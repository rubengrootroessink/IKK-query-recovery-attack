In today's edition of the Daily Update, we offer a spate of ideas and some
promises we hope are kept. Like many of us at this time of year, certain
telcos are trying to shed excess pounds (of debt) to make themselves
more attractive (to investors), and equity research columnist Dave
Sterman does his best impression of a personal trainer keeping his eye
on analyst sentiment.

The new year also means new conditions for private B2B exchanges,
and eMarketer senior analyst Steve Butler explains how the survivors are
adapting.

Finally, Morgan Stanley has a stock idea for investors with an appetite
for wireless, but are leery of indigestion. Multex Investor members get a
free insight into Alltel (AT) thanks to the free research trial available
exclusively to them (that's you).

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Portly telcos
Telecom stocks trying to slalom through tough conditions while carrying
a few extra pounds of debt

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Telecom bankruptcies have been making headlines for most of the last
year. Struggling upstarts that borrowed too much money had to fold up
shop as the cash ran out and creditors came knocking. But debt
problems of another sort are cropping up for much larger telecom firms.
These companies are not candidates for bankruptcy, but staggering debt
loads may hinder their operational flexibility and could even cause them
to radically scale back their businesses. For equity investors, the
situation certainly bears watching.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
How the survivors have evolved
From passive transaction-based units to active technology providers and,
ultimately, proselytizers

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

At the beginning of 2001, eMarketer selected five so-called "independent
exchanges" that we believed were worth watching during the course of
the year. Chosen for the diversity of their vertical industry operations,
these benchmark exchanges were noted as useful indicators of the
success or failure of online exchange-based trade within various
industries.
Known as a pioneer within the energy industry and among business-to-
business (B2B) exchanges in general, Altra Market Place was placed on
the list because of its background as a facilitator of commodity-based
trade. Citadon has long emphasized its Web-based, collaborative
software for the engineering and building industry, while eMerge
Interactive (EMRG) was initially known as a cattle broker with extensive
online and offline trading operations.
MetalSite was selected because of its presence within the highly-
competitive online steel-trading industry, and SciQuest (SQST) was
noted for its leadership as a provider of Internet-based catalog and
trading technology for the life sciences industry.
