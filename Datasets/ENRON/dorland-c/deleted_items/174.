1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
FASten your seatbelts
New accounting rules and political infighting will make for a bumpy ride
ahead

by Rick Wayman, CFA

This is going to be an interesting quarter, if not year! The stock market is
advancing like it expects a recovery in the first half of 2002, and
politicians have reverted to their pre-9/11 partisanship. Coupled with the
new accounting rules for goodwill amortization (FAS 142), this could
make for a volatile stock market in the first quarter.

The market appears ahead of itself, and there is more downside risk than
upside potential. Stocks have rallied significantly from the 9/11 lows, but
we are really only back to where we were pre-9/11. The easy money has
been made, and now economic reality poses a threat. We think the
positive economic data that was released last month will be replaced with
negative trends in the first part of 2002. This is because the discounting
that boosted sales in December stole activity from the first part of 2002.
Consequently, we expect 4Q01 profit margins (to be reported in the first
quarter of 2002) to shrink, and early 2002 sales data to show a decline.

Regulatory roadblocks loom for RBOCs
Hating Ma Bell has never gone out of style

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The slowing economy has been a boon for at least one segment of the
telecom world. The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) saw
many smaller competitors go bankrupt in 2001, and their purchasing
costs fell as telecom equipment vendors were forced to lower prices to
win business. That left management of these firms sitting in the catbird
seat as we head into 2002.

But hold the phone. Washington appears set to deliver a series of
regulatory setbacks to RBOCS such as SBC Communications (SBC),
BellSouth (BLS), Qwest Communications (Q) and Verizon (VZ).
