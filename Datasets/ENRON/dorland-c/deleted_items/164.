Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Looking for security
The IT security market still looks good, but an attractive market brings
on more competition.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

Though many companies in the technology sector are confronted with
crises in valuations and expectations, those focused on IT security have
great promise for growth. The volume of Internet transactions continues
to rise, making it essential for companies to maintain a secure space in
which this business can be conducted. The fallout from recent high-
profile computer viruses has hammered this point home. Now recent
reports are projecting a sizeable increase in the demand for IT security
solutions.

From its recent survey on IT security, J.P. Morgan found that companies
expect to spend 10.3 percent of their IT budgets on security next year,
compared with 7.4 percent for this year. With IT budgets expected to
expand by 2.7 percent, the firm figures that IT security spending will
grow 43 percent.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Big fish, little fish
As growth in wireless slows, investment bankers may get busy

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

News that a few small wireless carriers just reported weak Q4 subscriber
results may seem insignificant. But it should be viewed as a defining
moment for the next phase of the wireless industry: consolidation. As
growth slows, the larger carriers appear set to gobble up the smaller
carriers in a bid to maintain growth.

The industry's structure holds the key. Big carriers such as Sprint PCS
(PCS), Nextel Communications (NXTL) and AT&T Wireless (AWE)
have entered into agreements with 'affiliates.' These affiliates are run by
entrepreneurs that got the green light to raise capital and launch service
in areas not served by their bigger counterparts. For example, Alamosa
Holdings (APS), Ubiquitel (UPCS), and Airgate PCS (PCSA) all
operate in conjunction with national player Sprint PCS. They benefit
from a national marketing plan, and get paid by the minute when callers
roam into their territorial networks.
