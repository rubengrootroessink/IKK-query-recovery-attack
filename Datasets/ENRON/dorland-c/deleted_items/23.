Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
What is the value of the digital home?
Comcast is paying approximately $5,830 for each AT&T
Broadband household. Is this a fair price?

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

Comcast (CMCSA) is in the process of acquiring AT&T's (T)
broadband unit and its 12 million cable households for
approximately $70 billion. Comcast's investment equates to
approximately $5,830 per AT&T Broadband household.  Is this a
fair price?

As has been widely reported, this deal will create the largest cable
company in North America, with 22.3 million subscribers. The
current value of the digital home is far less than what Comcast is
currently paying, but the future digital home may hold great
potential.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Exiting 2001 on a high note
The telecom sector took it on the chin last year, but some companies
gave brighter guidance for 2002.

By Dave Sterman

For the second straight year, the telecom sector took it on the chin. Many
companies are now bagging a fraction of the revenues they garnered just
a few years ago. But word has quietly spread that the industry may have
bottomed and that 2002 may bring better returns.

3. TRANSCRIPTS
On Wednesday, Steve Lord, editor of The Adivsor's Digest, participated
in a live Q&A session with investors on the site. Here is one of the many
questions he answered.

Question: In 1973-74, more than one-third of the value of the S&P
500 was erased and Warren Buffett said that it was the time to
invest and get rich. Is it that time again?

Steve Lord: Buffett has recently come out and said he expects a five to
eight year dry spell following the party we've all just been through. So
you can figure we've got at best a three year dry spell left. Buffett also
said that the length of the hangover is directly proportional to the length
of the party. And personally, I remember from my college days that the
length of the hangover can exceed the length of the party! There's
nothing I've seen that indicates that Buffett is remotely bullish on
anything concerning the broader market.
