1. Strong buy: License to ring
Licensing DSL technology could help position Aware (AWRE) for the future.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

An uncertain economic environment and a semiconductor market at
trough revenue levels means that this may be a good time for
investors to look into the semiconductor intellectual property
(SIP) sector.

In the broadband communications field, Aware (AWRE) develops and
licenses DSL technology to semiconductor and equipment companies
for use in conjunction with existing copper telephone networks.
The company also makes software for IP products for voice- and
video-enabled applications and video games.

Aware mainly competes with other companies' in-house development
and design teams, and with many corporations looking for cost-
cutting options, Aware is in a strong position to cash in.

2. Independent exchanges: How the survivors have evolved
From passive transaction-based units to active technology providers and, ultimately, proselytizers

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

At the beginning of 2001, eMarketer selected five so-called
"independent exchanges" that we believed were worth watching
during the course of the year. Chosen for the diversity of their
vertical industry operations, these benchmark exchanges were
noted as useful indicators of the success or failure of online
exchange-based trade within various industries.
Known as a pioneer within the energy industry and among business-
to-business (B2B) exchanges in general, Altra Market Place was
placed on the list because of its background as a facilitator of
commodity-based trade. Citadon has long emphasized its Web-based,
collaborative software for the engineering and building industry,
while eMerge Interactive (EMRG) was initially known as a cattle
broker with extensive online and offline trading operations.
MetalSite was selected because of its presence within the highly-
competitive online steel-trading industry, and SciQuest (SQST)
was noted for its leadership as a provider of Internet-based
catalog and trading technology for the life sciences industry.

3. The real deal: Five fateful days
Five January days that could determine the course of the year, and four picks from the guru

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

After a two-year route that saw the market experience it's worse
performance since 1973-74, investors are going to begin the year
hoping for the best but not forcing the issue. Reluctance to buy
this market could result in a lackluster first week.

The old saying is that as January goes, so goes the rest of the
year (in fact traditionalists say the first five days of the year
will determine the outcome for the rest of the year). I'm not so
sure that will be applicable to the market this year.

Instead, it could be the last 5 days of the month that sets the
tone for the rest of the year. On the 29th, the Fed gathers for
the first FOMC meeting of the year. After 11 rate cuts last year,
it will be interesting to see whether Greenspan and company
decide to take the scalpel to rates again. We think the market
has a better chance of making a serious rally if the Fed chooses
to stand pat.

4. Click and file: Taxes-dot-com
Two widely different strategies for navigating the tax Web

By Dave Sterman

For the last four years, the number of people filing their taxes
online has risen by at least 20 percent annually. And the folks
at Intuit (INTU) deserve a bunch of credit for the trend.
Intuit's TurboTax software has made it increasingly easy to
complete and files taxes electronically, eliminating the mistake-
filled pen and paper process.

Curiously, H&R Block (HRB) has gone a different route. The tax
prep giant has stuck by its bricks and mortar model of handling
taxes in person. Block's TaxCut software also enables people to
do their taxes on a PC, but the company has done little to create
a commanding Web presence.
