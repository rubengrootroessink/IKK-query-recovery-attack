Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Homeland defense may be catalyst for troubled wireless companies
Wireless stocks have tumbled in 2002, but $10 billion in national security
spending offers some long-term hope

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

The news just keeps getting worse for wireless stocks. They have fallen
for three straight weeks amid reports from Verizon (VZ) and others that
subscriber growth is much slower than expected due to the struggling
economy.

The downward spiral continued after a few analysts recently downgraded
the entire sector. Without any positive developments to cling to, investor
pessimism appears to be feeding on itself. So far in 2002, the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange's wireless telecom index is off by 7.7
percent.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Demanding times
While capital expenditures have ground to a halt, one sector offers hope

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

Has the telecom sector "bottomed out?" This is a question many
investors and those associated with the industry would like answered.
Certainly the US telecom sector has experienced a significant downturn
over the last 18 months, with tens of thousands of job cuts and capital
spending slashed. According to Lehman Brothers, 2002 will see a 20
percent reduction in capital expenditure (capex) across the sector.
Internationally, Merrill Lynch estimates that capex will also
decline in the Asia/Pacific, Europe and, most especially, the Latin
American telecom sectors in 2002.
