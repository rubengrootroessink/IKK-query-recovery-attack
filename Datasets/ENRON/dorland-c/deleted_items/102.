hey,

I think if you maybe want to start working the termination value as of Dec 22 (which is a Saturday), using ROM quotes and the rest of the mids, I will work on Nov30, and Dec1-21 phys penalties.

 Chelsea printed out   
I:\Canadian Energy Services\Estate\Dorland-Watt\Forwards Detail-MIRANT_JAN17.xls
    and I have the file
I:\Canadian Energy Services\Estate\Dorland-Watt\Mirant deals - typed from confirms.xls

This second file has a confirmed volumes for December (ie the market and supply we cut exactly matches what actually happened - good thing). There is probably some overlap with this file and the one Chelsea printed. Hers prints each deal by month though, which sucks. Take a look at both and see what you think.

Ryan
