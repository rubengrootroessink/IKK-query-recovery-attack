The "greater fool" theory sounds funny, but it isn't a
laughing matter.

investment methods can succeed, assuming they are well
executed.

2. INVESTMENTOR
Crisis du jour
How to assess the mini-scandals and near-
disasters afflicting the market

By William Valentine, CFA

can't get away from Information Spewage. Since nature-
-and the news media--abhor a vacuum, we're always on
the edge of our seat, whether it's warranted or not.
