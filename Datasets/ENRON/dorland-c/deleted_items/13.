Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
E-commerce comes out from under the shadows
Companies used to be reluctant to discuss Internet sales, but are now
breaking the silence

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

Until recently, many companies were reluctant to discuss e-commerce
because they did not want to share their strategies with competitors.
Today, however, companies announce e-business initiatives to show that
they are in tune with the times and prepared to face tough competition in
the future.

By comparing a company's e-commerce activity to that of its competitors,
shareholders may gain insight into how well management has grasped
the main issues of e-business, developed an integrated technology
strategy, and executed its vision.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Can eBay give investors an encore?
The company is confident that it can maintain super-fast growth, and
analysts agree.

by Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The economic landscape is littered with the carcasses of dot-coms that
tried but failed. Only one firm can say that it consistently delivered on its
initial growth metrics: eBay (EBAY). In 1998, when the online auction
company went public, it was set to bag some $86 million in revenue.
Three years later, that figure has exploded to $749 million, and operating
profits have risen thirteen-fold.

With shares of eBay trading at lofty heights, investors are clearly
expecting more strong growth to come. Can eBay deliver? The answer,
according to those who analyze the company, is a resounding "yes."
