Hello.

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  I have been extremely busy.
I am around on that weekend.  I am supposed to be at a conference that
weekend.  However if the teachers are still on strike the conference will be
cancelled.  Here's hoping!

It will be good to see you guys that weekend.  When you know, give me a
shout and let me know what your schedule is like.  We can tee something up
around the conference even if it is a go.

I don't know about you but I am really getting sick of this weather!  I want
to get out to Banff/Louise and get some skiing/boarding in!

Remind me when you are down and I will give you that cleansing info.  Looks
like I am going to start me cleanse on Friday. I am loading up on all the
beef, sugar and wheat I can!  It's hell but those are the foods I really
miss while cleansing!

Better run!  Have clients coming in shortly!  Have a good one!

Trace

Hi Traci,

I had a very relaxing weekend. Slept 10 hours both nights. Worked out and
chilled. Very good weekend except for the weather. No worries about Friday.
The highways were ridiculous. My brother is coming to town on Thursday for
a week. It will be good to see him. I am planning on being in Red Deer on
the weekend of the 8th. Maybe we can get together then. Let me know if you
are free.Have a great week and I will speak to you soon!

Chris
