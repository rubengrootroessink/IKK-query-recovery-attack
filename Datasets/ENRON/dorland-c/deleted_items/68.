In today's edition of the Daily Update, we look at the silver linings
for telecom equipment stocks and even Enron. Indeed, where the latter
is concerned, eMarketer senior analyst Steve Butler explains how Enron's
online trading platform changed the energy trading landscape and
created opportunities that would not have otherwise existed. Also,
frequent contributor John Filar Atwood discusses three telecom
equipment stocks with brighter outlooks than expected.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The EnronOnline diaspora
Online energy trading has been orphaned, not aborted

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

Although the company is now defunct, and while its behavior has taken a
serious financial toll on many individuals and companies, Enron's legacy
also includes its role as an Internet trailblazer. Indeed, by its sheer size
and ambition, the company was able to change the way that its
competitors traded, permanently and significantly altering both the
energy sector and the Internet.

To get an idea of the magnitude of what we're dealing with, according to
company data, Enron's (ENE) Internet-based trading exchange,
EnronOnline, was processing about 4,000 transactions per day
worldwide, with an average deal size of about $500,000, by September
of 2001. At an annualized rate, the notional value of online transaction
activity conducted through EnronOnline was approximately $510 billion--
a healthy increase from the $101 billion in transactions during 2000.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Analysts see brighter earnings picture for three equipment companies
In an uncertain market, analysts seem sure about the earnings potential of
these companies

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

The reduction in capital spending by major carriers has weighed on telecom
equipment stock performance in recent months, and threatens to do so
throughout 2002. The consensus estimate now appears to be a 26 percent
drop in carrier capital expenditures in 2002 resulting in a 23 percent
decline in aggregate revenues for the equipment group.
