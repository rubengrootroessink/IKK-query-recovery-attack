1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Strategic sourcing
Streamlined processes and lower costs create new investment
opportunities

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

B2B e-commerce stocks suffered from highly publicized plummets
during the last two years, placing weaker players in jeopardy, but
since September this group has seen an impressive run-up in the
shares of some stocks. Far from being on the verge of extinction,
it's a sector with multi-trillion-dollar potential, a piece of which
many vendors are trying to grab.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Surprise party invitation
Investors are in the dark, so why not be in on the surprise?

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Many investors are holding off buying stocks until they've had a chance
to check out earnings releases that will pour in over the next month. But
this is a good time to check out stocks that have a strong chance of
exceeding expectations. Buy them now, and an upside surprise could
lend a boost to your portfolio.
