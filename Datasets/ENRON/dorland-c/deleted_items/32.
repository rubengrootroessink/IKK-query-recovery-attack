Investment ideas

1. B2B insights: Internet-based trading networks chip at EDI base
EDI networks stand to lose a lot of business as companies move their purchasing to the Internet.

By Steve Butler

Electronic data interchange (EDI) networks operated by companies such as
General Electric's (GE) Global eXchange Services division are vastly
larger than those operated any Internet-based trading exchange. But time
may be running out faster than a pharmaceutical patent, as cheaper,
potentially more ubiquitous Internet-based exchanges gear up and add
clients both big and small.

For the time being, however, the private EDI operators are in the
driver's seat. As the biggest EDI network operator, GE GXS estimates
that there are more than 100,000 trading partners connected through its
systems, trading more than $1 trillion in transactions annually. The
Giga Information Group estimates that approximately 50,000 trading
partners connect to each other using IBM's (IBM) value-added networks.

2. B2B TV: Interactive software dawns
Cable's upgrade to a digital platform is driving iTV.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

"500 channels and still there's nothing to watch" may have been what
viewers used to say in the early days of cable and satellite. But this
is the beginning of a new era in television. Not only are channels
getting better and more interesting, but viewers are now being invited
to interact with this medium. And it's interactivity that may make all
the difference.

3. B2B insights: The EnronOnline diaspora
Online energy trading has been orphaned, not aborted

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

Although the company is now defunct, and while its behavior has taken a
serious financial toll on many individuals and companies, Enron's legacy
also includes its role as an Internet trailblazer. Indeed, by its sheer
size and ambition, the company was able to change the way that its
competitors traded, permanently and significantly altering both the
energy sector and the Internet.

To get an idea of the magnitude of what we're dealing with, according to
company data, Enron's (ENE) Internet-based trading exchange,
EnronOnline, was processing about 4,000 transactions per day worldwide,
with an average deal size of about $500,000, by September of 2001. At an
annualized rate, the notional value of online transaction activity
conducted through EnronOnline was approximately $510 billion--a healthy
increase from the $101 billion in transactions during 2000.

4. Pent-up aggression: Can EMC (EMC) stay atop the data storage mountain?
Still the market share king, margins and analyst confidence are waning for this former stalwart

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The boom in data storage has become a bust. Prices for data storage gear
have plunged as heavy competition has led to fierce price wars. Few have
taken a deeper hit from the storage sector's comedown than industry
leader EMC (EMC).

Shares of EMC, which hit the triple-digit mark in late 2000, plunged to
$11 a year later. But after reporting last week that fourth quarter
sales rose by 25 percent sequentially, shares of EMC have rebounded and
are now 50 percent higher than their October nadir. Speculation abounds
that the company, and the entire data storage sector, are poised for a
comeback.
