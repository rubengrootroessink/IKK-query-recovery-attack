In today's edition of the Daily Update, frequent contributor Dave Sterman
shakes his head in wonder at the recent surge experienced by supply
chain software stocks, and provides information that may encourage
readers to rethink their positions.

Also in a finger-wagging mode today, Multex Investor director of
investment research Marc Gerstein takes a break from promoting his
forthcoming book, Screening The Market: A Four-Step Method to Find,
Analyze, Buy and Sell Stocks, to scold investors who systematically
ignore retail, and to discuss the merits of one retail stock he really likes.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
American Eagle Outfitters (AEOS)
Weak sales reports present great buying opportunities for American
Eagle Outfitters

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research, Multex Investor

I've been hearing how rotten retail is for years now. There are too many
malls. There are too many stores. Consumers are bored with shop-till-
you-drop. Consumers don't have enough money. You name it, I heard it.

For your sake though, I hope that if I featured it, you bought it. Thus far,
I've profiled retailers 21 times (including two follow-ups for previously
featured stocks). As of the 1/11/02 market close, the average percent
change of the retail stocks we featured was +35.9 percent (including one
dot-com dud that lost 80.8 percent). The equivalent average percent
change was a 16.0 percent loss for the S&P 500 and -35.3 percent for
the Nasdaq 100.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
B is for "bubble"
Supply chain software stocks surge--but why?

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

It's dj vu all over again, as stocks of supply chain software vendors i2
Technologies (ITWO), Manugistics (MANU), and SAP (SAP), among
others, have climbed sharply in recent months. These stocks were
among the highest flyers at the height of the Internet bubble, and it's fair
to wonder if investors are slipping back into that old bugaboo, irrational
exuberance.

The surge in prices is based on a fairly dubious investment thesis: sales
are no longer falling and the worst may be over. But sales are not yet
rising either. And analysts are compelled to look several years out to
justify current stock prices.
