1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
What is the market's safety net?
Reading the tea leaves of political posturing and Fed pronouncements
for hopes of a recovery

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

Last year, almost every week seemed to be some type of test, or
moment of truth, for the market. Here we are, only two weeks into 2002
and the market is approaching yet another moment of truth. In this case,
the market is walking a very high wire and there doesn't seem to be a net
in sight. After ascending to heights with a mix of bravado and nerve, the
market has paused long enough to look down. All the fun and excitement
that went into the effort to get the markets at their current levels is now
replaced by trepidation and concern. The market would like to find a way
to retrace the climb without tripping up completely. Beginning this week,
and going until the conclusion of the FOMC gathering, the market will
face daily tests and mini-battles that will act as individual moments of
truth. These are the times when sayings like "don't blink" or "don't fall
asleep at the wheel" come into play. This is an extremely vulnerable
market; everyone knows it, and that universally accepted truth means a
lot of folks are looking for the exits.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Screening for the oversold
The market's guilt-by-association methods create buying opportunities in
telecom

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Sell first, ask questions later. That's the typical investor reaction when
companies warn of a weak quarter. But in their zeal to dump weak
performers, investors often collectively conspire to send share prices
down too far. So we went looking in the telecom universe for stocks that
have taken a sharp hit because of downward guidance. Our logic: these
stocks may actually now be bargains if they've been oversold.
