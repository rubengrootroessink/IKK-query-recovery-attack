In today's edition of the Daily Update, managing editor Michael Hickins
reports on the investment community's love affair with biotechnology,
the modern-day version of the Fountain of Youth, and explains why there
is some reason for hope--at least from an investment perspective. On the
other hand, equity research columnist Dave Sterman discusses the sense
of dj vu he feels when looking at the prices of certain Internet stocks.
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Sucker's rally
Fool you twice, shame on you

By Dave Sterman, equity research analyst

In recent months, investors have returned to their speculative ways,
bidding up share prices in companies that still face challenging outlooks
to say the least. With signs emerging that the economic recovery will be
tepid at best, these investors may want to proceed with caution. Indeed,
some of the biggest gainers in recent months may be the most vulnerable
to a pullback, especially those for which the company-specific outlook
has yet to brighten.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Biotech rules
Biotechnology stocks point investors to a holy grail

By Michael Hickins, managing editor

On one level, it makes perfect sense for investors and analysts to favor
biotechnology stocks as much as they do: everyone wants to live forever,
and in relative physical comfort. Biotechnology offers the promise of a
rational (as opposed to mythical) Fountain of Youth, a picture of Dorian
Gray that never ages.

Moreover, biotechnology offers the potential to generate immortal
returns. Indeed, historical returns for the sector have been very
encouraging. According to analysts at U.S. Warburg, the industry has
been able to grow its collective top line by 18 percent since 1996. And
during the past 20-plus years, also according to the firm, the industry has
produced more than 100 drugs (using a wide definition of "biotech
drug"), "that currently generate annual revenues of roughly $12.5
billion."
