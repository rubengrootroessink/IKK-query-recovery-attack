In today's edition of the Daily Update, Multex Investor director of
investment research Marc Gerstein encourages members to block out the
noise of earnings consensus and focus instead on the big picture.

But while corporate management usually tries to beat or meet consensus
forecasts, Dave Sterman explains why a pair of telecom equipment
manufacturers may be purposely dampening expectations.

Members can also take advantage of the free Morgan Stanley research
trial, available exclusively to Multex Investor members, to read the firm's
opinions on Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Dampening the mood
Why Nortel (NT) and Lucent (LU) may be playing the reverse-
psychology game

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Lucent Technologies (LU) and Nortel Networks (NT) delivered their
twisted versions of holiday cheer in recent weeks, telling analysts that
sales are slowing yet further, and admitting that forward-looking
estimates will have to come down--yet again.

But with their shares languishing in single-digits despite a broad year-
end Nasdaq rally, analysts have been softening their positions, even to
the point of seeing silver linings in these recent whipping-boy stocks.

Indeed, some analysts believe that the beleaguered telecom equipment
vendors may be deliberately dampening investor enthusiasm and even
underreporting or delaying booking some revenues in order to boost
March 2002-quarter results (and make for easier December 2002
comparisons to boot).

2. INVESTING STRATEGIES
No noise
Silence is golden, both for meditation and investing

By Marc Gerstein

This word, stream, is crucial. Remember it. Write it down on a little slip
of paper and paste it on your computer monitor so you can see it any
time you read an article or research report dealing with company
earnings (or EPS). Any time you hear or read the word "earnings," edit it
in your own mind so that it changes to "earnings stream." This is
essential for you to make truly rational earnings-based investment
decisions.
