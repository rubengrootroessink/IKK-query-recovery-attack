Matt,

That is cool. I can't really change the trip but I am sure I will be back in
Vancouver soon. Send me your vitals and I'll let you know the next time I am
in town. Or give me shout if you are ever out in Calgary. Do you have
Atkinson's office phone number? I seem to have misplaced it.

Thanx

Chris

anyway you could either come a week earlier or later? I'd  love to have a
few with you.  Let me know.  Have you called Bill  Ryan?
