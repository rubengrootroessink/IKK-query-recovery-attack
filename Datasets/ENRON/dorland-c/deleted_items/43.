Okay, we have the first draw for the loot thursday. The decision hasn't been made regarding what is up for grabs, but all the stuff's pretty nice as you know.

To make things clear, to qualify for the draw you must put in my hands a completed file folder with an initialled checklist on the front and a signed release form inside. Some completed folders can be found on the desk beside Jason Biever - Invasion is a good example of a completed folder.

It should also be noted that we always need a signed release form before we send out a cheque. Any issues counterparties have with that should be directed to Kyle.

If you should so require, Angela or Megan can put together a blank folder for you to fill in. We're not picky how you put the folder together, just that all of the following is inside (if applicable):
Confirms / TAGGs
Invoices / Payments
Correspondence
Model Calcs
Signed Release Form

Just send either of the two you counterparty name and they can set you up with a folder.

If you have any questions, let me know. Also, if you have a completed file without a release (i.e. if it's a reinstated contract which is flowing to termination like Domtar) tell me and I will make sure that management makes a decision on whether it qualifies.

I'll email the contenders out tomorrow around noon so if you think you are being sadly overlooked you can let me know then.

Good luck,

Mike
