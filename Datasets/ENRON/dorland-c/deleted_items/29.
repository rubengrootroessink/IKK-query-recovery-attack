You actually passed her when you walked out. You have to remind me about that stuff, otherwise I'll forget. She's wearing a pinkish shirt today, but she might have had a jacket on when you passed her. She saw you at the very last second so you maybe didn't see her. As you can tell...I don't matchmake very pro-actively.
You'll have to come back again.
