1. Hot Market, Consistent Earnings for Microcap (NEOG)

Jonathan Steinberg says Wall Street's spotlight may soon
shine on Neogen (NEOG). Earnings consistency (21 consecutive
profitable quarters) and heightened interest in protecting
the nation's food supply pushed shares of Neogen (NEOG) to
all-time highs in November 2001. Steinberg notes that this
move boosted the firm's market cap to over $100 million.
"Now that it crossed that threshold, it is likely to appear
on the radar screens of small-cap managers," he says.

Neogen develops and markets products and services for food
and animal safety; the recent shift in public attention to
the safety of basic infrastructure, such as food supply,
seems a readymade opportunity for Neogen, Steinberg says. In
fiscal 2001, sales boomed 44% for its diagnostic test kits
that detect foodborne bacteria and other toxins. The firm
grew its operating income by $1.9 million without incurring
comparable hikes in expenses, and margins rose 12.2% as a
result.

Steinberg sees annual sales growing from today's $35 million
to over $600 million in short order, and he predicts EPS
will rise 26% to $0.68 in 2002. A growing number of health-
conscious consumers and a more security-conscious government
will lead to even greater demand for Neogen's products, he
says. Steinberg advises buying today and anticipates a share
price of $36 by early 2003.

Situations Report. Jonathan Steinberg provides one

2. Government Small Pox Deal a Boon for Biotech Firm (BREL)

A huge contract to help supply the US government with 200
million doses of small pox vaccine caused a surge in shares
of Bioreliance (BREL). Buy signs soon came from growth stock
guru Jim Collins (OTC Insight) and his former pupil Louis
Navellier (MPT Review). That in turn prompted newsletter
watcher Gregory Spear to add shares to his Security
Portfolio of stocks expected to benefit from higher spending
on security and safety.

Bioreliance provides contract manufacturing and testing
services to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The firm
is a major subcontractor to Acambis and Baxter, who test and
develop the vaccine for the government. Shares of
Bioreliance more than doubled since September 11 and are now
consolidating near their all-time highs.

Spear is excited at how Q3 net income grew 500% on a 29%
increase in revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. "Look
for a dip and then stash some shares away. It's a great buy-
and-hold candidate," he says.

3. Zacks: Time to Buy Equities (AZO)

Ben Zacks is bullish for the first time in over 2-1/2 years.
"We are decidedly more bullish about the market than we were
just two weeks ago. It is time to start aggressively putting
money to work," he says. He predicts a surge in corporate
profits during H1 2002 as today's recession forced companies
to cut costs and layoff staff. Stock prices are rallying
despite poor earnings reports, and that tells Zacks that
earnings should grow substantially next year.

One stock Zacks recommends buying is Autozone (AZO). The
nation's #1 auto parts chain sells parts, maintenance items
and accessories through over 3,000 stores in 42 states. The
firm's board of directors just approved a $250 million stock
repurchase bringing its recent total to $1.45 billion.

Autozone's sales and earnings momentum are compelling, and
Wall Street analysts see this growth accelerating. Same-
store sales grew an impressive 9% in Q1, and EPS of $0.76
zoomed past the consensus analyst estimates of $0.60. Shares
now trade at 23x the current year's estimate of $3.13 and
20x next year's estimate of $3.75. "A good entry point for
new investors is $70," Zacks says.

For more on Ben Zacks' advice see "Timely Buys of the
Month," Mid-December 2001, Zacks Advisor. Ben Zacks uses
earnings estimate revisions from analysts at brokerages to
select stocks likely to outperform the market over the next
12 months.

4. Seven Supersafe Stocks for Capital Gains in 2002 (MYL)

The major market averages have rallied on expectations of a
rebound in the economy and earnings. But Rich Moroney is not
convinced. He says the time-tested Dow Theory has not yet
confirmed that the current upturn is anything but a bear
market rally. "Our bottom-line advice: maintain 33% of
equity portfolios in short-term reserves. Avoid richly
valued tech stocks, and consider small and mid-sized
companies in your search for reasonably valued growth
stocks." he says.

Moroney offers seven stocks he calls "2002 capital gains
favorites," and one of these is Mylan Laboratories (MYL).
The firm sells 140 generic and branded drugs. Wall Street
sees revenues growing from $846 million this year to $931
million next year and then to $1 billion the following year.
A long slate of patent expirations at big drug companies
should drive Mylan's revenues for years to come, Moroney
says.

Meanwhile, Mylan is growing its own product pipeline of new
drugs, and those should bolster profit margins
significantly. In fact, management sees 50% of all revenues
coming from branded drugs soon. Mylan handily beat estimates
for the last three quarters, and Moroney sees new drugs
leading to positive earnings surprises. "The stock is being
upgraded to 'buy,'" he says.

December 24, 2001, Dow Theory Forecasts. Rich Moroney uses
the time-tested Dow Theory to provide stock picks and
portfolios and to keep investors on the right side of major
market trends.
