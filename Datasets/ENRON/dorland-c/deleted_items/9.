Have you been recently screwed royally by your boss or company executives?

Have your stock options and personal holdings in your employer's company
taken a bite out of your portfolio?

Do you go home every night stressed/thinking about work?

Does it take you more than 10 minutes to drive yourself to and from work
every day?

If you answered yes to all of these questions then do I have the job for
you.  Guy's Pure Water is currently looking for a full time water deliverer.
  It is a 9 to five job, working for a privately held company that will
never offer you a piece of the profits in your compensation package.  You'll
never have to worry about the value of your options or any equities for that
matter because frankly, you won't make enough to ever purchase any.  Come
visit the quaint community of Red Deer and bring your resume.  Ah fuck it,
who needs a resume for this dead end job, just bring a valid drivers
licsence and your hired.




My driver quit on me today.  $9.50/hour wet your whistle?
