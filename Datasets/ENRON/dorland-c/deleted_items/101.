I thought those of you that owned some Pfizer might be interested in this news. 

  INVESTMENT ALERT 

Pfizer Corp. (NYSE: PFE) is making an announcement 
today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid 
form and will be marketed by the Pepsi 
Cola Bottling Group (NYSE: PBG) as a power beverage 
suitable for use as-is, or as a mixer, under the name 
"Mount And Do". Pepsi's proposed ad campaign 
suggests, "It will now be possible for a man to 
literally pour himself a "stiff one."
