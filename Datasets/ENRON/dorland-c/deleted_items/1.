**** A FREE 30-DAY TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION to Erlanger Squeeze Play, PLUS
bonuses, altogether worth $227! Learn why the biggest names on Wall
Street follow Phil Erlanger's buy and sell recommendations ****


Dear INVESTools Subscriber,

Have you ever wondered whom the "experts" on Wall Street or even
investment newsletter editors listen to when they're investing for
themselves?

The truth is that most "investment gurus" would rather walk on a bed of
red-hot coals than admit that any of their competitors or even friends
are good at what they do, much less be big enough to admit that they're
taking advice from them.

You know the game. They want you believe they're the only "guru" on the
face of the earth that you can trust for solid investing advice.

Meanwhile, many of Wall Street's most powerful and mega-rich insiders
including:

*	Peter Lynch of Fidelity Investments
*	Jeff Vinik, former manager of Fidelity Magellan
*	More than 100 top fund companies, collectively managing
	over 1 trillion dollars...

...have been glued to the buy/sell recommendations of one amazing man
-- Phil Erlanger. They follow his advice because he has a reputation of
being a genius.

Phil Erlanger is a mathematical computer whiz who has developed a
scientific method of pinpointing investor sentiment that allows him to
tell whether a stock is going to go up or down with an incredible
degree of mathematical certainty -- many say it's almost
"supernatural." This is the reason Phil Erlanger has been highly
regarded as the top-secret weapon for the biggest insiders on Wall
Street.

Because Phil's newsletter wasn't available to investors like you (until
now), many of those big shots on Wall Street been able to side-step the
"from whom do you take investment advice" question. Even more relevant,
Phil's newsletter and the price tag of his service -- $30,000 -- made
subscribing impossible for most of our subscribers. Wall Street can't
keep their "secret weapon" secret any longer.

Phil Erlanger is making his groundbreaking, scientifically-precise
method of investing available to investors for the first time for just
$295 a year, or $29.95 per month. As one investment newsletter familiar
with Phil Erlanger and his newsletter recently said:

"I hate to admit it, but Phil's newsletter is AMAZING, and any investor
who doesn't subscribe to Erlanger Squeeze Play is missing out. Anyone
with a brain should subscribe immediately."

Now you can through this limited offer. Try Erlanger Squeeze Play FREE
for 30 days. But that's not all! Counting the 30-DAY FREE TRIAL
SUBSCRIPTION and the bonuses we'll send you, this offer is worth over
$227!

It's an amazing opportunity that we think few other financial
publications would have the guts to offer. Phil's so convinced that
once you've enjoyed a trial subscription and have read Phil Erlanger's
special reports, you'll do back flips and love his newsletter -- you'll
want to be a subscriber for life.

How can you argue with a FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION plus bonuses
altogether worth $227?

We're thrilled to introduce you to Phil Erlanger, and happy to offer
you this trial subscription and bonuses -- worth $227!

   Erlanger Squeeze Play tells you when to buy and when to sell.

Every month, by e-mail or fax, you'll receive a monthly issue, then
throughout the month you'll also receive special Squeeze Alerts. These
are urgent buy and sell recommendations as well as updates and comments
from Phil Erlanger himself -- from his mind to yours in a matter of
minutes.

You'll get the kind of edge that Wall Street's most successful and
powerful insiders plop down $30,000 a year to receive. They're happy to
pay, because his recommendations virtually guarantee success.

      Phil goes through a time-consuming, mathematical ordeal
                     every day to make you rich

Every day, Phil Erlanger uses his revolutionary computer programs to
sift through 6,000 stocks and dozens of stock indexes, searching for
the opportunities that will make you wealthy. It's an enormous task:
the variables are staggering, and the numbers are constantly moving.
It's like trying to hit a moving target traveling at 500 miles per
hour.

Make no mistake about it; his computers go through a time-consuming,
computational ordeal every day. For even the most advanced investor or
sophisticated technical analyst, recreating this data would be
impossible. But incredibly, Phil has done it. We've seen his
recommendations deliver a string of profits including 75%, 89%, 101%,
even 431% in just the past several months. But these profits are just a
tiny glimpse of the profits he's been generating over the last 10
years.

Erlanger Squeeze Play is a serious, no-nonsense trading newsletter --
it's not about glossy bonus reports on the top 3 stocks you should buy
and hold for 12, 24, or 36 months. Phil Erlanger doesn't work that way.
Phil's revolutionary scientific method of trading requires fast, fresh
data and speed of light communications.

Sign up for a 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION TODAY, and you'll receive:

*	Erlanger Squeeze Play sent by e-mail or fax. Clear, concise, and
incredibly powerful, each issue is packed with the kind of money making
advice that can make you incredibly wealthy.

*	Phil Erlanger's Squeeze Alerts, also sent by e-mail or fax. Each
Squeeze Alert will contain exciting trade recommendations, market
analysis, and follow-ups on open positions. You'll think you've found
the Holy Grail. Over the course of this trial subscription alone,
you'll receive 2-4 Squeeze Alerts. Over the course of a one-year
subscription, you'll receive at least 35 of these special alerts.

*	A FREE Voice Alert service to ensure that you never miss one of
Phil's trade recommendations.  We've made arrangements with a cutting
edge messaging provider to give you the ability - at your option - to
be notified by phone every time Phil sends out an alert.  So, if you're
on the road or busy at the office and you're not sitting by your
computer or fax machine, the automatic messaging system will call you
and tell you there's been a new issue or alert sent.

*	Your own private username and password for Phil Erlanger's
Website at http://bonnie.investools.com/T/A21.49.1003.1.306258, which
will give you around-the-clock access anywhere in the world to his
latest analyses and recommendations.

*	Phil's new special report: "How to Read the Crowd and Squeeze a
Fortune Out of Wall Street," worth $99. This exciting special report
shatters the popular myths of investing and explains in detail why
Phil's revolutionary approach to trading stocks and indexes works so
well, time and time again.

*	Phil's second bonus report, "How I Avoided the Big Tech Crash,"
worth $99. In this report, Phil lays out in detail the methodology that
allowed his clients to completely escape the disastrous Nasdaq crash
from 5,000.

  There are just two perfectly reasonable catches to this special
                 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION!

This 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION is worth $227, but is yours free --
ZERO COST! No smoke, no mirrors -- just TWO very reasonable catches:

First, this is a very limited offer. One 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION
per person, family, or address, etc. Trust me -- you'll only need 30
days to enjoy Erlanger Squeeze Play and see for yourself why so many of
Wall Street's "experts" follow Phil Erlanger to generate huge profits.

Second, you must call Cecilia at 1-888-570-2090 or 1-561-750-7719 to
sign up for this free offer, and you must provide us with a valid
credit card and expiration date. After 30 days Erlanger's staff will
automatically start billing your credit card $29.95 a month for your
subscription to Erlanger Squeeze Play until you tell them to stop.

The first 30 days are a gift to you -- a 30-DAY FREE TRIAL
SUBSCRIPTION. Thereafter, you pay the normal monthly price. This
monthly billing agreement guarantees that Phil Erlanger will show you
healthy profits each month, or you can pull the plug on him at any
time. If he doesn't do the job, he gets dumped. On the other hand, if
he shows you the kinds of profits he's been delivering for Wall
Street's insiders, you'll stay aboard.

That's what they call "singing for your supper"!

This offer is only valid for the next 72 hours. We begged Phil to
extend this offer for a longer period, but he is just starting to make
his publication available to private investors, and he wants to start
off slowly. Up until now, his subscribers have been a small number of
Wall Street's insiders. You're going to be among a precious, small
group of private investors to receive his newsletter and his buy/sell
recommendations.

Understand that during the next 30 days you will receive Erlanger
Squeeze Play absolutely FREE. No smoke, no mirrors. You will also
receive two bonuses: Phil's special report, "How to Read the Crowd and
Squeeze a Fortune Out of Wall Street," worth $99, and Phil's second
bonus report, "How I Avoided the Big Tech Crash," worth $99, in which
Phil lays out in detail the methodology that allowed his clients to
completely escape the disastrous Nasdaq crash from 5,000.

Only after your 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION is completed, your
credit card will be charged $29.95 a month for your subscription to
Erlanger Squeeze Play. Your subscription may be cancelled at any time,
at which time this billing will be stopped.

Call Cecilia at 1-888-570-2090 or 1-561-750-7719 to accept this 30-DAY
FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION -- the gift of Erlanger Squeeze Play. You get
his recommendations FREE for 30 days, and he gets a chance to show you
how incredibly profitable Erlanger Squeeze Play is. What could be
fairer?
