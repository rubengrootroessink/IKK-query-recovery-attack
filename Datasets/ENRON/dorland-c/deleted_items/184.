In today's edition of the Daily Update, Charles Payne, principal analyst
and founder of Wall Street Strategies, explains the so-called January
effect and William Valentine, principal of Valentine Ventures, reviews
his home runs and strike-outs from 2001.

Speaking of the January effect, among the broker reports available for
download, we feature one from Brown Brothers Harriman that also
touches on this phenomenon.

We also remind our members that they have exclusive access to Morgan
Stanley research through the firm's free research trial; today, we suggest
you look at their report on Qualcomm (QCOM), which they rate "strong
buy-volatile."

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENTOR
Prophetic to pathetic: a year in review
Flagellation and self-congratulation with the benefit of hindsight

By William Valentine, CFA

I'm a corny, traditional kind of guy, especially around the holidays.
Whether it's felling the family Christmas tree in the nearby forest,
enjoying thrice-daily eggnog lattes, or experimenting with a new
pheasant recipe each year, you could almanac my predictability.

This is also the time of year that I lay out my goals, personally and
professionally, for the coming year--which you can't do until you
examine the successes and failures of the prior year. And as long team
readers know, that manifests itself in the form of my third annual
"Prophetic to Pathetic" Review of all columns written, and advice given,
over the last year.

Forty-two columns are a lot to review. But I didn't have to look too far to
find blunders, miscues, and downright pathetic commentary. Going back
to my "2001 Outlook" from last January, in hindsight I was too
optimistic about the economy and market. For the first half of the year, I
believed that we'd actually skirt an official recession. While we'll never
know whether or not we would have avoided one without the impact of
Sept. 11th, we clearly did enter into a recession, and that kept the stock
market's growth retarded.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Five fateful days
Five January days that could determine the course of the year, and four
picks from the guru

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

After a two-year route that saw the market experience it's worse
performance since 1973-74, investors are going to begin the year hoping
for the best but not forcing the issue. Reluctance to buy this market could
result in a lackluster first week.

The old saying is that as January goes, so goes the rest of the year (in fact
traditionalists say the first five days of the year will determine the
outcome for the rest of the year). I'm not so sure that will be applicable
to the market this year.

Instead, it could be the last 5 days of the month that sets the tone for the
rest of the year. On the 29th, the Fed gathers for the first FOMC meeting
of the year. After 11 rate cuts last year, it will be interesting to see
whether Greenspan and company decide to take the scalpel to rates
again. We think the market has a better chance of making a serious rally
if the Fed chooses to stand pat.
