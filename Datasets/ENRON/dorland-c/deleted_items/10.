Chris,

I'm sorry for the delay, but we are trying to be very careful about who has access to all the information and data on the website.  We have requested a list from HR of everyone who has signed the UBS agreement, but we still don't have the list for Portland or Calgary.  We made the request again this morning, but still haven't received the list.  I will update the access as soon as I get the list - sorry again for the delay.

Chris
