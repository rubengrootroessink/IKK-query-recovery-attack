Hello Chris,

As per our conversation, I checked out some prices on the 1989 Porsche
911.  Right now the price for 1,000,000 liability, collision $1000
deductible, comprehensive $500 deductible would be about $1300 for six
months.  Your renewal is coming up in April and it looks as though your
rates would come down on this vehicle by $400. (The premiums on your
Jeep will also be coming down on renewal)  If you buy the vehicle and
just want to put fire, theft vandalism etc.. until spring, the cost is
about $280 for six months.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact
me by e-mail or by phone at 1-800-897-5074.

Yours truly,

Kim D'Onofrio
