TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE NETCO    
       
Twas the night before NETCO and the pop fridge was bare
and it was not expected that Saint Nick would soon be there.   
No coke, no milk, nor Cplus could the employees find.  
So one by one they would trek down to the lobby and pay a dollar' o five.      
       
On the trading floor of Enron Canada the phones were all quiet 
But the nerf football game in progress was an absolute riot.   
The accountants were busy trying to find us some cash  
But if you talk to ATB they would swear it was hash.   
       
For our leather clad VP's had once ventured forth      
with visions of banking up here in the north.  
Our junior clerk was forced to take back our money.    
A bank not wanting our money, now isn't that funny.    
       
In spite of our troubles, oh the parties we've had!    
Because a good wine or rye makes us feel not so sad.   
The Christmas party was a spectacular gong show
as we showed the country club just how low we could go!
       
The employees' livers have never looked sadder 
Because we need to discuss what exactly is the matter. 
and from a bar stool in the best place to watch
The freefall of Enron to a 26 cent penny stock.
       
But from these ashes the employees will rise   
Despite Lay's, Fastow's and Skillings lies     
Our plan is to emerge as a single A rated NETCO
and then we see who will dominate this trading show!!
