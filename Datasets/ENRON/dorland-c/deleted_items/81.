In today's edition of the Daily Update, we feature the most popular
reports downloaded by our readers during the past week, most of
which are focused on network issues like security and
infrastructure.

Also today, equity research columnist Dave Sterman writes about
a latter-day Lazarus of the Internet--we're speaking, of course, of
Covad (COVD), which has reemerged from the ashes of DSL.

Wall Street also has its favorites, and Tom Ryan explains which
stocks seem most in favor--and why.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The most recommended stocks on Wall Street
Several micro-to-small cap stocks land on Wall Street's
most-recommended list

By Thomas J. Ryan, equity research columnist

With prospects for many of Wall Street's bellwethers still questionable,
analysts are looking for more sure-fire bets among the market's micro-
and-small cap stocks.
Indeed, small-cap stocks dominate a recent MultexNet screening of the
top ten most recommended stocks--with capitalization ranging from as
low as $150 million for LendingTree (TREE) to $900 million for 1-800-
Flowers (FLWS). The only clear large-cap stock to make the grade is
Gemstar TV Guide International (GMST), which has an $8.3 billion
valuation.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Covad is back from the dead
The company's rebirth is miraculous. But there's a problem:
No one knows if it can still make money.

By Dave Sterman, equity research analyst

The demise of NorthPoint Communications, Rhythms NetConnections,
and Covad Communications (COVD) in 2001 seemed to spell the end
of the data local exchange carrier (DLEC) sector. Investors were left to
conclude that the DSL industry would now reside squarely in the hands
of the regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs), such as Verizon
(VZ), SBC (SBC), Qwest (Q), and BellSouth (BLS).

But to the surprise of many, one DLEC, Covad, has emerged from the
ashes to fight another day. At least one analyst thinks the company is
poised to get it right this time.

3. TRANSCRIPTS
On Tuesday, Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist with Ehrenkrantz,
King, Nussbaum, participated in a live Q&A session with investors on the
site. Here is some of what he had to say:

Question: Does "valuation" need to be redefined in this market?

Barry Hyman: If one considers September 11 as a turning point for the
world, then valuation must reflect the increased risk created by
terrorism.....Yet, I believe we have to look at the future earnings potential
rather than current earnings to be excited about the market's prospects
for this year and beyond. The rally we have seen from late September
only reflects the decreased risk of lowered earnings, and does not even
represent any growth story.
