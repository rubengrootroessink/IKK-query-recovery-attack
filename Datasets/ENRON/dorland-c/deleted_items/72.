Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Dumbing down
Being smart is not necessarily the best way to protect yourself from
troublesome accounting.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

Believe it or not, financial engineering may be a worse problem.
Because it's legal, and praised in some circles, more companies are
willing to do it. As noted, financial engineers do not lie. Instead,
they tell you the truth about questions you really ought not be asking,
and distracting you from issues that may be more important.

2. INVESTMENTOR
Hard and soft recessions
Is the market's recent rally the start of a bull run? To answer that
question, look at the economy.

by William Valentine, CFA

Recessions, like boiled eggs, run hard or soft (...he says, scraping the
bottom of the simile barrel).

Hard and soft recessions differ by the damage they inflict and the
amount of time they cover. Not surprisingly, the severity of the recession
dictates the pain the stock market goes through. But since the market
dips and recovers before the economy, it's important to speculate on the
economy when considering whether the most recent stock rally is the
start of a bull run, or a bear market correction.
