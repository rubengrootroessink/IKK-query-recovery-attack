Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Looking ahead: Analysts predict solid 2002 for cable TV stocks
Consolidation and EBITDA growth will be the year's major themes

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Investors relying on cable television stocks as a defensive
investment were disappointed in 2001, as the group fell by about
20 percent, compared with the a drop of "just" 13 percent for the
S&P 500. But investors who now abandon the industry may find
themselves even more disappointed in 2002.

Analysts are projecting a strong year for cable companies,
predicting revenue growth of 13 percent and EBITDA growth of 14
percent. They also believe most of the stocks are more fairly
valued heading into 2002 than they were at the outset of last
year, when a late-2000 runup left them overpriced.

Adding to analysts' enthusiasm is the recent completion of
Comcast's (CMCSK) purchase of AT&T's (T) broadband unit. The
merger underscores the value of broadband and its ability to offer
voice, data and video over the same pipe.

2. Dept. of silver linings: Dampening the mood
Why Nortel (NT) and Lucent (LU) may be playing the reverse- psychology game

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Lucent Technologies (LU) and Nortel Networks (NT) delivered their
twisted versions of holiday cheer in recent weeks, telling
analysts that sales are slowing yet further, and admitting that
forward-looking estimates will have to come down--yet again.

But with their shares languishing in single-digits despite a
broad year-end Nasdaq rally, analysts have been softening their
positions, even to the point of seeing silver linings in these
recent whipping-boy stocks.

Indeed, some analysts believe that the beleaguered telecom
equipment vendors may be deliberately dampening investor
enthusiasm and even underreporting or delaying booking some
revenues in order to boost March 2002-quarter results (and make
for easier December 2002 comparisons to boot).

3. International wires: Counter-consensus
These four telecom services companies bear analysts' lowest ratings, but is that really bad news?

By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

Last week, we looked at underrated international telco equipment
companies. Today, we're featuring four international telecom
services companies traded in the U.S. that tote an average
analyst rating of 4 ("underperform") or worse.

Why would an investor want to consider a poorly rated stock?
Let's put it this way: A highly rated stock means a lot of people
already like it. If you like it too, you're going with the flow,
following the pack. Me-too investing may do all right, but it's
better to get there first, to blaze the trail. True value is
added only if the investment opinion is different, counter-
consensus, and of course, on the money. In other words, no guts,
no glory.

4. Burden of proof: Portly telcos
Telecom stocks trying to slalom through tough conditions while carrying a few extra pounds of debt

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Telecom bankruptcies have been making headlines for most of the
last year. Struggling upstarts that borrowed too much money had
to fold up shop as the cash ran out and creditors came knocking.
But debt problems of another sort are cropping up for much larger
telecom firms. These companies are not candidates for bankruptcy,
but staggering debt loads may hinder their operational
flexibility and could even cause them to radically scale back
their businesses. For equity investors, the situation certainly
bears watching.
