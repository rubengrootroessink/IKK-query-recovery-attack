Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Institutional ownership
This screen always seemed good in principle, and it's looking good
in fact

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

The real mystery here is why the screen struggled in the past. Its
parameters seem logical enough. The primary theme is that the stock
be under-owned by institutions (a percentage ownership that is lower
than the industry average percent), yet not hopelessly obscure
(coverage by at least two analysts is required as is a minimal
institutional ownership threshold of 10 percent) and a trend toward
improving ownership by the big guys. These primary trends are supported
by tests requiring a decline in short interest, insider buying, and
strong recent relative share price performance.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The new digital divide
Most Americans are now online, but they are still
divided by speed

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

The famed FBI criminal profiling unit would have its work cut out if was
on the lookout for a criminal today whose only known characteristic was
that he is a regular US Internet user. With the widespread adoption of the
Internet in the US, the demographic characteristics of the average US
Internet user today so closely match those of the wider population that
there are very few distinguishing features between the two.
