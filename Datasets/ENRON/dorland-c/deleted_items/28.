Hello all, 

I think it is time for another moral booster.  There is a deal in Panorama for 3 nights accomodation (most of us will probably do 2 nights) and 2 full days of skiing for $179/person.  The accomodations are one bedroom condo's that sleep 4 people.  They have a fire place, kitchen and have full access to the Panorama hot springs. 
There are only 4 condo's available so we need to book tomorrow.  Please  speak to your signicant others, and buddies and reply to me ASAP in you are interested.  
The weekend will be March 1st, 2nd & 3rd.  

If there are more then 16 people interested there are hotels running similar deals that are right at the resort as well. 

Please let me know tomorrow morning if you are interested!

Can't wait to hear from you!!!

Carlee & Nicki
