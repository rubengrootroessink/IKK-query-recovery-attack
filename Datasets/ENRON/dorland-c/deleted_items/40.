Chris,

Boulanger and a bunch of my buddies will be doing this for the Super Bowl
(see below).  You should check it out.

 Gents,


With the void created by Pearson's absence I think I have found a Super Bowl
party worthy of our attendance.

The Deal:

Cowboy's - Sunday February 3rd.

Topless Waitresses, and a half time lesbian show, I assure I am not making
this up!

Tickets are $30.00

Seeing as this invite came to me by way of a friend of friend, I would
appreciate if it was all kept on the hush hush and please don't pass this
along to anyone else.  You were all chosen for a reason.

As you can imagine tickets are selling fast so let me know tomorrow at the
latest and I will arrange to get you a ticket.

Kindest Regards,

Warren Moon
