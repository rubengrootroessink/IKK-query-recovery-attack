Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Pro forma profits: Hell freezes over (on a pro forma basis)
Could Amazon be pulling an Enron?

By Rick Wayman, CFA

I always thought that hell would freeze over before Amazon.com (AMZN)
posted a profit. This company, and the market's love affair with it, has
always amazed me. After all, how could a market (even an irrational one)
price this stock near $120 at a time when it was losing $0.44 on every
dollar of sales, which is what happened in 1999?

Ever since Jeff Bezos, the Prince of Pro Forma, announced that AMZN
would post a profit by the end of 2001, I eagerly awaited the release so
I could see how, not if, he would concoct the desired result.

I was not disappointed.

2. B2B insights: Strategic sourcing
Streamlined processes and lower costs create new investment opportunities

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

B2B e-commerce stocks suffered from highly publicized plummets during
the last two years, placing weaker players in jeopardy, but since
September this group has seen an impressive run-up in the shares of some
stocks. Far from being on the verge of extinction, it's a sector with
multi-trillion-dollar potential, a piece of which many vendors are
trying to grab.

3. Insider selling: Sucker's rally
Fool you twice, shame on you

By Dave Sterman, equity research analyst

In recent months, investors have returned to their speculative ways,
bidding up share prices in companies that still face challenging
outlooks to say the least. With signs emerging that the economic
recovery will be tepid at best, these investors may want to proceed with
caution. Indeed, some of the biggest gainers in recent months may be the
most vulnerable to a pullback, especially those for which the company-
specific outlook has yet to brighten.
