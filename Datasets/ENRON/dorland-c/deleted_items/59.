In today's edition of the Daily Update, Charles Payne, principal analyst
at Wall Street Strategies, discusses bending the rules and asks investors
if they really want to know the dirty little secrets undergirding their
lifetime investments. He also discusses coming economic news that may
affect the market and his own current favorites, which ironically include
energy stocks.

Also, Dave Sterman examines the challenges facing EMC (EMC) and
the storage hardware market in general, and Morgan Stanley gives its
sanguine take on another kind of storage, Federated Department Stores
(FD), in a report that Multex Investor members like you can access for

Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Market on the cusp, investors on the edge
You can't stand the truth, so stay in the kitchen

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

There is no doubt that the topic of the week is trust. Each day saw a new
scandal and a new perpetrator. Even though Enron (ENE) continues to hog
the headlines, the Houston based energy trader (I guess that's what they
were) wasn't the only company called to the mat on ethics and
accounting (next month the country celebrates Lincoln's birthday, and
although he'd be beaming about how everyone has come together to
support the battle against evil, he wouldn't be too happy with the goings
on in the corporate world).

In the meantime, corporate earnings took a back seat to the daily
revelations of improprieties. Even the eagerly awaited testimony of Alan
Greenspan became a sideshow of sorts. After spending the last year or
so soul-searching for reasons as to why they took such an
unceremonious bath in the stock market, investors have come to find
that they were never fully aware of the goings-on behind closed doors.
There are a lot of questions to be answered, both legal and ethical, yet in
many ways we already know the answers and will never get the details.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Can EMC (EMC) stay atop the data storage mountain?
Still the market share king, margins and analyst confidence are waning
for this former stalwart

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The boom in data storage has become a bust. Prices for data storage
gear have plunged as heavy competition has led to fierce price wars.
Few have taken a deeper hit from the storage sector's comedown than
industry leader EMC (EMC).
