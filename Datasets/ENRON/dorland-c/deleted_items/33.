Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Enron-gate
The financial engineering bubble has finally burst

By Rick Wayman, CFA

Just when you thought it was safe to invest again, Enron-gate has roiled
the financial waters Investors, barely recovered from a hangover caused
by a myriad of causes that include the dot-com bubble, Sept. 11th, and
the recession, now face a much bigger challenge: the loss of faith in the
core underpinnings of all investing decisions, financial reporting.

Enron-gate is an apt name because, like the Watergate and
Whitewatergate scandals before it, a problem that initially appeared
isolated is spreading (like a cancer on the Presidency) to encompass a
much larger universe of players. Every day, another company
announces that it has to restate its operating results. The trustworthiness
of the reporting process and the accounting profession itself is being
called into question.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Marvell sets its sights on Broadcom (BRCM)
Broadcom still dominates the communications chip sector, but Marvell
(MRVL) is growing at a torrid clip.

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Few firms have been able to grow as quickly as Broadcom (BRCM).
The communications chip maker saw its sales rise from $42 million in
1997 to more than $1 billion by 2000. Investors who got in early made
huge profits as shares of Broadcom rose twenty-fold from its spring 1998
IPO to its 2000 peak.

But just as Broadcom is looking to maintain its base of revenues while
the communications chip sector experiences a cyclical lull, a previously
obscure competitor has managed to grow through the downturn and is
setting its sights on the industry's number one spot. Marvell Technology
Group (MRVL) has been growing at a torrid clip, having already
surpassed the industry's next largest player, PMC-Sierra (PMCS).
