It was a tough decision, but Angela and I have picked a winner and two runners-up for coming up with the most creative idea for the "mystery item."  The winners and their answers are listed below:

Winner: 

David Hanslip for his answer of: 

"...To the casual observer, they look like the support pillars of any standard monitor stand. In reality, their special hollowed out interiors may be used to conceal sensitive accounting documents outlining off-balance sheet financing transactions from the FBI."

Second Runner Up: 
Paul Dunsmore for his answer of: 
"They are clearly snow shoes for the Smurfs that live in our office..." 
Third Runner Up: 
Carlee Gawiuk for her answer of: 
"The purpose of the object is for getting the attention of the commercial staff when they are not paying attention to their admin assistants.  There are 6 of them, 3 for each phone.  Simply pick up the object, close your fist around it, extend your arm behind your head, bring it forward in a fluid motion and release the object in the general direction of the person you are wanting to get the attention of.  If it takes more then one throw, that is completely acceptable.  It takes a little practice, so don't be too hard on your self if you need to borrow a few from the other phone.  It is not too big, so no serious damage will be done, & it's not too small so the person or anyone surrounding them will not lose an eye.  The colour is black to contrast with desk, or floor, so it is easy to find after it has been thrown."

Thank you to everyone else for your very creative answers! 
Congratulations to David, Paul, and Carlee (you may drop by front reception to pick up your prize)!!! 
Thank you, 
Megan Scott
