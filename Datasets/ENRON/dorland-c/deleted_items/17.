Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Be careful what you ask for
Getting on with our lives and with our investments

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

So I guess you can handle the truth. During the course of the past week,
I received a tsunami of mail, the vast majority ripping me for justifying
everything that's wrong with Corporate America. Ironically, both the right
and the left saw fault with the premise that I suggested--that investors
may not really want to know the truth.

A few investors admitted that they were afraid of opening a Pandora's
box, or that the revelation that the foundation of our financial system is
built on a lie would cause a financial Diaspora. I do believe that
assuming the worst is not only presumptuous, but probably jumping to
the wrong conclusion.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Rising subscriber turnover hurts PCS affiliates
Sprint's tougher stance on low credit customers is key factor

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Sprint PCS (PCS) has decided to get tough with certain low credit
customers. To date, the group getting punished by that decision is not the
customers, but Sprint's own regional affiliates.

The move has increased subscriber turnover, thereby lowering net
customer additions for the likes of AirGate PCS (PCSA), Alamosa PCS
(APS) and US Unwired (UNWR). It also has fed investors' perception that
there's no growth in sight for wireless stocks.
