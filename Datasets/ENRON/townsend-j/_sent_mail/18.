We had a very successful meeting with investors last Thursday at Enron's 
annual investor conference. The event was also webcast to individuals 
worldwide, including analysts, investors and media.  

A link to the replay of the webcast is available at www.enron.com.  A list of 
the presentations that were made at the meeting will appear on the screen.  
To view a presentation, simply click on the title.  The entire webcast is 
about eight hours long, with each presentation lasting about 45 minutes to 
one hour.  The webcast will be available 24 hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week
