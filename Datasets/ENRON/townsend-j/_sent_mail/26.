FYI.   (DTI is obviously what they are calling Dominion these days.)

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.
