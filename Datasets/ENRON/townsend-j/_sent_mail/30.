> College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
> demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma
> won 35 to 31. "The end zones were confusing," says Slocum. "I'm sure that
> some of the touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go
> into ours. We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never
> have scored thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M
> demands
> a recount."
>
> Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous".  "They agreed to the
> size,
> shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off," replies OU coach
> Bob Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have said so
> before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with
> the
> outcome. Someone had to lose. We've scored over thirty-five points many
> times."

> A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well
> as
> Reville down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.

> OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end

> zones until they lost," says Stoops.
>
> Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered bearing signs
> such as, "A&M wants a fair game!
> WHOOOOOOP!"  Students' thoughts echoed their signs. "All we want is a
fair
> total of the points before we declare a winner," says student Karen Hays,
> an
> Aggie from Marfa. "We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment
> before we declare a winner."
>
> ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
> despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at
> that point. At about 2:30 pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC
> had

>
> College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. "We felt that
with

> number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs
> and the Aggies, we were certain A&M would carry this game. We may have
> been
> premature in our prediction."
