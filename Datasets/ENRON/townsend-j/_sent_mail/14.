Subject: Gulfstream Maps

Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep 
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and 
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of 
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into 
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final 
routing, but it will be pretty close.

First come, first served.  I only have one volume.
