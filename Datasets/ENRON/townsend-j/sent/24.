> won 35 to 31. "The end zones were confusing," says Slocum. "I'm sure that
> some of the touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go
> into ours. We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never
> have scored thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M

> Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous".  "They agreed to the

> Bob Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have said so
> before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with

> times."

> A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well

> Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered bearing signs

> WHOOOOOOP!"  Students' thoughts echoed their signs. "All we want is a
fair

> ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,

> College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. "We felt that
with
