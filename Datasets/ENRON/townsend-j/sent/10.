Do we do any business on Chandeleur?  They have filed to expand their system 
by about 40,000 Mcf/d and to interconnect with Destin Pipeline at the 
Pascagoula Chevron refinery.  Apparently there was an open season.

Please let me know within the next couple of days whether we should intervene 
or not.  I have never had any inquiries or expressions of interest in 
Chandeleur, so I will assume not unless I hear from you otherwise.
