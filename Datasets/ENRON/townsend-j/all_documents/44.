Mary - Please review the attached revisions to HI 199. The changes are 
1. Transport Rate for baseload gas is 3 cents plus fuel 
2. The prices for Excess gas are based on transport to Sta 65, then sta 65  
prices. 

Amount due Spinnaker is approximately $135,000 for HI 199. Still reviewing  
other blocks.
