Following is from today's Inside FERC.  The Commission rejected Phase III b=
/c=20
Transco filed contracts for 210,000dth/d, representing firm commitments,
rather than for the 404,000/dth/d proposed in the original application.  Th=
e=20
delay in filing was caused by the protracted negotiations over siting=20
between Transco and the State of New Jersey.  The rejection leaves a gap in=

the capacity needed to serve the NY/NJ market and may improve the=20
chances for success of the other proposed projects in the NYC area sponsore=

separately by Duke, ElPaso, Iroquois and jointly by Duke/Williams/KeySpan.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. will have to start the FERC approval=
=20
process all over again for
more than half of its originally anticipated MarketLink capacity. In an Apr=
il=20
26 order, the commission said
previously granted certificate authority for 404,000 Dt/day of capacity on=
=20
the expansion into the New York
City metro area has expired.

Earlier this month, Transco tried to persuade FERC to allow it to build=20
sufficient facilities to move the
gas it had under contract for the project=01,s phase three--only 210,000 Dt=
/day=20
of the phase=01,s planned
404,000 Dt/day (IF, 23 April, 4). But that request doesn=01,t square with t=
he=20
commission=01,s Dec. 13 approval of
project phasing, said last week=01,s order (CP98-540). In the December ruli=
ng,=20
the commission said that
"should Transco desire to construct some configuration of the remaining=20
MarketLink facilities and
services that differ[s] from what has been authorized (in the Dec. 13 order=
),=20
Transco will be required to file
an application for a new certificate for those facilities."

As a result, Transco now has authority to build only 166,000 Dt/day of=20
phase-one capacity, scheduled
to be online Nov. 1, and 130,000 Dt/day of phase-two capacity, expected to =
be=20
in service Nov. 1, 2002.

"As the history of the MarketLink project amply demonstrates, we authorized=
=20
Transco to construct this
project on the basis that the capacity was fully subscribed. Now, almost=20
three years after Transco filed its
application, one year after we certificated the project, and four months=20
after giving Transco more time to
obtain contracts, Transco still does not have a market fully subscribing=20
phase three," said last week=01,s order.
Transco was required to show contracts by April 13 for the full 404,000=20
Dt/day capacity of phase three, and
when it couldn=01,t do so, certificate authority expired on that date, FERC=
 said.

"Of course, Transco is free to file a new application requesting certificat=
e=20
authority to construct and
operate the facilities needed" to provide phase-three service, the order=20
added.
In filings before FERC acted, the state of New York said Transco should be=
=20
given the go-ahead for
phase-three construction because "new capacity is needed to serve growth in=
=20
the traditional core market as
well as the rapidly increasing demand for gas to generate electricity in th=
e=20
New York City area." While only
a small percentage of the contracted phase-three volumes-- 25,000 Dt/day ou=
t=20
of 210,000 Dt/day-- is
designated for delivery to New York City, the shipments into the region=20
"should help to alleviate capacity
constraints and bring down the high market prices that have been experience=
d=20
over recent periods," the
state went on to say.

Expressing the contrary view, Rep. Bill Pascrell in a short but pointed=20
letter expressed his opposition to
the proposal to build downsized facilities for phase three.
