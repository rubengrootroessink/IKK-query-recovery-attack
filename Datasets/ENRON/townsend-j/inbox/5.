Judy,
It was nice talking with you today.  Congratulations on your job with UBS.  My  specialty is focused around the trading operations, but the presentation I have  attached shows other positions we work on.  If there is anything I  can do for youor someone you know, please  let me know.
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you in the  future. 
Sincerely, 
Taryn Elliott 
Executive Recruiter
