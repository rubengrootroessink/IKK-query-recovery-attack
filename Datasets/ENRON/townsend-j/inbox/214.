Weather forecasts for the ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT) system
suggest colder conditions beginning Thursday, January 3, 2002.
Throughputs are currently approaching capacity at critical points on the
AGT system therefore restrictions of lower priority transportation may
need to be instituted with the onset of anticipated higher demand.

Customers are reminded of the importance of scheduled such that
deliveries are commensurate with receipts.
