The turbine compressor at Cromwell Station is estimated to be repaired
and available for service by the beginning of gas day Thursday, January
17, 2002. Therefore, ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT) will not restrict
transportation for gas day 17.

However, should the turbine not be ready for service as planned, AGT
will post any restrictions, if required, as soon as it is known.

If you have any questions, please contact your Operations Account
Manager.
