Richard James Taylor was born on Jan 15th.  He weighed 7 lbs 11 ozs.  Jim would like to meet for lunch, HIS TREAT, one day.  Of course he doesn't want to meet me, he wants to see Judy P.  But the boy is smart, he knows that the best way to see Judy P. for lunch is to invite me.  See there, you are still a benefit to me.  So how about Thursday?
