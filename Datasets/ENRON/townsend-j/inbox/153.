The Grand Chenier Compressor Station (GCH) will be taken off line at
11:00 AM on October 25 for planned maintenance.  The maintenance is
scheduled to be completed by 5:00 PM on October 26.  During this
timeframe, all producers on the Cameron System upstream of Grand Chenier
will experience higher than normal line pressure, although this outage
will not require any platforms to shut in.

Please contact Steve Jenkins at 713-627-5076 if you have any questions.
