Extended weather forecasts portend low demand conditions for the next
week to ten days.  Currently, Algonquin Gas Transmission (AGT) is facing
high line pack levels.  Thus the pipe has severely restricted
ability to absorb due-shipper gas.  Effective immediately, AGT is
requesting that all shippers ensure that physical receipts do not
exceed physical deliveries. Receipt operators are expected to not flow
above scheduled volumes.  Delivery meters are expected to take all gas
scheduled.  Any customer who is long should take immediate action to
resolve due-shipper positions.

No due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled, and OBA parties should
ensure that physical takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper
makeup gas may be scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.
These restrictions are expected to be in effect until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
