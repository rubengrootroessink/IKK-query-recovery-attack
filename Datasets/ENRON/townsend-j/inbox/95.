Hi! Glad to hear you are all doing fine. Mom is good. I am still on the northwest side of town. I bought a house last summer, which I am now trying to sell. It is a three bedroom and since James and I got married it is too small. I don't know if I mentioned it, or if Ingrid did, but he has three boys. So, we have found a 5 bedroom house in the same neighborhood, Prestonwood Forest, that we will probably buy, we just have to sell ours. Mom also bought a house in the same neighborhood last summer. She moved my Granny here from Port Arthur to live with her. She is 95. I think Mom is going to go crazy dealing with her. Mother doesn't have much patience. Let me know when you can go to lunch. I would really like to see you.
See you soon, 
Laurie
