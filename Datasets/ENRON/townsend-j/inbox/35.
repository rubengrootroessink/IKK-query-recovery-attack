I asked Victor about the files.  I think keeping it on your h drive is still a good idea for now.

Another thought is to simply copy all of your files onto the new directory if you prefer to do it that way. THANKS

Team, Please move all the files you need to do your jobs ( Phone lists, ID's, spreadsheets, anything) to O:\common\logistics\gas\eastdesk directory.  A copy of this will be made to conduct business in New Company....THANKS
