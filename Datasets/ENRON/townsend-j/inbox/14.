TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) pipeline system was over scheduled on
the 24 inch system between Longview Compressor Station and Fagus
Compressor Station for Gas Day February 6, 2002. As a result, TE
restricted receipts between Longview and Pollard to the capacity that
may move up the 24-inch system. No intra-day nominations for gas leaving
this area or for additional physical supply will be accepted for gas day
6.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
