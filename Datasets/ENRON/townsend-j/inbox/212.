TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) is considering restrictions of
Interruptible and Secondary services to be effective January 3, 2002 for
Market Zone 3.  Weather forecasts indicate colder conditions are
scheduled to arrive in the market area Thursday and continue at least
through the weekend. In anticipation TE will post these restrictions, if
any, Wednesday morning, January 2, 2002.

All OBA parties should match physical volumes with scheduled volumes.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
