In anticipation of colder weather scheduled to arrive in TEXAS EASTERN
TRANSMISSION's (TE) market area, all TABS-1 parties must be balanced.
TE is prepared to force balance TABS-1 pools, if necessary, in order to
maintain system balance and in order to meet scheduled firm services.

All supply side parties should verify that physical receipts equal
deliveries. Market side volumes should be commensurate with scheduled
receipt volumes.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
