The previously posted outage of the Panhandle Eastern (PEPL)
Interconnect on the Lebanon Lateral (Meter station 74902) has been
delayed.  The work will now take place beginning on Wednesday, October
31 at 9:00 AM and will be completed on Friday, November 2 at 7:00 PM.
There will be no gas entering the system from PEPL during this outage.
Texas Eastern (TE) is working with CMS to pre-inject customer gas into
the system prior to the outage to mitigate any affect to TE shippers.
Texas Eastern will provide updates to this outage as they become
available.
