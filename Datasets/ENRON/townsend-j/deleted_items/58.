For Gas Day January 10, 2002, the TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE)
pipeline system was nominated above capacity for gas leaving the STX/
ETX/ M1-24 Inch area.  In order to accommodate firm volumes, TE cut
approximately forty percent of Preferential/Secondary nominations
exiting this area.

No intra-day nominations for gas leaving this area or for additional
physical supply within these zones will be accepted for Gas Day
01/10/2002.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
