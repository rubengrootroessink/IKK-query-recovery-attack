Effective immediately, based on anticipated system operations and
weather conditions, as stated below, ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT) is
requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt steps to
eliminate excess receipts and to conform scheduled receipts to actual
deliveries.

Weather continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been
scheduling gas in excess of actual takes. As a result, there is no line
pack available for system operational purposes and AGT cannot continue
to absorb actual imbalances left on the system.

AGT will continue to closely monitor current pipeline conditions.  To
the extent necessary, AGT will contact customers on an individual basis
regarding additional action by AGT to protect system operations. AGT
recommends that all customers rank both their supplies and their markets
in the event that system-wide reductions are required.  To the extent
AGT and customers are unable to agree upon appropriate action within a
reasonable time, AGT may adjust customer's nominations ?and revise
scheduled quantities? immediately to halt the further accumulation of
imbalances. In addition, AGT may take any actions within its operational
capabilities to reduce excess receipts.

No due pipe imbalance makeup will be accepted until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
