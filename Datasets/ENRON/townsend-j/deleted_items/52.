Natural Gas Prices Up Slightly Ahead of Weekend

    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX ended slightly higher
Friday, ending up $0.019 to $2.204 per MMBtu on slow range-bound trades in
a boring market after hitting a high of $2.26. The March contract rose
$0.008 to $2.203 per MMBtu. The market open up and worked its way higher
after a cold-weather forecast was released midmorning. However afternoon
trading saw a steady erosion of prices and there was no pop-up in the
market before the close as is usual on Friday. The cold front should give
a little support to the market this week, but storage operators will be
calling on customers to withdraw volumes by the end of January to meet
contract requirements, which could bring prices down on high supply. Look
for support is at $2.14, a critical level that, if breached, could see the
market drop to $2 per MMBtu. Expect resistance at $2.27. However, unless
sustained cold weather shows up soon, prices are likely headed well below
$2 per MMBtu. Weather since October 1st, based on heating-degree days, has
been 25% warmer than last heating season and 14.6% warmer than normal. Big
speculators, including commodity funds, are seen as supporting the market,
based on the latest CFTC report. Funds increased their net short positions
to 47,104 on January 8th, up 42% from their 33,103-contract net short
prior position. Large commercial players held a net long position of
39,596, up from 27,367. They ended the latest reported period with 363,856
longs and 324,260 shorts. Open interest rose to 434,291 from 400,200.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally
flat to $0.05 higher or lower Friday. Natural gas for next day delivery at
the Henry hub lost $0.02 to $2.30 per MMBtu.

 Judge Keeps Enron Cases in New York


    A judge has ruled that Enron's bankruptcy case will stay in New York.
The decision is a setback for Dynegy and other Enron creditors who had
wanted the case moved to Houston. In addition, Enron's $10 billion lawsuit
against Dynegy for pulling out of a planned merger will be tried in New
York. According to the judge, keeping the case in New York would best
serve the debtors' reorganization efforts since New York is a world
financial center and has the resources that will be required to address
the debtors' financial issues. Enron's Chapter 11 case and the lawsuit
were filed in Manhattan, where a small unit, Enron Metals and Commodity is
based. Dynegy said that both cases should be heard in Houston in the
interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties. Dynegy said it
was disappointed with the decision, but expects that all of Enron's
creditors will be treated fairly regardless of the venue. The attempt to
transfer the case to Houston divided Enron's creditors. Several banks
based in New York opposed a transfer. A committee appointed to represent
Enron's unsecured creditors also wanted to keep the case in New York. Some
Houston-based creditors such as El Paso, Reliant and a group of Enron
401(k) plan holders, were in favor of Houston.

Drillers Idle Rigs Until Oil and Natural Gas Prices Rebound

    Pride International, which had 25 drilling rigs drilling for oil and
natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico a year ago, has idled 15 of those rigs.
Energy exploration companies have cut back their budgets on contract
natural gas drilling as prices plunged 80% from a year ago and oil fell by
30%. It is estimated that companies will cut spending on drilling by about
20% in North America to $42.5 billion. For every non-active rig, about 50
workers join the unemployment line. Apache has said it plans to cut
capital spending 70% after spending $1 billion last year. Burlington
Resources said it will spend 19% less than last years $1.3 billion.
Kerr-McGee has estimated spending would be half that of 2001. BP plans to
defer a $600 million Alaskan drilling program and 20% of its workforce in
the state lose their jobs. However, not all oil and natural gas explorers
are cutting spending this year. Phillips plans to raise its exploration
and production budget by about 2% and Unocal expects spending to maintain
current levels. ExxonMobil estimates a 10% increase in spending from as
much as $7.3 billion last year. Pride has reduced its active rig fleet and
now has lowered contract rates by 55%. Some analysts believe that drillers
should not cut their operations too steeply, due to the inevitable rise in
natural gas prices. Pride says maintenance crews run engines and keep
everything in order on the idle rigs for when prices rebound. Elsewhere in
the world, where the exploration costs are usually lower, the outlook for
oil drilling is not as dismal. Exploration spending by the industry on
overseas wells has been estimated climb by as much as 11%.

San Francisco Concerned over Power Project Delays

    The California ISO is worried that recent cancellations and delays in
the construction of more power plants in and around San Francisco could
have detrimental effects on the city's power supply. Those worries have
increased after Mirant delayed a project to increase generation capacity
at the aging 363 MW Potrero plant. The company said the project is on the
deferred list, but that is basically due to permitting. Mirant said it
intends to proceed with the permitting and then other decisions will have
to be made, but made no commitment beyond that. Potrero is not the only
generating plant that is causing concern for officials in San Francisco.
The Hunters Point station, owned by Pacific Gas & Electric, was built in
the 1920s and new power turbines were last installed in the late 1940s and
1950s. In addition, Mirant has 2 other power plants in Contra Costa County
across the bay from San Francisco, which were also scheduled to be
upgraded. The company said it will complete expansion work at one plant,
but improvements at the 2nd station are held up by problems with Bay Area
pollution rules. The ISO said that the alternative to avoid power
shortages is to expand the transmission grid delivering electricity into
San Francisco from the peninsula to the south. Many energy companies have
cut back their expansion plans in the wake of the collapse of Enron and a
sharp drop in wholesale power prices. Mirant has said it would complete
about 5,700 MW of power under way, but will defer or cancel 8,300 MW.

    Swiss bank UBS Warburg is the apparent winner of an auction for
control of Enron's energy trading unit. If the bankruptcy judge accepts
UBS bid, it would mean a venture into a new area of business for UBS, the
investment banking arm of the Swiss bank trades in commodities,
derivatives, and other instruments but not oil and natural gas. The value
of the winning bid or other details were not disclosed. As part of the
deal, Enron would retain a residual interest in the income of the business
but UBS would assume none of Enron's past, present or future liabilities
or trading positions. The company says that with UBS' 'AA' credit rating
and Enron's proven industry expertise, the shift in control will maximize
the value of the trading operations. The operations, which have been idle
since early December, generated most of the energy traders $101 billion in
profits for 2000. After all night negotiations in New York, the bid was
approved by Enron's 15-member unsecured creditors committee, a court
appointed group representing some of those that Enron owes. Members of the
committee said that they would have been comfortable with either UBS or
Citibank, the other bidder for the trading operations, but that the UBS
bid was a little more lucrative. However, Citigroup could still come back
with a sweetened offer and present it to the judge next week. Citigroup
declined to comment because it has never publicly admitted to being a
bidder.

Ontario Power Price Volatility Likely to Increase

    Ontario can expect large swings in electricity prices after its power
industry is opened to competition in May, according to some experts.
Ontario plans to introduce competition into an industry that has 29,500
MWof generating capacity and serves almost 12 million people. The
deregulation process was originally scheduled for November 2000. Price and
supply problems accompanied deregulation in Alberta and California over
the past two years, including and some expect the same for Ontario.
Alberta spent billions of dollars on rebates to cushion the impact on
consumers of its difficult transition. But Alberta's power charges, after
rising sharply in the run-up to its market opening in 2001, have declined
to about C$71 per MWh from C$133 per MWh in 2000. The economic slowdown,
additional generating capacity and lower natural gas prices have pushed
down prices across North America. But, the spot market remains volatile,
with Alberta's wholesale prices ranging from C$6 per MWh at off-peak times
to C$879 per MWh at the highest peak last year. So Ontario power prices
under the new market are likely to be more volatile than they were before
for the foreseeable future. But, while there will be more price swings,
Ontario's power prices will be lower over the longer term because of
increased competition. And a large reserve of generating capacity should
shelter Ontario residents from sky-high peaking prices boyh California and
Alberta suffered through. But Ontario will pay a price for its slow
movement toward competition. The weak economy and reduced capital
available to potential buyers are reducing bids for publicly owned power
plants by up to 50%. Ontario Power Generation must sell 4,200 MW of
capacity within 4 years to encourage competition, and within ten years
reduce its share of the market to under 35%.
