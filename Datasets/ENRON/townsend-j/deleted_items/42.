Natural Gas Futures Rally on AGA Report

    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.103
higher yesterday to $2.394 per MMBtu. The March contract gained $0.09 to
$2.363 per MMBtu. The market began the day up and pushed higher after a
137 Bcf withdrawal was reported by the AGA in the afternoon. The storage
report was about what was expected, but was 37 Bcf more than a year ago.
However, it barely dented the record amounts of inventory remain in
storage, about 2.529 Tcf, at 77% full compared to 44% full last year at
this time at 1.459 Tcf. The 5-year average is 2 Tcf. The rally broke
through the $2.36 resistance level. Funds are holding record-high short
positions and could cause a major technical rally if they ever had to
cover. But, more likely the market will head back down as the fundamentals
takeover. Support is seen at $2.36, $2.32 and $2.25 per MMBtu. A cold
front expected to move into eastern states next week and could cause the
market to rally again, but the increase will be difficult to sustain.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally
flat to $0.05 higher yesterday. Natural gas for next delivery at the hub
gained $0.03 to $2.39 per MMBtu.

 PG&E Ads Blast California PUC Lawsuit


    PG&E has bought full-page advertisements in newspapers throughout
California blasting a giant state fraud lawsuit against the bankrupt
utility in a bid to topple the company's reorganization plan. The ads
reprinted a recent letter to the employees of Pacific Gas and Electric
from the chairman and chief executive of the parent company. He wrote that
the lawsuit by the California Attorney General contained false and
unwarranted accusations. The lawsuit charges that PG&E drained cash from
the utility during the California power emergency to fund new businesses
and drove the company into bankruptcy and seeks damages of $600 million to
$4 billion. The attorney general and the PUC are working to derail the
utilitys reorganization plan because they don't want to lose regulatory
jurisdiction over the company, the ad said. The plan would shift the
utility's power generation and energy transmission systems to new
companies formed by PG&E and beyond state jurisdiction.

Calpine Revises 2001 and 2002 Earnings Estimates

    Calpine has lowered its earnings estimates for 2001 and 2002. It now
expects profits of $1.95 per share for 2001 compared to estimates of $2.00
per share. For 2002, it expects earnings of $1.70 per share versus
estimates of $2.20 per share. Even though Calpine lowered its estimate for
2001, it will see its profits rise by 63% above 2000 earnings. Calpine
also revised its capital spending budget downward by $2 billion saying it
will complete 27 power projects, accounting for 15,200 MW, which are
currently being built. Another 34 projects in the advanced development
stage will be on hold until demand for power increases. It is also
negotiating with major equipment suppliers to adjust payment schedules and
revise delivery timing in line with its new construction schedule.
Calpine, Mirant and other power generators have delayed or canceled
billions of dollars in projects in an attempt to bolster credit ratings
and reassure investors. Last month, Moody's lowered Calpine's credit
rating to junk and said it remained on review for further possible
downgrades. Calpine has raised almost $5 billion in the last 3 months,
including a $2.6 billion bond sale. Its current generating capacity is
11,100 MW, but was scheduled to have up to 70,000 MW by the end of 2005.
It now expects to have 26,300 MW by the end of 2003. Plants with a
combined capacity of 82,000 MW have been canceled or postponed. Plants
under construction with another 200,000 MW of capacity are on the auction
block.

FERC to Create Power Market Oversight Unit

  The FERC plans to create a new market oversight unit to prevent
manipulation of wholesale electricity prices and supplies. The new Office
of Market Oversight and Investigations is designed to protect customers
through vigilant oversight of the nation's energy market, according to the
FERC. It plans to have the office operating with a staff of over 50 by
this Spring. The FERC currently has an office of Markets Tariffs and
Rates, which monitors markets in a broad way. But, the new office will be
FERC's first attempt of defining and curbing market power, either through
refund orders or courts.

JP Morgan Posts 4th Quarter Loss

    JP Morgan Chase posted its first quarterly loss in 5 years after it
wrote off loans to Argentina and Enron. The bank lost $332 million, or
$0.18 per share, compared with earnings of $0.34 per share, or $708
million, in the 4th quarter of 2000. The banks decision to lend to Enron,
Argentina and others that defaulted kept it from profiting from the lowest
interest rates in 40 years. Competitors that took advantage of the low
rates are reporting increased earnings. JP Morgan took a write-off of $456
million for trading losses and loans to Enron and still has exposure of
$2.06 billion of potential losses. The lender had a complex relationship
with Enron as it traded with the company, advised it and loaned it money.
JP Morgan will attempt to recover its Enron loans, some of which were not
backed by collateral, in bankruptcy court. The bank is also suing
insurance companies for $965 million for insured oil and natural gas
contracts. In addition, JP Morgan took a charge of $351 million for loans
to Argentina, which devalued its currency and defaulted on its bonds. It
is one of 4 US lenders with large exposures in the country. The bank said
it lost $385 million in its private equity business, and also allowed $510
million to cover further possible loan defaults in response to
deteriorating market conditions.

Dominion Resources Expects 4th Quarter Costs


    Dominion Resources had 4th quarter expenses of $348 million for losses
from dealings with Enron and for a restructuring. The companys 2001
earnings, excluding some items, met or exceeded forecasts of $4.15 per
share. The expenses include $97 million related to Enron, a $183 million
write-off of Dominion Capital assets and $68 million from a restructuring.
The Enron costs involve $6 million for past sales to the energy trader and
$91 million for the decline in value of forward natural gas contracts with
Enron. Dominion expects profit this year of $4.90 - $4.95 per share.
Earnings after 2002 should rise at an average annual rate of 10%, Dominion
says.  Last November, Dominion cut its senior-management team by 19
officers, or 25%. Dominion has hedged more than 60% of its 2002 natural
gas production and 40% of its 2003 natural gas volume at prices above
current market prices.

UBS to Restart EnronOnline

    Natural gas traders who did large volumes of business with Enron are
taking a wait-and-see approach toward dealing with the new market player
expected to emerge from the recent deal with Swiss bank, UBS. Some have
their doubts about UBS' potential impact on the market. The deal calls for
UBS to restart the trading business, including EnronOnline, with the help
of 830 former Enron workers. However, even if the deal does get the
court's approval, there is still some question among marketers and traders
as to whether a revitalized trading operation could recapture the dominant
market share Enron held prior to bankruptcy.

President Urges Senate to Act on National Energy Plan

    In an address in New Orleans, President Bush said that it was a matter
of national security for the US to have a National Energy Package. The
president urged the Senate, where energy legislation is currently stalled,
to take immediate action to pass a National Energy Plan. The president's
remarks come prior to Congress reconvening next week after the holiday
recess. The White House, labor and business leaders support the
development of resources in ANWR to increase energy independence, national
security and create over 755,000 jobs. Opening the ANWR could double the
current domestic supply of oil and make the US far less reliant on foreign
sources for its energy needs. The US Geological Survey reports that the
1.5 million-acre tract holds upwards of 16 billion barrels of recoverable
oil, which is the energy equivalent of 17.7 billion barrels of gasoline,
enough to supply the total US gasoline demand for nearly 6 years. Arctic
Power, an Alaskan-based non-profit organization that supports the opening
of ANWR says that Congress has debated ANWR for over 14 years and now it
is the responsibility of the Senate to face up to the realities of the
present situation. The 2,000 acres of the ANWR designated for exploration
could replace Iraqi imports for the next 70 years.
