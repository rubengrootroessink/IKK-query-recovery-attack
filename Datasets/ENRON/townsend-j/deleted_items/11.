Natural Gas Futures Higher on Colder Weather


    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.058
yesterday to $$2.138 per MMBtu, propped up by cold weather in the Midwest
and Northeast. The April contract climbed $0.043 to $2.19 per MMBtu. The
market opened higher on colder weather across much of the nation, but
dipped below $2.10 briefly in the early afternoon before short-covering
boosted prices before the close, holding in a $0.055 range. Funds were
buying early with the cold weather keeping the sellers at bay. Look for
the cold weather to drive the market to test $2.15 resistance today, with
a good chance of testing the $2.21 level. The market is still bottom
building, moving quietly in a sideways range, causing any short-covering
rally to be met with selling into resistance. With winter ending soon and
a Tcf in excess storage, the gravitational pull on the market is
tremendous. The withdrawals over the last several weeks have been larger
than just pure weather-related withdrawals, so a marginal amount of
natural gas coming out storage is supplementing daily production in the
market. The estimated volume was 69,100 contracts, with 34,800 of those
hedges or spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally $0.05 - $0.15 higher yesterday on short-term cold
weather in the Midwest to the Northeast, forcing price squeezes at certain
pipelines on marketers who were short to begin the new month. The trend
for this month is still softer cash prices. Natural gas for next day
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.07 to $2.14 per MMBtu.

FERC Drops Complaint Against BPA and Others

     The FERC has dismissed a complaint by Californians for Renewable
Energy, a citizens group that claimed BPA and 3 other firms withheld badly
needed electricity during the state's power crisis. The group filed a
complaint last April, during the height of the crisis, when wholesale
power prices had galloped 10 times higher and customers were hit with a
series of rolling blackouts. The group accused BPA, Canada's BC Hydro,
Powerex and Mirant of withholding wholesale power supplies to boost prices
during the crisis. The BPA, which supplies about half of the Pacific
Northwest's power through huge hydropower dams, is owned by the federal
government. BC Hydro is owned by the provincial government of British
Columbia. The FERC dismissed the complaint because the group's allegations
are vague and similar issues were decided by the commission in other
cases.

Dynegy Takes Over Northern Natural Gas Pipeline


    Dynegy, which acquired the Northern Natural Gas pipeline from Enron
after investing $1.5 billion in the energy trader, will take over the
pipelines trading and marketing today. The system, valued at $2.7 billion,
runs 16,600 miles from Texas to the Great Lakes. Enron had contested the
takeover after Dynegy backed out of its plan to buy Enron for $23 billion
in November. Earlier this month, Enron gave up the pipeline, but is
proceeding with a $10 billion lawsuit against Dynegy for terminating their
deal. Northern Natural has a capacity of 4.3 Bcf of natural gas per day
and has valuable connection points with other pipelines. Although Dynegy
operates many pipelines, Northern Natural is their first foray into
pipeline ownership. Dynegy paid $23 million to complete the purchase and
named Daniel Dienstbier as the systems president, a position he held
before becoming president of Enron's Gas Pipeline Group in 1985. Dynegy
also assumed $900 million of Northern Natural's debt. Enron employees will
run and maintain Northern Natural until Enron's option to buy it back
expires June 30th. But most think that is unlikely to happen, given
Enron's current state of affairs.

FERC Approves Tuscarora Pipeline Expansion


    The  has given final approval to Tuscarora Gas Transmission's plan to
expand its pipeline system to bring more natural gas to industrial
customers in northern Nevada. The Tuscarora natural gas pipeline was built
in 1995 in a partnership between Sierra Pacific Resources and TransCanada
PipeLines. The $60 million, 14-mile pipeline extension would almost double
the capacity in the area from 125 MMcf per day to 220 MMcf per day. The
expanded pipeline capacity will serve Duke Energy's 540 MW plant near
Wadsworth, Nevada and Morgan Stanley's 360 MW power plant near Reno. The
229-mile pipeline stretches from Malin, Oregon through northern California
to Sierra Pacific's Tracy power station near Reno.

FERC to Probe Enron's Role in California Power Crisis

    At the urging of Democrats representing Western states, the FERC has
launched a probe into allegations that Enron illegally manipulated
wholesale power prices during California's power crisis last year. One
California senator also demanded that the FERC provide a list of meetings
and telephone calls between the commission and Enron executives from
August 2000 through June 2001. Enron has denied any wrongdoing. The
Democratic senator pointed to news reports that former Enron chairman Ken
Lay met with Vice President Cheney in April, 2001 and discussed the
California power crisis. The next day, Cheney said he opposed price caps,
the senator said. The senator is questioning whether Enron used influence
in secret meetings with the vice president or the FERC to persuade them to
do nothing about the state's soaring power prices. However, the
administration has always opposed price caps. But the FERC chairman said
that his staff has already started to look into the allegations. The probe
will involve FERC's office of general counsel and office of market tariffs
and rates. The chairman declined to elaborate on the scope of the probe.
The legislators cited a study by an independent consultant showing that
California prices fell by 30% soon after Enron declared bankruptcy in
December. The Democrats say that a key factor in higher power prices was
Enron's dealings in unregulated financial derivatives in the natural gas
market while controlling a large share of the market.

Plains States Hit with Icy Storm and Power Outages

    A brutal ice storm in the Plains states and Midwest knocked out power
to one million utility customers, causing some of the biggest
storm-related outages in history, according to the utilities. In Oklahoma,
the governor declared a state of emergency in 28 of the state's 77
counties. The storm may leave some customers without power for up to a
week. Freezing rain and ice downed power lines and snapped trees around
Oklahoma, leaving more than 230,000 customers without electricity with
temperatures in the low 20s. Oklahoma Gas & Electric said it was the worst
storm in the 100-year history of the company in terms of customers
affected. Yesterday evening, about 176,000 OG&E customers still had no
electricity, about 123,000 of them in Oklahoma City. The utility said at
least 60 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, ranging from 69 kV to
345 kV, were on the ground, but it has been able to reroute power around
the downed transmission lines. Kansas City was also hit by the worst ice
storm in 16 years, with more than 100,000 customers without power. Repair
crews from other areas were being brought in to clear downed trees and
restore electricity. Kansas City Power & Light had 90 line crews and 100
tree crews working around the clock. KCP&L said as many as 285,000
customers were without power overnight. In the upper Midwest, the storm

FERC Drops California Natural Gas Price Reports

    After reviewing what data it needed to monitor all US energy markets,
the FERC plans to stop requiring companies to report monthly California
natural gas prices. The FERC began requiring monthly California price data
from natural gas sellers and pipelines last July during the state's power
crisis. Last summer, natural gas prices oared above $18 per MMBtu in the
state's spot market while other US prices remained much lower. However,
the commission indicated that it might require other kinds of energy
pricing data to be reported on a regular basis. The decision to drop the
reporting was supported by energy companies which said the requirement was
costly and burdensome.

California PUC Reaches Agreement on Bonds

    The California PUC has agreed on a plan to let the state sell up to
$12.5 billion of bonds, the largest municipal bond sale in US history. The
governor and PUC argued over options for repaying the bonds after the
regulator rejected an initial proposal in October. Bond proceeds would be
used to cover the state's cost of buying electricity for utilities that
ran up billions of dollars in debt under the state's deregulation law. The
PUC has issued a proposed plan that would let the state Department of
Water Resources sell the bonds.  The state has spent $11.8 billion buying
electricity. Comments on the plan are due by February 5th and the FERC
expects to vote on the agreement at a February 21st meeting. But it may be
very difficult to sell the bonds by June 30th, even if a plan is approved
soon.
