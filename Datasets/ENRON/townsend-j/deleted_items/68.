Natural Gas Futures Up Slightly in Lackluster Trading


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX contract
settled $0.007 up Friday at $2.275 per MMBtu on a day of lackluster trades
and boredom. The March contract gained $0.002 to $2.265 per MMBtu. The
market opened slightly higher but slowly worked it way lower before
recovering a little before the close. The market hit a marginal new low
but traded in a $0.02 - $0.03 range most of Friday, with low volumes
around 66,210. The lack of activity was expected after a large sell-off on
Thursday, with traders exhausting their positions after the AGA report.
The AGA reported a withdrawal of only 124 Bcf last week, considered low
and bearish, leaving over a Tcf more in storage than a year ago. The
market should continue softening slightly on lack of prolonged cold
weather and high storage volumes, but a technical rally lead by
short-covering funds is likely soon. The commitments of traders report
published Friday by the CFTC showed large speculators, including commodity
funds, held a net short position of 33,103 contracts last week, compared
with 26,874 the prior week. Big commercial players held a net long
position of 27,367, up from 21,258 a week earlier. They ended the week
with 336,717 longs and 309,350 shorts. This week, look for support at
December expiry levels of $2.18 of MMBtu, with resistance at $2.40  -
$2.45. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally down $0.10 - $0.20 Friday. Natural gas for next day delivery at
the Henry hub lost $0.13 to $2.36 per MMBtu.

Companies Cut Planned Power Projects


    Power companies are cutting back on plans to build many new plants in
a reaction to sliding wholesale electricity prices and questions about
heavy corporate debt levels. About 18% of announced projects are defunct,
double the number of a year ago. The drop off could pose a threat to the
US after the current recession when demand for electricity picks up.
Enron's dramatic demise has hurt the power industry in recent months and
forced many to cut spending. Mirant, Dynegy and El Paso have all said they
would scale back some projects. Calpine is expected to make a similar
announcement later this month. Energy Insight reports that 91,139 MW of
generating plant, out of a total announced portfolio of 503,780 MW have
been scrapped or delayed by the end of 2001.

Unemployment Rate Rises for Oil and Natural Gas Drilling

    Lower oil and natural gas prices have taken their toll on the energy
exploration sector, which lost about 4,000 jobs in December according to
the Department of Labor. There were 336,000 oil and natural gas drilling
positions as of January 1st, about 6000 less jobs than the 3-year highs of
August and September, the DOL said. The US lost 124,000 jobs in December,
or 5.8%, but the unemployment rate fell from November, when 371,000 jobs
were lost. In 2001, the average crude oil price fell 14% to $25.96 per
barrel, but oil prices have risen since late December when OPEC and
non-member producers agreed to remove almost 2 million bpd from the global
oil market. Many have forecast a stronger market for oil and natural gas
prices in the 2nd quarter of this year, but the lost jobs will not return
until demand and prices rise. As is normal in the energy industry,
exploration jobs are usually the first to go when oil and natural gas
prices sink. Mostly unionized jobs in the petroleum and coal products
sector were stable at 127,000, but close to all time lows. The 4,000
positions eliminated by Enron last month are reflected in the securities
and commodity trading employment figures and account for more than a half
of that segment's jobless rate for December, according to DOL data.

Shares of Covanta Jump Higher

     Shares of Covanta jumped higher Friday after it had completed the
sale of most of an aviation fueling business as it seeks to focus on
independent power projects. The stock was up $0.44, or 8.9%, to $5.45 per
share. Covanta completed the sale of its aviation fueling operations at 19
airports in the US, Canada and Panama to Allied Aviation Holdings, a unit
of Tampa Pipeline for $15.2 million. Covanta also said Allied Aviation
Holdings would buy its aviation fueling operations at the three major New
York/New Jersey airports for an undisclosed price. This deal has been
delayed and there is no time frame for completion. Late last month Covanta
said it was seeking extra liquidity because of payment delays. The
statement, and investor fears about the prospects for power companies,
sent Covanta shares tumbling 60%.

PPL Cuts Earnings Forecasts


    PPL has said it plans to cancel 5 new power plants in Pennsylvania and
1 in Washington state and warned it will not meet earnings forecasts for
2001 and 2002. PPL canceled the projects worth $1.3 billion, which would
have added 2,100 MW of power, because of falling power prices and
regulatory conditions. The average price of electricity in PPL's main
market, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland fell 43% last quarter to
$25.80 per MWh from a year ago. The company will now spend about $1.5
billion on other power plant projects over the next 2 years. PPL has
lowered its 2001 and 2002 earnings estimates to $3.35 - $3.45 per share
from at least $4 per share. Power prices across the nation have fallen as
the recession and mild weather have reduced demand, leading many utilities
and power generators to cut back plans to build new generating plants. On
Friday, shares of PPL fell $2.56, more than 7% to $32.34, after dropping
by 23% last year. PPL is not alone as other power producers have canceled
or delayed plans for projects because of lower power prices and concern
that rising debt might hurt credit ratings. Its 2001 earnings were reduced
by $0.60 per share after canceling the purchase of 22 turbines from GE.
Earnings were also reduced about $0.14 per share after a write-off for a
share in the UK Teesside Power Station, partly owned by Enron. Profits
were further decreased by about $0.06 because of other business associated
with Enron.

Williams to Sell Convertibles


    Williams expects to sell $1 billion of securities automatically
convertible into company stock this week in a bid to shore up its balance
sheet following the collapse of Enron. Many energy providers have been
trying to improve their finances and increase investor confidence
following that bankruptcy. The sale of 3-year mandatory convertible
securities follows last month's $1.2 billion convertible securities sale
by Calpine. Williams' securities carry a rarely used structure that limits
the ability of investors to participate fully in a rise in Williams'
stock, but cushions that with a big dividend. The reason issuers in
general like mandatories is it helps their credit profiles, because there
is no principal coming due in 3 years. The benefit of a capped convertible
is there is a cap on the dollar value of the shares you need to issue if
the stock really runs higher. Williams will use proceeds as part of its
plan to fund capital spending, pay down short-term debt and pursue other
corporate purposes. Convertibles are stock-bond hybrids that usually offer
current income and can be converted into company stock.

Enron Removes Dabhol Components for Safe-Keeping


    After pulling out of India's Dabhol Power project, Enron has removed
key components necessary to restart the $3 billion power plant. Dabhol
said the parts were moved for security reasons so that they could be used
again when the power plant is sold. Dabhol, which laid off 300 workers
last month, says that the plant is surrounded by hostile people who relied
on the plant for their livelihood and that vandalism and theft occur
daily. The company wanted to keep the parts from being stolen or damaged.
A security staff of 80 guards protects the 1,700-acre site. Indian banks,
which have made $1.4 billion in loans to the plant, said the parts were
taken without their knowledge. Enron said it couldn't notify lenders of
the removal in time because of the holiday season. Dabhol says that the
parts are being stored outside India and would be returned once a sale is
completed. Tata Power, BSES and state-run Gas Authority of India have said
they plan to bid for the 740 MW plant. The lenders contacted Enron for an
explanation for the removal of the components, which included coded
compact discs and microchips. Enron owns 65% of the plant which was closed
down last May after cancelled a supply contract when the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board ran up $64 million in unpaid bills. An expansion plan to
add 1,444 MW to the existing generator and a 5 million-ton-per-year LNG
receiving terminal is 95% complete, but work has been halted pending a
sale. General Electric and Bechtel Group each own 10% of Dabhol.
