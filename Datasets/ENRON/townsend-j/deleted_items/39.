Natural Gas Slips Lower Before Long Weekend


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX slipped $0.018 Friday
to $2.236 per MMBtu in subdued pre-holiday trading. The March contract
lost $0.018 to $2.236 per MMBtu. With no fundamentals to drive the market
higher, but a general reluctance to short the market before a long holiday
weekend kept trading quiet within a $0.05 range between $2.21 - $2.26 per
MMBtu. The NYMEX was closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr
Day and will resume operations today. The AGA weekly storage report will
be released on Wednesday this week as usual. Physical prices tumbled
Friday into the long weekend, sliding down on a lack of cold weather and a
NYMEX that seems ready to head in the same direction. Natural gas for
weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.10 - $0.20
Friday due to a mild weather forecast. Natural gas for next day delivery
at the Henry hub lost $0.13 to $2.28 per MMBtu.

Court Questions AEP Purchase of CSW


    A federal appeals court is raising new questions about the $10 billion
acquisition of Central & South West Corp by American Electric Power, and
has told the SEC to reconsider its approval of the purchase. The
acquisition created a utility that stretches from Virginia to Texas, with
5 million customers in 11 states. At issue is the SEC's conclusion that
the combined company met Public Utility Holding Company Act requirements
that utility networks be physically interconnected and confined to a
single area or region. The court says the PUC failed to explain its
conclusions regarding the interconnection requirement' and failed to
justify its finding that the proposed acquisition will satisfy the single
area or region requirement.

Judge to Decide on UBS Deal for Enron's Trading Unit


    UBS's proposed acquisition of Enron's energy trading business could be
worth between $1 billion to $2 billion to Enron over the next several
years, according to testimony given to the bankruptcy judge last week. If
the deal is not approved, the liquidation value of the company could be
only $50 million. The judge is deliberating whether to approve a deal that
would allow UBS to pay Enron for its energy trading business out of future
earnings in lieu of cash up front. A creditors group that opposes the UBS
deal, saying the projections were speculative, especially since Enron's
trading business is not currently in operation. About 20 small energy and
exploration companies that traded with Enron, called the Dunhill Group,
say that the creditors will bear a higher percentage of the cost and risk
of the new business with UBS. The deal would hasten the depletion of
Enron's estate, the creditors allege. Under the terms of the deal, UBS
would license Enron's intellectual property, lease its real estate and
hire Enron employees to run the operation, but the bank would not assume
any of Enron's liabilities. The transaction does not include any pending
commodity trades and derivative contracts entered into by Enron prior to
its filing for bankruptcy. The outstanding deals are worth more than $4
billion. Enron is attempting to settle the commodity and derivative
contracts to help pay off debts. The agreement would give UBS the sole
rights to Enron's trading software for the next decade. Initially the bank
would pay royalties of 33% of pretax profit from the trading business to
Enron. UBS would also pay $5 million of the $11 million in incentive
bonuses promised to Enron's natural gas and power employees after the 1st
year. Then UBS would have the option to buy out Enron's royalty interest
in the 3rd year. Early payment by UBS could trim the royalties to 22% of
the operation's pretax earnings, then down to 11%, and then eventually
obliterate them.

PG&E Proceeds with Bankruptcy Plans

    Pacific Gas & Electric is moving forward with plans to emerge from
bankruptcy by the end of the year, despite objections by the California
PUC. The PUC opposes the bankruptcy plan which includes the transfer of
utility assets to its parent company, effectively removing them from state
regulatory control. The court gave the PUC until February 13th to file an
outline of its proposal. PG&E is skeptical of the PUC's ability to present
a credible plan, that would receive shareholder support. However, the PUC
is confident that it can develop a plan that is better for consumers and
that creditors would approve of. The bankruptcy judge is considering the
appointment of a mediator to help the two sides reach a settlement. PG&E
will file its response to the idea in a week.

SEC Suspends New Energy Securities Trading

  The SEC has suspended trading of New Energy securities over questions
involving the adequacy and accuracy of public disclosures. Trading of
securities will be suspended through February 1st. Questions were raised
about the adequacy and accuracy of information concerning the value of
certain power generation contracts, the existence and size of certain
purchase orders for solar chips and its partner's relationship with the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. New Energy says it is confident
that the issues could be resolved and that trading would resume when the
suspension over. It is the distribution and marketing arm of privately
held Megawatt, which makes solar power generators. New Energy had no
revenues last year. New Energy shares were last down $0.55 to $2.90 in
over-the-counter trading.

FPL 4th Quarter Profits Jump 82%

    The FPL Group posted an 82% increase in 4th quarter earnings over last
year. Profits for the quarter increased $0.70 per share to $118 million
from $65 million, or $0.38 per share. Revenue dipped to $1.84 billion from
$1.86 billion as the economic slump decreased electricity demand. Florida
Power & Light saw its profits jump by 18% to $109 million, or $0.65 per
share. The utility added almost 87,000 customers last year expects to add
65,000 more this year. Its customer base has been expanding at double the
national rate. Earnings for FPL Energy climbed 11% to $10 million, or
$0.06 per share. The unit operates power plants in about 15 states and
expects to add 3,700 MW of generation by 2004. An accounting change in the
last quarter related to derivatives added $3 million, or $0.02 per share,
to FPL's net income. Excluding the items, FPL's profit climbed 8.5% to
$115 million, or $0.68 per share, from $106 million, or $0.62, matching
the average estimate of analysts. The FPL Energy unit plans to acquire
power plants in its operation areas but is waiting to see prices that
reflect distressed sales. FPL added 5,063 MW of generating capacity
outside Florida, 23% over last year. If Congress extends tax credits for
renewable energy, the company plans to build 500 to 1,000 MW per year of
wind driven generators in the next several years. Two FPL shareholders
have filed a lawsuit seeking the repayment of more than $53 million in
retention bonuses given to nine FP&L executives before the Entergy
agreement collapsed.

Moody's May Change Companies' Rating Procedure


      Responding to severe market criticism, Moody's Investors Service is
considering making changes in how it rates companies. The changes, which
should be ready for discussion in a few weeks, could cause ratings to rise
or fall faster, affecting companies' ability to raise money. The review
follows criticism of the agencies' perceived lack of speed in downgrading
Enron's ratings to junk status in November.  Moody's is preparing a
special comment on the matter that should be issued in a few weeks. The
changes could include more multi-notch upgrades or downgrades of company
ratings; a speeding up of rating reviews into a matter of weeks, rather
than a few months; and perhaps the elimination of rating outlooks. Some
feel within Moody's that the ratings are too sticky, or move too slowly.
Some argue that Moody's should accept greater volatility in order to
improve the predictive power of ratings. A rise in negative rating actions
would depress bond prices and leave many companies facing higher funding
costs or more difficulty in raising money. S&P and Fitch have begun
focusing more on liquidity, or the ability of companies to access the cash
they need to run their businesses, since the Enron debacle. A policy shift
could have the effect of making it more difficult for borderline credits
to survive an economic downturn. "If Moody's moves ahead with the changes,
it could mark a major structural change in the corporate bond market that
could lead to structurally higher volatility.
