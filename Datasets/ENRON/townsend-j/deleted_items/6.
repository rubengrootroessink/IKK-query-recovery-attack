Natural Gas Futures End Friday Flat


    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX  ended another
boring session flat for the day last Friday at $2.138 per MMBtu. The April
contract gained $0.008 to $2.198 per MMBtu. The market opened lower, but
was soon boosted by short-term cold and short-covering from speculators
and locals pushing as high as $2.165 per MMBtu. Buy-stops were believed to
be above $2.17 per MMBtu, and will still likely be there today. Estimated
volume Friday was only about 50,400 contracts, with 19,600 of those
spreads. There just was not enough volume to hit the buy-stops as the
market hovered mostly between $2.14 - $2.15. With the market unable to
breach $2.17, speculators were forced to back-off late. If $2.17 can be
breached today, the market could rise to the next resistance level at
$2.22, and then possibly as high as $2.48 before reality once again sinks
in. However, if the cash market opens lower this morning, the market may
not get a chance to test the resistance. With still more than 1 Tcf in
excess storage over last year and a relatively mild winter so far, the
market's short to medium term bias is still down. Natural gas for weekend
delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to $0.10 higher
Friday. Natural gas for weekend delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.05 to
$2.19 per MMBu.

Enron Power Trading Falls in 4th Quarter


    Enron's 4th quarter power trading volumes were about 26% lower than
the previous quarter, which is surprising since it was bankrupt for a
third of the quarter and in deep trouble for over half of the period.
Enron Power Marketing sold almost 221 million MW from October through
December, down from about 300 million MW sold during the 3rd quarter. Last
week, the FERC began investigating allegations that Enron unfairly raised
wholesale power prices during California's power crisis last year. After
Enron took a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity related to its
off-balance-sheet transactions, other energy firms limited their trading
with Enron out of concern credit obligations. In the first 3 quarters of
2001, Enron had about 15% of the nations wholesale power market and AEP
was next in line with about an 8% share. The table below shows Enron's
biggest customers, the total MW sold and the highest price paid by each
for the 4th quarter.

Mirant Moving to Allay Investor Fears


    In an attempt to allay the fears of investors, Mirant plans to sell
assets and reduce expenditures to lower its debt. Shares of Mirant have
fallen by 50% in the last 2 months, following the downfall of Enron and
the downgrade of about $4.9 billion of its debt to junk status by Moody's.
Last week, Mirant said that 4th quarter earnings had dropped by 55%, due
to lower energy prices and a charge of $66 million from exposure to Enron.
It also cut its capital budget by 50% and lowered its earnings forecast in
2002 to $1.60 to $1.70 per share, from its December estimate of  $1.90 to
$2.00, because of lower profit margins. Mirant expects 1st quarter profits
of $0.30 per share, lower than last year's $0.52 per share. Profit for the
4th quarter dipped to $30 million, or $0.09 per share, from $67 million,
or $0.20 per share a year ago. Revenue was off 9%, to $7.24 billion from
$7.96 billion. Mirant was spun off from Southern Company in September 2000
and the deal was completed last April, when Southern distributed 272
million shares, or 80% of Mirant for $9.44 billion. In efforts to distance
itself from Enron, Mirant points out that assets, such as power plants,
contributed 90% to its profitability, unlike Enron, whose trading unit was
responsible for 90% of its 2000 revenue. Mirant has delayed plans to spend
$3 billion on tripling its 15,000 MW of power this year. Instead it will
limit capital spending to the completion of power plants that will produce
5,700 MW. Mirant will also cut about 65% of job at its German unit, Bewag,
which it wants to sell.

Midwest ISO Begins Selling Regional Transmission Service

    The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator has implemented
its tariff and will now provide regional transmission service for bulk
power in the Midwest ISO footprint. Transmission customers are now able to
request transmission service from Midwest ISO without going to individual
transmission owners. The Midwest ISO, which serves 21 transmission owners
in 15 states, is responsible for evaluating and coordinating requests for
access to the regional power grid on a non-discriminatory basis. The
Midwest ISO says that transmission customers in the Midwest will now
benefit from standardized rates, terms and conditions for service over its
86,000 miles of transmission lines. Transmission customers are now able to
request transmission service from the MISO's OASIS website, giving them
the ability to view transmission availability data at the same time and
request transmission service in the same manner. It also provides for
streamlined electronic scheduling which allows customers to easily
schedule approved transactions for service across multiple control areas
in the MISO footprint. In addition, customers will now have access to an
independent, regional analysis of bulk power flows utilizing a standard
methodology. The MISO will provide a single bill to customers for all
transmission service provided.

Wisconsin Energy Power Plant Plan

    Wisconsin Energy plans to build $3 billion in new electricity
generators over the next nine years to meet growing energy demands.
Forecasts indicate Wisconsin will need more than the 2,800 MW the new
units will generate by 2011. The projects include 2 natural gas fired
generators and 3 coal burning units at existing power plants. Other power
producers including Calpine and Mirant have delayed new construction in
the state because of lower electricity demand and prices. The first
natural gas fired should be under construction by early next year to be in
service before the summer of 2005. Wisconsin Energy has created a
subsidiary that would build and own the generators and lease them back to
the utility for up to 25 years. Calpine, Enron and PG&E had opposed the
proposal, saying it would delay deregulation in the state by more than a
decade.
