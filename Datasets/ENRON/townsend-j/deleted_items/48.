Natural Gas Futures End Up on Short-Covering

    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX  settled up
$0.046 yesterday at $2.25 per MMBtu on funds short covering. The March
contract gained $0.037 to $2.24 per MMBtu. Funds held an all-time high
number of net short positions, 47,104 on January 8th, according to the
CFTC report. Mild weather and huge levels of natural gas in storage
battled with short-covering rallies to keep the market trading in a $0.15
range over the past week, a trend likely to continue until fundamentals
change. Support has been constant at $2.14 per MMBtu, a level that has
been tested in October, the end of November and last week. Expect
resistance to be tested tosday at $2.38 and maybe $2.48 with technical
support at $2.23, $2.14 and then $1.88. In the longer term, declining rig
counts point to natural gas production levels dropping and supply
tightening as the storage excess is worked off this summer. Last week, the
total rig count was 856 compared with 1,121 a year ago. A 25% reduction in
exploration and development programs is expected this
year as companies cut back capital budgets in response to the lower
prices. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally flat to up $0.05 Friday. Natural gas for next day delivery at
the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.32 per MMBtu.

 Lawmaker Accuses Enron Executives of Insider Trading

    Rep John Dingell of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, claims to have pretty strong evidence of insider
trading as well as false accounting in the collapse of Enron. He also says
that there is clear evidence of failure to file honest and correct annual
reports required by the SEC. Dingell says that false accounting appears to
be a very major problem, and it appears that both Enron and Andersen were
involved. Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, has admitted that it
destroyed a number of documents. Some Enron shareholders have filed a
lawsuit accusing Enron executives and directors of unlawful insider
trading and misleading the investing public. The Justice Department is
also investigating. Dingell is one of 188 House of Representative members
who received campaign contributions from Enron.

Employees Letter Warns of Enron's Collapse


    An unidentified employee sent a letter to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay
last summer that alleged the company would implode in a wave of accounting
scandals unless the it changed its accounting practices. The employee also
met with Lay to provide proof. Two congressmen have demanded all records
relating to a review of the employee's allegations, made by outside
attorneys. The employee said that a veil of secrecy surrounded Enron's
partnerships, which moved large amounts of debt off the company's balance
sheets. According to the letter, several senior Enron employees
consistently questioned the company's accounting practices to senior Enron
officials, including CEO Skilling. Enron has hired an outside law firm to
review the charges, but allegedly told the attorneys not to second-guess
accounting advice and not to analyze the questioned transactions in
detail. The law firms review concluded that the questions raised by the
employee did not merit further investigation by independent counsel and
auditors, according to the congressmen. But the review noted that there
was a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation from the
partnership transactions.

Oil Majors Seeking Foothold in Power and Natural Gas Sector

    Oil majors like ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco are looking to expand
their power assets in developing countries and create a stronger presence
in the deregulated North American power market. But, antitrust regulations
could present a road block to more consolidation. Shell and BP have
already entered the growing natural gas and power markets, as backers of
Intercontinental Exchange. Among the majors, Shell has made the most
inroads into the power market with its 68% share of Intergen, a joint
venture with Bechtel. However, Shell has the smallest presence in the
natural gas market of any of the big integrated oil companies. Shell says
it is interested in strengthening its exploration and extraction
activities, and especially its natural gas business, which could also
include acquisitions. In the past 3 years, Shell has only made $6 billion
worth of acquisitions, far less than some competitors. Concerns over
antitrust regulations in the US has led big oil companies to increase
their power assets in developing countries, where demand growth will be
the strongest. ExxonMobil has 6000 MW of power generation capabilities in
China, and is considering other projects in Europe, Asia, Africa and
Central America. An expected switch from oil to cleaner burning fuels has
also provided an incentive for big oil to invest in wind and solar power.
BP is the biggest solar power producer in the world and Shell is actively
involved in the sector. BP Solar has manufacturing plants in the US,
Spain, Australia and India and a 20% market share worldwide. Shell
launched its first commercial US wind power station last year and has
committed to spend up to $1 billion by 2006 on renewables.

Brownell Says FERC Should End El Paso Case

   The FERC should expeditiously wrap up its investigation into whether El
Paso manipulated the California natural gas market last winter to inflate
prices by billions of dollars, according to FERC Commissioner Brownell.
The California PUC, PG&E, and Southern California Edison claim El Paso
withheld capacity on pipelines into the state from November 2000 through
March 2001. El Paso has maintained it is innocent of any wrongdoing.
Brownell says that if there are violations of rules, the rule breakers
should be punished. But, barring such violations, those firms should be
exonerated, she said in a filing with the ALJ overseeing the El Paso case.
The ALJ ruled last October that El Paso did not drive up natural gas
prices on its pipeline into California at a time when the state was
struggling with an energy crisis. But FERC reopened the El Paso
investigation in December, saying the issue needed to be reexamined to
ensure consumers were protected.

a $618 million loss, has caused many to question whether an obstruction of
justice occurred. Thousands of e-mails and other files that might have
shed some light on the events leading up to Enron's bankruptcy were lost,
according to reports. Andersen said that some employees destroyed the
Enron files before the SEC began its investigation. A Senate panel has
issued subpoenas for documents from Enron, Andersen and 49 current and
former officers and directors. Andersen is the subject of a Congressional
investigation, a federal criminal inquiry and lawsuits from shareholders
that may cost it billions of dollars. There has been speculation that
Andersen is considering a merger with another member of the Big 5
accounting firms to prevent its collapse. According to reports, Andersen
supervisors repeatedly reminded employees of the memo prior to the
issuance of subpoenas by the SEC. Enron paid Andersen $25 million last
year for its audit and $27 million for consulting fees and other matters.
In addition, Enron's chief accounting officer and its CFO previously
worked for Andersen. Last year Andersen settled a lawsuit over its
accounting work, which was brought by shareholders of Sunbeam, for $110
million. It also agreed to a $20 million settlement in a class-action
lawsuit stemming from its audit of trash company Waste Management.

Enron Plummets Off PFC 50 Ranking as Russian Majors Move Up

    Other than the September 11th disaster, Enron's collapse is the
biggest story in the capital markets in 2001 and within the PFC 50. Enron,
once ranked as high as 5th among global energy companies, left the natural
gas and power landscape dramatically changed. However, in the midst of the
turmoil in US energy markets, the Russian energy majors clearly emerged as
winners in 2001, surpassing all of the PFC 50 companies in market returns.
Among the Russian companies in the PFC 50, Yukos entered the rankings at
number 38. Gazprom moved up 6 spots to 35. Lukoil and Surgutneftegaz were
at spots 44 and 33 respectively. Conoco and Phillips were the 2 of the
most active players in M&A in the PFC 50 in 2001. Their recent plans to
merge, coupled with the acquisitions of Tosco and Gulf Canada in 2001,
signals the continuing importance of consolidation in the energy sector.
Also, the swap agreement between E.On and BP reinforces the trend of
convergence within industry consolidation. Pending regulatory approval, E
On will increase its share in Ruhrgas to over 32%, and BP will acquire a
51% stake in Veba Oel. From a convergence standpoint, the swap will give E
On added strength in its efforts to expand its natural gas business in
Europe. As a result of Enron's fallout, credit quality for Enron's peers
has been re-assessed and downgraded in some cases. In response to credit
reassessments and poor market performance, companies such as El Paso,
Dynegy, Williams and have initiated capital restructuring programs to
reassure investors, creditors, and rating agencies. Given the credit
watches and budget cutbacks, the PFC 50 report examines which of the
merchant energy companies and utilities are best suited to capture some of
Enron's lost market share. The PFC 50 serves as a reference guide for
international energy companies competing in a changing and converging
landscape. The PFC 50 report is updated quarterly and covers top
performers, M&A, strategies, and business models. Visit www.pfcenergy.com
