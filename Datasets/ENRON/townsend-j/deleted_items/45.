On  November 15, 2001, Texas Eastern Transmission, LP ("Texas  Eastern")
notified firm storage customers that, as required by the Federal  Energy
Regulatory Commission's November 30, 1994 order, in Docket No.  RP95-15,
Texas  Eastern would monitor customer storage activity and  would  issue
customer-specific Operational Flow Orders ("OFOs") prior to the issuance
of a system-wide storage OFO pursuant to Section 4.3  (L) of the General
Terms  and Conditions of Texas Eastern's  FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised
Volume No. 1    ("Tariff").

As indicated in Texas Eastern's November 15, 2001 letter, the need for a
customer  specific  OFO  would be determined based  on  such  customer's
variance  from  the suggested storage withdrawal plan specified  in  the
November  15, 2001 mailing.  The Withdrawal Plan indicates  the  maximum
recommended storage withdrawals for each of four (4) withdrawal  periods
and  is  designed to reflect in the aggregate Texas Eastern's historical
utilization of its storage facilities prior to the implementation of the
Commission's Order No. 636

Texas Eastern is not issuing a Customer-Specific OFO at this time due to
the  high  aggregate storage position at 12/31/2001. Texas Eastern  will
continue to monitor individual customer storage activity and may need to
issue  customer-specific  OFOs  if  required  by  future  circumstances.
Customer-specific OFOs will be based upon each customer's variance  from
the suggested storage withdrawal plan provided to you and the other firm
storage customers by letter dated November 15, 2001.

If  you  have  any  questions  regarding the foregoing  matters,  please
contact your Account Manager.
