Moderating weather conditions on the ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT)
pipeline system will allow a limited amount of Due Shipper pay back to
be available over the weekend.  Shippers should schedule any imbalance
payback with their Operations Account Manager.

Customers that are in a Due Pipe position should be scheduling imbalance
makeup to the pipe through their Operations Account Manager.

All shippers and point operators should endeavor to stay balanced daily.
The opportunity to make up or pay back imbalances is entirely dependent
on the operating conditions of the pipe from day to day.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
