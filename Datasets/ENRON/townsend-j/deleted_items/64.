TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) pipeline system was over scheduled in
the STX, ETX and M1-24 Inch zones.  In order to accommodate firm
volumes, TE cut approximately 150,000 Dths of Preferential/Secondary
nominations exiting this area.

No intra-day nominations for gas leaving these zones or for additional
physical supply will be accepted.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
