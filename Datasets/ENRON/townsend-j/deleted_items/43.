Natural Gas Futures Continue Higher on Short-Covering


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX continued higher
yesterday on more short-covering, gaining $0.041 to $2.291 per MMBtu. The
March contract rose $0.033 to $2.273 per MMBtu. The market opened higher
and traded range-bound bouncing off $2.32 several times as it awaits the
AGA storage report due out this afternoon. Look for a withdrawal about 150
- 160 Bcf reported for last week. Some say that since physical prices
maintained a premium to the NYMEX could be companies buying on the spot
market to keep from pulling stored natural gas that was pumped into the
ground at higher prices. If that is the case, a lower withdrawal and
subsequent price tumble could be in the offing. Physical prices gained
slightly yesterday on nominal cold in the West. Natural gas for next day
delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.03 - $0.07 higher
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.04
to $2.36 per MMBtu.

 EPA to Continue Utility Pollution Lawsuits

     The Bush administration plans to proceed with lawsuits against
several utilities for allegedly violating a Clean Air Act provision that
requires new pollution equipment when a plant is expanded or upgraded. The
Attorney General John says the EPA has a reasonable basis for continuing
the lawsuits initiated during the Clinton administration. In November
1999, the Clinton Justice Department sued many coal fired utilities for
expanding or upgrading plants without installing modern equipment required
to control smog, acid rain and soot. It sought to strictly enforce the
Clean Air Act's new source review rules, which exempt power plants and oil
refineries built before 1977 from installing modern pollution controls
unless major modifications are made to the plants. The industry has
bitterly opposed the pollution rule. It claims the regulations prevented
more refineries and power plants from being expanded or upgraded and
limited energy supplies.

LONGER TERM TRADERS SEEK BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

 "I think that $1.80 to $2.00 is rock solid support, and any long position
you want to put on you do that against $2.00," said John Beaver, president
Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City.  "I really wonder if the market is
ever going to get to $2.00, but if it does get that low I don't think it
will spend much time there. The industry will work through this storage,
the rig count is down, and all those factors. Prices will form a base down
near these levels, and once the storage is worked through, prices will
take off, but it may be July with hurricanes and heat waves," said Beaver.

Andersen Fires Partner in Charge of Enron Audits


    Arthur Andersen has fired the partner in charge of Enron Corp's audits
for ordering the destruction of thousands of e-mails and documents related
to Enron. In addition to the firing of the chief Enron auditor, Andersen
said it will place 3 other partners involved in Enron's accounting on
leave and is relieving 4 other partners of their management
responsibilities. The accounting firm says they will put a new management
team in place in their Houston office. Anderson said that the destruction
of Enron documents at its Houston office was on such a scale and of such a
nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good
judgment were violated. The SEC, Justice Department and Congress are
investigating the disposal of e-mails and documents related to Enron as
part of larger probe of Enron's meltdown. Andersen said the document
destruction ended a day after the SEC subpoenaed Andersen's records. House
Commerce Committee investigators believe the fired partner and others
involved in Enron's audit received approval to destroy documents from
Andersen's headquarters in an October 12th memo. But Anderson denied the
allegation, saying that the partner expedited efforts to destroy documents
without consulting others in the firm. Questions have been raised about
whether Enron-related litigation will exceed Andersen's liability
insurance.

Maine PUC Selects New Standard Offer Power Provider

    The Maine PUC hopes to save standard offer electricity customers
nearly $100 million a year. The PUC said that when market prices fall, as
they have during the past year, they will pass those savings along to
business customers with standard offer service, which is the default
energy supplier for those who have not chosen another provider. The
commission accepted bids for new standard offer prices for medium and
large commercial customers in the Central Maine Power and Bangor
Hydro-Electric service areas. The new prices are 41% to 49% below current
standard offer prices, the PUC said. The new standard offer prices for
Central Maine medium and large commercial customers average about $0.042
per kWh. Bangor Hydro prices average $0.042 per kWh for medium and $0.04
per kWh for large customers. Central Maine is a unit of Energy East and
Bangor Hydro is owned by Canadian company Emera. Large and medium standard
offer customers account for about 30% of the load, or about 6.8 million
MW/h per year. The PUC said it selected a one-year contract period to
ensure standard offer prices are in line with the market while maintaining
the competitiveness of the market. The commission said it would release
the names of the provider selected in 2 weeks to allow supply arrangements
to be completed.

Mirant Shares Continue to Tumble


    Shares of Mirant fell for a 7th consecutive day yesterday, hitting a
record low amid speculation of loss of trading business after its credit
rating was cut to junk status last month. The stock dropped $0.77, down
5.9% to $12.21 per share after earlier dipping to $11.80. It has tumbled
24% since January 4th. Mirant CEO claims the company is still doing strong
business and intends to meet with Moody's this week to discuss the
downgrade. Moody's downgraded Mirant to 'Ba1' its highest junk rating,
from lowest investment grade 'Baa2'. Moody's also says the rating outlook
remained negative. A day after the rating cut, Mirant sold stock, raising
$759 million, and said it will shed assets and cut capital spending by
40%.

Details of Enron - UBS Warburg Agreement


   Enron and UBS Warburg, the investment banking group of UBS, have agreed
to a deal for Enron's North American Gas and electric trading operation
that entitles Enron to a third of the profits generated by the new 'AA+'
rated trading entity. It is a positive deal for Enron and its creditors
that confirms the substantial value of Enron's trading operation. Enron
sees it as the first step among many towards an overall plan of
reorganization and planned emergence from bankruptcy. The deal is for ten
years but allows UBS Warburg a series of options to begin buying out
Enron's royalty interest in the 3rd year of the agreement. UBS Warburg's
calls may be exercised in 3 steps, each representing a third of the
royalty stream. Following the exercise of the first call, the royalty
payment rate will drop from 33% to 22%; following the exercise of the
second call, the royalty payment rate will drop from 22% to 11%.  Upon the
exercise of the third call, the remaining 11% royalty would cease.  The
complete transaction documents is available at: www.enron.com .

Others Scarf Up Enron Market Share

    Duke, Mirant, the Intercontinental Exchange and other energy traders
are taking up the slack created by Enron's bankruptcy. Mirant, BP and
Goldman Sachs are among a consortium of businesses that own ICE, whose
energy trades have climbed by 60% since Enron's problems. ICE's owners
account for 40% of the energy market, double EnronOnline's 20% before it
halted trading. The exchange said trading through its online marketplace
for energy products and metals, jumped to $4.3 billion last week up from
December's record high daily average of $2.5 billion. Mirant has seen its
power and natural gas trades increase about 10% to 15%. Duke said its
energy trading volumes have also risen. Enron once handled about 25% of
electricity and natural gas trades and had $100 billion in revenue in
2000, mainly from energy trading. UBS, the largest Swiss bank, was chosen
to buy Enron's trading business for a share of future profits, no cash up
front and the bank will assume none of Enron's liabilities. Enron hopes
that the UBS deal will revive its trading business.

Wind Industry Sets Records in 2001

    The wind energy industry left previous records in the dust with a
blowout year in 2001, installing nearly 1,700 MW, or $1.7 billion worth of
new generating equipment in 16 states, according to the American Wind
Energy Association. The final tally of 1,694 MW was more than double the
previous record year of 1999, when 732 MW was installed, and boosted the
industry's total generating capacity by more than 60% over the amount in
place a year earlier. Current installed capacity in the US is now 4,258
MW, and there are wind turbine installations in 26 states.  However,
prospects for a repeat in 2002 have been thrown into doubt by the
expiration of a key incentive, the federal wind production tax credit,
which expired December 31st and was not renewed by Congress, due to a
partisan battle over economic stimulus legislation.  Bills to renew the
PTC had strong support in both the House of Representatives and Senate,
AWEA said, but were left unpassed when negotiations between the two
parties on the economic legislation broke down shortly before Christmas.
