Natural Gas Futures Dip Slightly Lower

    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.024
yesterday to $2.048 per MMBtu. The March contract gained $0.001 to $2.09
per MMBtu. The market began the day higher on early short-covering, but
fell off sharply in the afternoon after an extended forecast called for
mild weather across much of the nation. Last week the AGA reported 124 Bcf
of natural gas was withdrawn from storage, leaving about a Tcf more still
in the ground than a year ago. Look for the market to take-out the $2.00
support level soon. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to $0.05 higher yesterday. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.01 to $2.12 per MMBtu. Look for
cash prices to weaken ahead of the weekend, likely leading futures prices
lower as well. With some cold in the Northeast and Midwest, but mild
temperatures forecast for the next two weeks, traders expect to see spot
prices at a discount to futures by the weekend. Turn-back volumes could
also weaken prices. By the end of January storage operators face
requirements to withdraw gas out of storage, the extra volumes hitting the
market could push prices further down.

Enron Creditors Want Andersen Investigation


    Enron's creditors' committee has asked the bankruptcy judge for
permission to investigate Andersen to help it prepare possible legal
action against the accounting firm. The committee wants to force Andersen
officials to testify and turn over documents. It was appointed last month
by the US Trustee's office, an arm of the Justice Department. Creditors,
which are owed $40 billion, are concerned that Enron may be worth less
than they thought. Andersen's CEO sent an auditing expert in his place to
testify yesterday before Congress on the destruction of documents related
to Enron. Another witness, David Duncan, a fired Andersen executive,
invoked his 5th Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refused to
testify at the hearing.

Enron's Top Management Departs


    As Enron struggles to survive, its top executives have been bailing
out. Of the 14 executives named in the company's annual 10-K filing with
the SEC last April, about half are gone. Vice Chairman Mark Frevert said
that he left the company at the end of December and seems uncertain
whether he quit or was fired. Greg Whalley, president and COO, will join
Swiss bank UBS which has acquired Enron's trading unit. Former CEO Jeffrey
Skilling and former Vice Chairman Clifford Baxter left the company last
year and Chairman Kenneth Lay resigned 2 days ago, in what some see as an
attempt to stave off the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee. A trustee
would supersede Enron's top management and its board of directors and
would likely name a new law firm to replace Enron's current bankruptcy
attorneys. A coalition of creditors has petitioned a bankruptcy judge to
appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to run Enron. To have a trustee appointed,
creditors must prove management's actions have been inept or fraudulent.
Document shredding and a suspected cover up of the company's true
financial liabilities could be adequate grounds to name a trustee. Lay's
departure leaves CFO Jeff McMahon and Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of
Enron Global Services in charge of the company for now. Enron plans to
hire a turnaround specialist to run the company until a permanent
replacement is chosen. Three consulting firms that specialize in turning
around failing businesses have been mentioned as possible front-runners.
They are Alvarez & Marsal, Glass & Associates and Zolfo Cooper.

Judge Halts Andersen Shredding


    A federal judge has approved a plan from Enron shareholders to prevent
Andersen from shredding any more documents related to Enron's audits. The
judge ruled that plaintiffs lawyers can start taking depositions in 20
days from Andersen employees who were fired or suspended for the document
shredding. Andersen must also file a report with the judge explaining the
shredding at that time. But Andersen argues that it has not completed its
own investigation into the shredding, and depositions related to the
lawsuit should take a back seat to investigations by Congress, the SEC,
the Justice Department and others. The judge also ruled Andersen can shred
no more documents and that the firm must preserve all Enron-related
documents going back to 1994 and that plaintiffs' lawyers can inspect
them. Andersen attorneys assured the judge that the records are under
guard and shredding has ceased. Andersen has admitted that its Houston
staff shredded a significant but undetermined number of documents related
to Enron audits last fall as federal regulators launched probes into
possible accounting improprieties. The company later fired the head of the
Houston office for his role in the shredding and placed several others on
administrative leave. Attorneys for the plaintiffs' want to depose the
former partner and five others. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against
29 current and former Enron executives and board members for more than $1
billion they gained by selling company stock during a 3-year period prior
its bankruptcy filing. Allegations have emerged that Enron employees
shredded accounting and finance documents as recently as last week. A
hearing on Enron shredding is scheduled for February 5th before federal
bankruptcy judge.

FERC to Hold Closed Meeting to Consider Investigation


     The FERC plans to hold a rare, closed-door meeting next week to
discuss a several issues, including the possible initiation of an
investigation. The private meeting will be held Wednesday, immediately
following FERC's regularly scheduled bi-monthly meeting that is open to
the public. The FERC issued a list of agency officials who will attend the
closed-door discussion of the possible investigation, including Chairman
Wood and the three commissioners, the office of general counsel, staff
with FERC's office of market tariffs, and staff with the office of the
executive director. Other items to be discussed at the closed meeting
include: 1) A demand by a group of natural gas producers in the Gulf of
Mexico that Williams cut its new gathering rates and other fees for
transporting volumes to shore. The producers claim that Williams has
boosted its rate for interruptible gathering by more than 230% since
December 1st; 2) A July complaint by New Power Holdings that PJM
Interconnection's capacity requirements and deficiency charges are unjust,
discriminatory and preferential. New Power wants PJM to change its
existing capacity deficiency rate of $177 per MW day; 3) A case involving
a FERC order last summer that says National Fuel Gas violated the law when
it operated a natural gas well and storage fields in Erie County, New
York, before obtaining authorization.

PSEG to Upgrade Coal Fired Plants in New Jersey


    PSEG has agreed to spend $300 million over 10 years to install
equipment to limit air pollution at its New Jersey coal fired power plants
to bring them into compliance with 'new source' review rules that require
the installation of air pollution equipment when a plant undergoes major
modifications. The agreement settles a complaint brought by the Justice
Department, the EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection. The complaint alleged that PSEG failed to install necessary
pollution controls at two plants. The federal air pollution rule is
currently under review by the White House. Utilities with aging coal-fired
plants contend that the rule requires expensive upgrades which reduces
their ability to produce more energy. PSEG said it would rather resolve
the issue than face protracted and costly litigation. PSEG Power has about
17,000 MW of generation capacity. In 2004, the company will start to
phase-in equipment to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide
and mercury at 3 New Jersey coal-fired plants with a total capacity of
about 1,250 MW, with all work scheduled to be complete by 2012. PSEG will
install selective catalytic reduction and dry scrubber devices, which
remove particulates from exhaust before it is released into the air. The
new technologies will cost about $150 million each.

    KeySpan says 4th quarter net income fell 42% on lower natural gas
prices and expenses related to the sale of a barge business. Net income
declined to $34.4 million, or $0.25 per share, from $58.9 million, or
$0.43 a year earlier. Revenue fell 14% to $1.62 billion from $1.87
billion. KeySpan has agreed to sell its Midland Enterprises barge unit to
closely held Ingram Industries for $230 million in cash and $135 million
in assumed debt. It had expenses last quarter of $30.4 million, or $0.22
per share, related to the sale. KeySpan also wrote off the value of its
investment in natural gas reserves by $31.4 million, or $0.23, because of
lower natural gas prices. KeySpan owns 68% of Houston Exploration. It had
costs of $2.5 million on Roy Kay Cos, a general-contracting business it is
closing. Excluding those losses, KeySpan earned $99 million, or $0.71 per
share. It was expected to earn $0.75. KeySpan cut its 2002 earnings
forecast by $0.20 to $2.50 - $2.65, because it expects less profit from
exploration and production. KeySpan's Vice Chairman and Chief Operating
Officer Craig Matthews will retire, effective March 1st.

Cargill Halts Saltville Natural Gas Storage Expansion

     An planned expansion of a Virginia natural gas storage facility
planned by Duke Energy and NUI has failed to obtain FERC approval because
Cargill filed a complaint. Cargill asked the FERC to issue an order
halting the construction of an expanded salt cavern storage facility
planned for Saltville, Virginia. Duke and NUI formed a joint venture
called Saltville LLC to expand the salt cavern storage to hold 12 Bcf of
working natural gas capacity over the next 3 years. The site currently
stores only 1.1 Bcf. Cargill says that the companies are attempting to
circumvent the jurisdiction of FERC by seeking approval only from Virginia
state regulators even though the gas may be used in interstate commerce.
The expanded Saltville storage site would have a deliverability of up to
550 MMcf per day. The Virginia State Corporation Commission has scheduled
a February 20th hearing on the project.
