Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Late Sell-Off


   Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.043
yesterday to $2.185 per MMBtu, stymied by local and trade selling on the
close. The March contract lost $0.037 to $2.195 per MMBtu. The market
opened higher and hit $2.30 early on the strength of Wednesday's AGA
storage report of a 190 Bcf withdrawal last week, the largest since 1994.
However, the market worked its way lower for most of the day until a
bearish weather forecasts, including a prediction of the return of El
Nino, contributed to a sharp drop off below $2.20 thirty minutes before
the close as paper and trading houses liquidated. The market is in
contango, with each succeeding contract more expensive. The price for the
February contract has fallen more than $0.55 since assuming the prompt
position on December 28th. Look for more weakness today as the
fundamentals deteriorate. Storage and weather are the keys to this whole
market, and both are bearish. Look for the market to test weekly lows at
$2.14 today. Yesterday, an estimated 83,000 contracts trading, with 41,000
spreads or hedge trades. Few utilities were seen in the physical market
yesterday, and prices held a $0.04 - $0.05 premium to the NYMEX, well
below the $0.12 premium seen Wednesday. As weather moderates, utilities
tend to switch off storage and turn to the physical market for natural gas
needs, creating a price squeeze in some markets as that extra supply
dwindles. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally flat to up slightly. Natural gas for next day delivery at the
Henry Hub gained $0.01 to $2.32 per MMBtu.

 New Energy Argus Regional Heating and Cooling Demand Measurements

    The market for weather derivatives received a boost this week with the
creation of new statistical instruments that measure heating and cooling
demand throughout the US. The exclusive indices from Energy Argus
represent seasonal weather in the US sliced 47 different ways: by major
natural gas pipeline, power trading hub or Federal Reserve region. The
indices were created through analysis of the  weather market and
discussions with its top participants, including energy traders and
marketers, utilities, insurance and financial service firms. The trading
of weather involves buying and selling options and other derivatives to
protect against fluctuating temperatures or precipitation. Weekly updates
of the indices can now be found in Weekly Weather Plays, dedicated to the
market for weather derivatives. The Energy Argus publication, launched
this week, is also the provider of independent market assessments for the
most popular weather transactions, and features key information for

Open Season for Desert Crossing Pipeline


    Allegheny Energy Supply, the Salt River Project, and Sempra Energy
Resources which are planning to build a natural gas storage and pipeline
system in the Southwest are taking bids from companies for capacity
through the system. The open season will last until February 8th, and will
gauge industry interest in the proposed Desert Crossing project.  The
response will determine the scope of the system, whose initial costs are
likely to be $600 - $700 million. The Desert Crossing project, pending
regulatory approval, would include a 10 Bcf natural gas storage complex in
Arizona and an 800 MMcf per day pipeline running from near Las Vegas to
southwestern Arizona. The 300-mile pipeline system would connect the
storage complex with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in
Arizona and southern Nevada. The pipeline is expected to be ready for
operation by the summer of 2004, while the storage facility would begin
incremental service in 2005 with full service forecast in early 2008. The
storage complex would allow hourly access to natural gas, permitting
customers to tap supplies to meet unexpected surges in demand from power
plants.

Enron Considers Bids for Trading Business at Auction


    Enron is negotiating with at least 6 potential buyers of its wholesale
trading business at an auction. The winning bidder will assume control of
51% of Enron's online trading unit, which generated about 90% of the
company's $100.8 billion in revenue in 2000. A hearing is scheduled for
today to approve the sale. Enron is met with the bidders in six conference
rooms in its New York law offices, going from room to room making comments
to the effect that if you want to have the best offer you at least have to
make the following improvements to your bid. Every bidder had a different
offer and some proposals are more complete than others. Enron's trading
unit buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity,
metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and
derivatives. Enron would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership
called 'Netco' under the proposed sale. Citigroup has submitted a bid, and
UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, also made an offer. BP has offered $25
million for Enron computer systems for trading natural gas and
electricity. The banks hope to profit from as much as $7 billion in
previously arranged trades and gain a better shot at collecting money they
are owed by Enron. Bids might total as much as $1 billion in cash and
debt.

Andersen Disposed of Enron Documents


    Enron's accounting firm, Andersen, has admitted its employees disposed
of or deleted a number of documents related to its audit of Enron.
Andersen, which has come under fire from investors and lawmakers for
signing off on Enron's books, said it had notified the SEC, the Justice
Department and congressional committees and other agencies investigating
Enron's collapse. In recent months individuals in the accounting firm
involved with the Enron engagement disposed of a significant but
undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence
relating to the Enron engagement. The SEC's enforcement chief says that
the destruction of documents was an extremely serious matter. In testimony
before Congress last month, Andersen CEO said it had warned Enron of
possible illegal acts, but said it had failed to provide the auditor with
key information. Some industry experts say the deliberate destruction of
key document can be tantamount to an admission of guilt. The ramifications
could be huge. Most accounting firms keep their audit records for at least
4 years. Anderson says it has suspended its records management policy
immediately and has instructed all its partners and employees to retain
all existing documents until further notice.

Lay Called Cabinet Members to Warn of Possible Bankruptcy


   Enron Chairman Lay called the secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce
departments prior to the company's collapse to warn them the company could
be in financial trouble or go bankrupt. In the call to the Treasury
secretary, Lay referenced Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that
got a $3.5 billion bailout from Wall Street which was engineered by the
Federal Reserve. Lay informed the secretary of Enron's problems and raised
the possibility that they may have an effect on credit markets similar to
that of LTCM. The secretary told Lay that he would pass the information on
to officials at Treasury who found no signs of ripple effects. Lay told
the Commerce secretary that he was worried that the decision to downgrade
Enron's bond rating would lead to bankruptcy, with harmful effects to the
energy industry and the economy as a whole. After Lays calls, the cabinet
members both agreed that no action should be taken to intervene on the
part of bondholders. Neither informed the president of their conversations

California AG Files Civil Lawsuit Against PG&E


    California's attorney general has filed a civil suit against PG&E, the
parent company of the states Pacific Gas and Electric utility, alleging
its fraudulent business practices drove the utility into bankruptcy. The
lawsuit asks for damages of $600 million to $4 billion and any other
penalties that might be awarded. The state's attorney general contends
that PG&E drained the assets of its California utility, saying that money
went from the utility to the parent company and then to unregulated PG&E
units. PG&E said that the lawsuit was unwarranted, discriminatory and
potentially harmful to the California economy. The company pointed out
that the PUC and state lawmakers have reviewed its transactions with
affiliates and found no illegalities. The attorney general charges that
PG&E violated 22 conditions set by the PUC to protect customers from the
potential risks and abuses of a holding company structure. According to
the conditions, PG&E was prohibited from using money from the utility to
fund its unregulated businesses and was directed to give first priority to
the utility's need for capital in the event it experienced financial
difficulties. The AG claims that during a 3-4 year period, the utility
gave more than $4.6 billion in cash to PG&E, $1.76 billion in shareholder
dividends and stock buybacks.
