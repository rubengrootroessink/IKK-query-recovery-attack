Weather forecasts would indicate low demand conditions through the
Thanksgiving Holiday's.  TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) is facing high
line pack levels and full storage.  Thus the pipe has severely
restricted ability to absorb due-shipper gas.  Effective immediately,
and continuing through the end of the month, TE is requiring that:
     -    All shippers ensure their physical receipts do not exceed  physical
       deliveries.
     -    Receipt operators are expected to not flow above scheduled volumes.
     -    Delivery meters are expected to take all gas scheduled.
     -    Any customer who is long should take immediate action to resolve
       due-shipper positions.

No due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled. OBA parties should ensure
that physical takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper makeup gas
may be scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.  These
restrictions are expected to be in effect until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
