TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) pipeline system was over scheduled on
the 24 inch system between Longview Compressor Station and Fagus
Compressor Station for the weekend. As a result, TE restricted receipts
between Longview and Pollard to the capacity that may move up the 24-
inch system. No intra-day nominations for gas leaving this area or for
additional physical supply will be accepted.  These restrictions will be
effective gas day January 26, 2002 and remain in place throughout the
weekend.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
