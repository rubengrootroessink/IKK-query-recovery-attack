 Latest NBA Player News=20

 Terry Mills , F IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Mills was placed on the injured list by the Pacers on Wednesday with a=20
sprained right ankle. In four games this season, Mills has averaged 2.5=20
points and 1.5 rebounds for the Pacers. He has no Fantasy value. =20

 Bruno Sundov , C IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Sundov was activated from the injured list by the Indiana Pacers on Tuesda=
y.=20
He averaged 2.3 points and 1.0 rebounds in three games this season. Don't=
=20
bother wondering if he has any Fantasy value - Sundov will likely spend mos=
t=20
of his time on the Pacers' bench.  =20

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Walker has been activated from the injured list by the San Antonio Spurs. =

nine games this season, Walker averaged 2.1 points and 2.2 rebounds per gam=
e.=20
He has no Fantasy value.  =20

 Shawnelle Scott , C SA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Scott was placed on the injured list by the Spurs with tendinitis in his=
=20
left knee. In just four games this season, Scott posted a total of three=20
points and eight rebounds. Don't expect any type of Fantasy production from=
=20
Scott this season.  =20

 Kelvin Cato , C HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Cato joined the team in San Francisco and will practice Wednesday.  He is=
=20
not expected to be activated for Thursday's game with the Warriors but expe=
ct=20
him to return befor next week.  Cato is a good rebounder  and shot blocker=
=20
but he doesn't play enough to have value in smaller Fantasy leagues.     =
=20

 Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Richardson missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is=
=20
listed as day-to-day. Richardson has played well since Tyrone Nesby was=20
traded to Washington, but his Fantasy value is still very questionable. Kee=
p=20
track of  Richardson to see if he can post any consistent numbers before=20
considering him for your roster.  =20

 Darius Miles , F LAC - Farragut Academy Updated 12/13/00=20
 Miles missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is liste=
d=20
as day-to-day. The rookie has averaged only 6.2 points per game thus far, a=
nd=20
has no real Fantasy value at this point in the season.  =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/13/00=20
 Bryant jammed his right little finger on a dunk during Tuesday night's los=
s=20
to the Bucks. He continued to play with his finger wrapped, finishing the=
=20
game with 25 points on only 8-of-31 shooting. The diagnosis on the finger w=
as=20
only a sprain, and X-rays were negative. The injury doesn't figure to slow=
=20
down Bryant, who has become one of the strongest players in the world of=20
Fantasy this year.   =20

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Sura did not dress for Tuesday night's game against the Blazers. He is=20
battling a strained left hamstring, and is listed as day-to-day due to the=
=20
injury. Sura has averaged 8.5 points and 5.5 assists through his first 11=
=20
games. The former Florida State star does have some Fantasy value, especial=
ly=20
in deeper leagues, but don't expect a double-digit scoring average like the=
=20
one he posted a year ago in Cleveland.   =20

 Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Head Coach Tim Floyd said that Miller could return from his broken hand as=
=20
early as next Tuesday against Indiana. A more likely scenario, however, wou=
ld=20
have Miller coming back on Dec. 21 in Orlando. Miller, who has missed 17=20
games thus far, was averaging 6.0 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. With th=
e=20
lack of talent at center, Miller could be useful to those Fantasy owners in=
=20
deeper leagues.    =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/13/00=20
 Coleman returned to practice this week and looked good during workouts,=20
according to Head Coach Paul Silas. "He's moving, practicing and running th=
e=20
court well," said Silas. The Hornets hope to have Coleman back for their=20
six-game West Coast road trip beginning on Dec. 28. Coleman does have some=
=20
Fantasy value, but don't expect his numbers to equal his 1999-'00 totals=20
until he gets back into playing shape.  =20

 Bryce Drew , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Drew, who has been sidelined with a strained hamstring, participated in hi=
s=20
first full practice on Tuesday and may return to the Bulls in time for Frid=
ay=20
night's game against Atlanta. Drew had averaged six points in four games=20
before going on the injured list on Nov. 11. With a number of point guards =
on=20
the Bulls' roster, minutes are likely to be spread around, which decreases=
=20
Drew's Fantasy value significantly. He isn't worth a roster spot at this=20
point. =20

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Thorpe, who has been out the last month with a foot injury, was activated=
=20
for Wednesday's game against Sacramento. The veteran has very little Fantas=
y=20
value, especially on a very talented Charlotte frontcourt.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/13/00=20
 After a successful return to the court on Monday night, Hill may have take=
n=20
a step back during Wednesday night's loss to the Supersonics. He left the=
=20
game with 1:39 remaining because of discomfort in his ankle, the same ankle=
=20
which has hampered him all season long. "My ankle felt good in the first=20
quarter, but as we got into the third and fourth quarters, it got sore," sa=
id=20
Hill. "It was hurting a lot and I was a liability out there for our=20
ballclub." His status for Orlando's game against Portland on Friday night i=
s=20
uncertain. The news can't be encouraging to Fantasy owners who have Hill on=
=20
their roster, especially if he can't play effectively on a nightly basis.  =
 =20

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed rig=
ht=20
ankle. The veteran has averaged 12.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 15 games th=
is=20
season. Mills does have some Fantasy value, especially in deeper leagues, s=
o=20
keep him on the bench unless you can find an adequate replacement on the=20
waiver wire.   =20

 Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game again=
st=20
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair to=
rn=20
ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4=20
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy=20
value at this point. =20

 Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle=
=20
and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has n=
o=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00=20
 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of=
=20
his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host=
=20
Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2=
=20
assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a=
=20
great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington.  =20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00=20
 Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a=20
injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close =
to=20
100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night.=
=20
Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be hap=
py=20
that they did - Golden State's frontcourt has been decimated by injuries an=
d=20
will be easy prey for Wallace.  =20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He =
is=20
scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligib=
le=20
to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2=20
rebounds per game this season, and has marginal value in the world of=20
Fantasy.  =20

 James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's=
=20
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.=
=20
"The team got together and discussed some things," said Posey, "and=20
(protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)." Reports out of Denver sa=
y=20
that the probems between the coach and his players escolated when Issel=20
ripped Nuggets' center Raef LaFrentz after a recent loss to the Boston=20
Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a=
=20
night of production from some of their Denver players.  =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The=
=20
Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right kne=
e,=20
and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. T=
he=20
Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for=
=20
their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point,=
=20
neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.  =20

 Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. "The=20
shoulder's still attached to my body," said Henderson. "No question I'll=20
play."  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one o=
f=20
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=
=20
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=
s=20
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a=
=20
smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=
e=20
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's=20
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth=
 a=20
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=
=20
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wi=
se=20
to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viab=
le=20
alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =
=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=
ds=20
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=
r=20
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coac=
h=20
Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.=
=20
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once=
=20
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury =
-=20
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their=
=20
lineup.   =20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =
to=20
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=

$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy=
