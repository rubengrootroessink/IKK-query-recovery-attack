Phillip and Kam

I put together spreadsheets summarizing the variances for Enron Canada 
purchases and sales for the Ontario region for August and it looks like we 
have a similar situation to July in that there are two liquidations on the 
purchase side that don't reference any particular Sitara deal that are 
directly offset in the liquidations for Transcanada Pipeline sales.  If we 
net these two liquidations, it significantly reduces both variances.  The 
Taggs are N63076.8 and 2 and N63076.C and 6.  



Thanks,
Cathy
