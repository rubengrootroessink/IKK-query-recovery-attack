The tagg number for the january piece is QP7914.  This deal was put in after 
the fact - Feb.  so, we will have a variance in January that should be offset 
in February.  This is due to the information not getting to us in time to 
change the customer price in Sitara before we flashed Jan.  The sitara number 
that this all relates to is 543246.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.
