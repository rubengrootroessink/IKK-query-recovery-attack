Aurora N65007.2 0008 lone liquidation belongs to sitara #307241.  We should 
have had a form on this.  The deal came to the desk at mid and would require 
a liquidation.  You should have a variance on your compare reports.  If not, 
please have settlements get you a copy of the invoice for 0008 and we will do 
a form.  Thanks.
