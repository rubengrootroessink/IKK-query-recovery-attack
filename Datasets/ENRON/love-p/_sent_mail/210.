Please use the following two files as your detail support for finanical 
liquidations:


Previously, I believe you were given the capacity hedges file the 
pricebasisindex file and the pricebasisindex_revised file.  All three of 
these equalled the 3.7 million.  You should use the revised and the capacity 
hedge file.  When you use the two files listed above, you will come up with a 
variance going the other way of roughly $(817,385).  This amount should be a 
"desk adjustment".  We have accounted for the variance in our current month 
(0800) file and will simply reclass between the months.  Please shout with 
any questions.
