How are things going with you?  Great I hope.  My mom wanted me to pass this 
on to you and see if you guys might have anywhere for him to fit. She says 
hello and feel free to contact her  at the email address below or 
281-283-3196.  I am also going to try and get this kid an interview in my 
group.  Talk to you soon.

This is Mike Wolfe's son.  He graduates this semester from Texas Tech and is
moving back here to help his father since his mother passed away a few
months ago.  Kevin says he is a good kid and very smart.  Could you give it
Ashley or someone else at Enron.

Thanks <<Jerrsum2.doc>>
