The price is $5.40 canadian dollars as referenced on TAGG #NI7771.2.  Due to 
TAGG constraints, the deal had to be booked as two legs in tagg to capture 
the canadian price.

I left Bob a message last week and again today that teh Utilicorp price is 
right in sitara and tagg, the confirm should have gone out at IF Ventura + 
.1825.  My understanding from the conversation with Bob was that the confirm 
had not gone out yet, however, the trader got a phone call today that the 
deal got confirmed at the wrong price.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Hi Philip,

Is the price for Deal NI7771 5.40 or Index because TAGG = 0 and Sitara = 5.40.
Please advise.

Also, Bob Bowen has spoken with you on Friday regarding a confirmation that 
was sent with the wrong price, counterparty is Utilicorp.
Has the price been updated in the system and could you forward me the deal 
number and I will revise and re-send?

Thanks
Jennifer
