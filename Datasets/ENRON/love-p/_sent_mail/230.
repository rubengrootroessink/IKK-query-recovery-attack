I was able to change the first deal in Sitara, but the other pricing request 
I did not feel comfortable making any changes.  Would you please look at this 
pricing issue for Client Services since they need to get it paid on Monday.

Please correct the following deals:

Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is 
due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by 
$70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, 
it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The 
Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.


Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side 
that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We 
have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, 
I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:

ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50
            Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,067.50
                                                                        
Enron Canada Books:

            Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00
  Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,501.00

I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in 
SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA 
purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at 
posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday.


Thanks, Jane
