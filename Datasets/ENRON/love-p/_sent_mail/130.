I agree with you.  We are going skiing in January.  If ya'll want to come or 
come to a football game in the fall.  I am not sure if we can make it out 
there before the end of the year.  I have spoken for all of my vacation 
days.  Did you see the sorry Astros released Cami today?  The man gave up all 
of that cash for us and is sitting in rehab for dependency and we walk out 
him.  Typical Drayton McClain.  Talk to you tomorrow.
