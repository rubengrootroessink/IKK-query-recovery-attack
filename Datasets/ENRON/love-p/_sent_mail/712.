Can either of the two distinguished Jim's from accounting help me with a 
financial liquidation problem from 0007.  I have a deal NR2989.1 that is 
showing up in my actuals for the beloved FRED file for this production 
month.  When I look at the deal in TAGG, the deal is an annuity booked to 
NG-Price.  I do not believe this should be in the central region.  Any 
assistance in clearing this is much appreciated due to the fun meeting we had 
yesterday regarding financial liquidations.  Thanks for your help guys.  
Cathy this should clear/address all of our issues in 0007 for fin. liq.
