Hi guys,

Because of the EOL group putting in language to automatically flip deals to 
the P& book as soon as they are booked, the number of deals to be flipped at 
the end of the month has decreased quite a lot, but there are always some 
stragglers that are left behind.  Here is what I've come across.  Could you 
please flip these deals before the end of the week.

FT-EAST



FT-ONTARIO



G-DAILY-EST



GD-CENTRAL



As far as I know, these are the only deals that still need to be flipped.  
I've gone through all the other books that I could
think of, but I might have missed some.  Could you please make sure that I'm 
not missing any deals.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this, and please let me know 
when these have been flipped.

Thanks for all your help again.

Stacey
