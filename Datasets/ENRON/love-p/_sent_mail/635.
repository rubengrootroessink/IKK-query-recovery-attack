Due to the significant amount of activity on EnronOnline, and the large 
number of users logged into the system during peak trading hours, please 
inform your respective teams that they should not use the EnronOnline 
applications (Reports, Product Manger, Profile Manager, and Data Manager) 
between the hours of 7:30am and 10:00am.  Only those actions that are 
absolutely critical should be performed (i.e. credit headroom adjustments, 
etc.).  

The IT group is reviewing the database in an attempt to make our queries more 
efficient, but until further notice, these guidelines should be followed.

Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks-
Sheri
