I looked into these deal and I have good reason to believe they should have 
been flashed by economics under CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE.  They will fall out as 
a lone liquidation on the COMPARE REPORT, but only because CPR PIPELINE 
EXCHANGE, while flashed on the desk is not included in the CPR detail for the 
COMPARE REPORT.  They should be offset by the flashed detail or they should 
be put into the economics section as an adjustment to the desk.
