Subject: Fwd:FW: drug recall



I don't know if this is true but I know I am going to check it out for
myself.

Subject: all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine are being recalled

A friend sent this to me and I just wanted to pass it on. I know I'm going
to clean out my medicine chest. Before I forwarded this message to anyone I

wanted to make sure that the information was true.  I checked with Rachel's

pediatrician and she verified that all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine

are being recalled. I also happened to be at CVS Pharmacy and they have a
sign stating that all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine have been pulled

from their shelves.

You  may want to try calling the 800 number listed on most drug boxes and
inquire about a refund.

Please read this carefully, as I know that some of you use some of these
drugs (Alka Seltzer Plus for one).  Also, please pass this on to everyone
you know.

Stop taking anything containing this ingredient. It has been linked to
increased hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in brain) among women ages 18-49 in
the three days after starting use of medication. Problems were not found in

men, but the FDA recommended that everyone (even children) seek
alternative medicine. The following medications contain
Phenylpropanolamine:

Acutrim Diet Gum Appetite Suppressant Plus Dietary Supplements
Acutrim Maximum Strength Appetite Control
Alka-Seltzer Plus Children's Cold Medicine Effervescent

I just found out and called the 800# for Triaminic and they
informed me that they are voluntarily recalling the following medicines
because of a certain ingredient that is causing strokes and seizures
in children.

Orange 3D Cold & Allergy
Cherry (Pink) 3D Cold & Cough
Berry 3D Cough Relief
Yellow 3D Expectorant

They are asking you to call them at 800-548-3708 with the lot number on the

box so they can send you postage for you to send it back to them, and they
will also issue you a refund.

If you know of anyone else with small children, please pass this on.
