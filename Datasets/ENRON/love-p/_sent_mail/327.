Per your request, attached is the hedge strip file that we use to calculate 
your bench every night.  On one of the tabs R2, you will find your positions 
and a conversion factor.  I have tied these to the benchmark groups 
conversion factor numbers.  Let me know if we need some of these points 
changed, i.e. CGPR-DAWN's conversion factor is 0.  Shout with any questions.  
Thanks.
