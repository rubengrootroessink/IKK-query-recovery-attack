True or not, I can't say, but the thought itself is chilling.

>This is how it works.  If by some means you have been separated with your

>Adam&quot; (missing child in the store) over the
>intercom system followed by a description of the child (height, weight,
>hair
>color, age, name, etc).

>When that page goes out all the exits are immediately guarded, and/or

>So if ever you are separated from your child now you know what to do.
