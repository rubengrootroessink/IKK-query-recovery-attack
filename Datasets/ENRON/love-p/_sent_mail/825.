Can we go ahead and take the unexplained amount (numbers at the bottom of 
your schedule) for Ontario thru 0008.  It appears that the number will be 
roughly 25K in income, making the number 255K unexplained and that will be 
for the months 0009-0011.

Can we also do the same on Central through 0006, this will be roughly 56K in 
expenses.  This will clean up that as well.

Please shout if there are any problems.  Thanks.
