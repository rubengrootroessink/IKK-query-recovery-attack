Can you take a look at this and let me know what we officialized instead of 
these.

Subject: February 2001 Official Post IDs

Phillip,

Each month we (in accounting) pull the forward detail for the post ids which 
were officialized at month end.  For February 2001, these post ids are on the 
Report page in the FT Intra Ontario file but they are not officialized in 
RunM:

1054684
1054685
1054686
1054689

Were there other post ids which were officialized for these particular 
rolls?  If not, would you please officialize these so I can pull them.

Best regards,

Rachel
