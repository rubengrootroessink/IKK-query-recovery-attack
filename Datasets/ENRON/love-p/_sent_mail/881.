Please send me more information on book G5.  The person that runs that book, 
FTOC, is not aware of this book.  Please send me the book name and we will 
try and track it down.  

FYI, please send all future Central desk/Ontario desk inquires to me.  Kam 
has moved to the East desk and I am now the lead for the Central.

Thanks for your help.
