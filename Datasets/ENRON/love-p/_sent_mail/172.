I don't know if you are working any this week, but I will send an email any 
way.  We were wondering what there might be to do in Denver on Friday?  Since 
we have all day, are there musuems or things unique to Denver to see?  I know 
there is some luncheon on Friday, is that for couples or just girls?  Wasn't 
really sure.  We get in about we land on Thursday at 5 p.m. and her 
grandmother lands at 6 p.m. so we should be at the hotel by around 6:45.  
Should we call your room or meet you somewhere?  Talk to you soon.
