WHat time are you coming to Jock's & Jill's tomorrow?  I will be there around 
11 a.m.  Are you doing anything tomorrow night?  I hear the Gold club 
calling.  I am staying at the Holiday Inn at the Airport.  There is also a 
big boxing match tomorrow night - Vargas and Trinidad - should be a dandy.
