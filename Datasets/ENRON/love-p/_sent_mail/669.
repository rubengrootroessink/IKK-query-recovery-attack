I think Ashley sent Fab some info on the fest.  We have had to lock into the 
rooms last week, so I do not know if we will be able to help her get a room 
unless they still have some available when she makes a decision.  

Sorry to hear about your work life stinking.  I definitely know the feeling.  
The way I rationalize it is that I will take a job that has better hours 
before Jackson gets into school.  

On a happier note, we are going to dinner with your parents this weekend.  
Should be fun.  Talk to you soon - don't work too hard.

Hey Phillip.....I am on a plane back to St. Paul (Sunday night).  My life
completely (other than Jason and Drew) sucks right now.  I can not wait
until this project is done and over with.  I have reached the point of
thinking about quitting.  Funny how only 5 weeks ago my career counselor
asked me regarding that same question...and I had zero intention.

Anyhow, I spoke with Fabiola..and she is still interested in coming out to
Jazz Fest....and was curious in speaking with you and/or Ashley about
rooms.  She is not 100%...but is curious in talking with you re:
possibilities.  Her email is fabiola_rock@hotmail.com...and her cell number
is 617-515-6760.

Give the little one love for me...
