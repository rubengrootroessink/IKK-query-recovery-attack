Who in the hell is getting married in Cabo? That sure is different.  You will 
have to go to Jazz fest with us next year.  Just let me know.  We reserve the 
extra rooms around Jan. and have to pay for them by Feb. 15th.  How is your 
new job going?  I am staying too damn busy here, Darron got me in all kinds 
of trouble.  See you in Vegas.
