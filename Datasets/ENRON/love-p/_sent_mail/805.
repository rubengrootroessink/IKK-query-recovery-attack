FYI, please also know that if the change is simply a meter change, that does 
not effect the value.  Only the Pipeline and trading zone will effect the 
value.
Thanks again.

Subject: changing deal locations

I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me 
when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case 
yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal 
and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics 
corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the 
locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will 
then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are 
different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could 
potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem 
pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing 
deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make 
the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first 
place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in 
cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks.
PL
