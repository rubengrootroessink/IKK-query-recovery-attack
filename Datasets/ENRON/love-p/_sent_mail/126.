Yeah man, tell me about that crazy night before.  You know us married guys 
have to live vicariously through our single friends.  Next time you are 
headed this way, please do give me a shout, we will have to get together and 
catch up.  We can shoot a little pool at my house or go out to a bar.  Good 
luck with the financing, please keep me informed.  Thanks for the nice 
thoughts, same goes from me bro, I have been thinking about you for some time 
and hoping things were going well, I am glad they are going well.
PL

Funny, somebody else sent me the same e-mail, actually my ex-girlfriend.
How are you?  I don't think I mentioned that it was a tru pleasure to see
you, hug you, meet your lady, and re-experience the energy I get from being
in your company.  I'm very happy for you and where life is.  Now that I know
you're local, I'll e-mail you before I come down next time so we can
hopefully hang or where I can at least pop by.  I'd love to play with the
little one.  Allright bro, just wanted to share that with you,

Much love,

Tarek
 P.S. Tell Dawn I was disappointed I didn't get to see her.  By the way I
gotta tell ya sometime about the night before the reunion, it was rather
wild.  Also, keep your fingers crossed, we will have an answer on financing
for the after-hours joint by next Fri, everything is in.
