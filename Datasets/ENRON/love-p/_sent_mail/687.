I am meeting monthly with each person in my group to go over their training 
plans and get feedback on things they would like assistance with.  I need to 
still meet with Souad for this month and need to get with Anna and go over 
the information that I have given her.  One thing that seems to have come up 
several times is the desire to continue the brown bag sessions.  Some topics 
that have come up are OA and  curve mapping.  I have talked with Kam about 
this and we are going to try and put something together.
