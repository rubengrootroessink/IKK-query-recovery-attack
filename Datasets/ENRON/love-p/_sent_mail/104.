I understand Mick's point of view...So for everyone, I will also share my 
day...Get out of bed, shower, brush teeth, comb hair, don't forget that 
deodrant(that's both arms)...Take the bus..book deals til 5 p.m. and calc 
three books....Get the point.  We are all busy, welcome to Enron.  I think 
the point of the message, which I think should be directed at a few 
individuals that have shown a pattern..DON'T COMMITT YOURSELF TO SOMETHING 
YOU DO NOT INTEND TO DELIVER UPON.
