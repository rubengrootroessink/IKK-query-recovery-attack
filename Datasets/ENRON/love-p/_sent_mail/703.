0011 Lone liquidation variances:
CES-Dynegy - these tagg numbers are EFP deals and we had variances show up in 
forms and we should have used these to clear.
ECS - this tagg number has a sitara deal - 309408 that did not flow.  The gas 
that was suppossed to flow on this deal, flowed on 310637 - Northern 
Natural.  This tagg should be part of that variance for settlements. 
Reliant Energy - that is a synthetic storage deal that flowed, sitara 
#456560, again, no variance to the desk.
Move WPL variance to its own line and we will take the remaining variance to 
the desk.

Let me know if you need further info on this category.
