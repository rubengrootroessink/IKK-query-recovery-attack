LTC Dowling, 
I will do everything I can to get you to Houston, for selfish reasons.  I 
know if you move here, there is a good chance my Dad will follow you.  Thanks 
for the info and if you see a position on the website that I miss, just let 
me know and I will get your resume down there.  Have a good weekend.
Phillip
