He led the nation last year -JUCO- in rushing and touchdowns and was JUCO 
player of the year.  He went to Butler JUCO and led them to a national 
championship.  In the national championship game, he had 300 yards and 7 
touchdowns.  He has 3 touchdowns so far this year over 70 yards.  He is a 
welcome addition to our poor running game.
