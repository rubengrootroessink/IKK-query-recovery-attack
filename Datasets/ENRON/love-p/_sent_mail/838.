Phillip,
The Price Report file will display the information in the same columns as it 
does on the site, so the format  should be the same.  I don't think it is a 
problem to get it to the O:/ drive by 2:30.  The price reports will start 
going to the folder on Monday, February 5.  

To make things easier for now, is there a folder that you already have access 
to on the O:/ drive that we can have this file sent to everyday?  Please let 
me know when you get a chance, so we can get that folder name into the 
scripts.

Thanks.
Julie

Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I 
have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the 
curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve 
file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. 
everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help.
