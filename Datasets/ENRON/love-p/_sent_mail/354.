It was great to hear from you.  Things are going well for me at Enron. I am 
on the trading floor working with the natural gas traders.  The work is fast 
paced and very educational.  

How is your family doing?  I hope it is still expanding with recent grand 
children.

I was sorry to hear of your leaving NSF.  They are definitely going to miss 
your expertise and committment.  I am sure however, that you are exciting 
about the "time off".  

Please stay in touch and if you are ever passing through Houston, please look 
me up.  I look forward to talking with you soon.

PL
