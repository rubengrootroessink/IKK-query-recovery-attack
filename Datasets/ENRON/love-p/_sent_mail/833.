Sounds good to me.  We just wanted to invite you guys anyway.  We look 
forward to seeing you in April.

My grandfather actually passed away on Thursday afternoon and we had the 
funeral on Saturday.  I had to give the eulogy and boy was it difficult.  I 
bet a stood there for 1 minute without saying a word, unable to hold my 
emotions.  I hope I never have to do that again.  Thanks for your thoughts.  
I actually had a dream this morning about talking to you about it.  Wild huh?

Talk to you soon.

Hey Phillip-

I talked with Jason...and I think we have to lean towards not this year.
We (Jason, Drew, I) are coming home for Easter weekend (April 15) and
staying for appx. 5 days.  We can probably only do one....and have already
promised Drew that we would take him to Houston (he's never been).  If I
were single, or w/o child I would be all over it!!

Hope everything turns out ok in Alabama....I'm thinking of you.

Rach

Thanks.  I think we have everything covered.  We are taking Jackson, I
believe everyone else is leaving their kids at home.  If you guys want to
bring Drew, we have no problem with that, there however won't be any other
kids his age to play with.  Talk to you next week.
