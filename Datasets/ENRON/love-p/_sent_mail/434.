Dawn said I need to email you with eol id changes. We have two traders on the 
central desk who are changing book names effective sunday.  Kruscitti needs 
his log in -ADM96645 moved from Ft-int-cen-mkt to ft-cent.  Joe Parks needs 
his id - ADM13230 moved from ft-intra-gulf2.  Please shout with any questions 
or if you need additional information.  Sorry for the short notice, I just 
found out.
