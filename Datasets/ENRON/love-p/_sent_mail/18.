Could you please change the curve mappings on a type of trade for Robyn 
Menear.  THe trade is a GD Index swap for out months.  THe product type is US 
GAS Basis - GD/M Trunk WLA.  This is currently being mapped to a GDP curve 
adn we need it changed to TRUNKL/WLA-GD.  Robyn sets this curve everyday as a 
basis curve.  Thanks.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to shout.
