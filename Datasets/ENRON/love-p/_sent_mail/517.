Subject: duplicate deals

Tagg is currently working on a situation where the bridge is creating 
duplicate deals.  This started yesterday and we contacted the appropriate 
books to kill the duplicate deal.  Yesterday, there were a total of eight 
deals duplicating, so far today there are six.  They have narrowed down the 
problem and Mike Swaim and Oscar Rivera think it should be resolved this 
afternoon.  

Meanwhile, Oscar is running a query that will let us know the duplicate 
deals.  He will run this throughout the day and I will e-mail you the deals.  
Listed below in Bold is the duplicate deals from today (two are from late 
last night).  I have placed the risk book next to the deals.  Please forward 
this to the appropriate people in your group.  I was not sure who runs the 
Singapore book, if London could let me know I would appreciate it.

I will keep you updated on the progress.  Sorry for any inconvenience this 
may be causing.  Feel free to call me if you would like more information.

Thanks,
Dawn
