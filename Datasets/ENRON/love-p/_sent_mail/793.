Anthony Mix
6'5", 222 Pounds
Wide Receiver
Baldwin County High School
Also plays center on the high school basketball team

Runs the 100m in 10.64

Chose Auburn over Tenn, Ala, LSU, Michigan, Michigan St. and Ole Miss.

His High School grades are good enough to qualify to play as a freshman, but 
hasn't scored high enough on the ACT.

Another wide receiver is paying a visit to AU this week.  Roscoe Crosby of 
Union, SC.  He also wants to play pro-baseball.  He'll probably go to Clemson 
or Georgia Tech.
