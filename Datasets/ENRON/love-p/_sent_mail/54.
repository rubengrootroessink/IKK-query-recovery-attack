I have been meaning to email you all day.  I  have been extremely busy as 
wel.  I am sorry to hear that.  Ashley and I were looking forward to going 
out to dinner with you guys on Saturday.  Maybe we will call your folks and 
see if they would like to go out for your dad's bday.  I will have to give 
him a call tomorrow to wish him happy birthday.  Do you have his number at 
work or an email at work?  Thanks.

We look forward to seeing you soon.  Take care.
