His sister was older and she lived in New Jersey, no idea of the name.  
Unfortunately I was going to check on the internet for death records and any 
inmate records(he was a little wild).  Do you have any idea about that stuff?

Your career by the way sounds very exciting, I would like to hear more.  
Thanks for the efforts, I have really been wondering about this guy for a few 
years.
