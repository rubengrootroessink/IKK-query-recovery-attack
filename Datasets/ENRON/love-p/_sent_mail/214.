Glad to hear your trip was wonderful.  Things are great hear.  We are 
anxiously awaiting the arrival of football season and our annual trips back 
to Auburn.  Where is Steve's new job?  Are you guys still planning on going 
to the Friday night party at Cadillac Bar.  I have to hurry and send in my 
money for the event.  Talk to you soon.
