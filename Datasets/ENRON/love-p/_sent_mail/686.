Please replace your physical tabs in your P&L to the file format attached=
=20
below.  This should eliminate interdesk variances.  You will need to add th=
e=20
MTM information and any transport/flash to actual items that you currently=
=20
may have on your physical tab.  I would suggest doing this tomorrow morning=
=20
when you roll your P&L.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.

Attached is a revision of the current =01+Physical=01, tab found in each de=
sk=01,s=20
Regions/Last Day files.  In an effort to standardize and more efficiently=
=20
identify and eliminate Interdesk/Intercompany variances we propose that you=
=20
replace your existing physical tab with the attached template by Thursday,=
=20
February 22.

Please re-link those cells pulling information from other sheets within you=
r=20
file (i.e. Third Party Sales, Third Party Purchases, CPR Fuels, CPR=20
Imbalance, CPR Cash Out, CPR Pipeline Exchange, and CPR Storage).

Follow these steps when entering data:

1. Select your desk=01,s name in the drop down box.  The desk name appears=
=20
exactly as it does on your desk level summary report from CPR. =20
2. Select the "counterparty name" involved in the transaction.  It also=20
should appear exactly as it does on your desk level summary report.=20
3. Enter the Volume and Dollars.  No need to summarize the numbers under on=
e=20
general name.

The template automatically assigns the correct =01+OA Code=01,, which is dr=
iven by=20
the company numbers.=20

Please provide me with any feedback by Thursday, February 22 if the templat=
e=20
creates issues for your desk.
