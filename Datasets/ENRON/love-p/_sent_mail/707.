The Paul Harvey Philosophy

These things I wish  for each of you.....
We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that  we made them worse.
For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like  for them to know 
about hand-me
down clothes and homemade ice cream and  leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I 
really would. I hope you learn humility by being  humiliated, and that you 
learn honesty by being cheated.

I hope you learn  to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash the car. And I 
really
hope nobody  gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.

It will be good if at  least one time you can see puppies born and your old 
dog put to
sleep. I hope  you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.

I hope you  have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it's all 
right if  you
have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to  crawl 
under the
covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him. When  you want to 
see a movie
and your little sister wants to tag along, I hope  you'll let her.

I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your  friends and that you live 
in a
town where you can do it safely. On rainy days  when you have to catch a 
ride, I hope
you don't ask your 'driver' to drop you  two blocks away so you won't be seen 
riding
with someone as uncool as your  Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad
teaches you how to make one  instead of buying one.

I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read  books. When you learn to use 
computers,
I hope you also learn to add and  subtract in your head.

I hope you get teased by your friends when you  have your first crush on a 
girl, and
when you talk back to your mother that  you learn what Ivory soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a  mountain, burn your hand on a stove and 
stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you try a beer once, 
but I hope you don't like it. And if a  friend offers you dope or a joint, I 
hope you realize he is not your  friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma and  go fishing 
with your Uncle.

May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy  during the holidays.

I hope your Mother punishes you when you throw a  baseball through a 
neighbor's
window and that she hugs you and kisses you at  Christmas time when you give 
her a mold of your hand.

These things I wish  for you: tough times and disappointment, hard work and 
happiness.
To me, it's  the only way to appreciate life.

Send this to all of your friends that  mean the most to you but, don't send 
it back to
whoever sent it to you. They  have already read it and you don't need to show 
them that you are a good friend.  They already know!

"We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by  doing them."

Paul Harvey - "Good Day"!
