The feeling is mutual.  Things are going good, even better if I could get out 
of here at a decent time.  At least I don't have Susan's hours.  Are you 
coming to her happy hour tonight?  Talk to you soon.

He got dairy queen coupons?  Mine wasn't even that good?  

So how are you doing Phillip?  It was great to meet you Saturday - I had 
heard so much about you; it was nice to put a name with a face.

Talk to you later,
Lisa

So I hear you are stealing my man Vic's bonus check?  I am sure you didn't 
open it up to see if it was deposited into your account.  From what I was 
told it should have just been some dairy queen coupons.
