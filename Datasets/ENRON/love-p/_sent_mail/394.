Hi Kam,
I am working with Toni Graham in reviewing resumes for your Risk Management 
position, Req. # 108785. I have reviewed all of the postings to date.  These 
were the ones that  were worth sending to you.  Please review and let me know 
which ones you would like me to phone screen. I will actively be looking for 
more resumes tomorrow as well.  




Thanks!
