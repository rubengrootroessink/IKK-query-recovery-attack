The only thing that I can find is Sitara #575092.  This is the only August 01 
deal we have with them.  This volume and price do not match up.  Sylvia does 
not recall the deal they describe and  has no paper work for it.  ANR Lebanon 
Ohio does not sound familiar.  The only thing that I can think of is that 
they send us a confirmation letter/or transcript from the tapes.  If they can 
prove to us a time and who they talked to we can then pull our tapes.  Let me 
know how I can further assist you.  Sorry.
