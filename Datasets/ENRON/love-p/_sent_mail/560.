We have made some slight changes to the orig schedule and may make a few more 
per Laura Luce, the director that is over all of the orig teams.  It is 
vitally important that we do two things with this file now.  We must fill in 
all columns on the first tab - orig schedule and we must put all orig deals 
in the schedule - even if no orig is granted.  THis policy is in effect 
starting today.  Shout with any questions.
