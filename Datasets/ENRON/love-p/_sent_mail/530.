If these are new curves today, they will not show up in CPR until 6:30 am 
tomorrow.
This is the list of deals at the 2 locations.

Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and 
PGLC/NBPL.  The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is 
GDC-Chi./N/Bord.  Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system 
for these two locations.  Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing 
tonight.  Thanks.
