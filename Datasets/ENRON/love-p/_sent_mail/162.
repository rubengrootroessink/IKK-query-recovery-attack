It is an absolutely hilarious video of a pakistani man firing a shotgun in a 
range and the gun shooting out of his hand and him yelling at his friends.  
Real player should be able to play it - that is what I used.  

I had a good time.  Send me those pics.  It was great seeing everybody and 
give us a shout the next time you are in town.
