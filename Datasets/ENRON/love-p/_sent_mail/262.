Subject: Dependent Child Information

If you have viewed your benefit elections on eHROnline, then you may of 
noticed the missing coverage amount for Child Life Insurance.   For Child 
Life Insurance, you will be able to see the coverage cost of $.42 per pay 
period.  However, the amount of coverage will reflect $0.00.  

During conversion to SAP, we discovered that there was no dependent child 
record created, we need immediate action from you

Please respond to this email by Thursday, June 29 by 3:00 p.m. with your 
child's name, date of birth and social security number.  Once we have entered 
all dependent data in SAP your amount of coverage will reflect $10,000 per 
child in eHROnline.

Thank you,
Ginger McCain
Benefits Analyst
