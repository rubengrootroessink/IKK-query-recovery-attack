Sounds great.  We will have to meet up somewhere.  We are staying at the 
NY,NY under my name.  

I feel the same.  I really enjoy seeing you, but as usual, the visits are too 
short.  We will just have to make more frequent trips to Denver.

I will write more later, trying to get caught up from a week off.

Jackson did get the gift for Christmas from you, the thank you card should be 
in the mail.  Thanks.

First....like always it was awesome to see you and the family.  I always
hate saying good-bye to you....but what can you do??  Second....did Jackson
ever receive something in the mail from me for Christmas?  I received a
note from Amazon asking.....and thought that was weird...so thought I would
ask you.  Oh...I think Jason and I will be in Vegas the same weekend as
you!!!!  The only down side is that he will want to spend time with the
other people going out...they are his best friends from Iowa...........I'll
figure something out....even if I have to break away by myself.......
