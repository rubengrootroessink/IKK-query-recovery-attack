Just wanted to give you guys a reminder when it comes to new deals out of our 
traders notebooks.  Please check each morning when you copy the new deals for 
the current day that you verify the prior day's last deal was entered.  It is 
very easy to miss a deal the trader does after four and the trader's do not 
always remind us that they did a deal late.  I spoke with hunter this morning 
and he wants these mistakes to stop.  This doesn't happen often, put it is 
very easy to miss these types of deals in the future.  Thanks for your help.
