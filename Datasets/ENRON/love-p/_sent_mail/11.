I do not mind us bringing JAckson.  I understand your desire to be with him 
all the time, but I would like to occasionally do something with our friends 
for a vacation that is just us.  I think in time you will become more 
comfortable, and I will just wait for that time.

You need to talk to your mom and decide if we are going this weekend.  If we 
go we need to make plans for barkley.

Bundle Jackson up this morning it is near freezing.  Please cover the plants 
out back.  Thanks.
