It was good to talk to you live.  I miss our chats, but this is the wrong 
time and place to discuss that.  Please do not fret at all about not asking 
me to stand up.  For what it is worth I didn't ask you either.  I think you 
are correct it would have been akward for both of us.  This week is a time 
when you need as little stress as possible to cope with al the people that 
are pulling at you.  So you know, do not worry about us, we are there to 
celebrate with you and meet your family.  Take care of the other high 
maintenance people, because you will be suprised how many there are.  Try and 
relax and enjoy it.  I am looking forward to seeing you in that dress.  See 
you soon.
PL

Hey Phillip, I am in the office now...but will be leaving soon and will not
be working the rest of the week.  We should chat live.  But...as for as
Friday goes...I am giving each room a guest box.  And in the box is a
map/tour guide of things you can do.  The luncheon....well, other than my
brother (and not totally sure he is coming...but will know tonight) you are
the only guy invited...and Ashely of course.  If you were a girl (which I
am happy you are not) you would be in my wedding party....and the lunch is
a way to say thanks to those close to me.  If you and Ashley can't come b/c
Grandma, etc....I totally understand.  Please do not feel obligated.  But,
can you please let me know...I have to give the restaurant a head count.  I
am still working on Thursday night.  BUT....worst case...check with the
front desk.  I will leave where we are, or what the plans are if in fact I
am not there.  I'll try and call you tonight.  OK..I am not nervous...but I
am losing my mind right now!!  Too many things to do!!!  Anyhow...did want
to let you know that I really thought about having you in Jason's wedding
party....but then thought it might not be the most appropriate.  Might have
been a little weird.  Just wanted to let you know that I did think about
you.

I don't know if you are working any this week, but I will send an email any
way.  We were wondering what there might be to do in Denver on Friday?
Since we have all day, are there musuems or things unique to Denver to see?
I know there is some luncheon on Friday, is that for couples or just girls?
Wasn't really sure.  We get in about we land on Thursday at 5 p.m. and her
grandmother lands at 6 p.m. so we should be at the hotel by around 6:45.
Should we call your room or meet you somewhere?  Talk to you soon.
