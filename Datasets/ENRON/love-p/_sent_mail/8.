Ashley and I need your address again and your uncles' addresses for Christmas 
cards.

How is married life treating you?  Good I hope.  What are you guys doing for 
Christmas?  Are your folks coming in?

We are staying in Houston.  Should be nice and quiet.  We are going to have a 
few people over for new year's, but nothing special.
