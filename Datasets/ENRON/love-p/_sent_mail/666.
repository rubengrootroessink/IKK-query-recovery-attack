We can take the 265k if you find that we already took the existing variances.

Phillip, 

I can reclass this to synthetic storage.  It looks like we may have netted 
the pre-existing synthetic storage valance with some other variances and 
taken it to the desk in the October,November time frame....

Also, in 0006 theres is a synthetic deal identified as NN4016 with NNG for 
$265K, this deal is in sitara 301891 under CPR Pipeline storage. The terms 
match and we should have no variance.  Please ask Gas accounting why we do 
not have a variance on synthetic line - probably Jim Pond.  Thanks.
