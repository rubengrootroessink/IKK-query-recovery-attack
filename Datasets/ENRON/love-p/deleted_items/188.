TLD-
 
This is someone Diane knows and have recently  reinitiated contact.
 
Diane needs to know what he does and  responsibilities before a face-to-face... If he is an 
officer and ANICO is suing all players in sight,  she needs to know..
 
We checked Edgar for him and he didn't come up in  any of the filings.
 
Let Diane know at her work email or by  phone.
 
Thanks.
 
Diane and George
