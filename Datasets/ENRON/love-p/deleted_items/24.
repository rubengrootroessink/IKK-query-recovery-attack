Attached is the list of counterparties we need moved today.  The list has 140 counterparties on it.  Please let me know if you are not going to be able to move these today by 3:30.  Below is what we need done:
1.  Only financial deals with these counterparties
2.  Change the ENA book name from NG-Price to ENA-FT-WC-SJ
3. commodity code should be NG
4. cutoff date 1/1/02

Please shout if you have any questions.  Thanks.
