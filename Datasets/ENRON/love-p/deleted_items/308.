MAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 12/=
29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing =
elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is e=
xpected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup=
 vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwha=
ckers Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a =
family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Clev=
eland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Upd=
ated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against C=
hicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy =
season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee=
) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to=
 start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR=
 CAR - Not So Nice Machine Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not pl=
ay this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely s=
tart in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01=
 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not star=
t on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his=
 playing time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Meximullets =
Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a =
thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN=
 - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Gr=
een Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in mo=
st of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start t=
his deep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - The Executioners=
 Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are int=
erested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New En=
gland's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Pat=
riots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no dea=
ls would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , =
K TB - One Man Show Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out=
 for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Do=
ug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky =
Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - One Man Show Updated 12/28/01 Dun=
n's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this wee=
k, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent=
 weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/28/01 Westb=
rook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this=
 week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may =
miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jac=
kson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR AT=
L - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee =
injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot ove=
r rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time no=
w that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets =
in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/28=
/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his =
hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Nort=
h Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thurs=
day. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy star=
ter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JA=
C - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice=
 time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie=
 Downs Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice o=
n Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free=
 Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve.=
 O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is =
out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Not So Nice Machine Updated 12/28/01 Brook=
ins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may no=
t see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake Pit=
 Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury=
. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming =
his normal workload.   James Thrash , WR PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/=
28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to pl=
ay this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Snake Pit Updated 12/28/01 Wall=
s missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime deci=
sion this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 12/28/01 =
A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Da=
n Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at half=
back.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is d=
ay to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen D=
avis , RB WAS - The Executioners Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned=
 to practice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - M=
eximullets Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't app=
ear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full strength" criteria for starting agai=
nst Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches did=
n't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate =
in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without full=
y suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters=
 were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wy=
nn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.   =
 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined=
 by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first t=
ime in a month. "Still questionable," coach Bill Cowher said. "He did more =
today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day=
 to day."   Doug Brien , K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Brien signed a =
one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will us=
e him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica=
 strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last w=
