, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Th=
e Executioners Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Su=
nday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, =
you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - The Execu=
tioners Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week=
, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Phil=
adelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considerin=
g! t! he lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR =
KC - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass=
 Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burn=
ed by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver fo=
r this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richard=
son has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a ch=
ance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should m=
ove the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touch=
down-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes =
, RB KC - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many pla=
ys to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes rol=
l up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your act=
ive lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Gree=
n , ! QB! KC - Meximullets Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped ba=
dly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expec=
t him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't r=
ush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander =
, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 According to the Washington Post, Al=
exander will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia.=
 He had been inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting h=
im is somewhat of a gamble.   ! Kyle Brady  , TE JAC - One Man Show Updated=
 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We do=
n't recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely t=
his is the game he will break his slump.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Not So Nic=
e Machine Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive =
weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll fac=
e a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a=
 Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - One Man Sh! ow! Updated=
 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against B=
altimore, and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn startin=
g at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat=
 Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for ex=
plosive stats.  Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/21=
/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you hav=
e to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have=
 less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more pa=
sses than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph , RB JAC - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs de=
spite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend =
you use him this week if you have no other options at running back.  Marcus=
 Pollard , TE IND - The Guzzlers Updated 11/21/01 Pollard will have his han=
ds full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulters on Sunday. While P=
ollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in recent weeks, you shou=
ldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should probably start him =
unle! ss! you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reg=
gie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes=
 thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we =
only recommend you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.  =
Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/01 Harrison is a mus=
t-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. However, he should ha=
ve no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfield for great st=
ats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11=
/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should =
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats, =
but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DEN - =
Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown !=
 hi! s way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key membe=
r of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys w=
ill likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start on=
e it should definitely be Clark.  Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - oops, I did it=
 again Updated 11/21/01 Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing gam=
e more Thursday against Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. Howeve=
r, he had no catches in similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys w=
ill be ready to defend short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thi=
n at the tight end position.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/=
21/01 If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will=
 need to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't re=
commend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a rel=
iable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.  Kevin Dyson , WR=
 TEN - Meximullets Updated 11/21/01 Don't look for good numbers from Dyson =
this week. he has been inconsistent this season, and may not do much agains=
t a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Derrick Mason!  , WR TEN - The Lie Downs =
Updated 11/21/01 Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steel=
ers. Don't expect him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.  Mike Al=
stott , RB TB - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/01 Alstott is once again pla=
ying second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't expect huge Fantasy numbers fr=
om him. Unless you play in a deeper, scoring-based league, starting Alstott=
 is a risk.   Brad Johnson , QB TB - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/01 Johnson=
 threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no touchd=
owns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy standpoi=
nt, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor.   Keyshawn Johns=
on , WR TB - The Lie Downs Updated 11/21/01 Johnson had a big game against =
Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for 89 yards. He was held out of t=
he end zone again, but look for that to change on Monday night against St. =
Louis.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/01 Hakim =
suffered an ! an! kle injury during last Sunday's game against New England.=
 He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay, so avoid =
starting him if at all possible.   Torry Holt , WR STL - One Man Show Updat=
ed 11/21/01 Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last wee=
kend against New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the l=
eague, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Th=
e Guzzlers Updated 11/21/01 Bruce had a huge game against New England last =
weekend, posting seven catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid =
game in Week 11 against a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big p=
lay.   Olandis Gary , RB DEN - oops, I did it again Updated 11/21/01 Gary w=
ill likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but we don=
't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will probably fo=
cus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky starts this w=
eek since they have been splitting time.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - Not So Ni=
ce Machine Updated 11/2! 1/! 01 With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidel=
ined by injury, Griese will have questionable receivers to work with Thursd=
ay against Dallas. However, the Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the=
 run and force Griese to beat them through the air. He should provide your =
team with decent stats and is worth using this week.  Marshall Faulk , RB S=
TL - oops, I did it again Updated 11/21/01 Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards an=
d a touchdown against New England last weekend. He's the best player in Fan=
tasy Football, and is a must-start in any league format.   Mo! re! Updates =
