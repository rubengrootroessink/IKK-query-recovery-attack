tes  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , WR SD - oops, I did it ag=
ain Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City becau=
se of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Frid=
ay. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate =
Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already miss=
ing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed l=
ung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed =
for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of th=
e best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.  =
   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/23/01 McNair p=
layed Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well,=
 throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No.=
 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose p=
ractice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted a=
fterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying i=
t didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in=
 the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie=
 George , RB TEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 George played in Satur=
day's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third qua=
rter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , W=
R MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01  Gadsden did not play in Saturday=
's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers =

 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest o=
f the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 H=
orn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-s=
tart player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB =
ATL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much st=
atistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoff=
s.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step bac=
k into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muha=
mmad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much d=
uring Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated=
 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks=
 the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option i=
f you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated=
 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the play=
offs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB O=
AK - The Executioners Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy=
 QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should neve=
r be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 12/21/01 Moss sta=
rted off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts.=
 Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR K=
C - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help=
 Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the =
NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/21/01 W=
estbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be =
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Not So N=
ice Machine Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season=
. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    =
Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't bee=
n a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy p=
layoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Executioners Updated 12/21/01 Gonzal=
ez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented t=
o bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - The Fat Bastar=
ds Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count o=
n him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Mexim=
ullets Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year=
. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR =
GB - Not So Nice Machine Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season.=
 Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt =
Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big=
 disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.   J=
ohnnie Morton , WR DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Morton has been inc=
onsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy=
 playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Meximullets Up=
dated 12/21/01 Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. Bu=
t he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. =
  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is havin=
g a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers mak=
es him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your pl=
ayoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Snake Pit Updated 12/21/01 Harrison=
 will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL seas=
on. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the pl=
ayoff race.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/21/01 Stal=
ey started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your s=
tarting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs.    Shawn Brys=
on , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Bryson will start in place of the=
 injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need hel=
p at that spot.   James Thrash , WR PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/21/01=
 Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch=
 a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will b=
