an , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/29/01 Pittman suffered a concussion in=
 Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to day.  James Stewart =
, RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 10/29/01 Stewart was inactive for Sunday's=
 game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at RB for the Lions.  Keys=
hawn Johnson, WR TB - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01Johnson sat out the sec=
ond half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of=
 a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playi=
ng with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will ge=
t an MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they =
are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probabl=
y could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."  E=
mmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced hims=
elf OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3=
 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, bu=
t I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't =
know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able =
to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next w=
eek at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluat=
ed on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    =
 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 According to pu=
blished reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against =
Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action. Eddie Kennison , WR =
DEN - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards a=
gainst New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has rever=
ted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mi=
ke Anderson , RB DEN - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for on=
ly 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-ya=
rd run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yar=
ds also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.=
 David Patten , WR NE - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five p=
asses for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring t=
hreat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy B=
rown , WR NE - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86=
 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. =
Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams o=
n the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 1=
0/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the pas=
t, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie =
and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a F=
antasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Jone=
s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passe=
s for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones =
may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to p=
refer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red=
 zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Centers was =
limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills id=
eally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, s=
o don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR B=
UF - ! Th! e Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 y=
ards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears t=
o have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasse=
lbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game a=
s a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he conti=
nued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downf=
ield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Nice Machine Updat=
ed 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consider=
ing the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked res=
pectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post g=
ood yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overa=
ll output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/28/01 Gad=
sden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is=
 not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James =
McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/! 28! /01 McKnight caught eight p=
asses for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami r=
eceiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , R=
B NYG - The Nice Machine Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards o=
n eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbe=
rs, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , =
WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 10=
9 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player=
, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - The Execution=
ers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was=
 held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but =
the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the =
ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 19=
0 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, ! no! w the =
erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce St=
aley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday agai=
nst Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with=
 two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush de=
fense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noti=
ng that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggest=
s that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky=
 starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 10! /2! 8/=
01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelph=
ia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back=
 while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Execu=
tioners Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns an=
d no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall c=
hallenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with bette=
r stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers =
Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday =
against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot =
for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was stil=
l a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should =
break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of=
 the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Pittm=
an rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much =
better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will=
 be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston =
, WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for =
108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an incons=
istent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy p=
layer because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's e=
asily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I =
did it again Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns a=
nd two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inc=
onsistent he can be. Unle! ss! the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn'=
t rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sund=
ay, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defen=
se has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup=
, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit wil=
l give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL =
- Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yard=
s, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 y=
ards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't gre=
at for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary=
. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  More Upd=
