The date is set for Sept. 21st. The friday before will be great. I am going this weekend or the next to the tux shops to find out what all the details will be. I will let you know as soon as possible. I'm really just getting started so tell Ashley if she has any suggestions to please let me know. I have checked into the botanical gardens and the hsv museum of art for holding the ceremony but I need someone like a wedding corodinator to tell us what to do, you know the church you get married at usually has one and she tells you the night of the rehearsal dinner. By having it somewhre else I dont really have that person. I am glad that you want to be a part of the wedding. I do think that Jackson will be the cutest little man in tux.  talk to you later  B
