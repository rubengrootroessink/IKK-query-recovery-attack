From corporate benefits, the incorrect employment status information has now been corrected and the active employees should disregard the termination letters.  They can verify that their status has been fixed on the Hewitt system by either calling and speaking with a representative (800-332-7979, option 3), or by logging into the Savings Plan system directly and clicking on the "Personal Data" option off the main Savings Plan home page.

Thank you.

Melissa Videtto received a termination package over the weekend and should not have.  Can you please confirm she has not been terminated so I can send an email confirmation to her manager and herself?  thanks
