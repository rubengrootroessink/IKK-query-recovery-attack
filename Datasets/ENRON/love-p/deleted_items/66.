I am booked on a flight 1 week from Friday 8th of February - I land in
Birmingham at 9 a.m.  I should be to Huntsville by 11 a.m.  I am staying
until Sunday.  I think Ashley and Jackson are going to stay here for now
unless you report granddad is doing much worse next week.  We will see
how that goes.  Talk to you soon.  Did you call last night?
