Howdy everyone!

Rebecca, myself and the pumpkin will be gracing the Great State of Texas in
late Feb.  During this time, we will be hosting a post wedding reception on
Sunday the 24th. of February, 2002 at the Coliseum Restaurant in Clear Lake.
  We plan on starting the party at around 1300.  It will be a semi formal
type of occasion, so just bring an appetite and get ready for a great
afternoon!

If you could please let us know via email if you can make it and if you will
be bringing a significant other, we would greatly appreciate it.

We look forward to seeing everyone there!

Tommy
GO STELLERS!!!!!!
