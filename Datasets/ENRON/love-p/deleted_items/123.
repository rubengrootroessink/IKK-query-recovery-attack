I saw that in USA Today as I was getting on a plane this moring.

I tried to send you an email to enron.com day before yesterday and it
was returned saying it didn't exist.  Curious.

Looks like due to the Enron debacle, you guys can make some money...On
Ebay the cups I sent you are going for $50 and higher.  Make your money
while you can.
