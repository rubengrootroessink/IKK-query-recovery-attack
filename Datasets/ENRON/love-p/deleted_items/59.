I actually have the time to have a life.  I never knew there was such a thing.  I've been reading about all the events going on down there, and have been thinking about all my friends that are effected.  
Just came back from Canada last week.  Went on a skiing trip to Whistler, outside of Vancouver.  I t is one of the best resorts in North America.  Tommorow I'm going to LA for a convention and then I'm off to Europe to see my sister and her new baby, whenever it decides to be born.  So all in all, things are great.
