teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie D=
owns Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playof=

. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR W=

the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Executioners Updated 12=

ntasy teams.   Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/21/01 T=
oomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fanta=
sy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout =
during your playoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Snake Pit Updated 12/=
21/01 Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks o=
f the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are=
 not in the playoff race.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated=
 12/21/01 Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep h=
