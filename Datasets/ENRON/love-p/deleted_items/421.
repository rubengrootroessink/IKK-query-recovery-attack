Victor,
	We have three deals (sales) to Kaztex for Ocotber 2001 production that Kaztex says aren't theirs.  Deals 715257, 715271, and 715294.  Kaztex says they belong to Nicor, and not Kaztex.  We contacted Nicor, and they also said they did not buy this gas from us.  Can you please clarify who should be paying for this gas?  The total $ amount for all three deals is $329,630.44, so I really need to find out who should be paying for this as soon as possible.  Thank you.
