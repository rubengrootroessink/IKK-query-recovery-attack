st the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham =
, WR SD - oops, I did it again Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play =
Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident,=

ur team to Fantasy glory.     More Updates   Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]The=
 Executioners Player News  Peter Warrick , Active WR Updated 12/26/01 Warri=
ck, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has =
been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at t=
his point of the postseason.   Rich Gannon , Active QB Updated 12/21/01 Gan=
non has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on =
many title teams, and should never be benched.   Tony Gonzalez , Active TE =
Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Stil=
l, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Marty Booker =
, Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Booker has been one of the better receivers in=
 the NFC. Look for him to produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. =
  Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 12/21/01 According to the Pro Football =
News and Injury Report, Davis' status for Sunday's game is questionable rig=
ht now. He has told reporters he will play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start i=
n his place if Davis can't play.   Albert Connell , Reserve WR Updated 12/1=
7/01 Connell will be officially suspended for the remainder of the season b=
y the team, league sources told SportsLine.com. Connell was a major disappo=
intment for Fantasy leaguers this year.   Cris Carter , Active WR Updated 1=
2/16/01 The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the vete=
ran receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during =
any week of the Fantasy playoffs.   Tiki Barber , Reserve RB Updated 12/16/=
01 Barber compiled 130 scrimmage yards against Arizona, but he was held out=
 of the end zone. Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants' o=
ffense, however, and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy p=
layoffs.   Tom Brady , Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01 Brady had another disapp=
ointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an interception at Buffalo=
. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to be a Fantasy risk during t=
he most important weeks of the year.  LaDainian Tomlinson , Active RB Updat=
ed 12/16/01 Tomlinson had only 69 all-purpose yards on Saturday against Oak=
land. He seems to be wearing down somewhat, which makes him more and more o=
f a risk for Fantasy owners.   Shawn Jefferson , Reserve WR Updated 12/14/0=
1 Jefferson (back) has returned to practice. He is now listed as probable f=
or Sunday's game, but Brian Finneran has started to take some of his reps a=
s the team's No. 3 receiver.  Roland Williams , Reserve TE Updated 12/13/01=
 Williams is day to day with knee and ankle injuries. He is expected to pla=
y on Saturday.  Jets , Active DT Updated 12/03/01 CB Aaron Glenn may miss u=
p to four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right kne=
e. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more often to protect the secon=
dary, but the unit may also allow more passing yards in the next few games.=
  Drew Bledsoe , Reserve QB Updated 11/14/01 Bledsoe has been cleared to pl=
ay, but Tom Brady will start against the Rams. Bledsoe said he will try and=
 prove he is ready to play by performing well in practice, but it doesn't a=
ppear likely he will get a chance to start. But the future past Week 10 app=
ears to be unclear, and there is no guarantee Brady will hold onto the job =
past the Rams game.  Trung Canidate , Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01 Canidate =
got almost all of the carries in the second half of Sunday's game against C=
arolina. With St. Louis way ahead, coach Mike Martz obviously rested stud b=
ack Marshall Faulk, who had 183 yards rushing and two touchdowns in the fir=
st half. Canidate finished the game with 145 yards rushing and a touchdown.=
 However, don't expect Canidate to get as much playing time in games where =
the score isn't so one-sided.   Adam Vinatieri , Active K Updated 12/13/00 =
Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent=
 weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get =
his chances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense st=
ruggles like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's el=
ite kickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [I=
