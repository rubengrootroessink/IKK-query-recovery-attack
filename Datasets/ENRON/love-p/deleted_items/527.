                         SEC CHAMPIONSHIP

The 2001 SEC Championship game will be played at the Georgia Dome in
Atlanta on December 8.  Since the team representing the western
division may not be determined until after the LSU-Auburn game on Dec.
1, seven days before the Championship Game, the SEC office has
instructed all teams in contention to begin processing orders at this
time.  Since we are dealing with such a short turn around, we have to
prepare now as if we are in the game. If we do not represent the
Western Division, your credit card charge will be cancelled.  If we
are in the  Championship Game, we will be prepared to mail the tickets
after  December 1.  It is imperative that  orders are received by the
November 20 deadline. We will not have the luxury of filling any
orders received after November 20 based on priority. We will
need a street address and daytime phone number, because the tickets
will be shipped via UPS Next Day Air.  If you need to change your
address or have any questions please send to:
to:mailto:tickets@auburn.edu.
Address changes can not be made on the order form.  You will save $5
when ordering via the internet.

Your customer number is:  42077
