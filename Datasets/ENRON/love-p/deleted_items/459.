EA - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to mi=
ss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of man=
y contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should r=
oll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE -=
 The Executioners Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for n=
ow, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any chan=
ge! s ! this week," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy sta=
rter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if yo=
u can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may hav=
e to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's=
 status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - North=
 Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently h=
ealed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expect=
ed to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will c=
ontinue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason come=
s into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/20/01 Mike =
Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving=
 Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he sa=
id. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within =
this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the nex=
t win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy =
most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 B=
ruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. H=
is loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is =
widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Whe=
atley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Cos=
ta Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to pla=
y on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11! /2! 0/01 Kinne=
y (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to r=
eturn to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - North Blvd Nut=
whackers Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this w=
eek. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blv=
d Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore w=
hen he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now s=
ays he doesn't expect him to miss any pr! ac! tice time this week.   Derric=

returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minn=

ed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his pla=
ce,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Meximullets Up! da! ted 11/20/01  Wayne has a =
sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orlea=
ns. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IN=
D - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He=
 will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meani=
ng Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.  =
 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told th=
e Miami Herald there is no ! QB! controversy surrounding Fielder and backup=
 Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the star=
ter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play tur=
nover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - oops, I did it again Updated 1=
1/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be suffic=
iently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a =
chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver =
Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation=
 where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then =
we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't =
indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him i=
nvolved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , W=
R WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last=
 weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. Ho=
wever, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this poin=
t.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks=
, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered =
a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects=
 of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green ,=
 WR TB - The Guzzlers Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to retur=
n to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this se=
ason, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR =
SF - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and a=
nkle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. T=
he injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be=
 in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - O=
ne Man Show Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sund=
ay's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expecte=
d to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real val=
ue as a Fantasy pla! ye! r, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley.    Gia=
nts , DT NYG - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 According to the New=
 York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began =
giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure t=
hat he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night,=
 but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should c=
onsider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   El=
vis Grbac , QB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/20/01 ! The Baltimore Sun =
says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's start=
ing QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy t=
eams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still =
dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game agains=
t Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at thi=
s point.    Ravens , DT BAL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end =
Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee ! su=
! rgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore def=
ense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    C=
owboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, wh=
o was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get th=
e start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denv=
er's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' d=
efense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake =
Pit Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Den=
ver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told=
 the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due =
to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. =
    Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bru=
ised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some prac=
tice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta=
. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could t=
urn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after =
missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to p=
lay on Sunday against San Diego.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Co=
