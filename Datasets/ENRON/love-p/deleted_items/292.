said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy.   Jam=

ained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont=

n on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , =
RB GB - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the f=
ourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   T=
odd Bouman , QB MIN - Meximullets Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start=
 Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was re=
placed by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Snake Pit Updated 12/=
23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but =
he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gr=
amatica  , K TB - One Man Show Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamst=
ring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but=
 Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Me=
ximullets Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's ga=
me. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with so=
me pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - oops, I did it again Updated =
12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the de=
ath of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graha=
m doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will =
be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No=
. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antow=
ain Smith , RB NE - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career=
-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runne=
rs in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McN=
air  , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Satur=
day despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a=
 touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jef=
f Garcia , QB SF - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice tim=
e was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards t=
hat he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't gr=
eatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remain=
ing weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , R=
B TEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game =
despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter becaus=
e of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thr=

nst the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in h=

ke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regula=
r season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once =
again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player =
during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Who's =
Yo Daddy Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically =
in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald =
Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the f=
orefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn=
't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks =
15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Co=
nsider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons=
 to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need a=
n emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 12/21/01 Wa=
rner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect=
 fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Exe=
cutioners Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this yea=
r. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched=
.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slo=
w this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesit=
ate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - North Bl=
vd Nutwhackers Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy own=
ers this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. =
  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has=
 been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2=
 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine =
Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you=
 play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richard=
son , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consiste=
nt scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   T=
ony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Executioners Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't pl=
ayed as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench duri=
ng the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - The Fat Bastards Updated 1=
2/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to hel=
p lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Meximullets Updat=

sky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Not So =
