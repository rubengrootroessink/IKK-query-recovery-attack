Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/26/01 Brookins is expected to miss the rest =
of the season with a broken foot. Moe Williams will probably become Baltimo=
re's No. 1 RB now, and the Ravens may add another RB to their roster in the=
 next few days.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/26/01 Bar=
low dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not b=
een determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/26/0=

ay to day.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/26/01 Jackson=
 re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day=
.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - The Executioners Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is li=
sted as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken=
 for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's W=
eek 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/2=
6/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched=
 at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mi=
tchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the B=
engals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell=
 , WR JAC - One Man Show Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 8=
0 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in=
 recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opp=
onents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Thrill Kil=
l Cult Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught fiv=
e passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack rem=
ains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL -=
 North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01  The Jaguars held Ismail to three =
catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail rem=
ains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most comple=
te and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Not So N=
ice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Ja=
cksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erra=
tic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - =
Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the bal! l ! six times f=
or 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during th=
e remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Executioners Updated=
 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught =
five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners =
would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian To=
mlinson , RB SD - The Executioners Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out =
of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The roo=
kie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego=
's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Fl=
utie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Ar=
izona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advanta=
ge.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I did it again Updated 11/25/01 Plummer=
 had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown again! st=
! San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy q=
uarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/2=
5/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards=
 and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy r=
eceivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie J=
ackson , WR NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outin=
g against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. =
He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth startin=
g in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 11/25/01 Ho=
rn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New =
England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth =
starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Update=
d 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball ! fi=
! ve times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage=
 packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy=
 team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able=
 to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - T=
he Guzzlers Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two t=
ouchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a prett=
y good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - The Execu=
tioners Updated 11/25/01  Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, po=
sting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable =
Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pa=
triots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Executioners Up=
dated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions a=
gainst the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look=
 like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - N=
orth Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 Sanders! l! eft Sunday's game agains=
t San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by Mar=
Tay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Who's =
Yo Daddy Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, ca=
tching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a f=
umble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disa=
ppointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best =
outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309=
 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fant=
asy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oron=
de Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eigh=
t passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and =
lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in=
 these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 1=
1/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yar! ds! , three TDs and no interceptions at =
Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fie=
dler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNa=
bb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McN=
abb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions.=
 Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performanc=
e.  James Thrash , WR PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught=
 four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be =
a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner ,=
 WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes f=
or only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the =
past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.  =
