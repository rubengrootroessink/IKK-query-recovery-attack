I started calculating the bankruptcy book last night for the credit group.  This needs to be done nightly.  I may be out a few days so if I am can someone else take this over from me please?  We can also use these to check daily for counterparties that have been moved incorrectly.

The file is in O:\erms\1intra\west\Bankruptcy post-ids.xls

Thanks

KK
