Dianne,

Hope you are ready for the rapidly approaching holidays!

Need to share new opportunities with you in the event you know of
individuals who might be interested.  I will of course, be reviewing
existing resumes for possible candidates, but need to make you aware of
other opening that have just become available.

We had two resignations last week opening up the need to recruit for the
2 following positions:

            Vice President of Clinical Operations - Requires someone
with a rather specialized background on the clinical side.
            Director of Business Operations - Works with start-up's and
existing centers implementing and problem solving within the business
office.

Projected growth has created the need for:

            Development Coordinator - Coordinates and works with all
phases of a new center to bring it from inception to opening.

All three of these positions will be based in Kansas City.

And of course, we are still actively recruiting for an Administrator and
Group Vice President for the Texas market.

Have a wonderful holiday!!  And as always, thanks for your efforts on
our behalf.

Best Wishes,

Judy Byers
Director Human Resources
