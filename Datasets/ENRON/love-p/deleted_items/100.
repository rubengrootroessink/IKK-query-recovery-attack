> IT WAS 1987! 
> At a lecture the other day they played an old video of Lt. Col.  Oliver  
> North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the Reagan  
> Administration.  
> There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third  degree.  
But  
> what he said was stunning!! He was being drilled by some  senator;  
> "Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security  
system?"  
> Ollie replied, "Yes I did sir."  
> The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the  audience, "Isn't  
> this just a little excessive?"  
> 'No sir,' continued Ollie.  
> No? And why not?" the senator asked.  
> "Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir."  
> 'Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned.  
> 'By a terrorist, sir.' Ollie answered.  
> 'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?"  
> "His name is Osama bin Laden sir." Ollie replied.  
> At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't  
pronounce  
> it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of  people  
> laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.  
> "Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked.  
> "Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of,"  Ollie  
> answered.  
> "And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the senator.  
> "Well, sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that an  assassin team  
be  
> formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth."  
> The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all that  was shown  
of
