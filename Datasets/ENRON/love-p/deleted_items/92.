did this change recently?  I have done several....3-5 transactions without a
problem.  I understood the verification only mattered if I ever transacted
an agregate of $1000.  I will double check that, but you should not have a
problem getting the funds.

FYI - not sure if you know this yet, but you need to become verified on
PayPal before your payment can go through.  This usually entails you getting
the two amounts from your bank account that they drafted - usually pennies.
Once you are verified, I will receive the funds and I will mail out the
cube.  Thanks.
