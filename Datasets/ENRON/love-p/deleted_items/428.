01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sund=
ay's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remain=
der of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in=
 Butler's absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated=
 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but th=

England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as =
day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Meximullets Updated 11/19/01 Wayne su=
ffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Rod Sm=
ith , WR DEN - oops, I did it again Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could no=
t finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is un=
clear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/19/01 M=
athis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 =
yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he'=
s expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harr=
is , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated! 1! 1/19/01 Harris suffered a strained rig=
ht hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return t=
o the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Nort=
h Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit=
 on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured=
 his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy =
Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his ha=
mstring has healed e! no! ugh that he's ready to return to action. However,=
 the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets h=
is starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this s=
eason to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James =
Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Clevelan=
d Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens.=
 Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to game=
time had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergen=
ce of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf =
, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing thi=
s weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the t=
eam's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than=
 waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first=
 quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Phila=
delphia is uncertain at this time.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against D=
enver, told the Washington Post that there's a "definite possibility" he wo=
uld be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Gra=
ham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive=
 Fantasy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake Pit=
 Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a spra=
ined knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas=
 faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Upd=

gainst Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free=

y.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/18/01 Muhamm=
ad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His statu=
s for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN =
- The Guzzlers Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 car=
ries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 ya=
rds. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fant=
asy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael=
 Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine =
passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on =
rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the =
year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I did it again Updated 11/18/01=
 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.=
 Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better =
game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 11/18/01 =
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries=
. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin a=
t RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught =
two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate f=
or help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie B=
atch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed f=
or 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a sco=
re. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the g=
oal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of th=
e year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - One Man Show Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 1=
2 passe! s ! for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yar=
ds and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy num=
bers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic=
.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - The Lie Downs Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught=
 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end =
zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is ve=
ry thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - One Man Show Updated 11/18/01=
 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is n=
ot consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CH=
I - The Executioners Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 ya=
rds and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a su=
perb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter w=
