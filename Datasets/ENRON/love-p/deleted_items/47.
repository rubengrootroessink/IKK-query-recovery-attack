Kim,

Deal # QR4659.1 & 3 are in the FT-CAND-ERMS book as of yesterday afternoon.  Should these trades be terminated or do I need to send an invoice to Entergy-Koch?

Please advise,
Mechelle

Per Cecilia this was done and I just spot checked a few deals and checked ENTERGY in particular and it they were moved to Bankruptcy.

Phillip,
Did you receive confirmation from Cecilia that these were indeed moved?  Entergy Koch is one of the entities that Mechelle Stevens is questioning.

Please move the following six counterparties from NG-Price to Bankruptcy.  Please move only financial deals.  Please let me know when this is complete.  We need to have it done by the time we calc our books today - no exceptions.  Thanks for your help.
