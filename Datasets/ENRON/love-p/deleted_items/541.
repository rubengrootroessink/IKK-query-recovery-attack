MAMA JUST CALLED AND SAID THAT THE DAMAGE WAS WORSE THAN DEPICTED ON TV  THE

OLD FOOTBALL FIELD, THE OLD HOME ECONOMICS BUILDING, LOWE AND JAMES ATTORNEY

OFFICE, THE POST OFFICE WERE ALL  BADLY DAMAGED AS WELL.  MAIL IS BEING
MOVED
TO THE ARMORY.  THE HOUSES ON THE STREET BEHIND THE POST OFFICE LOST ROOFS
AND WALLS. EDNA BLACKWELDERS CARPORT WAS BLOWN OFF. MAMA FOUND UNOPENED
PACKAGES OF AUTO PARTS FROM DANA'S BLDG. IN HER YARD. OF COURSE, THE
DOWNTOWN
MALL AND THE PIGGLY WIGGLY WERE ALL DESTROYED. THE CHURCH TOOK A GOOD LICK.
DOBBS LUMBER AND BOTH OF THE GAS STATIONS NEAR THE CHURCH ARE GONE.
   MAMMA CAME BACK BY YOUR DAD'S HOUSE AND SAID IT  WAS SPARED. SHE SAID THE

THE  AGENT HAD PUT A REDUCED IN PRICE SIGN ON THE HOUSE. MAYBE WITH SO MANY
HOMES BEING DESTROYED, THE HOUSE WILL SELL SOON AND YOU CAN SETTLE
EVERYTHING
WITH GLENDA.
