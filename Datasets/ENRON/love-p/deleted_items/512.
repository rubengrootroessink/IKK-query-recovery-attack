A violation is a violation.  I suggest that you go big time next time in order to get your money's worth.

Gosh , Kimat, this is so unfair... I get penalized for exceeding VAR by 1,000, and Derren by 1,000,000 and it's both 10,000!!!!

FYI, penalty of $10,000 each has been posted to your P&L for VAR violation.
