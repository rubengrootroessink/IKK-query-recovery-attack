FYI....

AA is request to see ALL new deals in both tagg and sitara for the past two months.  I left her a message to clarify that they want all deals.  That is a unreasonable I think.  I'll let you know what she says.

Kam,

Per your conversation with Sharon this morning, please find below the email
that we sent yesterday in regards to our gas stub period testing.

We would like to begin the preliminary stages of our second phase of stub
period testing as part of our Natural Gas Audit.  In order for us to do so,
we will need your assistance in obtaining all transactions entered into
from October 1, 2001 through and including November 30, 2001 from both TAGG
and Sitara.  Since we are selecting the deals we would like to test
statistically, we will also need to ensure that deals entered into both
Sitara and TAGG are included only once in our population.  In addition, we
will be requesting all transactions entered into during December 2001 from
both TAGG and Sitara at the end of the year.

In relation to our first phase of stub period testing, we are in the
process of assessing and testing the documentation provided thus far and
will be sending an additional request later this week.

Thanks for all your help.  If you have any questions, please call me at
X6-6269.

Jennifer
