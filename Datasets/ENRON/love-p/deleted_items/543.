Phillip,
 
There are several deals in TAGG with an ENA book name of UN-NY; examples are N67489.6 and N67489.C.  I am trying to find out the long description for the book and where the deal value would be captured.  Can you help?  The examples above were set up in 2000 and run through 2003.
 
Best regards,
 
Rachel
