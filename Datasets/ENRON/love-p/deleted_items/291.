ettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy.   James Ste=

n in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE=
 NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on S=
unday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB =
- Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth =
quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bo=
uman , QB MIN - Meximullets Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunda=
y's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced=
 by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Snake Pit Updated 12/23/01 =
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he lef=
t the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatic=
a  , K TB - One Man Show Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring i=
n the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Grama=
tica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Meximull=
ets Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He=
 should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pai=
n in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - oops, I did it again Updated 12/23/=
01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of=
 his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham does=
n't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be sig=
ned off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 re=
ceiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Sm=
ith , RB NE - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high =
156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in =
the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair  ,=
 QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday de=
spite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touch=
down pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garc=
ia , QB SF - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was =
limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he=
 has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly =
affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining we=
eks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN =
- Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despit=
e suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a=
 neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Ki=
ll Cult Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against th=
e Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his abs=
ence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his=
 right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular seas=
on.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again =
performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during=
 the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Who's Yo Dad=
dy Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in rec=
ent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes =
, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefro=
nt this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't ver=
y explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 thr=
ough 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Consider=
 Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to po=
st better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emer=
gency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 12/21/01 Warner s=
hould guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine =
numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Execution=
ers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He =
will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Ra=
ndy Moss , WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this=
 season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to=
 start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - North Blvd Nut=
whackers Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners th=
is year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Mich=
ael Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been =
inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at be=
st during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine Update=
d 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play =
in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , =
RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent sco=
ring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Go=
nzalez , TE KC - The Executioners Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played a=
s well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the=
 Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/21/0=
1 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead=
 your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Meximullets Updated 12/=
