 WR SD - oops, I did it again Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play S=
unday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, =
coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will st=

lications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith  , RB NE - The Guzzlers Upd=
ated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Satu=

urday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played w=

t help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB =
CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the=
 Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers=

n one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff=
