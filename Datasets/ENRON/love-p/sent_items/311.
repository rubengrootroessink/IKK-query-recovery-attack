Attached is a book request for two new books - one for Lavorato and one for Cuilla.  Due to the problems we had last week/this weekend that you guys helped us try and resolve, we are going to have to go the route of Canada on these Aeco deals and book a spreadsheet for VaR purposes.  Please set the two books up like Calgary's book(Sheet 1 on the attached file) We need to start doing this tonight, because Hunter and Lavorato want their VaR reported correctly tonight.  They both plan on altering their positions and utilizing all of their VaR.  I apologize for the short notice and appreciate all of your help so that I can get this fixed for tonight's VaR.  Please let me know any additional information I can provide you.  Thanks.
