got your message last night.  What is up?  Bet you are glad you are not working for the big E.  Things are not too good here.  Just waiting for the ax to drop.  Hope things are good in SF. Talk to you soon.

Hey Philip!

What's up? I have mixed feeling about you going to
ND...I', jealous! This year is out for me
unfortunately.  I have some friends that have gone to
games this year...I'll get the skinny on scalping.  It
shouldn't be much of a prop.  However, despite there
records, it's still ND and Tennesse. It will be sold
out.  But you can get tix.  I know this much. You
can't (or it's against school policy to )get tix on
campus. However, there are plenty of scalper on roads
leading to campus.

Sites to see.  Definietly check out the campus.  Make
time to see the lakes, go by the dome etc. It's
awesome. Also, it may be one of the games of the
week...so, look out for espn, nbc and all the rest.
The hype is great when networks other than nbc show.
Lots of small bars...avoid the linebacker, unless you
want to test that you have the endurance you had in
undergrad. College Football Hall of Fame is
there...downtown.  Tailgating is great....like I said
make sure you get to the game early. That way you'll
get the whole experience. Lots of tradition game day,
for example the Band marches from the dome to the
stadium....it's awesome.

I'll give you a call at work..

Later,

Steve
