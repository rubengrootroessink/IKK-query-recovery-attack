Please set up Souad Mahmassani in risktrac.  She is a new trader on the central desk.  She will be running the Aruba and central transport books.  The following books will be her responsibility:
ARUBA-SPLY-PRC
ARUBA-TP-PHY
FT-PEOPLES-BAS,PRC,IDX,GDL
FT-CENTRAL-OPT-BAS,GDL,IDX,PRC

Souad would need to roll up to the Central desk in natural gas, I would say she should be set up similar to Denver Plachy.

Please shout with any questions or additional information that you may need.  Thanks.
