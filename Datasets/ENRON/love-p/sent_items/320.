Boy did you call it 3 months ago....WE SHOCKED THE WORLD!!!!  What a great game.

I just wanted to thank you again for the great tour we had on Friday.  Everyone talked about it all weekend and we look forward to the expanding projects at the raptor center and hope to be able to help in those efforts.  It was great meeting you and I look forward to talking to you again in the future.

Thanks again.
PL

I'm planning on it. In fact, I talked with Joe Shelnutt a little while ago
and reminded him I'm bringing you guys out there after 1 pm.

If you want, I can plan to meet you at Chuck's at 12:15 Friday.  How many
in your party?

PS...After watching us the past 2 games and watching UF against LSU, I
revise my earlier prediction and now am thinking it is not going to be
pretty.
