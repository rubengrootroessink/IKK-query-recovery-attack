This book simply replaces a book that we were officializing for position purposes only.  We have a separate gas daily calc that is for value that goes into our P&L.  Nothing has changed with that book.  Please shout with anymore questions.  Thanks.

Phillip,

Is this new book (?Y) going to roll into the Intra Ontario DPR or have its own?  We just want to make sure we pick up these new gas daily rolls.

Thanks,
Amanda

Amanda,

Can you check with Phillip and find out the details on this book.  From the description, it looks like they are trying to get spreadsheet information into RiskRAC, however I am not sure how this will impact our process, if any.

thanks
