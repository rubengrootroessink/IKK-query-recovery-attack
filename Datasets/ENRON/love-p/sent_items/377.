I have never heard of this location.  I only see a basis and index curve for this, no intra month, Storey has this location in his curve file.  We have no deals at this location.  Does Canada?  We do not do the pub posting on Mich_CG-GD, rates does this one.  I would think they should post the NGI as well.
