Isn't it crazy.  Someone is selling a risk management book that they gave us in a class here for $900.  Unbelievable.  I am putting stuff out there tomorrow when it comes in.  We have a signature shop here that we can buy that same sleeve of balls for $4.

   That's the address that I sent it to that was returned.

   Went to Florida yesterday morning and came back this morning.

   I think they have finally changed the way our addresses work.  It
is
   phillip.m.love@enron.com for now.  We will see if it changes to
UBS.
   Where
   are you traveling to today?

      I saw that in USA Today as I was getting on a plane this moring.

      I tried to send you an email to enron.com day before yesterday
and
   it
      was returned saying it didn't exist.  Curious.

      Looks like due to the Enron debacle, you guys can make some
   money...On
      Ebay the cups I sent you are going for $50 and higher.  Make
your
   money
      while you can.
