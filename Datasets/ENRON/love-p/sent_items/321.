Phil,

Please see the attached file with the current structure for Central Gas desk by trader.  For each trader, these are the books that he/she trades.  I am assuming that this list by trader has all books whether active / inactive.  Please review and ensure that all books with or without positions are being captured by traders.  Can you respond by Friday, Oct. 12th.   Thanks.
