sounds good, I heard from Bruce that the booking is not going to well.  I don't think it is that complicated, but I will be happy to do it tomorrow.  Any luck on getting it into an existing book and not having to calc another book from here on out?  Hopefully we can do it tomorrow since it is not going live until 11/01.  Talk to you in the morning.
PL
