Phillip,

Another request - can you provide a report that breaks out the monthly physical volume for the NSS 2 program starting in March 01.

Thank you,

Lee

I think I have all of the financial liquidations that were in your book from 3/01 - 09/01.  Look at the attached file and let me know what you think.  Thanks.
