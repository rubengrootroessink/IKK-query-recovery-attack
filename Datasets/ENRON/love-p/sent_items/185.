Phillip,
I spoke with Kam this morning, but she had to go to a meeting at 10:00am.  I am going to come back down to the 5th floor at approximately 11:00am to finish our discussion.  I'll see you then.
Zac

I just got back from lunch, when you get a chance, please stop by and we can talk about you coming to risk.  I sit at the end of the row at the row behind the flag that says gas risk management.  Thanks.

Phillip,

As Ina probably told you, I am without a phone at this time, but I left you a message earlier.  Send me an email when you get back to your desk so that we can talk about whatever it is that you need to discuss.

Thanks,
Zac
