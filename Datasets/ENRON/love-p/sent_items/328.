Yes it will.  This deal is still in the structuring stage.  We simply wanted to get the books set up in TAGG and Sitara for if and when this deal goes live.  I will keep you posted.  I think that logistics is also going to be setting up a pipe called MGU that will have all of these deals on them.  I will get with you when I hear the final so that we can map the correct curves to these locations.  Thanks.

A new Central desk has been set up "ENA - IM MGU" in Sitara.
Is this a new physical desk that will need to have it's positions rollup into the "Central Region Intramonth Position".
