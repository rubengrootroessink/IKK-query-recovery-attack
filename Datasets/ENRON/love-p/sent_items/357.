I think you will have to log off.  I approved the request.  Look at the status of your request and see if it says final approved.  If it does than try logging off and trying again.  Thanks.

Phillip,

I tried Sitara out.  Do I need to log off to get the sitara updates?  Or is that a different group I need to contact??

Thanks
Jim

I'll come by tomorrow, if you have time, for a TDS lesson.
