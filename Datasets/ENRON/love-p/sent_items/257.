Here are the instructions for adding the correct drivers for Weapon X.  Keep for your future reference.
You might want to forward to Chicago office - I have not done so.

Thanks

   Here are the configuration requirements for WeaponX in our environment in Houston. -
 
   You need the following ODBC Drivers configured, You can access this by
   Start->Run and typing in ODBCAD32
