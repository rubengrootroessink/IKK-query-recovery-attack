I am booked on a flight 1 week from Friday 8th of February - I land in Birmingham at 9 a.m.  I should be to Huntsville by 11 a.m.  I am staying until Sunday.  I think Ashley and Jackson are going to stay here for now unless you report granddad is doing much worse next week.  We will see how that goes.  Talk to you soon.  Did you call last night?
