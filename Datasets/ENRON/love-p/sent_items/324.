FYI we will be having a meeting next Wednesday from 1:30 to 2:30 with logistics in 32C2 to go over what risk does and what logistics does.  Should be an informative session.  Please also remember to email your goals for the next six months so that we can work on making sure you meet those objectives.  Thanks.
