Phillip,

I am the recruiter you spoke to today about Chuck and other opportunities.
Thanks very much for your time.  As discussed, I've attached my contact
information for your records.

You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
have built relationships with many energy companies in North America

arrangements to talk again.  Thanks.
