I am not familiar with Wyatt Howell, but I have been away from Winston
County for 35 years.  I have complete confidence in your recommedation.  I
would like to get this over with as soon as possible, so please proceed with
the attorney of your choice.

Dianne

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his
office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign but I
have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing
as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like to
associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Tammy

Legally I cannot contact her since she is represented by an attorney.  I
will follow up with Jeff.

I have heard nothing.  I have been out of town for about 12 days and have
just returned today. I thought there might be a response from Jeff but none.
I will follow up.
