The only books that should still have deals in them, other than NG-Price, will be 

Intra-Ont-Cad		all canadian gas daily deals
NGPR-Can
Oil-NG-Spec
Ft-Ont-Central		all consolidated price/basis deals

these books will still have to be calculated after today.

All counterparty deals were moved over the weekend but any remaining desk to desk deals were not touched.  We need to move those ourselves today.
All others need to be calculated and officialized one more time today then inactivated on the Rac website for tomorrow.
