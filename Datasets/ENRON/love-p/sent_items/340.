sorry to keep bothering you.  It looks like Souad's VaR continues to go down, but her net positions 5 contracts and her VaR is over $300K.  Can you verify that it is her Aruba book that is causing all of the VaR.  She only has positions at about 5 locations and they should all be mapped to the same omicron curve and either NG or Chi. Gate.  I would think that there would not be that much difference between NG and Chi Gate.  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

 Bharat ,
 I've done the mapping of omicron but you need to contact book administrators to do the sec-prim. mapping as I don't have permission to do that.

 Thanks.

GDC-CHI./N/BORD: Map to NGI/CHI.GATE and OMICRON_11

GDP-EMERSON: Map to NG and OMICRON_5

IF-MONCHY: Map to NG and OMICRON_5

IF-NGPL/OK-NW: Map to and OMICRON_11
