Congratulations on winning the auction on EBay for the Enron Values cube.  Please let me know if you will be paying by PayPal(alove@houston.rr.com) or by money order/cashier's check.  As soon as I receive payment, I will mail the cube by priority mail.  Please send me your mailing address.  If you respond during the day, respond to this email address, the alove@houston.rr.com is for my home account and I can not access it from work.  Thanks again.
