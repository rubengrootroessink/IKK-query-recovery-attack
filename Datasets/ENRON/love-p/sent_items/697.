From the way it is looking now ... I gave my money away anyway.

Subject:	League Dues

I have some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.  The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.  So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.  

Sorry guys
