sorry I did not get back with you last night, we were up in Navasota all weekend with some friends enjoying the clean and quiet country air.  We also went to the Renaissance Festival.  Things are getting pretty hectic around here.  There are a number of individuals who are responsible for destroying one of the best companies in America in less than a year.  It is all pretty amazing and really still has not sunk in.  We are all just trying to continue with business as usual and hope for the best.  If I do get laid off, I just hope to get a really good package.  

How are things in Denver?  Good I hope.  How is that baby?  Is she getting bigger?  I hope so.  Drop me a line and let me know what is going.  Thanks for the call.
PL

Hey.  My friend Chad (i think you remember him) just moved back here from Houston and is currently in job search mode.  He is in the same field as you..and worked for Raymond James in Houston.  He has some pretty good leads here..and some may pan out for more than just him.  Once he has things settled...meaning when he has a job he will be helpful to you.  Once I know more I will let you know.

keep going in the toilet on Wall Street.  My 2,000 options are now all
worthless.
