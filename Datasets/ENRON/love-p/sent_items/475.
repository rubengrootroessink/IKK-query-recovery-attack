I am still here.  I have a contract through March 1 of next year, so I should be here at least until then.  The absolute destruction of the company has been pretty brutal - some of the people lost everything in their 401K.  I guess they really believed in the company.  We should still be in town in Feb. just let us know when the party is and we will be there.

whats up man?

How are things with you?  Hearing all the news about Enron and all, figured
I see how you are fairing.  I really hope that your not effected by all the
bs.  We are doing well here.  Getting cold, but hey, its Norway right?  We
have starting building a house and its going well.  I figure it will take
about a year to get it all done. I would like to do as much of the work
myself, but I will see how long that goes.  Anyway, The Family and myself
will be in Houston in late Feb.  We are having a small reception in Clear
Lake and would love to see yall there if you can make it.

Let me here from you soon, hope all is well with you and the family.

Tell your moms whats up from me.

Tommy
