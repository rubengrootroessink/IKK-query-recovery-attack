I fixed 1127631, the other deal , I do not have a confirm from you on and it is already priced at NX1 + basis.  Please let me know if you need something further on these deals.

Phillip,

Co-Steel is claiming to have triggered two deals for Nov-01 production - 1127631, 1131418.  However, these are not triggered in the system nor can I ascertain who the trader is.  Will you verify / change these deals accordingly, please.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier
