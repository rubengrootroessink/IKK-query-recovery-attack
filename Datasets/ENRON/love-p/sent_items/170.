You know you got me all fired up now, I am going to put on the full court press to keep the tradition alive.  I am attaching a map from El Cajon to Houston for driving directions.  They say it will take 24+hours, I calculated the time and I think the jilly mobile can do it in 20.  Ashley is probably going to drive the Burban over to NO and I am going to fly because of work.  So you guys only have to drive to Houston and she will do the rest.  Sounds like a good idea to me(yeah right).  I will even throw in a Love trip back to SD this summer/fall if I can get a visit in April.  Two for one baby, you can't get a deal better than that except at Costco.  Plus, I almost forgot the best part - we have a little TV for the burban so you could get a little MLB 2001 action on the way.....(give me enough time and I will keep it coming)

P.S. - we also have the Milton's bread here(so you can make sandwiches for the trip to NO)

PL.
We are doing good. I hope all is well with all of the junk you are going
through.
It looks like Steve went out on top! I think that the Chargers are too cheap
to hire him. Emma
is doing great. I liked the pictures that Ash sent. Jackson has a hat on and
there is a joker
on a pogo stick. Also the picture of J Bug and Tory was great. Trying to
impress the
ladies with his musical talents. I think that the tradition may end this
year. I know that
if we came we would have to drive. Denise will not fly.
We are going to miss you this year. There will probably be some great acts.

Talk to you soon.

Jilly With It

What is up my California buddy?  Staying out of trouble?  Things are going
pretty good here.  You believe Steve Spurrier?  IT is a great deal for
Auburn and the SEC.  Time for a new dog to get on top.  What is my little
friend Emma beans up to?  I bet she is growing and talking up a storm.  Are
you guys coming to the Fest this year?  Just to offer you a little
encouragement, I found a special fare for you out there on southwest non
stop both ways....here is the link.  Only $250 a person.  Let me know big
dog.  You know we can not have the tradition ended.
