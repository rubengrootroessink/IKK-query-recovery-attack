These pictures are from an accident that involved an 18 wheeler carrying
fuel through Birmingham.  Supposedly, a car trying to exit onto an off ramp
cut in front of the truck from an interior lane.  The rear quarter panel of
the car hit the truck sending it out of control.  The driver of the car was
not injured, but sadly, the truck driver died when the load exploded.  Here
are the results of the fire to the roadway.  Unbelievable!
