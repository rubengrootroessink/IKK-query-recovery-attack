and for those that are email challenged(Scott Palmer) you sent it twice.  Don't worry, we do not have to worry about O'Neal, Sunday is not daylight savings time.  I got them to move the tournament two weeks so we could count on O'Neal for the first game.

Our first game is at 9:00 with the TechnoSapiens on field #3. A map is attached. I paid the $10.00/person fee today. If you could give $10.00 between now and the tournament, I would appreciate it. 


Again, for those who have difficulty with the time of day (O'Neal), that was 9:00 am. See you there and let's have fun.
