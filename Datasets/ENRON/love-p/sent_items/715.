Can you do me a favor similar to Kam's previous request:  Can you add to my current profile all the books that Scott Palmer currently has calculation access to.  Could you also set Bruce Mills, Kristen Clause and Edward Brady up like Scott Palmer.  Additionally can you also set up Ashley Worthing like Anne Bike.  Thanks for you help and shout with any questions.
