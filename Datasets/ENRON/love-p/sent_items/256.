I can not remember if I called you Friday or not.  Let me know when you want to get together and go over the consumers stuff.  Sorry if I forgot, the mornings are the best for me.

How is this week to look at Consumers?  I have a spreadsheet put together back to Jan 00.  I have not made it to 1999 yet, but I'm working on it.  I'm available any time this week.  You name the time and place and I'll be there.
