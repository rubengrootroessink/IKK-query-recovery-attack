standard reply is that we will be working on the last day and no one knows what it will be like.  Make a reservation and we will do our best to get you out.  The problem is I am sure everyone wants to get out for New Year's Eve so you might generate hard feelings.  I have nothing to do because I consider it to be the most dangerous night of the year and I always stay home.  You decide what you want to do and we will work around it.  If you stay here, I have always heard the Hyatt has a great party and room rate all included.  I am sure other hotels have the same.

I'm trying to figure what kinds of plans to make for New Year'sEve, but i hear conflicting stories about work on Dec. 31...I hear that it's a half day of trading and half of zero is zero so I'm trying to understand what could make it a long night...Ideally I'd fly into New Orleans New Years Eve and com back the next day...What are the possibilities of making an evening flight out...
 
If I can't make it to N.O...what kinds of things do you know of to do around her for New Years? Remember, my little woman is not yet of legal drinking age so bars are out of the question...
 
thanks
