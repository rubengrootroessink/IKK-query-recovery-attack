Phillip:
The accountant that took the Consumers account from me last month has left the company this week without getting them paid for October.  I am now trying to tie out their October invoice.  Please let me know the correct pricing for the deals below.  

Deal 1086060	Consumers billed all of the gas at 0.03.  We have various prices.  Consumers Contract 5030-82-99
Deal 1029516	Consumers billed 0.05.  We have 0.025.  Also, I think the sign is wrong on the price.  It should be negative.
		Contract 5030-82-97
Deal 1075510	Consumers billed 0.03.  We have 0.015.  Also, I think the sign is wrong on the price.  It should be negative.
		Contract 5030-82-96

Also, they billed us for contract 5030-82-98 which I do not see in the system --  2,000 @ 0.01.

There are also some deals in the system that Consumers did not bill us for, deals 1029566, 881687, and 1087206.  Please let me know what I should do with these.

I will not be in the office next week, so please respond to Lisa Valderrama.

Thanks,
Megan
