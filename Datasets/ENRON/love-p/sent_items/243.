Once again, it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know.  I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule:
Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.  If that happens to be midnight, sorry.  That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.  Sorry I have to be a jerk, but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.  Thanks for your help in eliminating this in the future.
