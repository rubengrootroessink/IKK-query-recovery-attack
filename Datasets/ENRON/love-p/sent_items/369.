separate region.  It is within the Mich P&L.  Also starting in October, Central transport will no longer be in FT-OC, it will be in Aruba and needs to continue to roll up to Central.  Do I need to call you back?

P LOVE,

For September OA, do you want Ontario broken out as a seperate region or rolled into Central region? 

Thanks,
