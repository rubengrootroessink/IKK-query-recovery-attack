Good morning,

I am Lisa Guilliams and will be taking over the responsibilities of Rachel Crowell for Portfolio Accounting.  I have been in training for the last week with Rachel, and hope to make a smooth transition into my new position.  I am transferring from ENA Reporting for various Support Departments, so this is a new experience for me.  Rachel is transferring to Gas Accounting.

Attached are the October 2001 variances between the Risk P&L and the General Ledger.  Please review the items and make Schedule E adjustments for the items that belong to you.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

In future months, I will provide this at least one week prior to month end.  I apologize for the delay this month.

I look forward to working with you,
Lisa Guilliams
Portfolio Accountant
713-345-4077
