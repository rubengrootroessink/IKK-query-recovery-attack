FYI - since we are moving this weekend, do not put your trader packets on your trader's desk tomorrow night.  Give them to Bruce(since he is the slowest) and he will bring them in Monday morning and distribute to our trader's.  Everyone needs to be here by 7 a.m. on Monday in order to answer any questions your traders have and test out your systems.  If things are messed up, we want to get the IT people first.  Thanks and shout with any questions.
