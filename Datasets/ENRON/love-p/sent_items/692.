Subject:	TDS Physical Position Problems

We have discovered a problem with physical positions in TDS.  Changed deals potentially can double up the deals volume in TDS.
The TDS group worked late Monday to try and resolve the issue, but failed.  Please let your traders know that the physical positions
cannot be completely relied on.

I have also left a message on you phones to get this message to you.

Thanks
Russ
