work with ed on this and please do this asap.  Check the rest of your books as well please.  Rember this will be any deal with Transcanada and any other canadian counterparty.  Or search in TAGG for your book with ECC as the Enron counterparty - should take 5 minutes.  Thanks.

Hey Phillip,
 
Could you please make sure these two deals get flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.
 
Y20134.1
Y20477.1
 
I need to invoice for them this afternoon.  Please let me know if you have any questions on these, and when
they've been flipped.
 
Thanks
Stacey
