I want to keep the two ladies that currently do my OA.  Any deviation from this will result in bodily harm to you and your family.

All,

I am currently reviewing the OA assignments for each desk to determine whether I need to move employees to a different region.  Please let me know if you are satisfied with your OA coordinator.  This will ensure that each of you are getting the proper level of support that you require.  In addition, if there is anything that you think we can do better either as a group or on an individual basis, I welcome that as well.  Thanks.

John
