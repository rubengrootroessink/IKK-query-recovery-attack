I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding EBay=
's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person that yo=
u outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would suggest=
 you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.  =
I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm=
 your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your payment =
if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than some of the=
 balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid $60 will re=
spond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene o=
n your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it look=
s like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at
$6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry i=
f
you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these ball=
s
were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment,
but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not,
I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
possible.  Thanks.
PL
