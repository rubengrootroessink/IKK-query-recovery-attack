As I said, take it up with EBay or the individual you outbid.  I see your max bid says $1600, an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless EBay made a mistake.  For the last time $61 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend, you won by a dollar.  You can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not.  Per the attachment I sent, you have another 5 days to decide to pay or get Ebay to adjust it or I will seek payment through them.

I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding
EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person
that you outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would
suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest
bid.  I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to
confirm your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your
payment if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than
some of the balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid
$60 will respond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to
intervene on your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up,
but it looks like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

   I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid
   at
   $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am
   sorry if
   you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these
   balls
   were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
   higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an
   adjustment,
   but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
   planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If
   not,
   I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
   possible.  Thanks.
   PL
