Enron's Lay could get $80M from deal 
Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.
The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.
Enron's shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.
