Congratulations on winning the auction on Ebay for the sleeve of Pinnacle Golf Balls.  Please let me know if you will be paying by PayPal(alove@houston.rr.com) or money order/cashier's check.  I will mail the balls priority mail as soon as I receive payment.  Thanks again and use this email address if you reply before this evening, alove@housotn.rr.com is my home email and I can not access it from work.  Thanks again and look forward to hearing from you soon.
