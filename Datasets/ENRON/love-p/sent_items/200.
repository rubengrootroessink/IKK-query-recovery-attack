Dinah or Karla,

We have been experiencing some call volume on active employee's who are receiving term packet information from Hewitt, but are still active in the system.  Do you know why that is?

Please advise.

Thanks.

P.S. Phillip - I show Melissa active in SAP with no future term action out there.  Thxs, Irma

Melissa Videtto received a termination package over the weekend and should not have.  Can you please confirm she has not been terminated so I can send an email confirmation to her manager and herself?  thanks
