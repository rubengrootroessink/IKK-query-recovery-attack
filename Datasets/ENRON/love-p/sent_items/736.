X-INFO: INVALID TO LINE



> COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Football practice was delayed on Monday for
> nearly two hours at Texas A&M University.
>
> One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look
> down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery substance on
the
> practice field.
>
> Practice was immediately suspended by Coach R.C. Slocum while the FBI was
> called in to investigate.
>
> After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the foreign white
> substance that they found was the goal line.
>
> After the substance was identified as the goal line, the FBI went on to
> comment that they believed there was no threat because there appeared to
be
> little or no chance of the Aggies coming into contact with that line...
