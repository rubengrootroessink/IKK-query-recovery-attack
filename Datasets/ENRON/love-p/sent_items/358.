Please forward to your master email list of all of the risk management/OA g=

We are planning a group outing for a road trip to The Coushatta Casino.  Th=
e trip will be via chartered bus(yes there is a functioning toilet on board=
) and beverages and snacks will be provided(alcoholic and non-alcoholic).  =
We are planning on leaving the Enron building at 6 p.m. on a Friday and ret=
urning before 6 a.m. on Saturday.  For those of us that run books, if we ar=
e not done running our books by 6 p.m.  we will need to come back on Sunday=
 between 4 - 6 p.m. to sign off with the Benchmark guys.  If you do not wis=
h to go on the trip and you are not done by 6 p.m. on Friday, simply finish=
 your P&L and hedge strip and your lead will sign off with the Benchmark gu=
ys.  Here is the issue, we have selected two dates, please respond which da=
te you prefer and if either date is good for you.  We have to have an accur=
ate head count to give to the bus company.  If we guarantee a number and th=
at number does not show, the trip is cancelled per the bus company.  If you=
 agree to a day and we provide the final head count a week in advance, barr=
ing an emergency, it is expected that you will attend to keep the trip from=
 being cancelled for all of your teammates.  The dates we have selected are=
 Friday October 19th and Friday November 9th.  Please respond to AC by 5 p.=
m. Monday October 8th.  Thanks and we look forward to another fun outing.
