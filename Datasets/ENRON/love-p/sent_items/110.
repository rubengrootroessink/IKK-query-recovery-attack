yes, I am interested in your Golf Balls..
Please email your best price for all of them shipped
priority mail insured. Priority mail usually runs $5
for a dozen plus $2 for the 1st $100 of insurance.. I
can send payment via paypal for them.
If you have a picture showing the boxes that would be
great also.
