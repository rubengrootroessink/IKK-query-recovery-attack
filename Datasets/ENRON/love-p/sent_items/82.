 work out a negotiated payment with you since I was willing to take your wo=
rd you made a mistake, but you have been very rude from the beginning.  Goo=

I THINK IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THESE DOCS YOU'LL  SEE WHERE THE PROBLEM IS.
THEWAXOH'S BID APPEARS AT 2236HRS FOR 60.00 MY BID APPEARS  ABOVE HIS AT  1=
647 HRS FOR 61.00 NOR 16.00 AS SEEN ON THE ACTUAL BID  DOC  AT 2236HRS.=20
THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE BUT IT'S NOT MY DOING IT LOOKS LIKE  EBAY'S
PS NOTICE THAT THEWAXOH IS SIMILAR TO THORHAWK. MIGHT BE AN  INPUT ERROR BU=
Y NOT BY ME =20
