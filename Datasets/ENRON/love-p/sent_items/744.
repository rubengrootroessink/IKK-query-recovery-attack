I wish you would come back - it would give our stock price a shot in the arm...press release...DK is back at work!!  I will talk with DG and get with you on a date, we are pretty busy around the holidays, maybe we can hit something up during the week.  Does Gary get home at a decent time during the week?  I now am over the east desk, so my hours recently increased.  We will see.
PL

Let's work around y'alls schedule because we have no life now that we have a
baby!!!  Just kidding.  We are open to any evening.  What works best for you
guys?  Let's plan a date so I don't forget about your genorosity....

How is work?  the morale?  Do I need to come back and get things
straightened out?  Are you working late?
