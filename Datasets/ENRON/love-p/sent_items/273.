Subject: 7 new terrorists identified in Alabama


Latest news reports advise that a cell of 7 terrorists has been operating in the Alabama area. Law enforcement officials advised earlier today that 6 of the 7 have been detained.

The FBI stated that the terrorists bin Fishin, bin Huntin, bin Drinkin, bin Cussin, bin Fightin, and bin Dippin Skoal have been arrested on Immigration charges. 

The FBI advised further that they can find no one fitting the description of the seventh cell member, bin Workin.

Police are confident that anyone in Alabama who looks like he's bin Workin will be very easy to spot.
