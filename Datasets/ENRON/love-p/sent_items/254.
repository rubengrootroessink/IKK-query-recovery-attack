Subject:	We found more physical index deals booked incorrectly by EOL, today

Guys:  Just a reminder to have everyone check their physical Index deals carefully.  We have been discussing this issue with Tara and thought that it was a one time issue that had been resolved, but today, Tuesday, we found that EOL is still booking certain Fiz Index deals incorrectly.

Look for a 0.00 in Basis.

On most of ours the deals did not show up in any of our calcs because the Nymex reference is not populated.
