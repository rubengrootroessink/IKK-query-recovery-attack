I like the name.  I think it is beautiful and distinguished.  I hope she is at least six feet tall.  There is nothing wrong with a tall drink of water.  Gotta run and get some work done.  PL

Thanks!  I don't know if it will be Mallory.  I know both my parents strongly do not like the name....Jason is in love with it.  What do you think of it?  She will be tall...hopefully she will stop before 6 feet!

   Hey.  My friend Chad (i think you remember him) just moved back here
  from Houston and is currently in job search mode.  He is in the same
  field as you..and worked for Raymond James in Houston.  He has some
  pretty good leads here..and some may pan out for more than just him.
  Once he has things settled...meaning when he has a job he will be
  helpful to you.  Once I know more I will let you know.

  Subject: new job
  what is this I hear that you may have a new job for me?  I hope so, we
  keep going in the toilet on Wall Street.  My 2,000 options are now all
  worthless.
