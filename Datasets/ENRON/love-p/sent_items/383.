we should be in Auburn in plenty of time for lunch, but I would like to get
your phone number so that I can call you if we get held up in traffic or
flight delays.  We arrive in Atlanta at about 9:30 auburn time and should
be to Auburn well before noon, but with everything going on, I an not sure
of our arrival time.  Looking forward to it.

   I checked with Joe ... 1 p.m. will work fine.  Our new $500,000 worth of
   construction will be finished and in use by then, so I'm really looking
   forward to showing you the place.

   If you guys would like to get together for lunch before that, Chuck's
   barbecue is right around the corner from the Raptor Center.  I could
   meet
   you there.  Let me know.  Just learned our Miss State game will be on
   espn2
   at 6 p.m.  I hope we put on a better show for TV than we did the other
   night.

   You are right, that game was very difficult to watch.

   I know we were scheduled to take a tour around 3 p.m.  I was wondering
   if
   we could move it up to around 1 p.m.  We are going to be getting into
   Auburn before lunch time on Friday and we have some friends coming that
   have never been to Auburn and we would really like them to see the
   Raptor
   Center.  Even if Tiger is not going to be there, we would still like to
   have a look if that is feasible for you.  Maybe if we move it up to 1,
   she
   will still be there.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks and look
   forward
   to seeing you in a couple of weeks.

   War Eagle.

      Phillip ...  hope all is well there in Houston.  We are still
   wondering
      what we ran into at the Carrier Dome.  I thought Lawrence Taylor had
      retired, but apparently he is still playing and wears number 54 for
      Syracuse.

      In any event, I have learned that the School of Nursing is having a
   fund
      raising event on Friday, Oct. 12, from late afternoon through the
      evening,
      and Joe Shelnutt will be taking War Eagle to that event.  That of
   course
      means he and  Tiger won't be at the Raptor Center at the time we had
      planned to go out there.

      Do you guys want to try it on another trip to Auburn?
