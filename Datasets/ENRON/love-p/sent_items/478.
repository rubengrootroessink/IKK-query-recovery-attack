I have inactivated the following books on the website(all risk types) please verify they are inactive:
FT-VNG
FT-VNG-Storage
FT-VNG-Trans
Intra-VNG-Phy

There should only be one active book under VNG is FT-VNG-PMT-PRC(we will inactivate after value liquidates this month).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
