just confirmed it with the Vet school.  They asked we "keep it quiet" because they had to sign a confidentiality agreement saying it would not be promoted.  He said as long as the wind is not too strong, she will fly in the first 45 minutes of the show.  Record it and we can watch it when I am there next Friday.
