According to Hully - we have a game tentatively scheduled for tomorrow at 7 p.m.  He needs to know ASAP who can play because of some snafu at the Y(we were supposed to play last night and they forgot to call him).  Let me know today if you can play and I will let him know so he can call the Y.  Thanks.
