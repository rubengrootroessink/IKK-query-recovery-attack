FYI, I will show you how to work this spreadsheet, just call this guy and tell him what you are going to name the file and why.  Tell him it is like Brian Gillis' file in Canada.  He needs to know the prefix you are going to call the file and then you attach the current date in the MMDDYYYY format.
Thanks.

Note that you must also get Wei Hu to set it up so that it will accept the spreadsheet - he will need a name that you will use - an example is CAND_ED10122001.xls
