Bruce Mills called me.  He said you told him to work on it with me.  I left him a message on Friday, but I haven't heard back.  Below is my spreadsheet of the variances.  Why don't you take a look at it and let me know if you have any questions.  I have compared what Consumers invoiced to what we have in Unify.  I haven't made it through 1999 yet, so that tab is blank.  I need help on the deals that have differences and the ones that Consumers did not invoice me for.  I have tried to highlight them all in red.  I can come down in the morning to go over it with you, if you have time.

Megan

I can not remember if I called you Friday or not.  Let me know when you want to get together and go over the consumers stuff.  Sorry if I forgot, the mornings are the best for me.

How is this week to look at Consumers?  I have a spreadsheet put together back to Jan 00.  I have not made it to 1999 yet, but I'm working on it.  I'm available any time this week.  You name the time and place and I'll be there.
