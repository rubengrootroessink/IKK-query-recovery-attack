just a status reminder of what is going on:
-Please give me a list of your goals and objectives, we will plan on meeting at least once a month and going over those to determine how I can better help you meet those and we can track progress.
-We now have a file in the central file in excel entitled project list central desk.  there are a list of projects already out there that each of you need to sign up for.  This will assist in the PRC process in terms of providing me with examples of things each of you are doing that are contributions to the organization.  If you can think of a project that will be an improvement, please add it.  If you add a project, put an expected completion date and then put the date it was completed.
-  We will meet this week or first thing next week to go over the status of each of your "training plans"
