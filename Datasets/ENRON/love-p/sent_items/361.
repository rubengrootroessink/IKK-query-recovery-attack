FYI - Andy and Martin will be giving classes to the trading track guys on the two different locations.  They are opening these classes to everyone.  I would recommend that you attend, I am going to try and attend as well.  THE ONLY CATCH IS THERE WILL BE A TEST AT THE END AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SHARED WITH HUNTER.  I think it would look very good if you attend, I only caution you to pay close attention because the two guys have been known to ask tough questions.
