what is up rob?  I still have a picture of the four of us on top of that mountain in California with dirt all over us from riding those four wheelers when we were in 9th grade.  I am still here for now - no jokes about the demise of the big E.  Pretty rough carnage through here.  I am sure you guys in California are loving it.  I will give you my secondary email if in fact I am one of the next one's out - plove@houston.rr.com.  Ev just had a baby boy last week - he was one month early and the boy still weighted 9 lbs. 5 ounces.  21 inches long.  His name is Devon Lamar.  Ev has changed companies - his new email address is ESmith@kanekatexas.com.  I am sure he would love to hear from you.  Hope all is well with everyone.  
PL

If the words Camino Vice or Bowl Brothers or Vice Dolls mean anything
to you at all you, then you've got to respond to this e-mail.  Why?
I don't know, I just thought it might be fun to talk to you all (ya'll)
again.
