Kam Keiser suggested I call you to help with a request I received from our auditors.  Can you give me a list of all of the deals that have been put into Sitara for the Chicago office - the book/counterparty name will be Enovate.  The Arthur Anderson auditors have requested this information.  They are doing an audit of Enovate and want a list of all of the deals since the book started in order to get a sample size for their audit.  you should not have to go back farther than 01/00.  Thanks for your help and shout if you need anymore information.
