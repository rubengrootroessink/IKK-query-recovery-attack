The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Thanks

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call
