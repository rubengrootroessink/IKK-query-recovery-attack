What is up my California buddy?  Staying out of trouble?  Things are going pretty good here.  You believe Steve Spurrier?  IT is a great deal for Auburn and the SEC.  Time for a new dog to get on top.  What is my little friend Emma beans up to?  I bet she is growing and talking up a storm.  Are you guys coming to the Fest this year?  Just to offer you a little encouragement, I found a special fare for you out there on southwest non stop both ways....here is the link.  Only $250 a person.  Let me know big dog.  You know we can not have the tradition ended.
