no thanks necessary - you have done a great job - now keep it up.  The courts are going to rule if some bonuses can be paid out - there are no guarantees, so I would not count on them approving it.  They are supposedly negotiating to have us stay on 5 & 6.  Nothing really new on those fronts.

There were a few more questions that I had about the new developments but i figured it would be easier than going to a conference room to talk about it...
 
First of all, i am glad that i get to remain in this group of people...i think that there could be plenty of good opportunities surface from this.  Second, i appreciate you, or whoever it was that chose me, having the confidence and faith in my ability to get the job done.  I definitely take that as a compliment and a challenge to continue to perform well. Who was it that bought us?  Didn't you mention something about going to the courts looking for money for performance bonuses for those of us who are continuing on to SwapCo?  How soon will we know if we'll be able to remain in the same building?  
 
that's about all that i can think of...if you get any more news today, please send it my way too...

 
See you Monday...
