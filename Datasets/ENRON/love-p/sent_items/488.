Phillip:
Here is the spreadsheet I received from PSEG regarding the price issue with deal 759607.  It looks like our price does not include the fuel percentage for any month or the change in GPS beginning with August.  I have highlighted these rows on the spreadsheet.  From their spreadsheet, we have under billed by $350K.  Please review and let me know what you think.  I also have a copy of the confirm from PSEG if you need it.
