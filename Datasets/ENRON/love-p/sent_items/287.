That is cool . The price per loaf in SD is about $ 2.95 at Cost co . The
soup would be a good idea
as it is starting to get cold. I think we tried on line and it had to be
bought in the store.

We have actually been able to find that bread here at Sam's, so we are
absolutely set man.  If they stop selling it, we can get it over the
internet, it is just a little pricier.  You need to get us to start buying
it here and shipping to you man - Sam's has it for less than $4 a loaf.  I
think Ashley said it is close to $6 in San Diego.  We still need to get you
some soup don't we?

   We went to a place called Carpenteria. It was on the beach near Santa
   Barbara. We totally roughed it,tents and all. How is your bread
   situation ?
   Do you need a new shipment?

   We went to the game.  unfortunately, I picked up a cold from being out
   in
   the rain all night Friday and Saturday, but we had a blast.  A win cures
   everything.

   We are now ranked #20, we were previously unranked.  Where did you guys
   go
   camping?  Do you rough it all the way?  My idea of camping is watching
   TV
   outdoors.

      I did not. We were out of town camping. I did see the score and was
      happy to
      see that they
      roughed up Florida. What is their rank? Were you at the game?

      Everything is going good. Say hi to Ash and J-Bug.
