I figure you are going to turn around and sell them on Ebay(current price is $77).  So, I will sell you the two pinnacle cases for $250, roughly $31 a sleeve.  I now have two cases of the titleist golf balls that will also sell at the same price.  I can send you a picture tonight, when I get home.  I can ship tomorrow or Saturday, I will pay for the shipping.  If you are interested, let me know.  Thanks.
PL

yes, I am interested in your Golf Balls..
Please email your best price for all of them shipped
priority mail insured. Priority mail usually runs $5
for a dozen plus $2 for the 1st $100 of insurance.. I
can send payment via paypal for them.
If you have a picture showing the boxes that would be
great also.
