looks like Florida will not be very good next year.  They are losing their best players to the draft.  All three of their receivers and their best cornerback and offensive linemen have now declared for the draft today.  Add to that they can not get a coach to sign on.  Shanahan just turned it down, they are now going to New Orleans offensive coordinator.  See what happens.  Did you get your pool cover fixed?

I've been following the story in the paper since last week.  If you look
real close at the story though, you'll see that all these national
offensive leads were for small schools (NAIA, Division 1AA, etc.).  But,
still good news.  I forget the name of the Jaquars quarterback, but he
has nothing but praise for Petrino.

Now, if we can just get a defensive coordinator.  Wouldn't hurt to have
some defensive players too.

Things are okay here.  Kind of cold.  Ready for spring.

Saw this morning we hired Petrino.  I did not realize how successful he
has been at the college level.  Three times his offenses have led the
nation in offense.  He also did a good job with Quarterbacks.  He has
three playing in the NFL now that he developed.  I think this might be a
real good move.  How are things there?
