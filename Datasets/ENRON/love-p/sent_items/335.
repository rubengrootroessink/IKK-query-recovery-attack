Can you run a component VaR report again for me.  We can not figure out where Souad's VaR is coming from.  IT fixed the curves and Burton fixed them on his side, the VaR should be virtually nonexistent.  I am also noticing a high VaR for Virawan Yawaponsiri, can you also run one on hers please.  Sorry to continue to bother you with this, Jeff Gossett just wants this resolved ASAP.  Thanks.

 Bharat ,
 I've done the mapping of omicron but you need to contact book administrators to do the sec-prim. mapping as I don't have permission to do that.

 Thanks.
