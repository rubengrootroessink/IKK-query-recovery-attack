Subject:	RE: Estate

Just a couple of points that I am not sure I mentioned to you:

1.	I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease the
house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She
obviouly has not done that.

2.	The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to
take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in
Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his
estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and had
not been formally appointed.

3.	Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him to
pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm
surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.

With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to
court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:

1.	The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are put
back in to the estate.

2.	The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.

3.	The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her
distribution.

4.	The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in April
1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of the
estate.

5.	If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's
death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.

6.	Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as
executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.

7.	Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me and my
family.

I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am willing
to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's
death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as his.  I
will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy left
to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while he
was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay the
value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car for,
but that she did not put in the estate.

I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been very
busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need a
new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.

I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

Dianne

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his
office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign but I
have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing
as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like to
associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Tammy

Legally I cannot contact her since she is represented by an attorney.  I
will follow up with Jeff.

I have heard nothing.  I have been out of town for about 12 days and have
just returned today. I thought there might be a response from Jeff but none.
I will follow up.
