is

overwhelming

surprise.
> As a career soldier and a student and teacher of military history, I have
a

> This war will be won or lost by the American citizens, not diplomats,
> politicians or soldiers. Let me briefly explain. In spite of what the
media

among

don't

> The many parallels that have been made with the Japanese attack on Pearl
> Harbor are apropos. Not only because it was a brilliant sneak attack
against
> a complacent America, but also because we may well be pulling our new
> adversaries out of caves 30 years after we think this war is over, just
like
> my father's generation had to do with the formidable Japanese in the years

> and we must not underestimate the power of their moral commitment.
> Napoleon, perhaps the world's greatest combination of soldier and
statesman,

the

> committed are we, America? And for how long?
> In addition to demonstrating great moral conviction, the recent attack
> demonstrated a mastery of some of the basic fundamentals of warfare taught
> to most military officers worldwide, namely simplicity, security and
> surprise. When I first heard rumors that some of these men may have been

> not a random act of violence, and we can expect the same sort of military
> competence to be displayed in the battle to come. This war will escalate,
> with a good portion of it happening right here in the good ole' U.S. of A.
> These men will not go easily into the night. They do not fear us. We must
> not fear them.
> In spite of our overwhelming conventional strength as the world's only
> "superpower" (a truly silly term), we are the underdog in this fight. As
you

> any indication, our enemy is ready and willing to die to the last man.
> Eradicating the enemy will be costly and time consuming. They have already

the

worked

software

are

hoping

stomach

defeated

in

also

facilities.

mistakes,

certain.
