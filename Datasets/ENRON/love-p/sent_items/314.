Kam Keiser suggested I give you a call, the auditors have requested all the deals for the Chicago office books.  I need to get a list of all TAGG deals since 1/00 that are done with the book FT-ENOV and INTRA-ENOV.  Is this possible.  I need to give a list to Arthur Anderson as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help.
