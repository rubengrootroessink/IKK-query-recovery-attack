Thanks for the EOL products email.  I am attaching the curve files. The CA Basis is the California markets and the West Basis is Rockies and SW.  The third file is the GDI curves.  Please review and let me know if we need to make any changes or additions to this file.  They are pretty simple and straightforward and do not link to anything currently.  Let me know what you think.  I am sending them in three different emails because of the size.  I will have the physical/GD curve file to you by Monday.  Thanks.
