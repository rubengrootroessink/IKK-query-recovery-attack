The Raiders have always been my team. The Chargers are my Home team.
I will ask about the Vegas weekend.

What????  I thought that was your team?  I am a big raiders fan and I hope
Chucky gets that ring this year.  Hey, FYI, we are getting a guys trip to
Las Vegas for the first weekend of March Madness if you are interested -
March 13-16th.  Got a room at the Mirage and it is $120 per person for the
three nights.  I figure air fare is pretty cheap from SD, let me know if
you are interested.  Take care.

   that is absolutely hilarious.  I have heard a rumor that the Chargers
   are
   considering moving to LA....Is that correct?  That will be absolutely
   horrendous.  I saw the game of the century the other day on ESPN
   classics...Chargers vs. Dolphins 1983.  Truly awesome.  My man at the
   time
   Winslow(racist) got carried off three times.
