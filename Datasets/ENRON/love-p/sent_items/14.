   There are rumors around here that all the employees going to the new
   company
   - UBS Energy will be taken off of the Enron servers tomorrow.  If this
   is
   true, I do not know what or when my email service at work will be back
   up.
   Please send in the mean time any emails to plove@houston.rr.com.
   Thanks.
   Hope all of you are doing well.
