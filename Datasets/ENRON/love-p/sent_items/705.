we flashed this as Union, they subsequently moved the volumes on GL to CPR pipeline exchange.  you have to look at both to get this to reconcile.  Does this make sense?  If not, give me a call.  Thanks.

I do have this deal under CPR Pipeline Exchange but if I move this $635,999 liquidation to Syn Strg I end up with a variance exposure of $1,237,227 on Syn Strg.  Our flash for Syn Strg is volume of (189,279) and ($1,058).  No volumes have been booked yet.  Should there be another liquidation?

looks like this deal got zeroed out and rebooked on #1019677 look and see if you see this - CP should now be CPR pipeline exchange.  No variance should occur.  Thanks.

I'm still showing an open item for Union Gas Purchases - Liquidation 972214/VU3457.1 in the amount of $635,999.94.  Any info on this yet?

Thanks!
