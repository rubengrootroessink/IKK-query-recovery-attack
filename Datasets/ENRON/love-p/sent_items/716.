Thanks.  It has also been a pleasure working with you.  I am sure our paths will cross again in the near future.  Thanks for all of your help the last year.

Hey, just wanted to say CONGRATULATIONS on your move to the EAST!!  I will miss working with you.  Also, you've done a great job of training your  guys on FLASH.  It is getting easier every month!!  (at least for me)

Thanks again and Best of Luck,


Natalie Baker
