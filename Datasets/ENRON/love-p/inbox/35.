I would like to meet today, preferably this morning to discuss the attached form and the status of the various gas books.  If you have any questions, please ask.

Melissa, please set a meeting up as soon as possible today.

Regards,
Ed

Do we want to go over this with Fallon again or just send it to E&Y?  This is the first one I have received since requesting that interco be pulled out.

Shona,

Here is our updated form A without intercompany deals.  Included on the last two tabs are the details they asked for from gas.

We are still working on the contracts and confirms.


Thanks
