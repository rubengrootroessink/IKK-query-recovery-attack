From the State where drunk driving is considered a  sport, comes a true story
from Oklahoma. Recently a routine police patrol  parked outside a local
neighborhood tavern.
Late in the evening the  officer noticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated
that he could barely  walk. The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few
minutes, with the  officer quietly observing.
After what seemed an eternity and trying his  keys on five vehicles, the man
managed to find his car which he fell into. He  was there for a few minutes
as a number of other patrons left the bar and  drove off.
Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it  was a fine
dry night) flicked the blinkers on, then off, honked the horn and  then
switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward
a few inches,  reversed a little and then remained still for a few more
minutes as some more  vehicles left. At last he pulled out of
the parking lot and started to drive  slowly down the road.
The police officer, having patiently waited all  this time, now started up
the patrol car, put on the flashing lights,  promptly pulled the man over and
carried out a Breathalyzer test. To his  amazement the Breathalyzer indicated
no evidence of the man having consumed  alcohol at all!
Dumbfounded, the officer said "I'll have to ask you to  accompany me to the
Police station this Breathalyzer equipment must be  broken."
"I doubt it," said the man, "Tonight I'm the designated  decoy."
