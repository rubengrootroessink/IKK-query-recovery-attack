This is what has been suggested for future brown bags:

		
How hedges work (physical deals)/Why we book term deals in two systems
Curve mappings
How physical deals flow through our systems
What the financial desk does
	(EFP posting, Brokered deals, etc.)
Curves, how they are set, how deals value against them (MTM)
Overview of Power/Weather/Coal      (I vote for Phillip for this one)
