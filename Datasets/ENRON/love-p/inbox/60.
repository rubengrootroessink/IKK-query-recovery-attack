We just wanted to let you guys know of some changes in order to keep the te=
rminations being processed in a timely manner.  It appears that all Netco e=
mployees may be taken off of systems access for Enron this weekend.  In cas=
e this is true, Darron and I have transitioned from handling these requests=
.  Greg Couch is going to be leading the estate risk effort and Pat Ryder a=
nd Chance Rabon will be handling all termination list issues.  Please send =
these lists to these three people in lieu of Darron and I.  As a side note,=
 could you send an updated financial termination list(if this list has chan=
ged since you sent it to me Kim) to these guys so that they can verify deal=
s are moved to the proper book.  It is probably a good idea for future term=
ination scripts to come through Greg before going to IT because of several =
book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to Ed McMichael.  For examp=
le the price book has been basically split into three books.  Please shout =
with any questions or concerns you may have.  Thanks.
