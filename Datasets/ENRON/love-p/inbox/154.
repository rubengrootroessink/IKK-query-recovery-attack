Sorry bro I guess I don't have you in my address book, I included people
that were in my hotmail address book.  I actually have been twice since we
went.  Once for a bachelor party that was crazy and then a couple of weeks
ago when I only got 4 hours of sleep the whole weekend.  The last time was
pretty cool because we played Texas Hold'em the whole time out there.  I
had never played poker in Vegas before but it was pretty fun.

Anyway I just thought I would see if any of you guys need a hook up.

Take care man.

Kyle

what is up with leaving me off the email this morning?  You don't want
me to come work for you too?  My feelings were hurt.  Hope things are
going well in San Antonio.  We need to get back to Vegas so I can gamble
away what is left of my retirement.
