Brian invited his mother over for dinner. During the course of the meal, Brian's mother couldn't help but keep noticing how beautiful Brian's roommate, Stephanie, was. Mrs. Hester had long been suspicious of a relationship between Brian and his roomate Stephanie, and this had only made her more curious. Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, Mrs. Hester started to wonder if there was more between Brian and his roommate, Stephanie, than met the eye.
Reading his mom's thoughts, Brian volunteered, "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you Stephanie and I are just roommates."

About a week later, Stephanie came to Brian saying, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful
silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?" Brian answered, "Well, I doubt it, but I'll send her an e-mail just to be sure." So he sat down and wrote: 
"Dear Mother, I'm not saying that you 'did' take the gravy ladle from the house, I'm not saying that you 'did not' take the gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner."
Several days later, Brian received a letter from his mother that read: 
Dear son, I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Stephanie, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Stephanie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now." Love, Mom

LESSON OF THE DAY.........NEVER LIE TO YOUR MOTHER 
[Peterson, Phil] ....and mothers are sneaky.
