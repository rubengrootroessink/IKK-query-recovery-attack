Dr. Love:

I am the Director of Finance at Memorial Hermann Southwest Hospital and we
are looking to hire an Accountant with 2-3 years experience.  The person in
this position will initially fill the role of Cash Auditor as we tighten our
cash controls throughout the hospital and have the potential to move into a
more analytical role.  The candidate should have experience with cash
reconciliation and  internal controls enforcement.  I have attached the job
description and would appreciate it if you would circulate.

Interested candidates should forward resumes to me at
pauleanne_lewis@mhhs.org


Thank you, <<Cash Auditor.doc>>
