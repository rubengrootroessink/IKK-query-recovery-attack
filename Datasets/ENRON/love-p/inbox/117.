this is the best I can do scaling the recipe down.
1pt heavy cream
1 oz chopped onions
1 oz chopped red pepper
.5 oz chopped jalapeno
1.5 oz tequila
.5 tsp chopped garlic
1 oz butter
cornstarch
water
chicken base or boullion cubes
melt the butter in a heavy sauce pan
add the onions, red and jalapeno peppers and garlic saute until onions are soft.
add the tequila cook to reduce the liquid by 1/2 
add the cream stir bring to a boil and simmer for 3 minutes
add 2 tsp of cornstarch with water to make a slurry
slowly add the slurry to the sauce stirring all the time until your sauce is as thick as you would like it.
add the chicken base to taste.

Regards

Chef Robin.....
