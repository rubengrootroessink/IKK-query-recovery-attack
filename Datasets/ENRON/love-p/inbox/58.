I believe Priscilla is asking if VNG is to pay Transport for 6-10/01 on these deals. The demand charges for these months were reversed 1/15/02. I was not part of this. Can you answer her questions. Thanks.

Please have someone check on the following deal number and the reversal of charges.

#602019 -	June 01, July 01, Aug 01, Sept 01, Oct 01

#602021 -	June 01, July 01, Aug 01, Sept 01, Oct 01

#602027 -	June 01, July 01, Aug 01, Sept 01, Oct 01

#1020386	Oct 01

#602028	Oct 01

I believe what has happened is that we reversed all these charges for Nov 01 so that VNG would pay all their own transport and these months got reversed as well.

Please have someone notify me when I can see the corrections in Unify.

Thank you for your assistance.
