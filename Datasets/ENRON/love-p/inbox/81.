Plove,

You once asked me to let you know when the next Special Olympics event I would be involved in would be. It will be the basketball tourney Feb. 23 and 24 in CyFair ISD school gyms. The day usually start at 9:00 and end at 3:00 or 4:00. (volunteers do not have to stay the whole day) Let me know if you and your wife are interested. Thanks.
