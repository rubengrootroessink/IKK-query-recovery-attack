Phillip,

I apologize that it has taken me so long to send you an e-mail like you asked us to, but I just wanted to send some suggestions/thoughts about things on the East Desk.

1.  I really like the idea of weekly meetings.  Especially in the new building where we will be spaced out and not all sitting together, I think it would be good for team unity.  Even if the meeting is only 10 minutes long, it gives the group a chance to talk about what everyone is working on and projects that we can work with others on.  Also, with people joining East and leaving East, the meetings could give us a chance to get to know each other better.  I realize that meetings are not necessary every week, but 2 or 3 a month have very helpful and beneficial for me.

2.  We were all going to give a small "lesson" on an area of our jobs that we have a strong knowledge about and present it to the others in our group.  Jeff has already given a lesson on NX3 Basis positions.  Although the lessons may be a little nerve wracking, I think they would be very useful to continue.  For example, the subjects of Liquidation, Storage, and OA are all areas I would like to know more about.

That's it really.  Thank you for all of your help so far with the Gulf4/5 "merger".  I am really excited about our new group and I can't wait to move to the new building.

Thanks,
Melissa
