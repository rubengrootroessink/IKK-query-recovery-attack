Hey-
 
That's really weird that you never heard back from Steve.  Next time I talk to him I'll ask him what's up.  Maybe he never got it...who knows.
 
Life is good.  We find out next week what we are having...can't wait.  I have held off buying anything until then.  This week I have to go clothes shopping.....I hate shopping (believe it or not).  I am finally starting to show, and not just look fat, so that's good.  Nothing much else is new.
 
I can't even believe my parents are going to Vegas...I am certain my mom won't want to go back.  She will think it's a waste of time/money, but my dad loves it.
 
How is Jackson?  What is up to now?  I am sure he can carry on a full conversation by now.  Every time I see Auburn on TV I think about you and calling...but figure probably not a good idea b/c you are busy watching the game.  Catch 22...
