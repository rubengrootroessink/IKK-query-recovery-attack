It's clear the Ebay made the error in this  matter.
They are not being forthcoming about it however. I'am  continuing to communicate with them but they are being less that  honest.
I am not going to pay what I did not bid.
Since Ebay is the culprit here we are caught in the middle  
I'd refrain from leaving any negative at my site, until this  matter can be resolved, since I would have to respond in  kind.
