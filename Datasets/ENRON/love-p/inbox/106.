The current schedule is :
    
    Oct : Kam  (I forgot what topic you were going to do)
    Nov :  John - a revisit of OA (this time with a working overhead)
    Dec :  skip - I suggest we skip Dec since there will be quite a few vacations taken, holidays, etc.
    
    For the other topics, why don't you decide among yourselves, who is going to do what and when.  Please just let me know so that I can be sure we have things scheduled for Jan going forward.
 
Let me know if you have questions.
 
Greg
