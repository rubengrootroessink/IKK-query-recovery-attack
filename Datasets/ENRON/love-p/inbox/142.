Hey...at least you were able to have a relaxing weekend.  I have seen this happen before in companies (not as good as Enron) and it's a miserable place to be.  Moral sucks for sure.  Sounds like you have a good attitude about it all.  Maybe now is a good time to skim through the Denver Post or Rocky Mountain News to see what the market is like here.  I really do think you can work about anywhere.  Just have to make the decision about Mom...and maybe you can convince her to come here too.
 
Dad said he invited you to the Rockets game Sat.  You should feel pretty special...it's his b-day (56).  No worries on you not being able to go....Auburn vs. Alabama is a huge event! 
 
The pg. is going fine...it seems like I am getting bigger everyday.  It's really nuts.  I'm not too big yet, but I finally look pg. and not just fat..which is totally nice.  Good luck with everything, Rach

sorry I did not get back with you last night, we were up in Navasota all
weekend with some friends enjoying the clean and quiet country air.  We
also went to the Renaissance Festival.  Things are getting pretty hectic
around here.  There are a number of individuals who are responsible for
destroying one of the best companies in America in less than a year.  It is
all pretty amazing and really still has not sunk in.  We are all just
trying to continue with business as usual and hope for the best.  If I do
get laid off, I just hope to get a really good package.
How are things in Denver?  Good I hope.  How is that baby?  Is she getting
bigger?  I hope so.  Drop me a line and let me know what is going.  Thanks
for the call.

   Hey.  My friend Chad (i think you remember him) just moved back here
  from Houston and is currently in job search mode.  He is in the same
  field as you..and worked for Raymond James in Houston.  He has some
  pretty good leads here..and some may pan out for more than just him.
  Once he has things settled...meaning when he has a job he will be
  helpful to you.  Once I know more I will let you know.

  what is this I hear that you may have a new job for me?  I hope so, we
  keep going in the toilet on Wall Street.  My 2,000 options are now all
  worthless.
