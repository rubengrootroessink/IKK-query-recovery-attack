I think we should also put the position report file in there that Jad/Couch created as a backup to the CEPos/East Positions.  Couch can you put the query file you set up for the price desk?

Jeff was able to create a Netco file under O:\erms\erms_adm without an erequest.  There is a file for each region out there now.  I will save the new p&l to each region but could each of you please pick an p&l from your region as a back-up just in case. 

these are the files I know of

Exotica
P&L
Hedgestrips
All excel queries
Weapon-X & new version
Access financial reports
Exotics file
Transport model
Curve files


Do you guys have anything else?
