The following guidelines should be followed in determining the kind of application data and databases that should be migrated to UBS.

1. As a general rule, all Enron data relating to or used in connection with the trading of North American Gas and Power (Netco's commodities) should be copied and the copy transferred to Netco.  This includes forward curves created in the past and data on commodities that are relevant to the pricing of Netco's commodities (i.e., coal and oil).  Data on other commodities should not be copied or transferred for Netco.  In all cases, a complete copy of the data transferred to Netco must be retained by Enron.

2. There are three important exceptions to the general rule:

a. With respect to trading counterparties, only contact information and Enron created trading profiles may be transferred to Netco.  All other information concerning a trading counterparty, including credit information, historical trading data and terms of trading contracts with Enron, may not be transferred without the express written consent of the trading counterparty and the approval of the legal department.

b. With respect to other third parties that have entered into written agreements with Enron, such as brokers, software vendors and market data vendors, only contact information may be transferred to Netco.  All other information, including pricing, concerning the contractual relationship between Enron and the third party may not be transferred without the approval of the legal department.  In many cases there are confidentiality provisions in these agreements requiring the consent of the third party prior to the disclosure of confidential information.

c. Historical data provided to Enron by a third party data source may not be transferred to Netco without the approval of the legal department.  In many cases, the contracts governing the data preclude its copying and transfer.

If you have any questions concerning these guidelines, please contact Regan Smith at x39291.
