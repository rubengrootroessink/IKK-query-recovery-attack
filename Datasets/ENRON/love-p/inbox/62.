There is a P&L Summary for east desk in the Netco directory located at O:/ERMS/erms_adm/Netco/2002/0102/Regions0102/_Converted/East P&L Summ. Please take a look at it and tell me what you think. To simplify and speed up the reporting process, I added buttons that will link to the P&L's. The format may or may not resemble formats used on other desks, but I do believe the data shown is comprehensive.

Errol - This may not fit your needs on the financial desk. You may need to design your own. If so, let me know if I can help. 


Thanks.

Scott
