I thought about that email during the game Saturday. But of course, going
into the weekend I had lost ALL optimism because I had seen us play
barely-above-average football and I had seen UF light up everybody. But how
about that crowd! And we were without several defensive starters, including
number 54 in the 2nd half.  Truly astounding.

I was sorry Joe wouldn't let us go over to where some of the birds were
stationed, but I take it he sometimes has the sense that certain times are
just not good for the birds. And he's always going to do what's best for
the health of the birds.  In any event, can you believe Tiger flew out over
the Florida section before the game? Someone next to me said, "I hope
that's an omen." Turned out, it was!

Thanks again for your role in the scholarship, Phillip. Vet school awards
night is Monday, Feb. 11.  We'll be in touch later with details, but in
essence it's a 7 p.m. program at the school, usually lasts 2.5 hours and we
have a reception afterwards.

Hope your flight back included some Gator alumni!
