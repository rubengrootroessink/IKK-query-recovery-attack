Phillip,

I think I told you that my boss, LTC Dowling, has decided to retire from the
Army.  He is real interested in moving to Houston.  He has family there.  A
guy he knows (who apparently works for Enron, but I'm not sure) suggested he
try there for a job.  while we were travelling together last week, we were
at Applebys, eating dinner and watching the Astro's.  I mentioned that mys
son's company paid a bunch of money for that stadium.  When Ed heard that,
he asked if you might take a resume in for him.  I kind of volunteered you.
Then I got to thinking, I think I remember you saying that you get some kind
of reward if they hire someone you recommend.

In my opinion, and you know I have those, any company that gets this guy has
found a gold mine.

If it's a problem, I'll understand.  But if it's possible, I'd really
appreciate you taking a copy of this to Enron.  And, by the way, I told Ed
several weeks ago, before I knew he was retiring, that if and when he needed
my help, call me and I'd come work for him again.  So, who knows, if he gets
on in Houston, I might get an opportunity to move there too.

Thanks,

Pop

P.S.  Don't forget, I'll be out of town most of the week.
