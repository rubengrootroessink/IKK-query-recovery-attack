I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at
$6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if
you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls
were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment,
but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not,
I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
possible.  Thanks.
PL
