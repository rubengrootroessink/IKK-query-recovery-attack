CONCERNING THE TITLEIST "ENRON" LOGO BALLS.
THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS:
    1. MY BID WAS FOR  19.99, NOT 61.00
    2. I NEVER PLACED 1,600.00 AS THE  MAXIMUM BUT ONE OF MY BIDS WAS FOR 16.00.
    3. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE BUT I  SURE AS HELL DIDN'T BID A MAX OF 
1,600.00 FOR ANY GOLF BALLS ESPECIALLY ENRON'S.
