Phil,

I have been really busy the last couple of weeks. Well, come to think of it I
have been really busy ever since I started this job. Yesterday, I was in Town
and Country at 7:30 a.m. then straight to Edna, Texas by 11:00 a.m then
straight to the Woodlands by 2:30 p.m. and got back to the house last night
about 8:30 p.m. That has been a pretty typical day when in Houston, and this
morning I was up at 4:00 a.m. to catch the first flight into Austin.
Thankfully, the hard work and long hours are paying off. I have closed 3 or 4
deals now on my own and am further along then they expected me to be at this
point, so I will be in Houston on a more full-time basis in the next couple of
weeks. I will be in Houston on my own all next week ( July 4th week). By the
end of July I should only be in Austin on Monday's, as a day trip, and then in
Houston the rest of the week. I have not yet purchased my airline tickets for
the fishing trip, but I will look to do it this weekend.

Good to hear you are doing well at work.

If you need to get in touch with me, here are all my numbers.

Houston office 713-968-9222
Austin office  512-329-0050 or 800-664-4888
mobile #       281-723-3991
e-mail address bwachsler@cm-ic.com or bwax@ghg.net

Talk to you soon,

Brian
