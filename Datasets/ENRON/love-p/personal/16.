> Dear Ashley Love,
>
> Thank you for joining PayPal, the #1 online payment service with

>
> Below you will find some basic information about your PayPal account,
> and a quick summary on how to get started.
>
> We hope you enjoy using PayPal!

> ----------------------------------------------------------------
> HOW TO SEND AND RECEIVE MONEY
> ----------------------------------------------------------------
>
> Sending Money - To send a payment, login to your PayPal account and
> click the "Send Money" tab. Just enter the recipient's email address
> and the amount. You can pay with a CREDIT CARD, CHECKING ACCOUNT, or
> funds already in your PAYPAL ACCOUNT. We send recipients an email to
> let them know you've paid; they can pick up their money at PayPal.
>
> Receiving Money - When someone sends you money with PayPal, the funds
> automatically appear in your PayPal balance. You can then WITHDRAW THE
> FUNDS from your PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer to
> your bank account or a check sent to you by U.S. mail.
>
> Spending Money - Instead of withdrawing funds, you can also spend money
> with PayPal in a variety of ways:
>
> *  PayPal Shops - Visit over 10,000 ONLINE STORES that all accept
>    payments with PayPal. Just click on the "Shop" tab on our homepage.
> *  Online Auctions - PayPal is currently accepted on over 3 MILLION
>    AUCTIONS.
> *  Personal Payments - Use PayPal to pay rent, split a dinner bill,
>    or plan a group event.
> *  Any store on the web - Click the SHOP ANYWHERE link and choose
>    a store. PayPal generates a virtual MasterCard debit number that
>    lets you pay with the funds in your PayPal account.
>
>
> ----------------------------------------------------------------
> HOW TO ACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT
> ----------------------------------------------------------------
>
> Register a credit card or checking account - To get started sending
> money, you need to ADD A CREDIT CARD or CHECKING ACCOUNT to fund your
> payments. Look for these links in the "Activate Account" box when you
> login to your account. For checking accounts, there is a brief
> CONFIRMATION PROCESS after you register.
>
> Verify your account - For security reasons, new users have a Sending
> Limit until they verify their account.   To verify, just register and
> confirm a checking account. This INCREASES THE SECURITY of the PayPal
> network by demonstrating that you have met a bank's approval process.
> You can register a checking account by simply providing us with the
> publicly available information at the bottom of a check.
>

> HOW TO ENHANCE YOUR ACCOUNT

> sign up, just look for the "Money Market" link on the "Account Overview"
> page.

features
> and more by UPGRADING TO A PREMIER OR BUSINESS ACCOUNT.  Just login to

> *  Debit Card - Sign up for a free PayPal Debit Card to get INSTANT ACCESS
>    TO YOUR FUNDS. You can use the Debit Card to withdraw your money at
ATMs,
>    or spend it anywhere Mastercard is accepted. If you are an eBay seller,
>    you can also earn 1.5% CASH BACK on debit card purchases - essentially
a
>    70% rebate of your PayPal fees - by joining the "PayPal Preferred"
program!
>    For more details, visit the "Sell" tab after logging in.
