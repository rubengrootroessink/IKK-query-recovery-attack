Phillip ... greetings from Auburn, where in 9 days the eagle will fly, the
stadium will rock and the tigers will welcome ball state to our newly named
"jungle."

WE have this week received the $12,500 matching money from Enron.

Also, can you email me your work number again. I think the dean of the vet
school wants to call and say thanks for setting up the scholarship.

I still have you on my calendar for a tour of the raptor center on Friday,
Oct. 12, the day before we (am I getting giddy here?) shock the number one
ranked gators.
