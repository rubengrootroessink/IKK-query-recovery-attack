Phillip,
I wanted to get back with you on Calpine.  My co-worker said that they are
not going to be hiring until after the 1st of the year.  They need people
desperately, but they just don't have it in their budget for this year.  I
will keep you posted on other things in the meantime.  Thanks!

Jennifer
