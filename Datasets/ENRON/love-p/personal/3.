Hi Phillip,
 
Thanks for your winning bid on the  Alabama-Auburn record.  Sorry, I don't take Paypal. I would prefer a  cashiers check or money order, or if you can stand the wait, a personal check  will do.  I will send it in a Priority Mail envelope sandwiched between  several layers of corrugated cardboard and I will insure it.  The total  will be $47.60. My mailing address is:
 
Tim Cocker
141 McCallie Lane
Lookout Mountain, GA 30750
 
Hope you enjoy it.
 
Regards,
Tim
