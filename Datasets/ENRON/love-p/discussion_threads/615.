Please provide interview feedback (YES, NO, MAYBE) on the following 
candidate(s).    If NO, briefly state why and include if this person is still 
a good fit for Enron and we'll search other opportunities for them.    If 
MAYBE, give time frame of when you'll have a final answer.     (All NO 
external candidates will receive a "Decline" letter.  If internal, a phone 
call from me).
