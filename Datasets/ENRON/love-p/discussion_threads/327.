Subject: TDS Physical Positions

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping


 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks
Russ
