Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.
