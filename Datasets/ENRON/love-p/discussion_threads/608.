Phillip/Milton

Phillip, this liquidation looks like it relates to Reliant contract 813, 
Sitara deal  459075,  which was booked as a physical storage withdrawal for 
January production in the January GL.  I don't normally see liquidations for 
physical storage.  Is there anything else you can tell me about this?

Milton, can you confirm that this is really physical storage?

Thanks,
Cathy
