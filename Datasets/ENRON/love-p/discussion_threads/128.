The benchmarks looked great last night,  Central had zero plugs.  You all did 
a great job.


 Thanks,

  Kam

I just wanted to thank everyone for their work last night on the Benchmark.  
It looks infinitely better.  I would appreciate any input on how we can 
continue this effort going forward.  Thanks again for all your help.
