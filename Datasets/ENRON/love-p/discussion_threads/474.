Jeff and Kathy,

After much testing, the logic will be placed into production this evening 
that will book the two legs for the counterparties that have master 
agreements with ECC and hit a US product.  I have had Victor Guggenheim 
review the following deals in tagg stage but you may want to review as well 
and let me know if everything looks alright.

QT8025  Dynegy Canada
QT8034  TransCanada

This logic will create the two legs for the price and basis swaps when a 
counterparty with a master agreement with ECC hits a US product.  The first 
leg will be between ECC and the external counterparty and risk assigned to 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS.  The second leg is simply the flip from FT-US/CAND-ERMS to 
the appropriate US book (the book mapped at the product level).   These 
examples illustrate this logic.  This logic is also set up for the 40+ 
counterparties that have the master agreements with ECC.

If you see any problems with the example deals or in the logic described 
above, please call me before end of business today so we can stop this from 
going into production.  Please forward to you groups to inform them of the 
change.  Please let us immediately if something is not correct on these deals 
on Monday.

Thank you,
Dawn
