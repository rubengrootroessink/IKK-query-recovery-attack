Hello!

As we enter the new year, I think we should all be reminded of Enron's work 
hour policies and the environment in which we operate.

Enron supports and encourages flexible work hours (7:30-4:30, 8:00-5:00, 
8:30-5:30, part-time, etc.).  Additionally, the policies allow us generous 
personal time, family time, sick leave, vacation time, etc.  We are supported 
and encouraged to put our health and families first. 

This culture allow us many freedoms, and it does not dictate a 
"clock-watcher" mentality.  However, we are all paid to give Enron a minimum 
of a 40 hour work week (or some other agreed upon part-time amount).  This 40 
hours does not include your lunch hour.  

As you are all aware, many of our fellow co-workers on the 30th floor are 
required to give much more than 40 hours a week.  Please do not abuse the 
privileges we are afforded, and do not tarnish the reputation of our group.

Thanks for all of your hard work and cooperation. . .
Carrie
