That is what I had for your address, just checking.  We had a blast with
your uncles as well.  We were wqanting Bobby, Carl and John's adresses.  I
guess we also need there wifes names, even though we did not meet them at
the wedding.  I don't know what we will do when your parents leave houston.
I guess we will have to make more frequent trips to Denver.  Since I have a
small family and Ashley is so far from her family, it is nice to have
special friends that you consider family.   Plus, you know how special you
have always been and will be to me.

Sounds like work is going great, glad to hear it.  Sad to hear you are
working my kind of hours now.  Work is the same for me, learning a lot, but
counting the days till my rotation to a new group.

Talk to you soon.
