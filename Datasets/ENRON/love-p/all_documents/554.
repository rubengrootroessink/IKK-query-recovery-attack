David, per my telephone message to you today, I am attaching a resume for 
Lena Zhu.  Lena is needing to relocate from our Portland office as soon as 
possible.  We have to find a home for her immediately.  Her choices are very 
slim; therefore, she cannot be very picky at this time.  She was originally 
needing to move out of the program in August, 2001 but her time has been 
extended to December, 2001 at which time, she will need promote to an 
Associate.  Please review her resume and if you are interested in talking to 
Lena, you may call her directly.  I will contact you to discuss your interest.


Thanks in advance for your consideration.
