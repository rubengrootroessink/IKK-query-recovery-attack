SEND US YOUR PHOTOS!

"Memories...all alone in the moonlight..."

Remember that song? Well, now your moonlit memories can be forever captured
in cyberspace. (Well at least for a while anyway!)  We're putting together
an electronic "scrapbook" for our website, and we need your help to make it
truly representative of our class.

So how can you help?  Well, we'd would love it if you would send us five to
fifteen pictures to help us get it up and running.  When you send us your
photos, we'll group them by theme (e.g. "football" or "drama") or by your
name.  If you want, you can even write a few lines explaining each photo.
To see what the scrapbook section will look like,  please visit:
http://www.clhs90.com/scrapbook/

Basically, we think it would be boring if all the pictures in the scrapbook
were of us.  So, please, please, please send us your pictures!  C'mon. It'll
be fun!

If you want your photo memories up on the web, you have a few options.

1.  Mail them to Geneen Pipher-Boyd at 4519 71st Street #1909; Lubbock,
Texas 79424.  She'll scan them and mail them back to you within 48 hours.
2.  Send them via e-mail either as gifs or jpegs  (check for acceptability
of other file formats) to csgp@ttuhsc.edu.

Question: How do I get my photos in electronic format?
Answers:  Use a digital camera to take your pictures. Scan traditional
photos.  This can be done with your own scanner or at a print shop like
Kinko's (most locations offer scanning services for a nominal fee). Finally,
many drugstores now offer to put your photos on a CD-ROM when you take your
film in for processing.

3.  Or, if you're in the Houston area, you can arrange a photo swap with
Kathy (Voigt) Nuernberg. You can arrange this by contacting Kathy at
kathy@nuernberg-online.com .
