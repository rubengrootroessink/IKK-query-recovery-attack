Good afternoon Phillip.  My name is Scott Schaunaman.
We spoke yesterday regarding engineering opportunities
at Enron.  I am currently seeking a position as a
junior-project engineer.

My background is in gas pipeline simulation and design
as well as miscellaneous project management for
pipeline terminals.  I currently work at Fluor Daniel
in Pipeline Engineering.  I am seeking a position with
an operating company as a junior-project engineer with
responsibilities in project cost, scheduling,
engineering, safety, environmental, and construction
supervision for pipeline projects. If you are aware of
any such opportunity, I would be interested in
pursuing a career with Enron.  Please see the attached
resume for more details regarding my qualifications.
If you have any questions or require additional
information, please feel free to contact me via e-mail
(saschaunaman@yahoo.com), or at 281-263-5667. Thanks
for your time and consideration, and I look forward to
hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
Scott Schaunaman

P.S. Great game last night.  I was getting concerned
about losing our first game on our new turf.  The last
2 innings were great.  Have a good one.
