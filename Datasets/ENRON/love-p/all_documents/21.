All,

John Valdes asked us to prepare a list of the items that we need/would like 
to see and when they are needed.  We have been putting together a timetable 
of Gas/Portfolio Accounting data as well and it is included at the bottom of 
this email.  Keep in mind that the timetable for what we would like to see 
and our data is based on all handoffs happening smoothly (ie if the desks 
don't flash until the 3rd workday we know we will not get WACOGS until that 
point).

Here are the items we have come up with to this point as being needed from 
the OA Group:



We would also like to be included in the Regional OA meetings to help resolve 
some matters up front rather than from a schedule.

Here is a timetable for our data:



Additionally, all buyer reallcation entries should be received within 24 
hours after expense hits the GL.


Starting in January 2001 the 1999 OA packages were not produced.  The data is 
still available for research and is included in the matrix detail report from 
SAP.   To keep the number of OA packages to a manageable level we are 
proposing to drop a quarter at a time after we reach 18 months of data.  We 
will drop these on a non-quarter end.  For example, in July 2001 accounting 
we will stop producing the OA's for the first quarter of 2000.  By this point 
PMA's should be minimal and OA variances should be minimal.

Remember that the dates above are a guideline that we are shooting for and 
can change if the handoff of information is not timely.  Each group is 
working to clear the roadblocks they face to make this process work.  The key 
to the process is communication and fixing any problems at their root cause.  
Also keep in mind these deadlines are based on the current 6 workday close 
process.  If close is accelerated, the above will have to be reworked.  
Please feel free to voice any questions or concerns you may have.
