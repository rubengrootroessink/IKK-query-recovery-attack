> Word is circulating around the links that a proposed revision to the rules
> of golf is being sought in South
> Florida that would replace the traditional call of "Fore."
> When a player hits an errant shot, he would be allowed to call "Gore"
> while
> the ball is still in flight. He
> could then replace the ball in the same spot and hit it again. The player
> could do this until he is satisfied the ball is going to drop where he
> intended to hit it in the first place.
>
> A recent test of this new rule was recently played out in an exclusive
> club
> in Palm Beach County, Fla., and the first hole took only 21 days to
> complete.
