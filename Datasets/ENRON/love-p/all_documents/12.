Phillip,
I spoke with someone in our technical team about the ability to provide the 
EnronOnline price reports in a downloadable format.  What I think we can do 
is send a csv file (comma separated values) to the O:\ drive everyday 
containing all of the data that appears in the EnronOnline price reports.  
Then, you could just go in and open that it in Excel or copy and paste it 
from the csv file into Excel, which is easy.  Let me know if I can explain 
this better.  As far as saving it on the O:\ drive is concerned, I am 
currently thinking that we would just create a new folder that EOL can access 
and you can access.  This way, if any other desk has a similar request to 
yours, they can just get permission to access that folder.

We are going to finalize the details, and I will let you know how long it 
will take to get this done.  The technical person who can do it is out of the 
office until Thursday, so I am assuming we won't have a good estimate until 
then.  

I will keep you posted.
Thank you.
Julie

Subject: EOL Gas Prices

I am hoping you will be the right person to talk with.  Rahil Jafry referred 
me to you.  I am the risk management lead for the Central Gas desk.  
Currently our traders utilize an EOL weighted average gas price report on EOL 
to set their curves for the next gas day, i.e. their curves set today for 
tomorrow's gas flow.  I was first inquiring with EOL if they could possibly 
provide this report in downloadable format(excel) and they sent me to Rahil, 
who then sent me to you.  Is this possible?  Please feel free to contact me 
for any additional information or if this is really confusing.

Please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and I will 
start over with EOL.  Thanks for your assistance in this matter.
