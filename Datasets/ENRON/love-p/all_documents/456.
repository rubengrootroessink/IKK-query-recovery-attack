Hello!

I wanted to pass on a compliment that you all received this weekend. . . 

Jason Williams told me that the entire Central risk team was "extremely 
helpful and patient", that you "respond to requests with a great attitude," 
and that he was especially impressed with your responsive to the traders' 
requests even though these things cause you to stay later in the evening.

Keep it up!  You impress people!
Carrie
