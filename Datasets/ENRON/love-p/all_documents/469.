Hi Everybody,
It is hard to believe but our 10 year reunion is fast approaching. I am
trying to organize everything I would like to get a good address on all of
you. The reunion will be September 23rd at the Clear Lake Hilton.  The first
mailout about the reunion is expected to go out in May. I am trying to verify
some address information before then.  If you could email me back with your
correct address, phone number and email address (I assume I have the right
one) that would help.  Next week we will be launching our Clear Lake High
School class of 1990 reunion web page.  You will be able to find out updates
on the reunion and see who is coming and get lots of additional information
on the website.  At least, that is the plan as of today.  If you can spread
the work about the website it would be appreciated.  The address will be
www.clhs90.com.

I will send out more information as I put it together.  If anyone needs to
get a hold of me you can reach me at this email address or my home number
(703) 532-8881.  I hope everyone is doing well and I look forward to seeing
everyone in September.  If you have additional addresses of fellow classmates
you can send me that would be very helpful.

Jennifer Kerber
