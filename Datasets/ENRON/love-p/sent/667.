The Aurora liquidation tagg is N65007.2

The NGPL variance is primarily the following:
                                                           
N50101.X                   2,221.50
              N70658.3              131,316.55            
                                                           
NQ1900.1               (15,596.02)

Sorry, my notes were getting a little hard to follow on some of those cells.  

Thanks

0008 Lone liquidations can you please get the tagg number for the aurora 
liquidation tsf from the East
Is the NGPL purchase variance for roughly $109K part of the the N50101 - syn 
storage?

 WPS liquidation NV8650.1 is a option premium that is being paid on sitara 
#384296 12/00-2/01.  This liquidation needs to be seperated out to its own 
line and split accordingly along the months 12/00 & 01/01 - $116,250 and 2/01 
$105,000.  We should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this 
liquidation will offset.
Take remaining $7K
Thanks.
