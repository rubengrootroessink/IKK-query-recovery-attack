I meant to email you over the weekend to let you know it was on it's way.  
Just be sure to fill out the matching gifts form.  Please let me know if 
there is any hold up on that.  

Looks like we will not make it back to Auburn until the fall for football 
season.  I will give you a call a few weeks before we come in to set up a 
tour of the raptor center/vet school.  Thanks again for your help in 
completing this special occasion for my family.

Talk to you soon.
PL

Phillip ... wanted to let you know the check arrived this past week and
I've taken it to accounting for deposit.  We will await the Enron match.

Thank you again, and especially for thinking about having Enron match the
family's gifts to this memorial scholarship. That will help it add up in a
hurry.

Do you know when you will be in Auburn next?
