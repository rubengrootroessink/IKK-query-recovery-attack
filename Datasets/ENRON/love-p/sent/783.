Thanks for the thoughts.  Sorry it has taken me a few days, work has been 
really crazy.  Sounds like you are doing a little more travelling huh?  How 
do you like it?  I will keep your cell number and try and give you a call to 
talk in real life.  Looking forward to seeing you guys during easter.  
Hopefully we will not be heading to alabama for the weekend.  Talk to you 
soon.  Thanks again.
PL

Hey Phillip-

I am really sorry to hear about your grandfather.  It must have taken alot
of courage to say the eulogy, and I am sure that your grandfather would
have been proud.  If you do want to talk about it in "real life" please
call.  I am on a plane to St. Paul for the next three days, but can be
reached on my cell phone.  That number is 303.669.2296.  I am glad that I
was able to give you some sort of peace, even if it was in a dream.  I
always hate to hear someone I care about is hurt, especially when I can't
do anything about it.

Easter is only 2 1/2 months away........

Sounds good to me.  We just wanted to invite you guys anyway.  We look
forward to seeing you in April.

My grandfather actually passed away on Thursday afternoon and we had the
funeral on Saturday.  I had to give the eulogy and boy was it difficult.  I
bet a stood there for 1 minute without saying a word, unable to hold my
emotions.  I hope I never have to do that again.  Thanks for your thoughts.
I actually had a dream this morning about talking to you about it.  Wild
huh?

Talk to you soon.

Hey Phillip-

I talked with Jason...and I think we have to lean towards not this year.
We (Jason, Drew, I) are coming home for Easter weekend (April 15) and
staying for appx. 5 days.  We can probably only do one....and have already
promised Drew that we would take him to Houston (he's never been).  If I
were single, or w/o child I would be all over it!!

Hope everything turns out ok in Alabama....I'm thinking of you.

Thanks.  I think we have everything covered.  We are taking Jackson, I
believe everyone else is leaving their kids at home.  If you guys want to
bring Drew, we have no problem with that, there however won't be any other
kids his age to play with.  Talk to you next week.
