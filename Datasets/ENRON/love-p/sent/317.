Attached are the spreadsheets you requested.  The first tab - 100 is the same 
sheet as the one we discussed earlier.  The second tab 60.40 is the sheet 
that assumes Tom only gets 40% and Sharpe gets the asset deals.  The third 
tab is the revised summary sheet for all months if the 60.40 split is the 
route we choose to go.  Please feel free to give me a call with any 
questions.  Thanks.
