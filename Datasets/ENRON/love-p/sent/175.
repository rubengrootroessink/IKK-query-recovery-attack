I have even read where Ronney Daniels has said he does not mind having a 
reduced role as long as we win.  Hopefully the good times will continue.  I 
get all of those articles from that website  ww.tigeronline.com.  It is an 
outstanding website.  That article was from the Huntsville Times.  See you 
soon.
