Attached is the file that I use from Storey to load his curves.  It has quite 
a few tabs because he uses the model to track his positions and P&L.  The 
tabs that should be of interest to you are the upload tab - for the curve 
names and the batch tab for the curve prices.  Please give me a shout with 
any questions.
