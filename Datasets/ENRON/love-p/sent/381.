the variances you have listed in january for lone liquidations for NNG - 
QN8046 - this is a storage deal and should go with sitara #588958 and QO0171 
should go with 590922.  We will have the same thing in February going the 
other way with these deals the sitara numbers there are 588959 & 591053 
respectively.  Shout with any questions.  This should explain about 900,000 
of the lone liquidation problem from January.
