Attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for Central 
1 & Central 2.  The total page should tie to what I gave you last week.  I 
highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change.  I 
then attached those days P&L top sheets.  Please review this information and 
let us know what type of detailed support you will need.  Thanks.
