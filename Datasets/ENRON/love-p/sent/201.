Sorry I did not get back with you yesterday.  We have been really busy around 
here.  I called the person that I gave your resume to and she is on a 
business trip until early next week.  Her assistant is going to have her call 
me when she returns.  Apparently she left the day after I gave her the 
resume.  I will keep you informed.  If you look on our website www.enron.com 
and you see anything that interests you, let me know and I will put the 
resume in.  Talk to you soon.
