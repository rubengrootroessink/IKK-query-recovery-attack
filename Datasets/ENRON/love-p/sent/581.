This is absolutely hilarious.  We checked it out on Nike's website and it 
appears to be legitimate.

Hi 
If you've aleady received this, my  apologies. On the other hand, if not, 

please read and forward around the world. 

Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or  phrase 
which they will stitch onto your shoes, under the  swoosh. So Jonah 
Peretti 
filled  out the form and sent them $50 to stitch "sweatshop" onto his 
shoes. 

Here's the responses he got... fun and games with Nike...

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the  following 
reasons: 

1) Your Personal iD contains another party's trademark  
2) Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we  do not 
have 
the legal right to  use 
3) Your Personal iD was left blank. Did you not want  any 
personalization? 
4) Your  Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang, and 
besides, 
your mother would slap us.  
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at  www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD

Greetings, 

My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate  any of 
the 
criteria outlined in  your message. The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes was the word  "sweatshop." 
Sweatshop is not: 
1) another's party's trademark, 
2) the name of an  athlete, 
3) blank, or 
4)  profanity. 

I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor  of the 
children that made my shoes. Could you please  ship them to me 
immediately. 

Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have  chosen 
contains, as 
stated in  the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang". 
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at nike.com  

Thank you, NIKE iD

Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom  ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes.  Although I commend you for your prompt customer service, 
I 
disagree with the claim that my personal iD  was 
inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's  Dictionary, I discovered 

that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not  slang. 

The word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed  for 
long 
hours at low wages and  under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates 
from  1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your 
first 
email. 

Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about  freedom to 
choose and freedom to express who you are." I  share Nike's love of 
freedom 
and  personal expression. The site also says that "If you want it 
done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build  my 
own 
shoes, and my personal iD  was offered as a small token of appreciation 
for  
the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision. I  hope that 
you 
will value my  freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to 
reject 
my order. 

Thank you, Jonah Peretti

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the  NIKE iD 
web 
site that "Nike  reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to 24 
hours 
after it has been submitted". In addition,  it further explains: "While 
we 
honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every one. 
Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of  certain 
professional sports teams, athletes or  celebrities that Nike does not 
have 
the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider  
inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our  products. 
Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to  decline personal iDs that may 

otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you  know if we 

decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to  submit 
another." With these rules in mind, we cannot  accept your order as 
submitted. If you wish to reorder  your NIKE iD product with a new 
personalization please  visit us again at www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request.  I have 
decided to order the shoes with a different iD,  but I would like to make 
one 
small request. Could you please send me a color snapshot of the  
ten-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes? 

Thanks, 
Jonah Peretti 

As one forwarder writes: 

... this will now go round the world much farther and faster  than any of 
the 
adverts they  paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all 

their sweatshop workers in the world to do... 

I normally avoid making a plea to pass on these things,  
but this time I say: 

JUST DO IT
