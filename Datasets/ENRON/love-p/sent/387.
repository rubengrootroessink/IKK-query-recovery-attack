FYI,
The system is now open and you should have recieved an email regarding 
access.  You need to select 5 people to review you.  Please select people 
from different groups and I would suggest putting your trader on the list.  
Also, please send me a list of accomplishments for this six months.  This 
will help me in drafting my review to help represent you in the review 
meetings.  If you were not an enron employee on 1/1/2001, you will not be 
ranked with other members or your job classification, but you will still 
recieve a review.  Please shout with any questions.  Don't forget the 
deadlines from the original email.
