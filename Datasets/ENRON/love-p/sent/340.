FUCH - it is great to hear from you.  How did you get my address?  What have 
you been up to?  

You won't believe it, but I am married(about 4 years) and have a son 
Jackson(not named after Bo) that is 15 months old.  We finally sold our old 
house and moved into a new one, that is about a mile south of my mom.  
Everything is going great for us here.  We are enjoying our new Astros 
ballpark, which happens to be named after my company.  Unfortunately, we are 
not getting any free tickets(at least the little people aren't).

Where are you living?  Are your parents still in Auburn?  How about your 
lovely sister?  I bet she is married with several children.  We go back to 
Auburn every football season for about three games, if you are ever in town, 
we will have to get together.

Clear Lake is having our ten year reunion this fall.  Should be fun.  I think 
you and I are the only two from that school to ever go to Auburn. 

Talk to you soon.
