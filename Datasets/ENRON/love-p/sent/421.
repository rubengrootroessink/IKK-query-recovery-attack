Subject: Gas Curves

Jeff, attached is a file containing gas curves that have been identified as 
being not in the RisktRAC system.  Curves were found to be missing from  the 
Benchmark mapping table and/or the Primary/Secondary curve table.  Curves 
missing from RisktRAC could have a significant impact on positions and V@R.  
Please let us know by Thursday, April 26th, if these curves should be added 
to the RisktRAC system.   For those curves that need to be added to RisktRAC, 
a blank curve request form is also attached. Thank you.


 






SIncerely,

BM
