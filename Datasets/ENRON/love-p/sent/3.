FYI - 
I spoke with Misti Day today regarding negative orig that was flashed and 
booked to GD - Central.  This negative orig(revenue) is being transferred to 
the Central desk to cover the transportation demand charges that were 
incurred related to this orig.  Per Misti, this amount will come through in 
November and needs to be reclassed to July August adn September.  Cathy has 
the correct amounts on her back pages.  Please shout with any questions.
