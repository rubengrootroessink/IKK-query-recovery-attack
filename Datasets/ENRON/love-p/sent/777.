Jim, would you mind setting up a meeting with the appropriate people so that 
we can get this resolved, I was assured by Misti Day the first week of 
December that this would be fixed.  Thanks for your help.

There were two negative originations in the central gas daily book.  One in 
August for $489,600 and one in Sept for $258,000.  The GDCentral book got the 
credit/income for these through our top level origination entries.  

Thanks,
Todd

Misty and/or Todd

Are you aware that the Central desk is expecting negative originations for 
July through September to cover demand reimbursement on Natural Gas Pipeline 
for July through September?

Thanks,
Cathy

Originations are not booked to the GL.  They are entered in the CS module of 
SAP by the portfolio group.  Jim L. then incorporates them in his OA's.  
Misti Day or Todd Warwick would be the one to contact.

Jim

It is my understanding that the Central desk is expecting negative 
originations to cover demand reimbursements for Natural Gas Pipeline for July 
through September 2000.  The amount is approximately $300,000 per month.  Are 
you aware of this and is there anything I can do to help clear this variance?

Thanks,
Cathy
