Well, did you survive the week without your husband?  I am sure things are 
alot calmer now at home.  How is the little one?  Jackson is into 
everything.  Ashley had to go out of town to a meeting on Saturday, so he and 
I hung out all day.  I taught him how to smoke, drink and cuss.  Ash was real 
proud.
