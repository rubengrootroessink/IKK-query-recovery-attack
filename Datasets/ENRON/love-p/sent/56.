Please only vote if you are an AUBURN  fan or REPUBLICAN!!!!!!!!!? We don't 
need democrats messing this one  up!!!!!!!!!

PLEASE ROUTE THIS TO ALL ATLANTA  AUBURN CLUB MEMBERS. VOTE FOR? RUDI FOR
THE
DOAK WALKER RUNNING BACK  OF THE YEAR AWARD (WHICH IS AWARDED VIA?  FAN
VOTING
ONLY).

RUDI IS THE ONLY SEC RUNNING BACK NOMINATED?  THIS YEAR. WHAT AN HONOR FOR
AUBURN !

BE SURE TO TAKE TIME TO  ARRANGE? THE OTHER CANDIDATES (VIA DRAG AND DROP)
SO
THAT THE  REMAINING CANDIDATES ARE? NOT STILL IN THE ORIGINAL  "ALPHABETICAL
ORDER".

RUDI HAS GIVEN? US MANY A SMILE THIS  SEASON, HAS KEPT HIS ACT CLEAN, AND
HAS
ASKED FOR? NOTHING AT ALL IN  RETURN. HE HAS SHOWN US NO "DOWNSIDE".
THIS
IS A CLASS INDIVIDUAL. NOW  IT'S OUR TURN TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO? RUDI
FROM HIS THOUSANDS OF  FANS.

IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS IN OTHER AUBURN? CLUBS AROUND THE USA,  PLEASE ALSO
FORWARD THIS NOTE TO THEM.

IF? SOMEONE HAS THE E-MAIL  ADDRESS OF THE NATIONAL AUBURN ALUMNI ASSN. IN
AUBURN,? PLEASE FORWARD  THIS TO THEM FOR WIDER DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE
VARIOUS
AUBURN? CLUBS  IN THE USA.
