Phillip,

Andy Lewis is setting up a new gas daily index and I need to map the correct 
indexes in EOL.  I am assuming for IF GD/D NGPL MidCont, it needs to be 
mapped as IF-NGPL/MIDCON and I need the GDP index for NGPL/MIDCON.  Can you 
please let me know at your earliest convenience?

Thanks,
Dawn

Dawn and Tara,

Could you please map in TEST the new gas daily index product requested by 
Andy Lewis.  The short name is IF GD/D NGPL MidCont (product #11181).  Let me 
know if you need additional information.

Chris W.
