FYI, Sally is getting an ear full today from the RAC group about 
unofficialized post id's.  We run a macro every night to verify these are 
officialized.  I just want to remind everyone that this is very important 
that we do this.  Our group and Jeff will catch tremendous heat if these 
errors continue.  Again, this is just a reminder, we are doing a good job on 
this currently.  Thanks.
