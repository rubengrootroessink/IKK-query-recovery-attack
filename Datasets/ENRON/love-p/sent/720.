You can ask fabiola.  We are not in a bind we are still waiting on a few 
people to get back with us.  I think ashley was calling Monica and Jaime to 
see if they were interested and Ricky and Tanya.  The only bad thing is they 
have to let us know tomorrow if they are interested.  Sorry you are unable to 
make it, maybe next year.

Hey...it looks like we aren't going to be able to make it.  Jason told me
to go with girlfriends.....and I really thought about it.  I remembered
that I had a wedding in April (girl at my wedding from Tampa) and found out
yesterday that it is April 21.  So..if I am traveling every week and am in
Tampa the 21 (Jason is not going)..and then Jazz Fest the following
week...it will be three weeks that I don't see him.  I just don't think
that is a wise move on my part.  Although I really want to go!!

Does this put you in a weird bind re: not enough people in the rooms, etc.?
If it does, please let me know.  I know Fabiola was leaning on going...so
maybe I could follow-up with her.

Hey girl, you guys figure out about Jazz Fest yet?  We have to pay for the
rooms tomorrow.  I need to know ASAP.  Hope everything is going good.
