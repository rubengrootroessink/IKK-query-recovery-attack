Do you know the names of some good jazz clubs in Chicago?  I figure you spend 
so much time there you can reccomend a few to me.  I have a coworker going up 
there next month and it is their first time to chicago.  I gave them Etta 
James Place to go on rush and on the south side.  Can you think of any 
other?  Thanks.
