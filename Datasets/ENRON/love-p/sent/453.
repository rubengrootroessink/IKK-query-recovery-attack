Dawn,
thanks for putting this information in the paper.  Hopefully a student from 
Haleyville that goes to Auburn in the future can apply for the scholarship.

A scholarship in memory of Dr. W.H. Burgess has been set up at the school of 
Veterinary Medicine at Auburn University.  The scholarship has been ear 
marked for students that are in need of financial assistance and have an 
interest in the area of large animal practice, an area in which Dr. Burgess 
dedicated much of his professional life in Haleyville, Alabama where he 
practiced for 35 years.

If you would like to make contributions to the scholarship in his name, you 
can do so as follows:
Auburn University Foundation
c/o Sam Hendrix
317 South College Street
Auburn University, AL 36849

Please make checks payable to the Auburn University Foundation
Any contributions are fully tax deductible
Any questions, please contact Dr. Burgess' grandson Phillip Love 281-486-7026

Please feel free to modify this in any way.  Thanks for your assistance. 
PL
