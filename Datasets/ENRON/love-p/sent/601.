I am unable to log in the way you suggested.  It is asking for your 
sportsline password when I hit the link in your email.  When I go into 
sportsline and hit march mayhem, there is no place to enter league name and 
password like there is when you go into sportsline fantasy.  Please provide 
assistance.
