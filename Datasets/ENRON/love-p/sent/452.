FYI - not sure if anyone ahs been putting vacation time in on a time sheet.  
I got a report and most everyone's was blank.  If you believe this to be an 
error, see me and I will show you the list.  I am not calling anyone out for 
cheating on their vacation, it is on an honor system with me.  I draw your 
attention to this matter because we always seem to have a problem at the end 
of the year with people having a bunch of vacation and only being able to 
carry over 40 hrs.  Please make sure to plan on taking at least all but 40 
hrs of yours so we do not run into issues at year end.  I have attached the 
site for your time sheets.  You will need your P# and password to access, 
contact security if you do not have either.  If you need help filling this 
out, let me know.  I think we are supposed to fill out a time sheet every two 
weeks, but I only fill mine out when I take vacation.  Thanks.
