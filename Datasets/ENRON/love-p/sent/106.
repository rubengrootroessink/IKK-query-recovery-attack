We are in bid week right now, so I have to work late and can not take 
vacation, so I am catching a 10 p.m. flight out tomorrow and get to auburn 
about 2 a.m.  I will be at your brother's by 7:15 a.m. on game day - you 
better be ready.  I am coming in on Thursday night for the Georgia game and 
may stay in Birmingham that night...any vacancies?  I think we may play golf 
on Friday.
