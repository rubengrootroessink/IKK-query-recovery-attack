Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.  All of the sub books 
associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e. Price, Basis, Index and 
GD.  The trader responsible for these books has been gone for over 6 months 
and all the deals in that book have now rolled off.  If you need any further 
information, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks for your help.
