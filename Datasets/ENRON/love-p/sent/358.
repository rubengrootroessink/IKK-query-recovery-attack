Attached are the fred files for the requested months.  I have to revise the 
0002 column on the summary schedule.  I lumped everything by mistake into the 
FT adjustment column.  We have to have 2 of the liquidations tsf to 
Transport.  On this one, look at the recon variances tab and answer my 
questions.  On 9911 look at the AVAR tab.  The deals highlighted in brown is 
the one that gas accounting - Jim Little should be reviewing.  On 9909 look 
at the AVAR tab and the three deals highlighted in yellow.  You will notice 
some of the same deal numbers here.  Let me know what you think.
