I agree with Bryan.  Judging by the number of email's he is sending, it looks 
like he doesn't have enough work over there.  I am sure the Texas boys could 
use his help on calcing the books.  I will try and limit my smack talking 
next week and I think someone else needs to jam Mick's finger before next 
week's game, it seemed to help him free throw shooting last night.
