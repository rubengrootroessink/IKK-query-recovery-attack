FYI,

I have been notified by Hunter again that any future srew ups are my behind.  
So, please verify your P&L's nightly for accuracy, mainly curve shift and new 
deal problems.  Curve shift reports should be run for all of your P&L's and 
new deals should be tied out before calcing.  I know you guys almost always 
do this, I am just giving you a friendly reminder since Hunter is going to be 
watching us even closer now.  

Also, please remember when we change any deals in sitara to notify the intra 
month trader.  I also heard this request from Hunter.

Thanks again for everything while I was out and keep up the good work.
PL
