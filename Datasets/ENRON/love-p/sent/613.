If you look in tagg, the sitara deal number is in the comments section - 
#372156.  If any of you guys want us to come up and show you how to use tagg 
or what we do to find these numbers, give me a shout.  The deal is 
liquidating in the Ontario book because the Ontario trader did the deal.  If 
that trader does a deal at a US point, the gas has to physically flow out of 
a US book, not a canadian book.  This deal is only for one month, so this 
will not make Jim Little's recurring list that he automatically transfers for 
you guys.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  I also got some 
message from Souad that you need some help with a People's deal.  She thought 
you said you emailed me on the deal and I do not have an email, let me know 
if you still need assistance with that issue.  Thanks.
PL

Phillip,

I have tried unsuccessfully to detemine the SITARA number for
TAGG deal #NW0078.3

I suspect it should be in CENTRAL and not ONTARIO.
Please advise.

Thanks,
Doug
