Glenda,
Hope everything is going well for you guys.  I just wanted to take a minute 
and thank you for the easter  gift you sent Jackson.  It was very 
thoughtful.  He has enjoyed coloring the book and everything else he can get 
his hands on.  He also ate all of the chocolate as fast as he could.  He is 
getting really big and really independent.  We are headed to Jazz fest this 
weekend in New Orleans, I am sure he will really enjoy it this year.  Take 
care and we will talk to you soon.  Thanks again.
Love,
Jackson, Ashley & Phillip
