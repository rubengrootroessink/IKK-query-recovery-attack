Subject: LIQUIDATION SUPPORT FOR JULY 1999

Attached is the liquidation support for July.  I am still in the process of 
tying these deals to the General Ledger and currently the difference is 
sitting in the Texas Region as the problem is most likely related to the 
financial deals on Co. 12.  Please do your research as usual and I will give 
you a detailed list of any changes if it relates to your region.
