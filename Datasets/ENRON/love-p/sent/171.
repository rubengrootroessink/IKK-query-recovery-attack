Congrats on the future addition.  We are all doing good.  Jackson is 20 
months and walking and talking up a storm.  Definitely keeping us on our 
toes.  The program for people with Graduate degrees is the associate 
program.  The person to contact that is responsible for that program is 
Kristin Gandy, her number is  713-345-3214.  I have no idea what all the 
requirements are and when they recruit.  What type of position is he 
interested in - Treasury?  I have some friends down in Treasury that I may be 
able to pass the resume on if you guys would like.  Oil and Gas experience is 
not a necessity, just a plus.  Enron really encourages diversity in every 
form, even experience.  By far the best company I have ever worked for.

Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.
