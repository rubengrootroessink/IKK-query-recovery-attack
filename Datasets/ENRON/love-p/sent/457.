I will leave steve's situation for him to describe.  Needless to say as far 
as I am concerned he wasn't leaving with anybody but me.  

I ran into your dad at the post office last night.  He was standing next to 
the mail slot crying.  It would be nice to live in Denver, just have to find 
a good job so that I can afford housing.
