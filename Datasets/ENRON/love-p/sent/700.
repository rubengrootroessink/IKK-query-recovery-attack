0008 Lone liquidations can you please get the tagg number for the aurora 
liquidation tsf from the East
Is the NGPL purchase variance for roughly $109K part of the the N50101 - syn 
storage?

 WPS liquidation NV8650.1 is a option premium that is being paid on sitara 
#384296 12/00-2/01.  This liquidation needs to be seperated out to its own 
line and split accordingly along the months 12/00 & 01/01 - $116,250 and 2/01 
$105,000.  We should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this 
liquidation will offset.
Take remaining $7K
Thanks.
PL
