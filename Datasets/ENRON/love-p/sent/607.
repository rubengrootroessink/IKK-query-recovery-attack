FYI - those of you running firm books.  These adjustments described below are 
due to firm book PMA's we recieve from Tiffany Miller.  In the future, we 
need to put these in the appropriate schedules - C & E.  Schedule C should be 
used for MTM adjustments and Schedule E should be used for all other 
adjustments.  Shout with any questions.

Subject: Topside adjustments to rolls

Jeff,

I need your help with a few items.  In the DPR rolls for several books this 
month there were topside adjustments inserted.  It was my understanding that 
all topsides would be included on the associated roll schedules (Sch E and 
Sch C).  Investigating all of these is greatly increasing our reconciliation 
time.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Here are a few 
books that had topsides:

MTM Topsides that should have been on Schedule C
GD-Central
FT-Texas
FT-Central
Liquidation topsides that should have been on Schedule E
GD-Central
FT-Northwest
FT-Ontario

Let me know if you need more information or if there is anything we can do to 
help.  Thanks.
