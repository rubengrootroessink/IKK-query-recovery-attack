Can you give me a list of the deals that we have currently on APLP  and NIPS 
- they will both be in the Market CG book.  Patrice is wanting to move these 
deals to a new curve and we are trying to get a handle on the number of deals 
that will be effected.  This will be effective for april out.  Thanks.
PL
