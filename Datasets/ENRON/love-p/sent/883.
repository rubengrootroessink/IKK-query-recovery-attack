Phillip,

This is just a guess for what Hunter is looking for.  I would start with the 
following pages in the
p/l found in this directory...

O: Erms/1Intra/Central/Midwest P&L/2001/0101/EMW0117.xls

Exec Summary
DPR
P&L Without Sharing
P&L Summary

In addition,  I think he wants more detail on the positions.

In my hedge strip file (same directory as everyone else - name is HS_IM-EMW) 
I would think he would
like to see the Financial Book Position, NSS1, FT-Enovate, and TP tabs.  
These are the only tabs with 
positions.  (Will be changing shortly).

Thanks for the help,

Kevin
