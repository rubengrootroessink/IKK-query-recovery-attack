Sorry it has taken me a few days to get back with you, I had to leave town 
unexpectedly and just returned today.  All of that sounds great, how about 
putting the file in the O drive under erms/1intra/central.  Please name the 
file EOL curves.  Please let me know if you have any problems.  Thanks for 
your help on this matter.
