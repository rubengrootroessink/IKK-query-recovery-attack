I have a few concerns about this.  We are suppossed to be the only point of 
contact for changes in tagg.  This is an internal control issue that leaves 
all responsibility for errors in tagg with risk.  If other people are 
touching deals in tagg, any errors will then have to be investigated further 
and thus take longer to resolve.

I guess my main question for you is, does a problem exist in the current 
system?  Is risk not addressing your issues and needs on a timely basis?  If 
so, we need to readdress that issue and resolve it in a more timely manner.

Please let me know if the others disagree with me.

Thanks.
PL
