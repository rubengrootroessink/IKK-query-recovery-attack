Would you mind setting up an interview for us with Greg Thomas, resume 
attached below.  I think Dave Baumback, Kam Keiser, Errol McLaughlin, Darron 
Giron and myself need to interview him.  Groups of two at time would be 
preferred.  Thanks.

I received your name and contact information from Lia Halstead, whom I am in
class with in the University of Houston's PMBA program.  Please find
attached my resume for your review.  I graduated from Texas A&M with a B.S.
in Chemical Engineering and am currently working on an MBA.  My experience
has been in operations management, but my plan is to  transition into a more
business/commercial function so that I can continue to grow professionally.
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.
