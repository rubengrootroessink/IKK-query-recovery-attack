The information you needed for 1100, roughly 310K, should be a firm book 
variance as well on the other side.  Portfolio accounting should have a 
variance that offsets this(hopefully we have not already taken it, I will 
look).  This means you will not have any actuals on it for FRED.  I will 
start looking for dec info you just requested.
