I am the last one to have a problem with people throwing balls around.  
However,  Frank Vickers had a client from another firm here today and people 
were shooting baskets while the clients were looking on.  I'm sure 
professionalism is not the first thing they thought of as they were watching 
this.  While it is important that everyone have fun,  it is more important 
that we are a seen as a professional organization.  We are on the same floor 
as the originators and therefore there will be many clients coming through 
here in the future.  It would be a shame not to get business because someone 
in our group was firing jumpers.  Thanks for your help in ensuring that this 
doesn't happen again.

Jeff
