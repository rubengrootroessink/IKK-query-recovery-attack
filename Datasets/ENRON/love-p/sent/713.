As is the case will all FT-Ontario deals done at a US point, the deal must 
flow physically from a US book eventhough the canadian trader gets the long 
term income/loss from the deal.  This is a commercial decision that risk has 
to abide by.  The OA group, specifically John Valdes has given Jim Little the 
deal numbers in the past that comprise this problem to eliminate repeat 
performances.  This deal in question began in 11/00 and since you are doing 
december OA I would assume this one has not yet made the list.  I suggest 
forwarding to Jim LIttle/John Valdes to eliminate future problems.  Thanks.
