Hey Phillip.....I am on a plane back to St. Paul (Sunday night).  My life
completely (other than Jason and Drew) sucks right now.  I can not wait
until this project is done and over with.  I have reached the point of
thinking about quitting.  Funny how only 5 weeks ago my career counselor
asked me regarding that same question...and I had zero intention.

Anyhow, I spoke with Fabiola..and she is still interested in coming out to
Jazz Fest....and was curious in speaking with you and/or Ashley about
rooms.  She is not 100%...but is curious in talking with you re:
possibilities.  Her email is fabiola_rock@hotmail.com...and her cell number
is 617-515-6760.

Give the little one love for me...
