Hey Phillip,

I'm not sure if you were forwarded this message yesterday, so I'm sending it 
to you today.
Could you please flip the deals that are in your book to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS 
book 
as soon as possible.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks
Stacey

Hi guys,

Could you please go through all your books and see if there are any ECC deals 
in them for April or May settlements.  I've gone through a few and here are 
some deals that need to be flipped before noon tomorrow at the latest as I 
need to invoice them tomorrow.

FT-EAST



G-DAILY-EST



GD-CENTRAL



Please make sure that all these deals are flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book 
before noon Houston time on May first.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks
Stacey
