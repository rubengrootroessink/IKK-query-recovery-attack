Your lucky those cans didn't explode and get all over your clothes huh?  
Thanks again, it actually tastes pretty good, but you know my criteria for 
beer - cold.

I was just giving you a hard time about the name, that is reason #4761 why it 
is good to be a man.  Ashley did the same thing with the middle name, that 
way you keep some of your family.

We finally got some cold weather here.  I know you guys just got back from a 
vacation, but were wondering if you might like to join us for a skiing trip 
to Deer Valley.  We are going Jan 6 - 13th.  The accomodations are paid for, 
you would just have lift tickets and airfare.  We are staying in a ski in and 
ski out condo, so we are going to do some grocery shopping and cook.  Jason 
Tidwell and his girlfriend are coming in on the 6th and leaving on the 9th, 
so if you want to come in half time, that is cool too.  Just let us know.  
Talk to you soon.
