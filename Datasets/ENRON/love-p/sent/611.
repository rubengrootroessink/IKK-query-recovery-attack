Sam-
Here is a little something about my grandfather:

 Dr Walter Herschel Burgess was a 1950 graduate of Alabama Polytechnic 
Institute, now Auburn University.  He practied vetinary medicine for 38 years 
in Haleyville, Alabama.  Dr. Burgess was blessed with 3 children, 2 
grandchildren and one great grandchild.  Dr. Burgess was an avid golfer and 
tremendous football fan.  He held Auburn football season tickets for 50 
years.  Dr. Burgess recently received the golden eagle from Auburn University 
in recognition of 50 years of alumni service.  Dr Burgess was a World War II 
veteran.  Dr. Burgess loved Auburn and sent all three of his children and 
both grandchildren to school on the plains.  Due to his love for Auburn that 
he instilled in his family, there will definitely be a forth generation 
Auburn graduate in the Burgess family.  Dr. Burgess was also a proud member 
of the OTS vetinary fraternity at Auburn University.  Dr. Burgess was born in 
Cullman County, Alabama and was a 50 year resident of Haleyville, Alabama.  

Please feel free to take some liberties and rearrange or omit some of the 
things I stated above.  Thanks again Sam for all of your help with this and 
the recognition this newsletter will give my grandfather.  Auburn is very 
fortunate to have such a great person raising money for the most important 
school within the University. Talk to you soon.
