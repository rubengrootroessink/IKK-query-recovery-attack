Subject: EOL / Tagg Broker Field

In order for EOL to support the Broker Client Application, we are requesting 
that EOL be removed from the broker field in Tagg on all previous EOL 
transactions.  We would like this "sweep" to be performed on Thursday 
evening, if possible.  What this means to end users is that they will no 
longer be able to query on the broker field to find EOL deals in Tagg.  The 
only way to search for EOL deals in the future will be to query on the EOL 
transaction number.

Please communicate this new procedure to your groups.  Also, I don't know if 
Ron/Joe cover the Canada confirmations, if not, please let me know who the 
confirmations contact is in Canada. 

Jeremy/Ron, please let me know if Thursday evening works for you to clean out 
the broker field.

Thank
