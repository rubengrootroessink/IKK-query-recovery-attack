I forgot to tell you last night, Ginger called and said Tori will be there.  
I thought there were possibly going to be other kids there as well.  What 
about just going out to eat at Lupe's with your mom and nonnie?  That sounds 
good to me.  We do not have to have a party with Brian/Rebecca, Kim and Ev 
and then they feel obligated to bring a gift.  No big deal to me and I am 
sure no big deal to them.

What are we doing for dinner tonight?
