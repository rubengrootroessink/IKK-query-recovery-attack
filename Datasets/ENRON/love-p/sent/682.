Government News Keywords: MILITARY COURTESY TO THE PRESIDENT Source: CNN
Posted on 02/15/2001 11:44:53 PST by Hurtgen
This morning CNN showed George W. leaving HM-1. The marine at the front step
saluted, GW returned it, and as he walked away, the marine executed a right
face to stand facing GW's back...something that was missing in eight years
of the Clinton presidency.
The traditional Marine Corps mark of respect was rendered to the new
president. That one goes back to the days in the rigging, when the marine
orderly to the ship's captain always faced him, no matter his direction of
movement, to be ready to receive an order.
Who says that enlisted men can't hold back when they don't respect someone?
..And for eight years, they did.
