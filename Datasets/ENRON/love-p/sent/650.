Here is the final version of the template to be used in February 2001=20
=01+Regions=01, P&L.  Please re-link cells pulling information from other t=
abs=20
within your file (i.e. Third Party Sales, Third Party Purchases, CPR Fuels,=
=20
CPR Imbalance, CPR Cash Out, CPR Pipeline Exchange, and CPR Storage).

Keep in mind that if you have multiple physical tabs in your P&L each must =
be=20
replaced with the template.  Also, if your region has multiple physical tab=
s=20
under a single P&L, they should be rolled into one total physical tab named=
=20
"physical".  =20

In future months, I will send each of you a revised template inclusive of a=
ll=20
CPR desk names and CPR couterparty names by the end of each month.  Please=
=20
copy future templates to your file to ensure consistency across all regions=
.

Thank you all for your patience and cooperation while we implement this=20
process improvement.  Please let me know how I can help.

Regards,
