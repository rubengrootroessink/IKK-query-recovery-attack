Darron talked the higher ups here into making me the business controller for 
the Central desk.  So now my hours are longer and responsibility greater all 
for the same pay.  I guess I did n't have to do the stupid thing and accept, 
but oh well.  We will see if I can handle another year in risk.  Talk to you 
soon.
