Ellen,

As far as I am concerned, the deals in question are with the Aruba Supply book which is being managed in Houston.  
I have no control over that book.

Patrick Ryder (who is on vacation until May 18) is aware of the issue and was working on it the last time we talked.

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

Kevin
