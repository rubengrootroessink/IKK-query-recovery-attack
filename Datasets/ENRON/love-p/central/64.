Phillip	

The $133,546 open item related to fuel is for an increase of 24,954 MMBTUs to ANR Pipeline. 

There was a fuel adjustment in March reducing fuel by 24,985 and reducing expense $132,800.  That revenue that was taken to the desk in April.  That fuel adjustment was reversed in a subsequent month, and that is the $133,546 expense that is on the back page currently.  I have copies of the VMREP007 reports as support.  Let me know if I need to get anything additional from Volume Management.

Thanks
Cathy
