Phillip, these were the only tickets we changed to Central Transport.  Let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Lisa, thank you for your comments.  The new ticket for Consumers is 881202 eff 7/1/01.  This is replacing #91742.  Also I extended the dates on the other tickets as requested.

Just to let you know, I have changed the following tickets from the desks you assigned in May to Central Transport.  

 Sitara #  91742  Consumers Energy    This ticket shows it ends 6/30/01; Please verify and I will not create a new for July. This is an internal contract - I would go ahead and create it for another year.  We use this like a pooling contract.  The cost associated with this is a monthly fee that Consumers charges to use their pooling services.  The desk that this should be associated with is IM-Mkt Central Mich.
Sitara #  91743   MichCon                  This ticket shows it ended 4/30/01. It is ok that this ended.  We no longer use this contract. 
 Sitara # 134583  NGPL                       New Ticket eff July 1, 2001   876271  IM_CENTRAL  GULF Storage deal has been extended through 4/30/2002 
 Sitara # 134586  NGPL                       New Ticket eff  July 1, 2001   876369  IM-CENTRAL GULF Storage deal has been extended through 6/2/2002 

If you have any questions, please call me.  Also let me know if you need any assistance with setting up tickets.


Thanks,

Natalie
