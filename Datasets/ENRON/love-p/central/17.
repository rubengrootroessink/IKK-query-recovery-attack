Bruce,
 
I will need you to fill in this form and rank your requests from Immediate to Standard.  Please rank them from a 1-3.  oFor example, one requiring Immediate attention.  Please attach myself, and Torrey Moorer. I will forward your request on to Tagg and then get back to you with an ETA.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Tara

Subject: ERMS Bridge Programming Guidelines


In order to protect the integrity of TAGG production bridging logic and better facilitate development and improvements to EOL bridge functionality, the ERMS IT team has set forth some guidelines for the processing and prioritization of bridging development requests. These guidelines should assist both Risk Management and Commercial in gaining resolution on critical bridging issues while protecting against the implementation of faulty or untested logic.
 
The new process flow for ERMS bridging requests and corrections is as follows:
 
1) All requests for bridge logic corrections and enhancements will need to be forwarded by email through the EOL Product Control Group and should be prioritized as either "Immediate" or "standard". "Immediates" are emergency requests for which other programming efforts being made by the ERMS IT team will be placed on hold, while "standard" requests will be placed on ERMS's developmental time-table in the order received.
 
    ** Note: Tara Sweitzer will be sending a supplemental email to the various Risk groups of current programming issues for prioritization.
 
2) Once received, developmental requests will be evaluated by the ERMS IT team. The programmers responsible for logic implementation will then assign an estimated completion date, which PCG will forward back to the appropriate Risk Desk. Any system issues, emergency requests or other subsequent developments which may impact this due date will be communicated to the appropriate Risk group by PCG.
 
3) Upon completion of testing, the ERMS IT team will load new logic enhancements and fixes into the production environment. These uploads will take place each Friday evening, except in the case of emergency requests, which may be uploaded at any time. This standardized weekend upload will correspond with the weekly EOL application enhancement uploads.
 
Please feel free to contact either myself or Tara Sweitzer if you have any questions regarding the new development request procedures.
 
Thank you,
