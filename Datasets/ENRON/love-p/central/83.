Met with Pam and here is the deal.  Pam wants the P&L for the April deals to show up in May GL.  What I suggested to her was that rather than do anything for the deals in risk or Portfolio that Pam defer the P&L on her company and release it the next month.  This keeps things normal in our worlds and Pam controls when she sees the P&L on her company.  She has agreed to do this.

There will be a new twist starting in July.  Starr is supposed to become 3rd party and the payment date is supposedly two months after the fact.  Pam is checking with legal to see if there is to be a complete unwind and rebooking because of structure changes to make the deal 3rd party or if we can just change the counterparty on the deals.  I'm sure we will be the last to know as usual.
