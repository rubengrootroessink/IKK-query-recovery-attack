Dear all-

I know that most of you all have now used the Global Standards Exception Reporting database, but we have drafted some basic instructions for using it as well as some maintenance instructions for the directions.  Kelly recommends that you repair and compact your database at least weekly to keep it from getting corrupt.  Please let me or Kelly know if you have any questions.  Thanks,

Christy
