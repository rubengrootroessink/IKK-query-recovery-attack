 James,
   Here are the configuration requirements for WeaponX in our environment in Houston. -
 
   You need the following ODBC Drivers configured, You can access this by
   Start->Run and typing in ODBCAD32
   OR
   Start->Settings->Control Panel->ODBC / (Windows 2000) Start->Settings->Control Panel->Admin Utils->ODBC

   Make sure the following are in the screen that open, if not you can add them by clicking the add button and selecting ORACLE ODBC drivers. All the entries should be in LOWER case.
