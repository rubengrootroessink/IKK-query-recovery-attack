Phillip, I'm still running the Canadian minibook on these deals, but here is the list of the deals that were created.

Old deal #	New deal #
NH1353	VC1474
E30623		VC1490
E34612		VC1494
E32934		VC1495
EA2386		VC1496
QA1354		VC1497

Any Houston book in these deals (with the exception of TP-Canada) was changed to the SITHEUNWIND book.  The FT-CAND-EGSC was changed to SITHEUNWINDCAD.

I'll be in touch with you shortly on this.
