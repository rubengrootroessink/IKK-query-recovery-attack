There is now an Access file ready for use that holds all CPR Flash files for all desks from Jan-01 through current month.  You can use this to print or view specific deals or counterparties from the flash files rather than holding on to the old stacks of paper. 

It is in Access 2000.....O:\erms\1intra\CPR flash files\CPR reports\Master\CPR Reports 2001.mdb.

You don't need to save this to your C drive to use it.  

There are still changes I want to make so let me know if there is something you want to add/change.  Scott Dozier in settlements created this for their use and James Hungerford has been working with him to make it useful to us.


Thanks,

Kam
