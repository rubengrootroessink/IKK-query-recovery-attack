Here is an updated list of the questions.  The highlighted have been asked already.  O'neal, I already asked some of the more experiences people #12 and #13 but they can use the practice.

The question most missed is boxing out/how to book a physical deal at one location priced at another.  Can you ask this one again? I think only two people got that one right.  I would expect everyone to get it right this week.
