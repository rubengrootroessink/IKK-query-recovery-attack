Elizabeth typed up these questions for us but there were a couple that got lost in the translation.  If the two with ??? next to them were yours, let me know what they are supposed to be.

I also tried to break these down evenly, I don't remember if we agreed to 3 or 4 per person but we can always cut back if we need to.  Let me know what changes need to be done and I'll fix it.
