Hi Darren,

I am sorry it has taken me so long to reconnect with you, but as you know, it has been very difficult these days at Enron.  It would be best if we could schedule a phone call some time during the first half of December.  At that time, I should have some time to help you.  Hang in there.

Best,

Jeff

Dear Jeffrey,
Lisa thought that you could answer some of my questions dealing with power and gas trading. I have traded equities for the last three years and I worked at a small investment commercial real-estate firm before I traded. I am trying to position myself at an energy company that produces, trades, and sells. I understand that I need to learn the industry from the bottom-up. I am looking at positions of Risk Analyst and Merchant Energy Trader. Do you have any suggestions for me.
 
Sincerely,
Darren Wolfe
