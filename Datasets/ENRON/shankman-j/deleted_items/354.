Jeff,

London
I would like to have turrets for my guys in London.  As a small group where everyone is learning and involved in everything it helps for them to communicate better internally and externally.  I have been told by London that our phone usage does not warrant turrets.  I don't want that to be the basis on which the decision is made.  Paul and I believe they are necessary to the business, our cost structure is reasonable and will improve over time.

I want the phones and I want to be able to operate the business as we see fit.  If London has a bloated cost structure that is their issue and I don't want them to make it mine.

USA Allocations
I met with IT on Monday regarding my allocations and I still find them to be unacceptable.  For example, my overhead allocation is approximately half of Dan's, yet we have about 25% of the people working on our system.  I will discuss with Brent, but wanted you to know.
