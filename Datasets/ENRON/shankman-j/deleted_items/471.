Dear Jeff: 
It was truly our pleasure having you over. It was fun to visit and hear your stories. The triangle chair is by Archizoom and was in production from 1968 to 1976 by Paltronova in Italy. I will try to track one down for you. I will email them tonight in Italy.  
Thanks for looking up the plated silver "glove" box. You are good.............. 
Linda and I would always love to see you. We'll give you a call in the next couple of weeks. I assume I'll see you Monday night at the Design Council. I am trying to track down some Desne pieces that we talked about. I located a vase in NYC. They are sending me an image. I will show it to you when I get it. I am actually beginning to focus on the cocktail set or a bowl. No luck yet. The real fun is the education and research. The hunt is the best part. 
I found an article through Cindi about Desne, but no book. I didn't realize they were in production only from 1929-1937. To me they achieved a great aesthetic in a vibrant time period.  
I hope you are holding up well at work. I know the top of the mountain looks high from the valley. I wish you luck. We're off to Austin tomorrow and we'll be back wednesday. I'm glad you're here for a couple of weeks.  
See you soon, 
Peter
