George,
My comments are that we have been reaffirmed by everyone except Moody's.  Moody's put us on watch only which is not unusual with a 1 billion write off.  Moody's is working with us to re-affirm.

There is no issue on liquidity or credit issues.  I am listening to the analyst call right now which these issues are being discussed.  We will defend our rating - period.

I hope that helps.

Larry any other comments from a finance guy?

Mike
