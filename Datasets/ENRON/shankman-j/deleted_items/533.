Mike/Jeff - I actually sent this on July 26 but it may have gotten lost in the shuffle.

Mike - Our three most critical IT needs are as follows:

	Thunderball - physical functionality is in the process of being tested; should be fully implemented by end of Oct.  This will
                 significantly automate the process (saving headcount) and tighten controls
	Global Valuation - will replace the current archaic risk system; will greatly enhance reporting capabilities and decrease the
                 amount of manual work around Risk Mgmt.
	Freight Systems - critical to allowing us to manage operational costs at an acceptable level (i.e. contribute to a profitable
                 margin amount); needs to be implemented ASAP - any delays will add costs to the bottom line

Let me know if you need more details or have any questions.

Brent
