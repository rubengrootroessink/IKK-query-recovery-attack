Dear Mr Shankman,
How's it going? As you may remember, I met you, Mr LeBeau, Ms Leibman, and Ms Li Sun at Cavanaughs with Matt Commons a few weeks ago.

During that meeting, you suggested that I visit Enron down in Houston in the next few weeks. As I have not been placed on the closed interview list at Wharton, I was wondering if I could conduct the interview process while in Houston? Please see my updated resume attached for your review.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I am still very interested in obtaining a full-time position in the Associate Program at Enron.

Kind regards,
Edward Divgi
