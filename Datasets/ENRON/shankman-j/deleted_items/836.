A Rabbi was opening his mail one morning.  Taking the
single sheet of paper from an envelope he found written
on it only one word:  "SCHMUCK."

The next Friday night he announced to his congregants, "I have known many

people who have written letters and forgot to sign their
names.  But this week, I received a letter from someone
who signed his name and forgot to write a letter."
