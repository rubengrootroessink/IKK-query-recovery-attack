Delores is copying the last few months and has set up the system such that you are the approver on all future expense reports.

Just confirmed with Nowlan's admin that you are the approver in XMS -( the expense report system) - for both Nowlan and Schroeder.

Delores will also make you copies of the past two months' reports for both.
