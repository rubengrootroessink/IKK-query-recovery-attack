Most of you are probably aware in the past crude and products mid-market deals were worked thru the ENA	Gas Mid Market group under Fred Lagrasta and Craig Breslau.  For the past 3 months we've been in the process of transitioning the final accounts from ENA over to EGM Mid-Marketing under Bill Berkeland.  Going forward it will be extremely helpful for everyone to focus on this business in EGM.  If you get any requests to price deals for crude, products, pet-chems or plastics from ENA please refer the contact to either Bill Berkeland or myself BEFORE providing any prices.  It's important to EGM's business plan and earnings targets that these transactions are managed by and credited to EGM.  Thanks for everyone's support.

Fred, is there any good reason why Craig & co are working FEDNAV (a Canadian Shipping co.) as opposed to referring them to my group? I,m getting word thru our london desk that Craig did a deal with them a few weeks ago and may be working another one thru Chris Figueroa today. As we go down the path here, we need to get your guys referring products customers to us as we have been referring gas guys to your shop. Through the years of your group's marketing efforts, there are quite a few prospects out there that have contact info pointing to your group and we need to be able to count on you to point them to us. The customer transition issues that we are working don't just apply to the named few we are talking about, but also to new contacts as well.

Thanks.
