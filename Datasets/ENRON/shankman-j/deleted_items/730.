Hi Bill

We need to send a form 1099 (a tax form showing income to him) to Ed Nayhem who helped ups with the Puryear and the Oldenburg.  We can also write off his fee as en expense to Enron in acquiring this art.

As well, pending a condition report, the Puryear (the piece on view at the Menil) was sold today to the Smithsonian.  Please keep this confidential.  Ned Rifkin does not know and if the buyer chooses to tell him that is fine, but this info should not be told to anyone yet.

We will have a contract next week from the dealer who sold it and I send you a copy.  

A good start--we really did buy some great things.

Jeff
