Mike/Jeff,

Jeremy will be sending you the updated internal deal list to give you a fee=
l for the types of things we are working on and where we stand.  We'd like =
to discuss this further with you.  I think you will see from the types of t=
ransactions and the relative value that the 2002 plan numbers are not unrea=
listic.  However, in order to achieve these numbers will require some stron=
g support from Houston and additional expat staff.  We have focused on reas=
onableness of the size of transactions that we are seeing to date and what =
we would additionally plan to see.  We have also focused on trying to do mo=
re with less (Sato proposition) and shooting for just north of break even. =
 Additionally, I am under the belief that you are stretching all of the gro=
ups and anything less than covering costs would not be acceptable.  While S=
ato would not be required to achieve these numbers, it would certainly be e=
asier with them.  (... don't mean for this to be interpreted that we should=
 have higher numbers with Sato...).

Sato:
We'd like to set a time to speak with you about Sato MOU your Thursday (our=
 Friday).  Our 0730 is your 1730.  Would this work for you? =20
