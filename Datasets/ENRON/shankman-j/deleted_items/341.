   The custom shirt promo is starting again on Monday.  It's really good
   timing.  When would you like to pick some out?  P.S. Some new shirtings
   just
   arrived.

   Hi Carol, I was thinking about a few more shirts.  You really need to
   have
   a referral discount or some other incentive program for your clients.
   It
   may help.

      I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish
      strong
      this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing
      sales
      by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to
      help me
      do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by
      giving
      me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be
      interested
      in the type of service we offer.

      Some things to consider:

      We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
      We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

      If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have
   an
      interest as well.

      Some memory joggers:

      Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
      Who do you know that likes nice cars?
      Who do you know that owns their own company?
      Who do you know that is successful in sales?
      Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
      Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
      Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical
   clothing?

      Thanks for your help!
