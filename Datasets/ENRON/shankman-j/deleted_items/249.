          As u probably guess international monitors
will be in favor of the 
          Palestinians ... not us! 

          When this mail was sent to me the 
percentage was 24% YES and 76% NO 
          Due to Pro Arab people asking everybody to
vote it is now 42 % YES 
          and 65% NO 

          Help us change the poll in our favor! 
            
          VERY IMPORTANT! Forward to everyone you know
ASAP! 
          Use this link and vote on the poll.
