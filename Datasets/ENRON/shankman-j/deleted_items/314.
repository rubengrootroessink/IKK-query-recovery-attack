Mike/Jeff, 
 
Sato is specifically asking us about what is happening at Enron including specifically share price, billion dollar losses and Fastow issues.  Obviously the latest is getting out across the world.  While it might seem somewhat ironic given their problems that they should ask us, but these are fair questions.
 
I know we discussed this somewhat during the past weekend,  but I believe it will be important for Corp to help us "at the front" to address real concerns concerning the company.
 
Joe
