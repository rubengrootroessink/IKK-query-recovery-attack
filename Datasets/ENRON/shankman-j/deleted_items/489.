Steve leppard has joined our group from a background in IT and research with Enron.  He has had sometime to analyze our group in these areas and wants to recruit some analysts and associates over.   I'm inclined to trust his judgement and take them in if they are to be working on developing our IT systems and var issues.   I'm to discuss this on Monday with Steve and Niamh but want to make you aware we are looking at taking on resources in London in this area.  Please let me know your views.

Chris, Niamh

Following my discussions with Chris last week I'm interested to know the state of play as regards increasing our market analytics efforts (as distinct from quant derivative work).  There are a few people I can recommend if we're looking for resource, and I'd like to know if it might be appropriate to make some subtle queries as to their interest/availability.

In particular I'm interested in obtaining:
Kirstee Hewitt, currently in Research.  Has the best feel for numbers and the most practical view of all things numerical/statistical in Research.  Wants to get more commerical.
Homan Amiry, currently in RAC.  Full of bright ideas, wants to get commercial.  Has already had discussions with Chris, and is available to move any time.
Ted Barlow, currently in Metals.  Relatively new to Enron, good bright Analyst - just point him at a problem and watch him go.
