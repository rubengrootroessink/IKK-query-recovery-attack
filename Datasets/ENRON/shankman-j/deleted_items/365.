Jeff- thanks very much for your support of our Energy News Today concept. We will talk to John Nowlan immediately, but based on your commitment today, we will proceed with the one year 360K commitment to ENT.  As mentioned, we had to act quickly to prevent the sources from being bought out by Petroleum Argus.  ENT has accepted our offer and the reporting will continue uninterrupted.

Attached below is Clay's memo on ENT for your reference.

Cheers,

RJ
