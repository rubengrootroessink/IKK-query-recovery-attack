Hi Tina,

Thanks for you help.  

The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly there.  The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.  

If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor fabric.

Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

Regards,

Jeff
