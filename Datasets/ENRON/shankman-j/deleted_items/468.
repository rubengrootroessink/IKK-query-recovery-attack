 Mike/Jeff:
 
Basic commercial items discussed during meetings from last week.  We will be following up with the different groups to try and push forward.  I will also be getting with the different business heads to further gauge their feedback (interests/concerns).  I'd like to set a time to speak with the both of you regarding feedback on the way forward (MOU development).  Also progress with steel, softs (trade finance) and non ferrous.
 
Thanks for your support last week.
 
Joe
