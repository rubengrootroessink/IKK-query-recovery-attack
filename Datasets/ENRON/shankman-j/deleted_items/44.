All Louise has is the file I just sent you Jeff.  I will send you the entire November position as I understand it.

Whatever you've given to Louise with any EGM counterparties, I'd like so we're all on the same page.

Jeff,

Let me send you what I pieced together from Joel Bennett's position at COB last night + my discussions with Peggy Rathmell and her slates.
Give me just a couple of minutes.

What about all the other reports for any EGM counterparty.  I'd like those as well.
