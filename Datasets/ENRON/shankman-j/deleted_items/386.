Hi Mark,

As you know, our meetings with Dow have not progressed as far as I would have liked.  However, we are about to launch physical polyethylene and physical polypropylene on EOL because of the deals we've done with Formosa.  

I would like to call Carlo Gaurino (at least) from at Dow just before launch and wanted to know if you wanted to be on that call.  (Plus, it might be a litte entertainning when they hear this).  Since we met with their CEO, I figured a call from me or us was appropriate. 

Jeff
