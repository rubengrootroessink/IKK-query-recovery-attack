Jeff,
 
Mark Tawney indicated that, while it might be a long shot, Lynda might be interested in a core group of people (smaller than all EJ obviously) that would be able to help her build a weather business in Japan.  Do you think there is any merit in this?  If so, let me know the best way to progress, including, if you have it, her phone number.
 
Joe
