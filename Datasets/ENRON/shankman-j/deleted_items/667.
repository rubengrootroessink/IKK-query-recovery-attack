Hi Jason,

I hope the Dallas, Texas show was good for you guys, and of course, it was nice seeing you again.  Also, the two times I came by at the NY show last weekend, you guys were swamped!  I'm sorry I didn't stop by again, but my frined started feeling badly, and we left for a while.

I remember your telling me in Dallas that a small early (1950's?) pitcher was going to be available now the the museum wasn't going to pursue it, and the price was around $32,000.  Is that piece available?  I'm interested and would like to talk to you about it.

Best Regards,

Jeff Shankman
