Hey Jeff.  Have a favor to ask.  Trying to get clarification on the Enron
balance sheet.  If you have some time can we speak about various aspects of
the business?  I know you are busy, and not necessarily as familiar with the
off balances sheet structures, but perhaps you could be of some assistance.
I think your the smartest guy I know that still works there.  Maybe its your
Penn roots.

I am in Houston over Thanksgiving.  Perhaps we can finally get that long
awaited drink you owe me!  If in London please give me a call.  I have a
great place here you are welcome to crash at.
