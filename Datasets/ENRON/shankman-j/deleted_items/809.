Hi Donnis, 

I hope your thanksgiving was good.  I'd like to make some progress on your loan with me.  I'd be happy to take $11,500 worth of land now, or you can start repaying me right away until you sell the land.  In any event, I am looking for full repayment of some sort by December 31, 2001.  

I know you are trying to get this all worked out, but I need to be treated fairly as well.

Regards,

Jeff
