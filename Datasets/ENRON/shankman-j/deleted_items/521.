Hey Jeff,

The Associate & Analyst Program is trying to confirm who is doing the presentation at all of the schools. 

I have blocked the dates on your calendar with Jennifer Burns, per your request.  Just wanted to confirm with you if these dates are good for you.

Please let me know at your earliest.

Thank you,

Paul LeBeau
