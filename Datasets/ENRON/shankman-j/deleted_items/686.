I actually told Deborah on Friday that she shouldn't plan on going to houston and situation was unclear on if there still would be a job for her.  I can't make the meeting today but will call you later to discuss this.

Jen,

I start 26 November in London on Chris's advice, as I haven't been able to
reach you.  I know that we said it might be best if my first month with
Enron were worked in Houston, but it now seems wisest to put that off for a
while.  

best regards,
Deborah
