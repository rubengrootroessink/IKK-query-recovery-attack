Dear Mr. Rosenfeld,

Thank you for your email.  Those terms you've outlined below are agreeable to Enron. 

 In addition, there is no problem with title and the transfer of the title of the Puryear before, during, and after the merger of Dynegy and Enron.  It is now the property of Enron, and in not encumbered by the the merger. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Jeff Shankman

Dear Mr. Shankman,

Thank you for authorizing me to sell the Martin Puryear sculpture "Bower"
owned by Enron Corp. A major American museum has expressed serious interest
in purchasing this Martin Puryear sculpture and the museum has an
acquisition meeting early next week when they expect to make a decision
about the purchase.

The museum has certain budget restrictions and I have been asked to find out
if it would be possible to pay $500,000.00 this year and the $285,000.00
balance in October 2002. If this schedule of payment is acceptable, it will
make the acquisition of the Puryear likely.

The November 8th email authorizing me to sell the Puryear does not include a
term. Since I am in the midst of negotiating the Puryear's sale, I would
appreciate assurance that Michael Rosenfeld Gallery will remain the sole and
exclusive authorized  agent for the sale of the sculpture through the end of
2001. Also, in light of recent developments with the acquisition of Enron by
Dynergy, I would appreciate assurance that sale of the Puryear may continue
unobstructed and that there will be no problem with transfer of title.
Naturally, this is a very important point.

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.


Sincerely,
Michael Rosenfeld

Dear Mr. Rosenfeld,

In May, 2001, Enron Corp. purchased "Bower", dated 1980, by Martin
Puryear, through the Sotheby's NY. sale.  Enron would like to sell this
piece for $785,000 which was the purchase price, plus buyer's premium,
plus fees paid.

We would like you to sell this piece for us.  We look forward to working
with you.

Regards,

Jeff Shankman
