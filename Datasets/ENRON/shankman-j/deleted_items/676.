Thanks again for all of your help today.  It was a great meeting!

I forgot to tell you as we were walking out.  The price for the Bel Geddes
Skyscraper Cocktail service is $7500.  Based on my preliminary price checks
(so far) it seems fair and certainly less that the boys would charge. What
do you think?  I am of half a mind to call the boys and find out what they
would be asking but I think that it would tip our hand....
