Holy cow this is expensive.  Of course I don't care about your 5% or so, but what is the retail on these babies?  I'm pretty flexible on the fabric--mid range would be fine.  Let's move ahead.  (2 loveseats though, not 1)  How long did they say?

OK...
Sofa = $4290
Loveseat = $3300
8.25% tax = $626.18.
Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a 30-35%
discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go to the
Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.  I
have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll get a
range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and expensive
type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.
Thanks, Tina

Hi Tina,

Thanks for you help.

The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly there.
The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that
says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain
off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor fabric.

Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

Regards,

Jeff
