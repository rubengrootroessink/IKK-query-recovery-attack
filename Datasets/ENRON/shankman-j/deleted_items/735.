All I can say is, "Oh f------ck."  To be determined about me.  All I know is I could have retired next summer, now I have to work for a few more, maybe serveral more, years.  Now I REALLY need to find a REALLY rich girl.  As Robyn Leach says, "Caviar dreams, and champagne wishes..."--that was so last year.  (By the way, he's my hero)
The whole thing is ugly, but I'm sure I'll end up OK.

How are you, and the bambina?  Where are you all going to end up?

Hey Jeff:

What's going on at Enron and, more importantly, what does it mean for you?

How are you in general and what's up?

Stefanie

P.S. WHAT THE HELL IS DAVE HERMAN'S E-MAIL ADDRESS???!!!!!
