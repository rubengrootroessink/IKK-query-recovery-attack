An older couple were lying in bed one night. The husband was falling
asleep but the wife felt  romantic and wanted to talk.

She said: "You use to hold my hand when we were courting."  Wearily he
reached across, held her hand for a
second and tried to get back to sleep.

A few moments later she said: "Then you used to kiss me." Mildly
irritated, he reached across, gave her a peck
on the cheek and settled down to sleep.

Thirty seconds later she said : "Then you use to bite my neck".
Angrily, he threw back the bed clothes and got out of bed.

"Where are you going ?" she asked.

"To get my teeth !"
