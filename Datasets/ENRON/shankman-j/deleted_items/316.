Mike/Jeff,
 
Cathy let me know while in Mexico that Frevert would not be available next week, but is free the week of 5 Nov.  We are going back to Sato and should know how this works for them in the next day.  If there is some change from your perspective, pls let us know.  Otherwise we'll assume that this week is still ok.  I would not imagine having Nakatani in Houston for more than 1-2 days.
 
thanks again for the offsite.
 
Joe
