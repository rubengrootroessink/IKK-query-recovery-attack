Hi,
Attached is my mom's resume for board consideration.  What can I say? I don't know what if anything you can do with this, but I can now say I forwarded it to you.  Watch out, my own resume may be following shortly (arggh!).  Amazon said they never received the return of the books I sent you.  How are you?
HOpe all is well and you are not too mosquito bitten or rain drenched.
Love, 
Sam
