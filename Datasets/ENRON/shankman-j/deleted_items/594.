Mark, 

A couple of follow-up questions in addition to our discussion/needs at lunch.

The weather business should be cash flow positive next year.  Brent shows $34 million with upside.  What are the key drivers and factors that will determine that.  How much confidence do you have in that or your estimated $ amount?

What is the total capital or balance sheet needed in 2002?

How many total people (support/analytics) are needed to run the weather group in the scenarios 1 and 2 situations.  In your scenario 1 you cut 23 people (26 remaining) and in scenario 2 you cut 36 with 13 remaining.

Thanks,
Mike
