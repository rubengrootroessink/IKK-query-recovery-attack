Hi,
Our picture email is on the fritz....sorry. I don't have your home address,
please forward and we'll get started packing. The best price on the Valet is
$ 6000.Let us know if we should send it along. It is a great example of this
chair. I think it's the best one I've ever had. I've only had 3. Last but not
least.....Any chance of getting a check this week? Thanks, Kim
