All,

Attached is an invitation to a Young Friends cocktail reception at the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft on November 29th.  The HCCC is a nonprofit organization with a mission to advance education about the process, product and history of craft.  While we are describing this as a "Young Friends" event, any and all are welcome, you just need to be young at heart!!  Please help us to kick this organization off right!!  

Did I mention the free wine, beer and food from Carrabba's, and the possibility of winning a luxury weekend at the new Hotel Derek????  Hope to see you there!!

Rachael
