Every day it's more bills.  
Sometimes life gets too busy to really stay on top of them.
American Express(R) Bill Center can help.  
Try it and get 2,000 MEMBERSHIP REWARDS(R) bonus points.
Click here.http://www.americanexpress.com/billcenter47?aexp_em=BILLC0911 Dear Cardmember,
Let's face it.  No one likes bills. But here's a way to manage
them more easily. Even when life gets hectic.  It's called
American Express Bill Center.
You can let American Express receive, pay and organize all your
bills.  It can really simplify things:
* We'll keep your bills organized by posting them on a secure,
  password-protected Web page.  
* We can notify you by e-mail when bills come in.  And remind you
  when they're due.  
* You can set up recurring billing, so certain bills are paid
  automatically every month.
* You'll even get 2,000 MEMBERSHIP REWARDS bonus points when
  you receive and pay two bills by December 31, 2001. Just enter 
  code 8115 when you enroll.
Of course, many services offer bill payment online.  But you still
have to worry about when the bills are due.  And you have to worry
about lost or forgotten bills. For a low monthly fee, Bill Center
helps manage all that.
Cardmembers feel more in control because all their bills are posted
all in one place. And you can access your bills anywhere. Let's
say you're on a trip and haven't kept on top of things. Bill
Center gives you total access to view and pay your bills - no
matter where, no matter when. It eliminates the stress of putting
it off and having to worry about overdue bills.  Managing bills can
be as easy as a few clicks.
Bill Center helps keep you in control. Try it and see for yourself.
Sincerely,
Pierric Beckert
Senior Vice President
