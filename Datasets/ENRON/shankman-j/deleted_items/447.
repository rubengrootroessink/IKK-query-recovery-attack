JS;
I have been working on the 2002 EGM Plan. With this in mind, could you please give me some guidance on the following topics;

1- Headcount: Per my previous email (Fundy Update- I do not expect to increase headcount in H1-02 with the exception of the outstanding offer)
2-Spending on publications and other data sources: Can you please tell me which businesses I should focus the most on. 
3-Resources: Again which areas should efforts be focused on.
4-London: We will have 5 people there in January (1 director, 1 manager, 3 analysts). If you are still considering bringing the crude team to London, please let me know before any move/viasa/etc expenses are incurred.


Thank you for your assistance.
