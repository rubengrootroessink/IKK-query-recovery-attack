Your assistant called and asked if I had any notes from Monday's conference call.

Jeff -- Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I do not have any notes from Monday's Dynegy conference call, but the script has been filed w/ the SEC and it's on our website under "Investor Relations -- SEC filings."

Let me know if you need anything else.
Karen
