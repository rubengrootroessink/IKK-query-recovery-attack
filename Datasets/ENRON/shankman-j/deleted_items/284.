The NoxTech tests in Scotland have been delayed by mechanical conditions in the test boiler.  It will take 2 - 3 days to perform the boiler repairs and restart the test.  

While we have not been able to conduct extensive tests - the initial NOx reductions were in line with expectations.  On the downside the ammonia slip was fairly high - which will have to be addressed during the next phase of testing.

Assuming MB can get the boiler fixed - expect to have more complete test results by the end of the week.  It is still our intent to find a financial player (Ross - ArcLight - Cline) to buy 3 - 5% of our 50% interest in Clean Energy Solutions.  We are trying to prove a valuation of plus $20 mm for our interest - and do a "140" deal by mid - end November.

Will advise any updates.

George
