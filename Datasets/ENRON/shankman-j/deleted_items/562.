   Jeff -

   Jean and the boys left yesterday for their 5 week
   "get-the-hell-out-of-Houston"
   Summer vacation.  Give me a call at 713.653.8207 (wk.) or 713.522.9381
   (hm.) and
   let me know whether you'll be around this weekend.  Perhaps we can get
   together
   for lunch or dinner on Sat. / Sun.

   JRG
