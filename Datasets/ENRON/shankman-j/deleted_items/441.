Joe, this is outstanding.  How can we help you get our 24/7 crude product on EOL in Japanese?  I'd like to get this done this quarter.  Also, forgive my inability to add and subtract, but how much did you guys book on this transaction?
 
Jeff

Mike/Jeff,
 
As indicated in the list of deals and interested cps that we sent you yesterday, we closed a transaction with Japanese trading company, Kobayashi Yoko, this afternoon.  Kinoshita and Anai had been working this company and had already gotten basic documentation and credit approval in place.  We had also gotten prior approval from Sheila Glover and Gary Hickerson to use the local metal's trader to handle FX swaps up to USD30MM.  Commodity and FX risk (except for 4 days from contract settlement) have been hedged with Singapore and ENA.  Not a big deal in and of itself (notional USD250k), but a start.  We believe there is much more demand and plan to see more in the near future.  Also expect to see first LPG deal with Marubeni with our new mid mkt "trader" very shortly.  We would back to back transaction as well.  Details of this transaction are as follows:

Price: 20.24$/bbl
