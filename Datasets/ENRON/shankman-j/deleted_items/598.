Jeff,

Details of the weather transaction we discussed yesterday (requiring a cash collateralized account in lieu of a letter of credit). This would be the first weather deal done in Latin America and hopefully create other opportunities with the Mexican government. Let me know if you have time to discuss further (I'd like to get your input before proceeding with Treasury).

Thanks,

Brian Hendon
