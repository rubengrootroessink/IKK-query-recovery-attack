Jeff-
We are in the process of making the changes that you had requested to be made to the Global Position Report:
Crude - Financial Options (Oil Price 3) - has been broken out as De La Ossa but is still included under "Crude Financial" portfolio.  Do you want us to move this position with the rest of Mario's positions (under the Distillates - Products II) or leave it with Crude?
Some of the "zero" books are still showing on the report.  We have discussed this with the Systems group and we should have the fix in place by Wednesday reporting - they must do some changes behind the scenes.  
The Distillates Spain position is now captured with Mahoney's Distillates positions.
The positions for Thomas under London Crude (Physical & Financial) have been combined.

Please give me a call if you want to further discuss the changes. 
Thanks,
Michelle
