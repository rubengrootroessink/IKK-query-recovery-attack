mike, jeff 

although for short term biz we are still trading as usual (we are fixing an average of one ship per working day in order to close heavily in the money short positions read in plain english to realize profits) and although we are keeping the deal pipeline alive for longer term biz it would help me a lot in order to keep on motivating my team and continue increase our positive ytd cashflow/realized margin and minimise our already very small average capital employed , to have following questions answered asap :

1/
what are the likely scenarios you see as off today for EGM/Coal/Vessel trading (being a grown up person please give me all the possible scenarios you see/ among other things management is the art of being prepared for the worse) 

2/
what is the scenario you are betting on 

3/
as EGM management what are you doing practically in order to make that scenario happen (a daily report on this would be much welcome for us to take steps to help things happen)

your timely feed back much appreciated . thanks
