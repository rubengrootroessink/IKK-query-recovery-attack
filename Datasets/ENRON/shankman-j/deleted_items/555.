Wow! It sounds as if you really have been busy. I expect postcards
from each of the exotic places that you visit! I think that we
probably have a greater chance of meeting in an airport than in
either Atlanta or Houston!
Congrats on your appointment and honour at the Museum of Fine Arts!
It sounds really exciting! You will really get to "hob nob" with the
artistic types..I am a little envious...
I am actually awaiting several people in my group to arrive as we
have a group project to do this weekend... remember thaose days of
group projects...it is a little different when you are 30+...people
have to feed their kids and take care of those domestic obligations!!!
I'll send you Dori's info in the next email..I have it at home.
Take care and definitely let me know if you will visit South Africa.
Try to go during our winter, as it will be summer there.
