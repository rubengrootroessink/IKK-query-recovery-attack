fred/jeff- we just did a 6000 lot crude deal with global advisors- we actually had an order to do 6000 more but because of the 5000 lot limit we have in the cargill contract, we could not do it..

i am really proud of everyone's efforts here.

the deal was a brent/wti spread for CY02 (they bought WTI and sold Brent).. the idea was generated by us...global liked it and put it on.  

Global's head trader Danny Masters ran JPM's commodity group before starting his own fund and is one of the biggest traders in the market.

this is the largest crude deal we have done.

the execution was through John Thomas in London.. he did a great job.. made a fair price right away..

the deal confirmation between michelle and derek and cargill/global is going smoothly.

and most importantly we made 135k outright.

many more of these to come...

we have also traded about 2000 lots of nat gas with global since signing the legal agreement in August.

Rgds,
caroline
