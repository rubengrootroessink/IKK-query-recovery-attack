The Department of Trade and Industry in the UK comes out every quarter with their "Energy Trends" Fuel oil assessment for a quarter in arrears. They published this week their Q2 01 figure (and revised up their Q1 01) figure - the net effect is a ?423,000 hit to the book ($602,000).
 
I would expect that they revise down these figures in their next publication (due mid Jan 2002). We are adjusting the Energy Trends curve for the "actual" fixings tonight (since it effects a lot of other books in Enron Europe) - and will therefore take a hit of $600k tomorrow.
