John/ Jeff-

We have approx 100 staff in NY in 2 offices ready to help the family and friends of any Enron employees in the NY area.

I have talked to Mark Jeffries at the crisis center and our HR Reps about offering our assistance.

They are trying to co-ordinate an effort but in the meantime can you please mention this to the staff in EGM and ENA- they can contact me directly anytime.

We have office space in 780 3rd ave, we can offer housing, we can try to contact people, visit.. anything.

Regards,
Caroline
