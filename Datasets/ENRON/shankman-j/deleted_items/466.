It is so nice to hear from you, Jeffrey.  I am  so glad that you weren't on one of those planes or at a meeting in the  Towers.  Personally, I lost several acquaintances and clients, but no  family or friends, so I feel really blessed.  In case you didn't know, my  Hillary worked on the 101st floor in a charity that was located in the Cantor  Fitzgerald offices.  It feels like a hand passed over her and she was  spared, thank god.
 
When the rabbis closed the doors of the ark on Yom  Kippur eve (in Rome's 100 year-old synagogue, btw), I just lost it.  I  started crying for all those who didn't make it to this point, and my heart  yearned to mourn for all of them, to give their souls an aliyah before the doors  of their fate were sealed, but the emotions of it were just overwhelming.   Words (for once) fail me.
 
I hope your Kippur was with loved ones and deeply  meaningful.  As for me, I'm planning on celebrating Sukkoth tonight with my  families, and then going to Washington Square Park for a quick l'chaim just to  make it kosher.
 
Things have been a bit quiet, but hopefully we'll  have some bites on your two items soon.  I do have a museum interested in  the Galle.
 
I am looking forward to sending you the most recent  batch of masterpieces you got here.  You really are developing a great  collection.
 
Thanks for your good wishes,
 
Love,
ben
