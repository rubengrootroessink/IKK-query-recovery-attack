Jeff,

Sorry I haven't answered sooner but I have been in a workshop for several days.  I had a buyer for the land and he is not able to get the land until late Dec or early Jan.  I am trying very hard to sell the land so that I can repay you.  I have someone else looking as well.

I will keep you posted and I know you need your money asap.  

Thanks again for your help!


Donnis

Hi Donnis,

I hope your weekend was nice.  Last week I sent you an email on your timing for repayment.  Your last email to me states that this would be done so in November, and I wanted to get an update from you.  

I would appreciate a response.

Jeff
