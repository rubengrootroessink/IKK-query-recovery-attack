   Hey Jeff.  Have a favor to ask.  Trying to get clarification on the
   Enron
   balance sheet.  If you have some time can we speak about various aspects
   of
   the business?  I know you are busy, and not necessarily as familiar with
   the
   off balances sheet structures, but perhaps you could be of some
   assistance.
   I think your the smartest guy I know that still works there.  Maybe its
   your
   Penn roots.

   I am in Houston over Thanksgiving.  Perhaps we can finally get that long
   awaited drink you owe me!  If in London please give me a call.  I have a
   great place here you are welcome to crash at.
