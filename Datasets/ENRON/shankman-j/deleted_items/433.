Hey Everyone-

I've just won an all-you-can-drink happy hour at Have a Nice Day Cafe!  Come this Friday between 8 and 10, mention that you're with Matt Commons, and you'll get free beer, wine and appetizers.

Have a Nice Day Cafe is next to Bar Houston in Bayou Place (see attached flyer for details).  It has a 70s/80s theme, and was nominated for the "Best Singles Scene" in Houston!  Plus, after 10:00 you can get into Bar Houston for free. 

Hope to see you there...

Matt
