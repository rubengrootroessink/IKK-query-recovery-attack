Just a note to remind you that Sunday, November 18th is Mitzvah Day.  If

you haven't signed up, just stop by our  "late registration" table and
we'll be happy to assign you to a project.  When you come to the Temple,

(opening ceremonies are at 8:30 am) please bring non-perishable food and

good used clothing for the needy in our community.
We're having a blood drive in the Board Room.  Help save a life!
The  Jewish Family Service TaySachs screening will be held at the Jewish

Community Center.
Hope to see you Sunday!!!!!
