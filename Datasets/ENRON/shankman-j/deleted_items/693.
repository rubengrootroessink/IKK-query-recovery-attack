Jeff,

Spoke to Michelle on Friday, she suggested that we have Masha Ariefieva, Andrew Hill and Dee Ware return to work as soon as possible.

I was thinking I would call each of them this afternoon to tell them to come back in starting tomorrow.  I would also plan to call Lowell, Matt and Matt to give him a head's up that they would be returning.  We would not share the results of the investigation with them, but would ask that they not discuss the case with anyone.

Ryan Seleznov has a meeting scheduled with Jen on Monday, 11/26.  Jeff's atty has been told that following the meeting with Jen, we would be prepared to issue a decision.

Ok with you?

Shanna
