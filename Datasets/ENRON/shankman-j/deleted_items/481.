Jeff,

Any insight?  I'll bring this up with Nowlan tomorrow.  We have companies looking for LPG swaps and while we appreciate recent volatility, when can we move forward?

Incidently, we lost out on a WTI swap with Mitsui OSK the other day when another trader called them (at midnight) to close the trade on the recent dip.

Joe

Jeremy;

Even though market has dropped a lot, our trader in London ( Bo Petersen ) is not ready to trade anything longer than a month. According to him, the market is too volatile at this moment and cannot take that risk.
