I will do my best on the girlfriend, and I am 90% sure I can do the watch.
Yours is white gold right?

		Bubbee,

		How's it going?  Definitely, next time I'm in NY, I'll let
you take me
		to dinner--at least drinks.  By the way, I don't know if you
know that
		I'm currently offerring a car to anyone who finds me a wife.
Keep it in
		mind.

		Anyway,  I paid $10,900 plus tax, total $11799.25.  For you
$6,000.
		There are no more available, only 1912 were made in total.
(divided
		between white, yellow and rose gold.)  1912 was when the
model came out,
		and this was a reissue.  I have all papers, and box.

		Find me a girlfriend, please.

		Jeff
