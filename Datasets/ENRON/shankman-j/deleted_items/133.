I'd love to catch up, and will do so shortly.  As I always tell my guys, if your job doesn't change one day to the next, keep doing your job.  

hugs to the wife.

Jeff

I'm sure you've been going through some pretty tough shit lately.  Just
wanted to say hi and I hope you're doing well.  I'd be happy to help take
your mind off of things if you want to head to the region.  (not that life
is a bowl of cherries up here either)

Take care,

Scott
