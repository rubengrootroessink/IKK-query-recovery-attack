I have no furniture, and the Kjaerholm might work--I need the dimesions.  Do you ever come across the Mies chairs?  What do you think of those?  OK, now for a crazy thing, I'm getting new checks printed and they should be to me immediately after thanksgiving, and I promise I'll have a check to you next week.  I hope that's ok.  If not let me know.

Regards,

Jeff

Thanks for the email. What kind of furniture are you looking for?  I have
alot of pieces that we are getting ready for the shop. What about Kjaerholm?
We have a pair of rare Aalto lounge chairs. great dining tables, chirs etc.
etc. Last question....did you have a chance to send the Salto check? Best, Kim
