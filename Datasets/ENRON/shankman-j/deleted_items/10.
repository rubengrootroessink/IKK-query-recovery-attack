Dear Equity,

	Good morning!

*	The Bush Administration is working with members of the Senate Banking
Committee
	to reach an agreement on terrorism insurance legislation. The design of
the plan
	resembles the Bush Administration's proposal of a temporary program under
which the 
	federal government will pay a certain percentage of claims from a
terrorist attacks
	during the next few years.

*	We are now in the 5th week of the end of recession rally. Each week that
goes by 
	where stocks and bonds move up together, the more convinced we get of a V
shaped
	recovery.

*	There is a great package of news suggesting that inflation plunges over
the next
	few months:
		-- Consumer inflation expectations down sharply
		-- German import prices declining
		-- Tokyo CPI continues to decline
		-- Philly Fed Prices Paid plunging

*	After bouncing for 3 weeks, our overall company surveys index of 14
industries 
	declined last week.

*	Although capex has already been weak, it is likely to continue to weaken
in Q4 as
	suggested by surging layoff announcements. Managements making the tough
decision
	to lay off workers are likely to also cut capex.

*	JIM MOLTZ HAS SWITCHED HIS RECOMMENDATION IN TECH FROM AN UNDER-WEIGHT TO 
	MARKET-WEIGHT.
