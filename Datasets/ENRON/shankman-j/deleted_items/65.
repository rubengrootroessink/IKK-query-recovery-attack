Guys,

Sempra Energy Trading is not trading with us today, and they were yesterday--particularly on EOL.

Also, I just talked to Steve Semlitz, head of Hess, (Hetco) and he said he's called Tom a few times.  (Tom,he know's you're busy).  They want to take margin both ways to $0, instead of the $10 million line we have now.
