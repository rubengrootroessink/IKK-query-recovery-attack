If, for some reason, this shipping address is incorrect, please let us know.
It is too late to change the address on the package and will be best if the
package can still be received by someone at the address. If that is not
possible, the shipper can be advised of your forwarding address and the
shipment can be diverted to that address, though this will necessitate extra
transit time.
