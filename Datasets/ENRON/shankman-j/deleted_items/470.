Mike/Jeff,

I had wanted to speak with you about this last week, but the time did not allow.  We currently have less than 5 spaces left on the trading floor.  The total build out costs would be just under USD800k (@ JPY120).  Getting the buildout in motion would allow this to be completed by beginning to mid December.  I don't mean to rush, but if ok, I'd like to give go ahead this week.

Joe

Joe,

Pls find attached the budget plan and layout for your approval.

The outline of this build out is as follows:
1) New Space
-add 64 trading desks
-open meeting spaces for internal meeting
-add filing cabinet
-remove the wall dividing the two spaces

2) Existing Space
-expand public space by changing storage/mgr room to meeting rooms

I appreciate if we could have this plan approved by the end of next week so that we can place the order for A/C by September 21 to meet the schedule. 

Should you need any further information, pls let me know.

Regards,

Akiko
