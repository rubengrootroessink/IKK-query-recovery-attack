H Robert,

Sorry for the delay, however you know it has been very busy these last several weeks at Enron.  Unfortunately, we are not hiring, and won't be for the foreseeable future.  It would be best if we could schedule a phone call sometime during December when I will have more time to help.

Regards,

Jeff

Mr. Shankman:

Thank you for getting back to me.

My interests lie in trading commodities and derivatives.  I know that Enron
is very much behind the move to commoditize many products and trade them
over electronic exchanges and feel that this is a strong position for the
digital future.  I think what Enron is doing is exciting and I would like to
speak with you about it and the opportunities it opens up to a person such
as myself.

It is nice to know that the Wharton alumni community is strong all over the
world.  If you have a few minutes, I would certainly appreciate the
opportunity to introduce myself to you.  Thanks again.

Sincerely,

Robert Brown
832.541.5805
