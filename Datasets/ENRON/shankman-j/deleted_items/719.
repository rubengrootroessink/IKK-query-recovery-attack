Jeff,
 
I would like to come up with a payment schedule.  I can pay $500/month.  If you can just give me a little more time I will have this resolved.

Hi Donnis, 

I know it has been hard selling the land, but we need to come up with a payment schedule, or your will need to give me the land valued at $11,500.  What do you prefer.  In light of the difficult times at the company these days, I'd like to get this resolved.

Thanks for understanding. 

Jeff
