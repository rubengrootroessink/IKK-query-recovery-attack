Hi Jeffrey,

We met at the opening of the Contemporary Art Museum's opening of the Yoko
Ono exhibition, and I would be delighted to see you on my forthcoming trip
to Houston to lecture next week.

Would you be free for a quick chat the afternoon of September 12? I would be
interested in learning more about Enron's support of the arts and its ties
to Japan, and would welcome the chance to describe our activities to you.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Sincerely,
Alexandra Munroe
Director, Japan Society Gallery
