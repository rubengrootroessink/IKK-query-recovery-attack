Li Sun. She is a Wharton Grad currently in EBS, I think.

Jeff - 

Shanna forwarded this request to me.  What is the name of the associate you referred to below?  Please let me know and I will provide Joe Hirl the resume.  Thanks.

Hi Joe, 

I mentioned to you an associate from wharton who has been here for 2 years looking for another rotation.  She is very interested in Japan, and a hard worker.  Probably more of a market research, model building, person at this point in her career, but I don't know, and I don't want to sell her short.

What do you have for her?  I'd like to keep her around. 

Jeff
