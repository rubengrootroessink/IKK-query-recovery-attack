Hi Donnis,
 
Congratulations on the land sale.  Can I get a copy of the sale papers for my files, so I have some written assurances that you will be able to pay me back?  Thanks for understanding, and I'm glad to help.
 
Jeff

Jeff,
 
Good Morning!
 
I have good news.  I have the land sold but will not get the money until the last week of December.  If the deal closes sooner, I will get the money to you asap.
 
I just want you to know that I appreciate everything that you have done for me and especially the opportunities you have given Jennifer.
 
Donnis

Donnis,
 
At $500 per month, ith will take you 23 months to repay me, which I am not willing to do.  I need assurance that you will repay me.  I don't understand what you mean when you say you need a little more time to have this resolved--please clarify.
 
Thanks for your reply this morning.
 
Jeff

Jeff,
 
I would like to come up with a payment schedule.  I can pay $500/month.  If you can just give me a little more time I will have this resolved.

Hi Donnis, 

I know it has been hard selling the land, but we need to come up with a payment schedule, or your will need to give me the land valued at $11,500.  What do you prefer.  In light of the difficult times at the company these days, I'd like to get this resolved.

Thanks for understanding. 

Jeff
