Jeffrey-

It was good to visit with you this past weekend in Louisville.  As we
briefly discussed, I will be living in Chicago July 30 and would love an
opportunity to work for Enron in the Chicago office. In part of my due
diligence, I have found that Enron has numerous aspects to it's company.
Based on my past experience, a sales position would probably be most fitting
especially in the area of IT sales, broadband, and/or internet. I was given
Jennifer Cronin's name (IT recruiter-713-345-8267) and Kevin Ormston
(Broadband recruiter- 713-853-6418) from Paul Koontz who works with EBS in
Chicago (312-583-1676). I spoke with Jennifer but she was unaware of any
positions for EBS in Chicago, although she did say she would check with her
VP. We agreed that most of the opportunities for sales forces on the
web-site appear to be in the Houston area. Hopefully there may be another
way I could be part of Enron via a Chicago office or as part of a sales team
that would sell either IT services/ bandwidth to new customers, or even
service existing companies like Simon Property Group via Enron's Intelligent
Network on a national or international level.

In addition to the sales opportunity, I did see an Associates program
available for certain people through Enron that appears to be two, one-year
training programs that aids those employers in learning from the bottom up,
focusing on the business side of Enron.

Jeffrey, attached please find my resume (a hard copy will be easily
furnished if requested) and again, I would like to reiterate my willingness
to work both very hard and smart, in an attempt to become an employer with
Enron, in Chicago.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated,

Thank You,

Jeffrey Goldberg
