Monday's OOC staff meeting was set aside for me to share with you the logistics around the upcoming layoffs.  The latest information is that layoffs will not occur until Wednesday (11/28) or Thursday (11/29).  The HR Leads will not receive the logistics information until Monday evening, so I think we will need to re-schedule our meeting for Tuesday morning.

Please consider your travel plans as the layoff date will not be Tuesday, 11/27 as originally scheduled.

If I receive more information over the weekend, I will pass it on to you.

Thanks,
Shanna
