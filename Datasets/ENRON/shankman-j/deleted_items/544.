Jeffrey:

Thanks for taking the time to step out into the heat to "dine" with me. As
always; it was a pleasure catching up (ever so briefly). Per our discussion,
my post-Belco career move will most likely be to a) a Financial Control
post in an energy company, b) Risk/Financial Control consulting or c) tbd
other intellectually challenging position. I've attached my resume for you
to
send on to Joe Gold at MG -- if he's interested in adding staff to his NY
operation. If he's not interested -- it's okay, I appreciate your thoughts
& support anyway.

On another note...please make some quality time for me (and my husband)
next time your in Manhattan. If you give us some notice, we'll book a great
dinner spot.

In the meantime, I hope the summer associate party was enjoyable--next time,
I suggest
renting a fun public venue...or hire a professional caterer!

Stay happy & healthy, and don't sweat the little things!

Ronney
