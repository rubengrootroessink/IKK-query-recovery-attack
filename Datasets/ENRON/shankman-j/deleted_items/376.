Eric:

Clay Harris and I met with the Venezuelan Ambassador this afternoon and reiterated our interest in arranging a meeting for Enron with President Chavez, who will visit the UK during 21-24 October.  The ambassador responded initially that Chavez's schedule had been "set for months" and that changing the schedule would be difficult.  After further discussion, he said Chavez would certainly be interested in discussing the project, and that they might be able to make time on the schedule at about 1100 hours on Tuesday 23 Oct.  We provided a brief overview of the status of the project, and he asked that we provide as soon as possible names and bio information for whoever would meet with Chavez if this comes off.  He promised to get back to us as quick as he can.  Please let us know who will be available from Houston for a possible Tuesday morning meeting here.  Thanks.

Jim
