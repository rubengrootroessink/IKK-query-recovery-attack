I spoke with Gary about this.  As you know the futures market closes at 2, and the cash market closes at 4.  He told me that you and he spoke of this last year, and that he would have the curves out between 3 and 3:30 which he mostly does.  Friday he was working the C$ deal with Zufferili.  I've told he to shoot for 3.
 
Any thoughts?
 
Jeff

I have had many complaints over the last year about the inability for the interest rate group to set their curves on time and on a consistant basis.  Every few months I once again ask Puskar (sp) and/or Gary to deal with this.  I am getting very upset.  We have 50 to 100 risk book runners who are forced to work late always siting the interest rate curve as the reaon.  
 
Please Help
