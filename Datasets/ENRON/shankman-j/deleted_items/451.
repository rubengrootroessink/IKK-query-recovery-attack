Jeff,
  Hi. How is everything going? I was wondering what is going on with the trading track and if maybe I can interview with some people over here in the UK. I've contacted Karen Buckley a few times on the issue, but have not heard anything and I know interviews were over a week ago, so I thought I'd drop you a line.
  Otherwise, how do the Penn recruits look? If there is anything I can do from overseas, please let me know.

Thanks,
Zac
