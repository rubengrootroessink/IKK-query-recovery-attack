I'm happy to get Ken to campus whenever we can.  I'll get the available 2nd semester dates and send them to you.  Hopefully we can try to get something incorporated into the curriculum during that semester in conjunction with a visit.

Also, my guess is that you've been getting a lot of calls from people disappointed about not being on our preselect list.  (I know that I have).  We received 215 resumes for 42 interview slots, so there are a lot of good people that we didn't preselect - we gave preference to people who had investment banking/trading and/or energy experience that we thought would have a higher likelihood of moving to Houston.  I've been telling the people who have called to try to get added to the invite list that they can sign up for any open interview slots on Oct. 25 in the online CareerTrack system.

I talked to Rosie yesterday, and she indicated Ken would not be available this semester, but would like to do something for us next semester.  Any thoughts?

Here are the available 1st semester dates - 
November 1
November 15
December 6

They probably also have some flexibility to schedule him to speak on another date if that coincides with his schedule - ie. he's going to be in NY or DC and can just do a quick stop in Philadelphia.

I've attached the agenda that discusses a typical schedule for Zwieg.
