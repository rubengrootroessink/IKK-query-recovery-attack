Jeff - 

Hope all is well - it's been a while!

This is a Penn undergrad (with an MBA) who is looking for a position at Enron.  I'm not sure there's anything for him here in EES, but I'll ask around.  Would you be interested in him?

Suzanne

Dear Ms. Suzanne Farrow,  
I found your name on our UPenn alumni listing and decided to contact you  
directly with regards to my interest in networking with professionals.  
After graduating from UPenn, I established my own business in the  
pharmaceutical industry which I sold in order to attend business school.  I  
am interested in working for a leading such as Enron, and would thus, like  
to send you a copy of my resume.  
Looking forward to hearing from you soon,  
Howard Marx
