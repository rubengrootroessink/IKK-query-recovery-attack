Dear Collector,

The creativity, character and heritage of American artistic style are very much in evidence in our special online sale. Among the highlights, we are pleased to offer a selection of works by Patrick Henry Bruce and Morgan Russell, two important 20th century modernists rarely seen at auction. The group comes to us from a private collection, the owner of which was a tireless proponent and champion of synchromism and enjoyed an active correspondence with virtually all of the major figures in this important movement. Click the link below to go directly to the sale.

Also featured is a fine collection of paintings from a Florida estate consisting of 19th and early 20th century American landscapes by Herman Herzog, Henry Chapman Ford and Guy Wiggins, among others. Another highlight is a full-scale drawing by Norman Rockwell of "Willie Gillis at the U.S.O.", the finalized version of which appeared as a Saturday Evening Post cover on February 7, 1942. Most works in this sale will be exhibited at Sotheby's New York from November 24-29, on the 6th floor. Please check individual lots for exhibition information.
