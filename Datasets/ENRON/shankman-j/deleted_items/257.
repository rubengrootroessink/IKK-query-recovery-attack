Captain Gault was primarily involved in the review of the Excaliber construction.  As this is now coming to an end Tony felt uncomfortable with our limited vessel build strategy.  He has not indicated where he is going.  Regarding Tim, if we need services outside of his capabilities we have agreed we will just hire a consultant for the remainder of our requirements.  

Regards,
Eric

Jeff,

Tony Galt, of the LNG group, gave two weeks notice last week.  His last day will be October 31st.  Tony functions as the LNG group's marine superintendent, reporting to Tim Nash under Jonathan Whitehead.  It appears that Tim Nash will be picking up these functions for at least the remainder of the year.  Let me know if you would like any further information.
