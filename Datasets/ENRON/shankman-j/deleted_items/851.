Thank you very much, Jeff.  I will have all the money in November for you.  Can you leave the check at the security desk downstairs at the Enron Bldg?

Donnis, I will loan you the other $5000.  Will you also pay back the other $6500 I've already loaned you by the first of November?  This will be the last loan I will make to you.  Again, I'm glad to help, but I'm doing this for Jennifer as well.  How would you like it delivered to you?
 
Jeff

Jeff,
 
If you could loan me the $5000, I can have that paid back to you by the first of November.  I have someone who wants the 5 acres but will not close on his house until the end of October.  I hope you will consider.  This would be the first time for me to ever own a home.  I don't have any other way of making this happen.
 
I want let you down.  This is a once in a lifetime deal for me.  I have so much to gain by this.  If I ever had to sell the house, it is worth $145,000.
 
Thanks,
 
Donnis
