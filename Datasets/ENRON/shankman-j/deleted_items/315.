I have had many complaints over the last year about the inability for the interest rate group to set their curves on time and on a consistant basis.  Every few months I once again ask Puskar (sp) and/or Gary to deal with this.  I am getting very upset.  We have 50 to 100 risk book runners who are forced to work late always siting the interest rate curve as the reaon.  
 
Please Help
