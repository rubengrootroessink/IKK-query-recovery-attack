Dear friends,

We have (hastily) scheduled our first executive committee meeting of the new
fiscal year for THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6 AT 4:00 AT THE MUSEUM.

Please forgive this short notice which is necessary as it became clear that
Mrs. Ballard, Chair, would be out of town for much of the month of September
and we need to have an executive committee meeting in advance of the
September 10 meeting of the Board of Trustees.

At the Thursday meeting, we'll create a schedule for executive committee
meetings for the year, as well as establish a time and place for the
meetings which is mutually convenient.

Last year, the committee met once a month on Wednesdays at the Bayou Club
which proved to work well for everyone.

Please let Cheryl know if you will be able to attend Thursday's meeting.
You may reach her at 713 284 8253 or by email to bliss@camh.org.

Thanks and I hope to see you Thursday.


Marti Mayo
