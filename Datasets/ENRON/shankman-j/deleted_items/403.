Hi Jeff:

Just wanted to drop you a quick note to let you know that it was a pleasure meeting you at Wharton.  I am enclosing my resume as we discussed. As a reminder, I am the student from Nigeria you spoke to at the end of the program at Wharton - you wanted me to mention that when I wrote to you.  It is nice to hear that you are still in Nigeria.  Jeff, I am open to discussing opportunities anywhere in the World.

After conversations with both Matt Zaklad and Neel Broker (your summer associates) I am convinced that Enron provides the right environment for me to begin my post-MBA career.  I am excited about the possibility of working for Enron.  I am requesting that I be included on your closed list.

For your information, I spent the summer at Morgan Stanley working with the Securitized Products Group and the Principal Transactions Group. I am a US trained professional engineer.  Please let me know if I can provide you with any additional information.

Look forward to hearing from you and speaking with you about opportunities.

Regards,
Lenka
