Joe, 

I can only imagine that your experiences with diabetes helped more than we will know.  It was an extremely difficult situation, and I really wanted to thank you for your ability to recognize the situation.  Workplace incidents like this are very hard to manage on so many fronts.  Your help today is appreciated by everyone in EGM.

Jeff
