Dear friends,

As discussed in the last executive committee meeting, I am preparing a list
of individuals for Fred Schroeder to "interview" when they are here to work
with us in November.  I'd like to send them 10 to 15 possiblilities as they
can see a good number over the time they're here, and those they don't catch
now can be contacted for a later trip.  Fred suggested we look at this as a
"first wave" of some people who know us well; more interviews with those at
a greater distance will come later.

Please let me know your thoughts.
