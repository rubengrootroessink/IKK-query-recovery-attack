Hi Jeff,

As you may know, the firm has offices in DC and NY and
focuses on late stage venture investments in energy
technology, biopharma, and other areas as well as
buyouts and rollups in a variety of
industries--including energy.  Understandably, I
welcome all the challenges and rewards which come with
this new opportunity.  My new information is below
(after 9/4):


Perseus LLC
2099 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.
9th Floor
Washington, D.C. 20006
Work Phone: 202-452-0101
Work (and permanent) email: jeevg@yahoo.com  (I
check it all the time)


I look forward to keeping in touch.  Feel free to

All the best,
Rajeev
