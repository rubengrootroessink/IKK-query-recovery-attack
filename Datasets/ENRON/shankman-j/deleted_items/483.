Enron Global Markets Competitive Analysis
JAPAN UPDATE: 9/25/01

Risks Increase for Longer, Deeper Deflationary Recession If Current Policy =
Mix Muddle Remains, NPLs Unresolved


SUMMARY:

Deflationary Recession: Japan, apart from the raft of new and compounded di=
fficulties consequent of September 11, was already facing a very difficult =
end of fiscal half-year and confirmation of another recession
After September 11: The impact of the shock to the world system over the pa=
st two weeks has reinforced - from outside - the structural challenges faci=
ng the domestic system
Yen Strength Despite Intervention: Recent efforts to stem rise of Yen, enla=
rge supplementary budget, reinforce the continuing reactive basis of policy=
-making in Japan, leadership challenges
Koizumi Still Enjoying Support, Keeping LDP Afloat: Cabinet's approval rati=
ng is 79%, with the LDP's approval at a 9-year high of 51%
Signs of Life: Bankruptcies down and retail sales component rises; as in th=
e US, consumer behavior will drive outcomes
Surrounding Asia: Weakens further on concerns about risk aversion relative =
to emerging markets and depressed export outlook
Collateral Effects: US weakness reinforces trend toward coincident global r=
ecession
NPL Update: Still Vague: Koizumi finally releases basis for expanded RCC ro=
le in settling NPLs


REPORT:

Global Context
Japan's greatest challenge is coming from the coincidence of recession, def=
lation, high government debt stock, and, for the first time, sustained eros=
ion of export surpluses and flight of manufacturing outside of Japan for ex=
port to Japan.  Part of the latest reductions in the world growth outlook a=
nd the related decline in world equities are due to the September 11 traged=
y and its many human and economic consequences. This portion of the equity =
market losses will be hard to recover. Another part of the post-tragedy dec=
line is a delayed reaction to the global deflation and recession which were=
 deepening prior to September 11. (Economic data since September 11 provide=
d firm evidence of sharply weakening economies in the U.S. and Europe.  Equ=
ities would probably have declined even without the tragedy.) This part of =
the recent equity loss argues for policy changes to stop the global slowdow=
n.  The challenge, as described in previous reports, comes from differing p=
riorities and magnitudes of responses across major economies to a global cy=
cle downturn. =20

Koizumi v. MoF
The Japanese government reportedly signaled some flexibility in its fiscal =
stance:  Koizumi said he may have to take a "flexible approach" to the Y30 =
trillion cap on new JGB issuance; but Shiokawa said the government's plan t=
o keep new JGB issuance below Y30 trillion was unchanged.  The government i=
s considering issuing up to Y5 trillion 10-year or shorter maturity "Koizum=
i bonds", funded by the sale of national assets as well as funds arising fr=
om administrative reforms (not included in the Y30 trillion cap).

BoJ
The central bank has shown no inclination to use monetary policy stimulus t=
o stop the recession. Instead, it continues to pursue fiscal stimulus and s=
tructural reforms, policy steps are seen by several sources as actually dee=
pening the recession. Though nominal interest rates are at zero, real inter=
est rates are very high. The central bank provides Y6 trillion in excess li=
quidity to the commercial banking sector, but the funds are very short term=
 and have not penetrated into the economy.

NPLs
Event: Koizumi administration officials released the program for expanding =
the Resolution Credit Corp's role in settling the NPL problem.  Because of =
still unsettled battles between FSA leader Yanagisawa and other Koizumi adv=
isors, the details of this plan were still left vague.  Yanagisawa is invol=
ved in a two-front war, pinned between officials on one side who want to ba=
nkrupt the 20-30 top debtor companies immediately, and BOJ officials on the=
 other side, who want to fund the RCC much more aggressively through buying=
 specially issued RCC bonds to let the institution expand its purchases of =
bad debt.

Result: What has been decided is to have the RCC dramatically change the pr=
ice at which they will purchase assets from banks and to expand its ability=
 to make losses when it sells those assets. This is an "in principle" decis=
ion and the fights rage on about exactly what this new freedom should mean.=
 Yanagisawa hopes to combine more activity on this front with his main idea=
 of re-examining 'need-attention' loans (with help from market signals like=
 the price of company stock, etc. detailed in our previous reports). Yanagi=
sawa would create a new class for these loans and then require banks to rai=
se the reserves they hold against these loans.=20

Strategy: Using the RCC is seen as an alternative to direct capital injecti=
on.  As one senior advisor put it, "It's not just that Yanagisawa wants to =
avoid capital injection because he'd be blamed for the failure of his first=
 injection. It's because capital injection (into "healthy" banks) doesn't w=
ork. We can't really force them to change management and to improve perform=
ance. There's a sense at FSA and the government generally that bankers are =
lousy and they'll never improve. Banks....are very unpopular. Providing cap=
ital to RCC is less obviously a direct help to the banks. That explains som=
e of the interest on the part of politicians." And it explains why this wil=
l be part of the eventual solution.

BOJ's Interest: BoJ is interested in funding this RCC because it allows the=
m to be part of the solution without adopting inflation targets or directly=
 purchasing JGBs. Assuming the RCC will be financed through issue of govern=
ment-guaranteed bonds, the BOJ would be happy to buy them as long as they w=
ere guaranteed (but not issued by) the Japanese government. BoJ does not wa=
nt to directly underwrite bonds issued by RCC because that would be against=
 the law (conveniently) and RCC would have a low rating. It's also true tha=
t BOJ likes the RCC idea better than going through the process of tighter a=
ssessment, bankruptcies, and capital injection, because it cleans up the ba=
nks' books in one swoop.

FSA's Concern: FSA official's comment: "There is a real problem in everybod=
y pretending that the problem will be solved by taking all the bad loans to=
 RCC. No matter how much money it gets, the RCC simply doesn't have the cap=
acity to help reconstruct companies. Maybe it can farm out this work to tho=
se who do. But the most likely outcome is that it will just give up and res=
ell everything at market price. This would mean that a lot of companies, in=
cluding those which may be saved, will go bankrupt. There are social and ec=
onomic consequences - it will be very deflationary. The banks will be a lot=
 better off but industry will be in a bad way. That's why we have to take s=
ome more time and figure out how much of this can be done through the RCC a=
nd how much through better reserving for special attention NPLs."=20

Koizumi Advisor's Assessment: One of Koizumi's advisors, looking over the s=
tate of play and admitting all of the hesitation that FSA officials feel, s=
ays, "There is no doubt that we still have lots of stuff to be worked out. =
But as I see it, we now have vague outlines of NPL disposal. In addition, t=
he FSA now admits that it has to get tighter: i.e., it has to get to the 'n=
eed attention' loans and look at them more carefully, reclassify the bad pa=
rts of need attention loans, and those additional downgraded loans will hav=
e to be disposed of in the 2-3 year framework. In other words, the Y13 tril=
lion total will go up significantly. We will give banks a break through the=
 use of something significantly above market price in selling NPLs to RCC. =
But the most fundamental thing still to be understood is that the RCC will =
have to acquire reconstruction skills or buy them if the companies sold to =
RCC are to have a fair chance of recovery."
