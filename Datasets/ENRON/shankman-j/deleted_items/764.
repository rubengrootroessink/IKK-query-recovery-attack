Hi John, 

 I will be in London sometime next week and was hoping to look at the knox cup, or experience the miracle of your finding the little dresser 3 legged conical bowl I want.  In any event, I'd like to have the option of getting the 7800 pounds back if nothing materializes.  As you know, Enron is undergoing very hard times, and I have a lot of loose ends that I'd like to manage.  I'm off for the Thanksgiving holiday for the next few days, and hope you have a great weekend.

Best regards,

Jeff

     Just after your email someone came to my shop and expressed interest in
the Knox Cup. . .so I didn't reply until interest waned.  This Knox cup is a
variant of the cup that is on the cover of Steve Martin's book.   Steve has
now brought out a new book on Knox and this cup is illustrated in it.   You
might be able to get the book from Amazon.com.   Full title is: Archibald
Knox by  Stephen A Martin.  Artmedia Press.
