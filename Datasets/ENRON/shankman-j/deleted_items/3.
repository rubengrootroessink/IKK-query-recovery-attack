Given the total and complete lack of communication from management, I can only assume the worst about our financial situation.  Is there any reason that I should not be trying to sell EFM?  We could at least recoup what we have spent so far.  It may be pennies relative to the problem, but like you, I would like to find a way to keep the momentum of the group and do what is right for our employees.

The only downside could be the PR, but at $14.00, I can't imagine that matters anymore.

Please advise.

Dan
