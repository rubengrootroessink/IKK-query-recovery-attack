Hi John,

Anything I can do to accommodate you is fine with me, of course.  In addition, I will do everything I can to support you with the museum here.  I can't tell you how awful it has been here--and my morale has certainly been higher.  

Best regards,

Jeff

  Hi Jeff,

Let me know when you are coming to London, so that I can be sure to be here
to show you the Knox cup and the new book by Steve Martin.

Since September 11, business has really dried up, mostly because my main
outlet is to Americans who are not travelling much at the moment.  So I
propose to send you a cheque for ?2800 within the next few days, or give it
to you when you come here, followed by a cheque for ?2500 in December and
one for ?2500 in January.   Total ?7800.   The last thing I was expecting
was you calling in your credit, and like all dealers I'm always trying to
keep my balance on the tightrope.   Let me know what you think.

In the meantime I have heard about the troubles at Enron, and I hope all
goes well for you.

Regards
John
