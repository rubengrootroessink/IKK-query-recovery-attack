Elsa/Ken, what's the status on the deliverables for weather, heating oil, and propane? Following is what I recall from our last meeting:

Weather: 

1.) Physically locate 2 individuals on EES product floor that will focus solely on weather products to our retail customer base, they should be sitting here now. 
2.) Have at least one weather product fully developed/structured and ready to roll-out to the sales folks in the targeted customer channel. The timeline on this was        Monday, September 10th. Be sure you have a weather contract fully developed and sign-off from retail legal (Vicki Sharp).

Heating Oil/Propane:

1.) Have one person identified to manage both products together. Physically locate them on same floor with EES product development. Timeframe on this was this week.

I'd like to set up a meeting with both of you, Jeremy, Vicki and myself to review the product and marketing approach before we roll it out to the sales force.
