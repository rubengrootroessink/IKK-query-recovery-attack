Dear Kite and Key Alumni:

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our letter this past
summer.  The Kite and Key Executive Board is excited to have such an
active group of alumni who are interested in establishing a Board of
Governors!  To become acquainted with one another, we would like to
invite you to a Kite and Key Homecoming Reception that will occur after
the Penn-Princeton football game on Saturday, November 3rd.  The
gathering will be held in the Sweeten House, 3533 Locust Walk,
approximately at 4:00.  Attending the reception will be many current
Kite and Key students, as well as other Penn Alumni, with whom you can
speak.  For those of you who are interested, we hope to informally and
individually gather your ideas and visions of an Alumni Board of
Governors.  Food and drinks will be served.

To keep you updated on the most recent Kite and Key news and programs,
we have attached the Fall 2001 Newsletter that was distributed at our
first General Meeting in September.  Inside, you will find information
about the exciting initiatives that each of our projects hope to achieve
in the coming months.

We hope that you can attend the reception during Homecoming weekend.  If
you believe you will be able to join us, please RSVP to
jeffreyi@sas.upenn.edu and provide us with the number of guests in your
party.  If you cannot attend and would like to offer us input, please do
so by e-mailing jeffreyi@sas.upenn.edu.  We look forward to seeing you
on November 3rd!

Warmly,


Jeffrey Stewart					David Greene
Alumni Relations Coordinator			President
