Keeping in Touch

Since the events of September 11, members of the Wharton community have united to help one another through this difficult time.  Alumni, students, faculty, and staff have come together to share information, offer consolation, and reach out to help those affected by these horrific attacks.

Ten Wharton alumni lost their lives during the September 11 attacks.  The thoughts and prayers of the entire Wharton community go out to the family and friends of these alumni:

Mukul Agarwala, WG'90
J. Howard Boulton, WEV'94
Mark Charette, W'85
Robert Deraney, WG'83
Garth Feeney, W'95
Nicholas Humber, WG'67
Hideya Kawauchi, WG'93
Michael Miller, W'84
Tu-Ahn Pham, WG'89
Michael San Phillip, W'67

During the first days after the attacks, over 2000 Wharton graduates connected with one another through the "Friends and Family Status Database." The information that Wharton alumni offered on has been saved in a "Friends and Family" archives (http://wave.wharton.upenn.edu/friends_and_family/).   A "Community Discussion Board" was also created, through which alumni communicated about fellow graduates and loved ones as well as shared feelings about the events of September 11.   There is an online summary of the Wharton community's response (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu), including a video of Dean Harker's remarks at a memorial service on the Lehman Quad.

The Wharton Club of New York has taken the lead to assist alumni whose businesses have been affected.   A telephone hotline has been established to connect small- and medium-sized businesses with those who can provide assistance.  To reach the Wharton Club of New York's hotline, call 1.800.327.8065 or send e-mail to help@beckofficefurniture.com.
