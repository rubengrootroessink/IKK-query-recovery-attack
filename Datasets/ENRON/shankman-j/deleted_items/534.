Hi Jeff-

How are you?  I haven't quite melted yet, but I am coming close. It has been very hot here, but I know I can't expect to get any sympathy from someone who lives in Texas.

Thank you for thinking of me in regards to Sen. Schumer's fundraising.  What is his fundraiser's name?  I may know her or of her at least.  The political fundraising world is pretty small.

I am not sure what to make of the sunglasses comment because via email I can't tell if you were joking or serious.  But in either case, the answer is no.

Anyway, thanks again for thinking of me.  Hope all is well with you.

 -Jennie
