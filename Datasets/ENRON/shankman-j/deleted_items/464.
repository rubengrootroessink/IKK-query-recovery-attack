Guys,

Attached is a resume from a guy I used to office with at McKinsey named Richard Saettone (Say-tone).  He has an oil and gas background (Belco Petroleum, McKinsey clients Pemex, et. al.) and extensive M&A experience.  Originally from Peru and has a lot of practical business experience in Latin America (ran a 4-country retail business and two commercial banks).

I mentioned that I would pass this on to EGM - feel free to folllow up directly if interested.

Rob
