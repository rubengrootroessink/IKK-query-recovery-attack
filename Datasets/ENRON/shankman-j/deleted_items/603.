Dear Jeffery:
We goofed! Last week, you received a message from us inviting you to a November 19 event here at Wharton designed for HR executives. (It's a great program, with more than 80 senior HR execs attending, but clearly not intended to meet your priorities.)
In fact, the program we wanted to bring to your attention is a special 3-day symposium, developed in conjunction with a group of top Wharton faculty in response to the general economic climate and the potential repercussions of September 11.
"Wharton on the New Business Reality: Scenarios and Strategies for the Future"http://aresty-direct.wharton.upenn.edu/nbr/  
December 3-6, 2001 
This one-time program is designed for senior executives who help set and implement strategy and direction, or are charged with new business development for their organizations. Despite the short lead-time, we hope that you -- or someone appropriate from your organization -- will plan to attend. 
Many of the School's top faculty are taking part, including Jeremy Siegel (finance), Jerry Wind (marketing), Mike Useem (leadership), Ian MacMillan (entrepreneurial management), Steve Kobrin (international management), Harbir Singh (strategy), Peter Cappelli (human resources), Olivia Mitchell (insurance and risk), Franklin Allen financial services) and Dave Reibstein (marketing). 
Sessions and discussions will cover topics such as "Consumer Confidence and Behavior," "Business Portfolio Implications," "Leadership in Uncertain Times," Technology Perspectives," "The Global Supply Chain Post Sept. 11," and "Impact on Financial Markets." 
The program is designed to be intensive and interactive - to provoke lively discussion - and to provide the insights, tools and opportunity for participants to think strategically about their own organizations. Participants will leave with specific strategies identified for their organizations.
Enrollment in the symposium is limited, but we are pleased to extend to you priority registration (for yourself and/or someone else you designate). To reserve and ensure your place, we do need to hear back from you by Tuesday, November 20. (Enrollment can be completed online at http://aresty-direct.wharton.upenn.edu/nbr/  ) 
If you have any questions, please contact Ray Del Bianco, our director of business development, at 215-573-9205, or email delbianr@wharton.upenn.edu .  
We look forward to welcoming you at Wharton for what we know will be powerful event with timely content that should be immediately applicable to your business and organization.
Best regards,
Robert E. Mittelstaedt, Jr.
Vice Dean and Director
