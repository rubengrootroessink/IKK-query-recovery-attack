I'm sorry about being such a bum...I slept most of the weekend.  I think I'll pass on the chair--I'd rather start furnishing my house, so any good things you can show me, I'd love to see.  Just bill me the shipping, and I'd like to wait until after thanksgiving for the Salto as I'll be in and out of town.

Best regards,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,
I don't want to bother you but did you make a decision about the Valet? When
do you want to receive the Salto and do you have a fedex # that we can use
for the shipment? Thanks, Kim
