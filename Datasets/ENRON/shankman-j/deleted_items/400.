Jeff,

Confidentially, EBS in London is preparing to wind down, though officially no decision has been made.  I'll be back in Houston the week of the 21st talking to a variety of people about opportunities in Houston.  I'd like to schedule a little time with you that week. 

I'd appreciate any ideas you may have on where things are going and where a former spy/bandwidth trader might want to position himself.  Quite honestly, I'm looking for something compelling to do in Houston - Washington has been calling for me to return.

Look forward to seeing you.
