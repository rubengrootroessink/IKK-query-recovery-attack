Hi Li,
 
I'm off for thanksgiving and am looking for a break.  We'll get together in the next few weeks.  Take Care!
 
Jeff

I am very tired too, but I had a lot of fun. Please let me know when you have mood to do it again, and we should keep the place "secret". Last night's dinner was cancelled, so I didn't get the chance to send out the invitation to your party today. Have you made the decision to fly or drive to see your parents? When you get back, let's plan a Enron Wharton party.
 
All the best!
 
Li
