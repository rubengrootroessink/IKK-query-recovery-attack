As we continue to deal with the recent tragedy, we have launched an additional
resource for you to communicate with one another:  the Wharton Community
Discussion Board (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni, then select the
"Community Discussion Board").  Please share information about all members of
our community (alumni, students, faculty, staff, corporate partners and friends)
and about your loved ones and family (spouses, partners, children, parents,
brothers and sisters).

There are two forums on the site:  "Open Discussion" is a place you can share
your thoughts and feelings about the recent events.  On "Information on Friends,
Family and Colleagues", share news about fellow Wharton grads and loved ones.
We continue to encourage you to use the "Family and Friends Status Database"
(http://www.finebrand.com/statuses/affiliation.cfm?prefix=Wharton) for status
information, and use this discussion forum for extended news and updates.
Please be aware that due to the high amount of traffic on the "Family and Friends
Status Database", some alumni have experienced time delays in accessing the
site.

We invite you to contact us at alumni.affairs@wharton.upenn.edu, call us
at 1-215-898-8478, or visit our Web site at http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni.
The thoughts and prayers of the entire Wharton community are with those who
have been affected by this tragedy.

Sincerely,

Steven Oliveira
Associate Dean, External Affairs
