Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff
