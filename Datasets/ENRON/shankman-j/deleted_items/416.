Hi Joe,

Are you looking for any options traders?  I know a guy in NYC who wants to stay there, who has years of energy trading and options experience.  He's very strong, and would be a benefit to the group.  Also, if you hear of options guys that are interested in houston/london, let me know if they aren't a fit for you.

Regards,

Jeff
