What did you think of this guy?  I'm probably going to add some slots to our interview schedule and schedule some people for the slots.

Dear Mr LeBeau:
How's it going? Thank you for returning my call today. As you may remember, I met you, Mr Shankman, Ms Leibman, and Ms Li Sun at Cavanaughs with Matt Commons on Wednesday October 3rd. 

During that meeting, Mr Shankman suggested that I visit Enron down in Houston in the next few weeks. As I have not been placed on the closed interview list at Wharton, I was wondering if I could conduct the interview process while in Houston? Please see my updated resume attached for your review.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I am still very interested in obtaining a full-time position in the Associate Program at Enron.

Kind regards,
Edward Divgi
