Hi Joe,

I mentioned to you an associate from wharton who has been here for 2 years looking for another rotation.  She is very interested in Japan, and a hard worker.  Probably more of a market research, model building, person at this point in her career, but I don't know, and I don't want to sell her short.

What do you have for her?  I'd like to keep her around.

Jeff
