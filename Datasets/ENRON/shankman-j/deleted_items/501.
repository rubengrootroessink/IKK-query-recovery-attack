Jeff,
 
I would like to type a business plan for the group.   This plan will encorporate what the others discussed in their individual plans.  Also, I will try to address how we can sharpen the focus of the individual traders and narrow the scope of their trading.   I'm flying tomorrow and will do this on the plane.  My suggestion is we go over all of this thursday afternoon after the markets have closed.  Let me know if that time suits you.
