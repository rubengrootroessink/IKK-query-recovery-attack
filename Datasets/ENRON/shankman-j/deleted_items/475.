A bit early for a real swaps market, but interesting nonetheless.

Hi

You are probably aware of reports in the Nikkei regarding Morgan Stanley's formation of an electricity forward swaps market. I just got a call from a broker (Natsource) and apparently there are the following quotes in the market:

* Bid for Cal 2002 (1 year swap), day peak power (10-30MW) in the 50Hz region : 13Y/kWh
* Offer for Cal 2003, 2004 (1 year swap), day peak power (10-50MW) in the 50Hz, 60Hz region : 14Y/kWh

I told him I would get back to him with an answer next week (I will tell him we can't do it). Note that, if we wanted, we could do FY 2003 baseload power (16MW) for 6Y/kWh (Nippon Chemicon).
