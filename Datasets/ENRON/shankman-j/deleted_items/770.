Mike and Jeff,

As of last Wednesday, I didn't think I would have enough information to share to warrant a meeting; however, today, I think I have enough questions for the B.U. heads and possibly enough answers to warrant the meeting.

I have contacted most by phone tonight and have left messages for others.  I think most of the direct reports will be prepared to attend and discuss the questions I have.

If Cathy will arrange for us to have the meeting, I would appreciate it.

Shanna
