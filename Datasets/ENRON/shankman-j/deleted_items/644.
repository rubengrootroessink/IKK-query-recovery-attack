Beginning with the purchase of a single piece of Doulton Lambeth stoneware, Los Angeles collectors Allen Harriman and Edward Judd, amassed over a 10 year period what was probably one of the largest and most important collections of British Art pottery in public or private hands. Harriman and Judd built their collection during the 1970s and early 1980s, a period when the art works of the late 19th century were undergoing a critical reassessment.  The Harriman Judd Collection is the most important collection of its type ever to be offered at auction, and the present online sale offers opportunities for the collector that may never be seen again.   Selected works will be on exhibit at Sotheby's New York, November 24-29.   Visit the sale now; bidding ends on December 5.
