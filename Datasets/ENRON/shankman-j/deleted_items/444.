Jeff:  This is the girl I originally mentioned to you on Monday.  Her name is Wendy Forman and she is a nice Jewish girl from Atlanta originally, and now lives in NYC and Palm Beach.  She is like 31 years old and a great gal.  I attach a photo that was taken of us in NYC at Adam Dell's apartment.  Let me know what you think?  Her numbers are:
Cell: 917 363-4321
