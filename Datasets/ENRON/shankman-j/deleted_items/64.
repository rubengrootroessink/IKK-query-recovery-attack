I had a conversation yesterday with Paul Burgener, Corp Risk Mgr, at DTE in Detroit. He told me that cash transactions with Enron are "business as usual" but that all term trades now receive increased scrutiny and                                                    are to be avoided, particularly if a reasonable substitute exists.Though he did not go so far as to say we were cut off, it's clear to Paul's group that term trades with Enron are not career enhancers.
