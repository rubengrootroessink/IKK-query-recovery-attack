Mr. Shankman, I (Lydia Delgado) will be the one handling the Interview for Mr. Mark Lake. Due to some of the Interviews being out of the office, I wanted to let you know that we are setting up the Interview for sometime later next week. If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call at x 3-9338.



Thank You,

Lydia Delgado
