Mary and Sam,

The attached schedule details the funds of $124.7 million to be received today from Brokerage accounts.
$85 million is being received from our funds and $40 million from other entities.  Everyone was very cooperative in getting this done this morning.
Wiring instructions have been send to the Brokers for the full $124.7 million.

We have added the Wiring instructions and exact amounts to the schedule.
