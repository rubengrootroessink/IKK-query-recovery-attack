An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully.  From
morning 'til night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about
something.  The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing
with his old mule.  He plowed a lot.

One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field.
He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat
his lunch.  Immediately, however, his wife began haranguing him again.
Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.  All of a sudden, the
old mule lashed out with both hind legs and caught her smack in the back of
the head, killing her dead on the spot.

At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather
odd.  When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen
for a minute then nod his head in agreement; but when a man approached him,
he would listen for a minute then shake his head in disagreement.  This was
so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.

So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him
why he nodded his head and agreed with the women but always shook his head
and disagreed with the men.

The old farmer said, "Well, the women would come up and say something about
what a wonderful person my wife was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."

"And what about the men?" the minister asked.

"They all wanted to know if my mule was for sale."
