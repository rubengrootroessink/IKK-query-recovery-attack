Jeff,

Tony Galt, of the LNG group, gave two weeks notice last week.  His last day will be October 31st.  Tony functions as the LNG group's marine superintendent, reporting to Tim Nash under Jonathan Whitehead.  It appears that Tim Nash will be picking up these functions for at least the remainder of the year.  Let me know if you would like any further information.  

Dave
