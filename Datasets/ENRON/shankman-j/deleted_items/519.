I really don't think this is the direction I want to head in,
but (as always) thanks for the support. I'm looking for a treasury/
risk control position, and I'm speaking with a number of regional
power cos. and consulting orgs. Do you know the people at The New
Power Company in CT?

Hi Ronney,  I just spoke to Joe, and the only thing he is looking to add in
NY is a more junior person to cover the hedge funds.  If you are interested
in that, he'd love to talk to you.

I'm not sure how much help that is.

 Have a great weekend.

Jeff
