I just received a call from the Venezuelan Ambassador.  He said he did everything he could to squeeze in some time with Chavez next week, but that Chavez's revised itinerary (he's leaving a day earlier and arriving half a day later than originally scheduled) has resulted in the ambassador's being asked to take a few things off the schedule to loosen things up, and he can't accommodate our request. He was apologetic and offered to assist us in trying to make arrangements for a Caracas meeting.  Sorry this didn't work.  Let me know if you guys would like me to pursue this further on the London end.

Jim

Jim,

I will make my self available for a meeting if it can really happen.  This is very difficult for me do pull off but I'll be there if he can meet.  I am very skeptical that he would have a meeting to tell us that our project is dead or let us vent our frustration of wasting several years and $15 million putting together this project.

I'll be traveling for the rest of the week, please leave me a voicemail with any updates.

Thanks,
m

Eric:

Clay Harris and I met with the Venezuelan Ambassador this afternoon and reiterated our interest in arranging a meeting for Enron with President Chavez, who will visit the UK during 21-24 October.  The ambassador responded initially that Chavez's schedule had been "set for months" and that changing the schedule would be difficult.  After further discussion, he said Chavez would certainly be interested in discussing the project, and that they might be able to make time on the schedule at about 1100 hours on Tuesday 23 Oct.  We provided a brief overview of the status of the project, and he asked that we provide as soon as possible names and bio information for whoever would meet with Chavez if this comes off.  He promised to get back to us as quick as he can.  Please let us know who will be available from Houston for a possible Tuesday morning meeting here.  Thanks.

Jim
