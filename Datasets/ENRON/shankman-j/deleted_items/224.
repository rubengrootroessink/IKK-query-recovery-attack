Jeff,
 
Per our conversation earlier this month I discussed with Vince Kaminski the possibility of getting a quant. guy on permanent loan to our group to help manage the more complex analyses I want our guys to be doing.
 
Vince is amenable to letting us have one of his managers.  However, because is group is stretched thin and he wants to keep his headcount flat, he would want to hire a replacement and charge the manager we get to us.
 
I would also want to hire an analyst to help this quant. guy with general research ideas and data gathering.
 
Is this acceptable to you?
 
Jeff
