Jeff,

I am trying to project the next month with NIC (and announcements, etc) and want to determine what would provide the greatest impact for us.  We will be discussing the budget tomorrow and I'd like to also determine when we can review our draft MOU with you and Mike.  We plan to show this to NIC by Thursday of this week.  Still plan on being over the week after next.

Joe

trading:  I'd like to set up a time to speak with you about this.  I also interviewed Brad McKay and Gregg Cooper.  I have asked HR to make sure that these guys come and speak with you as well (this week).

Hi Joe,

I would like to get over to Tokyo by year's end, and would like to know when it would be optimal for me to come.  

Also, I talked to Geoff Storey yesterday.  I think he has made contact with you, as well.  He is interested in the risk management postion in Tokyo, and he would be a great candidate for the job.  He lived in Tokyo and liked it.  

Let's set up a time to talk about him and figure out exactly what we could do.

Jeff
