Jeff:

Margaret Skidmore has already floated the idea by shell and will make a
pitch on the 29th.  we will have to see what comes of it.  Everyone loves
the desk - it is just trying to come up with the money.  I will keep trying
to reach the Zilkhas before I leave in the morning or if not then I will
talk with them when I get back.  Keep thinking good thoughts!

Happy Thanksgiving,

cindi

ps - I am having the Bel Geddes cocktail service sent down on approval for
our december meeting.
