Dear Jeff,

Thank you for getting back to me. I have been following what has been going
on at Enron. When you can schedule a phone call in your spare time I would
appreciate it. Have a good Thanksgiving Holiday.

Regards,

Darren Wolfe

Hi Darren,

I am sorry it has taken me so long to reconnect with you, but as you
know, it has been very difficult these days at Enron.  It would be best
if we could schedule a phone call some time during the first half of
December.  At that time, I should have some time to help you.  Hang in
there.

Best,

Jeff
