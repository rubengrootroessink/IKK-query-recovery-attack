We need to get this resolved - it's now getting stupid.

David/Heidi and presume Quilkey are really freaking over here regarding short term capital allocation and liabilities they take on signing off coal deals. Obviously difficult to get a real feel for things in this part of the world but John Suttle has been telling David/Heidi that there is little chance of us getting any allocation for this deal. Heidi is resigning as a Director of ECAP and hence we have noone to sign off on deals this end. We are looking at changing Bengalla deal to ECS if possible - if not one of us down here will have to be given necessary authority to sign off on this deal if we finally go ahead. How do we actually find out what the "f " is going on?? 

Cheers
