Dear Executive Committee Members,

At our first meeting of the year, which was very productive (and therefore
too long), we neglected to ask your preference for a meeting day, time and
place.

Last year the committee met on Wednesdays at Noon in the English Room at the
Bayou Club and that seemed to work very well for the members. How does that
sound to you?

We pre-ordered lunches to save time and billed members for their lunches at
the end of the year. Our next meeting is presently scheduled for OCTOBER 10
and below is a list of the other dates for the year. Please let us know if
this schedule works for you and if meeting at Noon works for you as well.

Thanks.

Marti
