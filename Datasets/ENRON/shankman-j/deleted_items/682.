Dear Jeffrey,
Lisa thought that you could answer some of my questions dealing with power and gas trading. I have traded equities for the last three years and I worked at a small investment commercial real-estate firm before I traded. I am trying to position myself at an energy company that produces, trades, and sells. I understand that I need to learn the industry from the bottom-up. I am looking at positions of Risk Analyst and Merchant Energy Trader. Do you have any suggestions for me.
 
Sincerely,
Darren Wolfe
