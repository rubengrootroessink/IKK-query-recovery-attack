At present we have we do not use them and have put a hold on anyone using them.

We talked to them but they refused to sign a non solicitation clause. 

Their principle in the Houston office is a guy called Lyndon Taylor - former Enron employee.

He called me today and has agreed to sign our non-solicitation clause - I think this is the preferrable strategy as Lyndon is well connected as a former Enron employee and this will take them out for 12 months. 

Given that he is prepared to sign up to this now means he may have not had any success in calling in.

Neil
