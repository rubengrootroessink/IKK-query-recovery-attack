Bubbee,

How's it going?  Definitely, next time I'm in NY, I'll let you take me to dinner--at least drinks.  By the way, I don't know if you know that I'm currently offerring a car to anyone who finds me a wife.  Keep it in mind.

Anyway,  I paid $10,900 plus tax, total $11799.25.  For you $6,000.  There are no more available, only 1912 were made in total.  (divided between white, yellow and rose gold.)  1912 was when the model came out, and this was a reissue.  I have all papers, and box.

Find me a girlfriend, please.

Jeff
