Dear Enron Top Management:

Do you know how serious situation of Enron Japan's business is?

We can't see any improvement of Joe Hirl's management.

Furthermore, due to overseas staff's big attitude and ignorance of Japanese
business manner, we found that not only Japanese companies but also Amrican
investment banks would not like to do business with Enron. Specially after
Enron Japan announced to trade at "TOCOM", a market controlled by Japanese
"Boryokudan" (Mafia), Enron's image become worse and worse in Japan.

Just wonder when this "Tatanic" will sink?

Regards
Sato
