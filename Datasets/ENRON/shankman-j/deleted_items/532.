Dear Friends:

    With the official launch of Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition (KAPT)
only weeks away, the program is buzzing with new developments and
initiatives.  I write to update you - and ask for your help in spreading the
word in time for our October 15 launch.

New Website:  Today, we are launching KAPT's new website:  www.getKAPT.com.
Check it out to learn more details about how the program will work and about
the options for your children and grandchildren.  Within a few weeks, the
website will contain detailed price information for our Value, Standard and
Premium plans.

October 15 Launch Event:  On the morning of Monday, October 15, we will be
launching KAPT at a news conference at the State Capitol in Frankfort.  The
conference will feature the first 100 Kentucky children to be signed up for
KAPT.  We want to invite you and your children or grandchildren to join us
for the ceremony.  Not only will they be among the first to be signed up for
this program, but also they will get a tour of the Capitol, and be able to
keep a commemorative T-shirt and graduation cap.  If you are interested in
joining us, please e-mail us at rebeccac.comley@mail.state.ky.us or call
888-919-KAPT.

KAPT Foundation:  As pre-paid tuition programs in other states have
demonstrated, KAPT's affordable monthly payment plans will open up college to
thousands of new lower to middle class Kentuckians.  Still, there are
children KAPT cannot reach - from those families who have no savings to put
aside.  That's why we are establishing the KAPT Foundation to fund pre-paid
tuition scholarships for these Kentucky youth.  The foundation will be funded
entirely by private contributions.  For more information on the foundation,
or to contribute to the program, check out www.getKAPT.com.

KAPT Logo:  As part of our extensive grassroots marketing campaign, we are
asking Kentucky businesses and organizations to prominently display the new
KAPT logo - on their internal communications, their promotional materials and
their places of business.  Please join us in our efforts.  The logo - which
directs viewers to our website and toll-free number - can be downloaded at
www.getKAPT.com.

House Parties:  Our grassroots marketing effort will also involve hundreds of
small house parties across the state, during which I or a KAPT representative
will make a presentation  about the program and answer questions of those in
attendance.  If you are interested in hosting 10-20 couples in your home
sometime at your convenience this fall, please e-mail us at
rebeccac.comley@mail.state.ky.us, or call us at 888-919-KAPT.

Payroll Deduction:  Dozens of private companies have agreed to join state
government in offering a KAPT payroll deduction to their employees.  Payroll
deduction is an excellent way - at little or no cost to the employer - to
reward your employees by making it easier to afford a college education for
their children or grandchildren.  To obtain our new KAPT Payroll Kit, which
provides signup forms and materials to distribute to employees about the
program, check out www.getKAPT.com.

Kentucky KAPTains:  I am so excited by the number of Kentucky citizens across
the state who have volunteered to be Kentucky KAPTains: individuals who will
help spread word of KAPT to their communities through visits to school and
civic groups and the distribution of brochures and posters.  We need more
KAPTains to join us, so if you or someone you know might be interested,
please signup on our e-mail list at www.getKAPT.com or call us at
888-919-KAPT.

    We will continue to update you on the program's progress before our
October 15 launch.  Until then, I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer.

Best wishes,


Jonathan Miller
State Treasurer
