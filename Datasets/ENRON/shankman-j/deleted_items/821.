Mike,

I spoke with Joe last night to ensure I understood his personal intentions are for repatriation, and we also talked about the office.

He told me that he has sent out inquiry letters to 4 potential buyers and that he will have a better idea by 12/10 whether anyone is interested.  Joe said that he or Jeremy will continue to provide daily updates.  Until then, Joe has said with the exception of himself and one other expat, there are no reductions scheduled for Japan until we know more about the potential for sale.

Joe said this is what he is operating under for now because he understands he has the authority to explore potential buyers.  If that authority should change, he is prepared to move to immediate shutdown which would take about 3 months.
