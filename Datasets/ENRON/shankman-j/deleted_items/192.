Jeff,
I thought I'd be travelling this entire week, but it turns out I will be in the Houston office Friday morning until 11am. 
Can we get together for 15-30 minutes sometime between 7-11am to discuss several  Wharton matters?
If you're unavailable then, I'll leave you a voice mail instead.
Thks-- Christie
Ps: when are you meeting with the dean?
