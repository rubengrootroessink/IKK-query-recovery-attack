Oh my god...I think I asked someone about you just last week. How weird is  
that? Are you still in Houston??!! If so, did you survive the flood?  
Yes, we're in Tampa--we are three now, including Saul(10 months). Actually, I  
was in touch with Stefanie in the last year or so b/c her dad was my doctor.  
I've always wondered how Sarah is doing. I heard she's living in San  
Francisco and that she got married recently. Is that true? If you have her  
e-mail, I'd love to be in touch with her. 
What is Enron & what do you do there? By the way, what ever happened to Lisa  
Schiffman?  
I still work for Hillel(going on 10 years!). I do fundraising in  
Sarasota($$$)and work with a few campuses across Florida that need jumpstarts  
for their Hillel/Jewish student groups. Brian has a job with a small(250  
family) congregation here. We'll be here for at least 5 more years, through  
his next contract. We built a great house which I never want to leave. Saul  
is lots of fun! 
It's really great to hear from you. Please fill me in on the past several  
years of your life. 
Best, 
Mimi
