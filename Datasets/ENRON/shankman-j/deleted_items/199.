Jeff,

Thanks for the e-mail today.  I wanted to let you know that I visited with Russell Dyk quite some time ago regarding his impressions of moving to New York in a mid-marketing role.  Just to let you know, I just moved into a financial crude trading position (approx. two months ago) working with Rich Slovenski after John Chismar transferred to London.  We are focusing on increasing the physical crude side of the business, which will present some very interesting opportunities for this group (both on the paper and physical side). Also, I am still focusing on the propane market for EnronOnline.  

Given that I've only been in this position for a few months, I would like to continue to pursue trading crude in the short-term if possible.  I don't know how that fits into the bigger picture with the Global Liquids group's objectives.  I understand the NY market is a very large market with many mid-marketing opportunities w/ the funds, and I know that Chris Mahoney was looking for someone in the London group as well in Mid-marketing. Overall, it sounds like there are quite a few interesting opportunities in the Liquid's group moving forward.

I usually stay up late watching the market.  If you'd like to give me a call, feel free to call me either at 65.737.9269 (h) or 65.9752.0196 (c).  I look forward to visiting with you soon.

Take Care,

Pat

Hi Pat,  

I understand you've been talking to our guys in NYC about marketing to the funds.  We need a strong person to do this, and I want to know what your thoughts are now, about this opportunity.

Jeff
