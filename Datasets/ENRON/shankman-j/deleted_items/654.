Subject:	Employees w/Gas Experience

The HR Rep for EES, Gas Origination has indicated to me that Don Black is looking for people with experience in the areas of Gas Trading, Logistics and Storage.

If you have any employees in your area who may have this type of experience, please have them contact Amy Fitzpatrick at ext.52729.

Thanks,
Shanna
