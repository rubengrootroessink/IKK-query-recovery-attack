Jeff:  I spoke with Natalie and she is looking forward to hearing from you.  I told her that you have been swamped and would call her soon.  I will bet my bonus you will be happy you called.  Take care and lets try and play some golf soon.

Jeff:  This is the girl I originally mentioned to you on Monday.  Her name is Wendy Forman and she is a nice Jewish girl from Atlanta originally, and now lives in NYC and Palm Beach.  She is like 31 years old and a great gal.  I attach a photo that was taken of us in NYC at Adam Dell's apartment.  Let me know what you think?  Her numbers are:
