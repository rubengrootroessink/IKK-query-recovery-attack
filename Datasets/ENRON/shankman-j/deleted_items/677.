Unfortunately, you cannot expense weapons.  If you could, I suspect everyone would have already.

Jeff

if I do, in fact, go back into corporate housing for some period of time , what is the maximum I can spend on a 9mm handgun?? ....does Enron have a corp policy addressing this like it does for airline tickets, travel expenses, etc???

(also,  can the corp card be used for automatic weapons???)

thanks, 

Rob
