Although the loss we have all recently experienced, and the loss of our
naive
sense of permanent security here in the U.S.A. effects each of us uniquely I

thought this "tail" is a nice way to think of all of the lost innocent
lives.
It's also good to share w/little kids.

P.S. Personally, I'm going through the motions of "getting on with
day-to-day
life", but I'm perpetually tired and sad. It is hard to be joyful--or find
joy
in much of anything!

For those of you that do not know what the "Rainbow Bridge" is, it is the
place where our beloved pets go when they leave this world.  Here they
wait, until that day when we once again can take them into our arms and
shower them with all our love!


Welcome At Rainbow Bridge
On the morning of September 11, 2001,
there was an unprecedented amount
of activity at the Rainbow Bridge.
Decisions had to be made.
They had to be made quickly.
And, they were.
An issue,not often addressed here,
is the fact that many residents really
have no loved one for whom to wait.
Think of the pups who lived and died
in hideous puppy mills.
No one on earth loved or protected them.
What about the many who spent
unhappy lives tied in backyards?
And, the ones who were abused.
Who are they to wait for?
We don't talk about that much up here.
We share our loved ones as
they arrive, happy to do so.
But we all know
there is nothing like having your
very own person who thinks you are
the most special pup in the Heavens.
Last Tuesday morning, 9-11-2001
a request rang out
for pups not waiting for specific persons
to volunteer for special assignment
An eager,curious crowd
surged excitedly forward,
each pup wondering
what the assignment would be.
They were told by a solemn voice
that unexpectedly,all at once,
over 4,000 loving people had left Earth
long before they were ready.
All the pups,as all pups do,felt
the humans' pain deep
in their own hearts.
Without hearing more,
there was a clamoring among them
"May I have one to comfort?"
"I'll take two,I have a big heart."
"I have been saving kisses forever."
One after another they came forward
begging for assignment.
One cozy-looking fluffy pup
hesitantly asked,
"Are there any children coming?
I would be very comforting
for a child 'cause
I'm soft and squishy
and I always wanted to be hugged."
A group of Dalmatians came forward
asking to meet the Firemen
and be their friends.
The larger working breeds offered to
greet the Police Officers
and make them feel at home.
Little dogs volunteered to do
what they do best, cuddle and kiss.
Dogs who on Earth
had never had a kind word
or a pat on the head,
stepped forward and said,
"I will love any human who needs love."
Then all the dogs,
wherever on Earth
they originally came from,
rushed to the Rainbow Bridge
and stood waiting,
overflowing with love to share
each tail wagging an American Flag.
