I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a ribbed off
white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing your house
( I hear it's empty).
If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can meet
you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that I can
stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.  Fabric can
be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
I think 2 day is plenty of time.

50% now - (not including taxes)
50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery (6-8
wks.).

Need now
$5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
I will give you a receipt.
Let me know when you can see the fabric........
Tina

Good.  I'm going to Cabo thursday and will be back early sunday.  If you
have a few samples, I'll pick one, and well go forward.  Can we order the 3
sofas, and send them the fabric when it comes so we can get in the line of
orders?  No problem on the check.

What do you think of them?  Be brutal.

Jeff

   Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
   Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
   I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one you
   need
   at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture
   stores
   only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if
   they
   are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday during
   lunch
   and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to order
   the
   fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.  Also,
   I'll
   find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then
   the
   other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.  Checks
   payable to me and I pay with my company check.
   I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
   Sound good?

   Holy cow this is expensive.  Of course I don't care about your 5% or so,
   but what is the retail on these babies?  I'm pretty flexible on the
   fabric--mid range would be fine.  Let's move ahead.  (2 loveseats
   though,
   not 1)  How long did they say?

      OK...
      Sofa = $4290
      Loveseat = $3300
      8.25% tax = $626.18.
      Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

      You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a
   30-35%
      discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go
   to
      the
      Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.
   I
      have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll
   get
      a
      range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and
      expensive
      type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.
      Thanks, Tina

      Hi Tina,

      Thanks for you help.

      The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly
   there.
      The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

      If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that
      says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

      I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain
      off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor
   fabric.

      Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

      Regards,

      Jeff
