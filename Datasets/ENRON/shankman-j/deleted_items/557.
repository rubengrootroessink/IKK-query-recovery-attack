I put in a call to Mark Kennedy. I think I know how this will work, but I
want to talk to Mark to make sure everything is clear. I will let you know
as soon as I talk with him.  I do think two checks will be better if that is
no problem

On another matter, please don't forget we want your photograph and a few
paragraphs about your experience and why you established the funds. We want
to publish this in the bulletin.

Glad I got to meet you and I think everyone really enjoyed Larry's
anniversary.  Afterwards,  I heard another retiring doctor ask Rabbi Rapport
if he could study for his bar mitzvah.

Best regards,

Hi Phil, It was nice meeting you at Larry's bar mitzvah anniversary at
the Temple a few weeks ago.  I was hoping you could help me with one
more thing.  I've spoken with Mr Kennedy (I think) from bank of
Lousiville, and I was a little confused after I hung up the phone.  As
you know the 2 gifts of $50,000 each are for separate awards, etc.  Does
Bank of Louisville know this? Or is it kept track of differently through
the Temple.  I ask because when I told him both "scholarships" or funds
were open to future additions via donations to them from whomever, he
wasn't sure what I was talking about.  Should I make out 2 checks for
$50k each payable to the Temple of Bank of Louisville?  Or 1 check for
the total?  Any help would be appreciated as I'm anxious to get these
open for future contributions.

Best regards,

Jeff
