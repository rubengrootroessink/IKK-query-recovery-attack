Jeff:

I was a sincere pleasure speaking to you today and I hope that I can help you find some good people.

As we discussed, please find attached a very good options trader that would consider a move to Houston.  He is very sharp and could be a real asset to your group.

Please advise if you would like to schedule an interview. Note: He is only trading a VAR of $500-600K and could do a lot more.

Regards,
