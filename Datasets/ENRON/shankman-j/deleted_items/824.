Jeff,
I work with Jennifer Fraser and was asked to contact you with regards to a fuel oil call that we sold Hydro Quebec a while ago. I would like to find out whether or not we are in the notification period (I think we are) and what kind of paper work that needs to get done if we are.

Regards,

Richard Lassander
