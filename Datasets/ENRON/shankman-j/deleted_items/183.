Hi Mark,

We had our call with Dow today.  Needless to say Carlo Gaurino was very dissapointed in our moving forward.  Privately he mentioned to Nowlan that they are about to announce layoffs, and another crappy quarter.  

We will be putting a banner headline on EOL announcing these products in the next week.

Regards,

Jeff
