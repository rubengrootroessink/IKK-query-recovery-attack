Jeff,
  I've been in touch with fundy team members back in Houston and they keep me up to date on ENE/DYN issues. Obviously, information is very limited at this point but I was wondering what your gut feeling about the future of EGM as a whole as well as the fundy team in particular is. Also, to keep you updated, I will be returning to Houston on November 30, so I will be back in the Houston office on December 3. By the time I was suppose to return to London again we should have a better idea of where everything is going. Things in London have been great and I think people on this end have been pleased with the fundy team's contribution. I hope all is well.

Zac
