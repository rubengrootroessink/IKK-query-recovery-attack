Following on to conversation between you and Mike McConnell in the EGM Monday meetings last month, Rommel and I thought we would put some research together on the impact of the slumping economy on the freight sector.  No costs were accrued or will be charged back to you.  Understand that a lot of things are under review right now, but let me know if you want further research.

Cordially,
