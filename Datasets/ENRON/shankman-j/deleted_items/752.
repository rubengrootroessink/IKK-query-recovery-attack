Dear Jeff,

following my phonecall from some time ago, I was waiting for the promised
cheque for the Josef Schulz work you purchased at this years Art Chicago.
Until today, I did not get this cheque and I was wondering if something
went wrong or the cheque got lost in the mail.
Could you please be so kind and check this issue.

If there is any problem in sending a cheque in general, you can also wire
the money if you prefer to do so.
Here are the details of our account:

Bank: Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, Karlsruhe
Account: 4020464
BLZ (Bank registration number): 60050101
Account holder: Galerie Haus Schneider
SWIFT code: SOLADEST

Please excuse this email if you did  send the cheque in the meantime.
However, it would be very nice if you could drop me an answer by email anyhow.

With warmest regards,
Heinz-Martin Weigand
Galerie Haus Schneider
