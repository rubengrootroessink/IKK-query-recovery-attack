thanks for the note, as I did not know there was a meeting tonight.  I saw

Jeff-

Just a reminder that  Design of Our Time opened this weekend, and that we 
have a
DC program this evening starting at 6:30 p.m. (Drinks) and 7:00 (Remarks by
Cindi) in the Law building of the MFAH.  Hope you can make it.

JRG
