Jeff,

I apologize, because I realise that I had not introduced myself to you.  I 
work with John Ambler as Director for International Marketing and Public 
Relations.  The original release was drafted by Envera and since our PR 
department provides support for the Crude and Liquids Product group, as part 
of our PR responsibilities for EGM, it was sent to us to revise and run 
through the approval process.  The copy I sent to you is the revised version 
that we completed.  We now will send it through the Corp. PR approval 
process, which includes a review by Investor Relations.

Again, thank you for your kind cooperation.
Habiba

I'd like to leave out mention of our equity participation in the first and 
third paragraphs, and reword the second paragraph to state that envera's 
customers will have access to enron's products.  (leave out the qualifier 
"many"  which I read as "partial")

Attached for your review and approval is the press release that Envera wishes 
to issue immediately announcing the participation of Enron Global Markets as 
an equity partner and trading member.  We already have sent it to John Nowlan 
and John Viverito and secured their approval.  Please let me know your 
comments. 

Thank you.
Habiba
