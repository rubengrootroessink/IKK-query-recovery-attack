Hi Dave.  As a follow up to out conversation, I found out Robert Rauschenburg 
will be here April 5 or 6 and the weekend (April 7-8).  See how that looks on 
the calendar for y'all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland.  (I did go to 
the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots, and a cowboy hat 
my group gave me--pictures to follow)
Can you believe I went to the Rodeo?
