Dear Mr. Shankman,
I guess I stumped you with my resume.  Nevertheless, I still would like to 
hear your comments - positive or negative.  As mentioned, I am extremely 
interested in working  for Enron and would like to pursue that jop 
opportunity.  
Look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
Rina
