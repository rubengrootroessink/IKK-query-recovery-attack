Jeff,

Great to see you yesterday.  Hope your presentation went well and
congratulations again on your new position.

As promised, here's Adrienne's address:

Adriene and Neil Tuch
1453 Kings Lane

And here's Vicki's too, while I'm at it:

Vicki and Norm Petty

Also, Michael Baker will be calling you this week to talk more about the
Center for Advanced Studies in India; we'd love to have someone from
Enron involved.

Maybe we can catch up again when you are here later this month.   Best,
