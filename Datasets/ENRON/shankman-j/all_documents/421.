around.

Jeff,

Below is the agenda for the meeting with Wells Fargo. 

I was hoping that you could participate during the introduction periods -- 
i.e. 10:00 am to 10:40 am (or longer if you have any interest) - would it be 
possible for you to follow Wells Fargo's introduction with a brief (15-20min) 
presentation/introduction explaining Enron Corp's and Enron Global Market's 
structure and "strategic vision".
You will see that I have slotted you in this time frame -- obviously, this 
conditional on your acceptance.

Please let me know if you are willing to participate in this way.

Thanks again,
George
