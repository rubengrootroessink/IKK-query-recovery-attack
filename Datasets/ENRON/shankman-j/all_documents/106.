Dear Jeff,

Happy Valentines Day.  I was in New York this weekend for halley and
Michael's Valentines day brunch.  halley mentioned that she would try to
get in touch with you for me.  I received an email from her yesterday
suggesting that I call you in order to arrange a trip down to Houston to
meet some people at Enron.  However, I do not have your office number
and have not had much luck getting it off  the internet.  I am
requesting, if possible a reply containing a number at which you can be
reached.  I will call you and we can then work out plans for a visit.

Have a great day, Dan
