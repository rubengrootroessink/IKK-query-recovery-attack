Hi

Weekend was fun.  I went out dancing with the girls.  I went to a super bowl 
party.  But I only went for the food.  I'm not crazy about football.

How was the weekend?  Mine was good--I met Dennis Hopper, the actor.  He is 
one cool dude.  I'm thinking about taking a long weekend vacation.  Where 
sounds fun?
