Jeff, I enjoyed visiting with you last week.  Subsequent to our meeting, I
did speak at greater length with our physical and derivatives traders.
There are developments which  may well provide for our examining ways to
work together on OTC, risk management and clearing collectively.  How would
you like to proceed?
