Sorry for not responding earlier.  I'll give you a call tomorrow--I have no 
time for anything these days.  I'm off to tokyo sat for 5 days to meet with 
Tom Foley (former house speaker) and others.  Freak show on the business 
front.  How about you?  The wife?  does she have any sisters or friends?

hugs,  Jeff

You had wanted to send me the Rousseau hanger and Galle mushroom ceramic to 
sell here in the gallery.  Do you want to arrange a shipper to pack and send?
 
love, ben
