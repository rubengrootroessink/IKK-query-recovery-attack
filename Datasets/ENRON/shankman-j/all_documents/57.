Thanks for the info.  I will give him a call.  

Rottenburg has not called me recently.  After reflection, that seems wierd.  
He used to call me pretty often.  If you want someone to go to lunch with him 
and pump him for info, let me know.  He lives around the corner from me.  It 
wouldn't be obvious.  

Joe

Joe,  

Saar Banin's work number in the UK at Goldman is 0207 774 6181.  He had been 
in metals for them for some time, and just moved over to gas and power (in 
the UK)  He's an aggressive, smart guy who I've known for 10 years.  Top 
notch.

Hope all is well

Jeff

PS  has Doug Rottenburg been calling anyone over there?  We haven't heard a 
sound from him.....
