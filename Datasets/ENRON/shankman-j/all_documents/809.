Mr. Shankman,

I hope all is well with you. Currently I am a second year analyst faced with 
the dilemma of which career path to pursue.  Although there are several 
options, I'm primarily interested in developing a deeper understanding of 
Enron's market philosophy. Trading, risk management, and commodity 
structuring all sound interesting to me at this point, but I want to go into 
my next rotation with a clear sense of direction.

Brad Hitch, who I worked with over at Enron International, suggested I 
contact you to discuss your needs as well as new developments in your group.  
He thought you would be in an excellent position to assist me with my 
decision.

My resume' is attached for your consideration. As you will see, I have a 
significant amount of Investment Banking, and financial industry experience. 
I know how busy you must be during this time of year, but I would appreciate 
a few minutes of your time.

I shall call you during the week of November 14th to schedule a time for us 
to meet. In the meantime, if you need to contact me, my number is 
713-853-6818. Please leave a message if I'm not in, and I'll return your call 
the next day.

I look forward to  speaking with you.

Sincerely,

Damon Harvey
