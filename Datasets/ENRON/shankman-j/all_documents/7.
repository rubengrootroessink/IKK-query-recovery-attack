Dear Jeff,

Sorry I had to get  off the phone so abruptly.

I am glad to hear that you are still interested in the Butterfield for
Enron. It would be an amazing piece for the collection and a unique early
piece for $200,000.00 seems much more appealing than a recent bronze
multiple for $225,000.00. This is an amazing piece though I am afraid that
the email image is probably not very good.

The following are the details:
ARTIST: Deborah Butterfield
TITLE: Goldie
DATE: 1980
MEDIUM: wood, iron, steel, plastic, wire, etc.
SIZE: 77" x 101" x 41" (life size)

Just so you know, the Butterfield is in a crate in SF.


Yours truly,
Michael Rosenfeld
