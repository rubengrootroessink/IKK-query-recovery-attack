just had 2 refusals to trade due to crdit issues.
one from shell, which is a bit surprising since i thought we cleared this last week. but anyway, the guy's name is james blount and number for stasco is 0207 546 5755
the other is socgen and this is due to some limits on gas side that they r linking. the guy there is frederic naudan and his number is  33 1 42 13 03 91.
