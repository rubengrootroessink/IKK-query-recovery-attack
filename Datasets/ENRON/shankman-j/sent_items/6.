Sunday is better than Saturday for me. (The Poe Elementary School Carnival
is scheduled for Saturday, and then Jack and Jean are attending his
teacher's wedding that evening).

Give me a call, or I'll try you on Saturday to finalize.

   Jeff -

   If you'd like to get together to have a drink and talk about something
   other
   than work, give me a call.

   Jean's got a meeting at school tonight, but other than that we should be
   around all weekend.

   Work: 713.653.8207.
