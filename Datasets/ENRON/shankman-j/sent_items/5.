Hi Carole,

I won't be able to make it to NYC this week.  How could I put a reserve on it?  How would you feel about sending it to me on approval?  If not, what other ideas do you have?  Hope you had a great weekend....

Jeff

Dear Jeff,

We just received the new Kondo piece - and quite honestly, I think it is
even better than the one you saw at the gallery.  I am attaching two images
- the first of just the plaque, and the second with the frame.  The
gestures in this piece are more interesting than the first and the plaque
is about 1 inch larger (height and width).

Please know that our photography doesn't do this piece justice - it is
beautiful and the color is much more vibrant than it appears.

Please let me know your thoughts.  As is gallery policy, all offerings are
subject to prior sale.

Best,
Carole Hochman
Director
Barry Friedman Ltd.
