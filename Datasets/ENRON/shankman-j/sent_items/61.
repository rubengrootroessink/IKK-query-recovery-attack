Yes, I'll send the check tomorrow.  Send all the pictures you have.  How low is the bench?  The Mies chairs I was asking about are the very classic chairs shown everywhere.  The back and seat chrome legs intersect and form a curvy X.  (How's that for description?)

Hi Jeff,
We are bringing alot of new furniture to the shop tomorrow. I will send some
jpegs with an overall view and you can tell us if there is anything of
interest. Also, have you gotten your new checks yet? We could really use the
payment.
Thanks, Kim
