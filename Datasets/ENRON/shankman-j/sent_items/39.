Dear Jeff-
I have been in Atlanta for two weeks and am continuing to unpack and
assemble furniture. I thought of you last night as I came across the
wonderful surrealism book that you gave me; what a great book. Of
course, I had to stop my unpacking to read through parts of it. I did
not get much unapcking done, but I had fun.
I reconnected with Christina Johns, one of my roomates at Penn with
Dori and she passed along Dori's email address. I sent her an email
and she responded, and appears to be happy in Philly with her 18
month old daughter. I told her that we had seen each other in NYC
during the past years and gave her an update on your successes and
accomplishments.
I hope that work is going well. I have to return to an orientation
session. My new phone number (404)248-2290 and address 757 Houston
Mill Rd. NE, Apt. 8 Atlanta, GA. 30329-4240. Does Enron have an
office in Atlanta?
Best,
andi
