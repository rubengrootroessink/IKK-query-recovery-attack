Mr. Shankman:

My name is Robert Brown and I am a fellow alumnus of the Wharton School.  I
noticed that you provided your name on the Penn Career Network as a mentor
for other alumni.  I have just returned from a sabbatical and am currently
seeking to enter the energy industry in Houston now that I have returned
stateside.  As a person who has achieved a prominent position in the
industry in which I am interested, I thought you might be able to help me in
my endeavors with some advice.

Would it be possible for me to contact you at a convenient time, so that I
might be able to ask you a few questions?  Please feel free to call me on my
cell phone at 832.541.5805 or you can also reach me through e-mail by
responding to this e-mail.  Thank you for making yourself available to other
alumni like myself.  I look forward to speaking to you.

Regards,

Robert L. Brown
W'97
