David,

I run a $650 million dollar commodities fund at Harvard Management Company.
Our focus has been on arbitrage strategies in the commodity arena - we are
looking to expand into weather and power. I was wondering, if given the
potential situation at Enron, that there might be employees interested in
interviewing for several positions both within my group and foreign equities
? I apologize if this is too forward or that I have assumed too much in
terms of potential restructurings.

Thanks,

Stuart D. Porter
