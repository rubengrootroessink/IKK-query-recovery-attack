Thanks for the note.  You have no idea how awful this is.  I hope no one I know (like) ever has to go through this.

I'm thinking about making the dragofly table a gift to the MFA, Houston, where is was just exhibited for 2 months in the Defining Modern show.  What would  you appraise the value as?  (Approximately, and of course I know it's not anything close to a fomal apprasail?)  Also, I've had 2 people approach me about selling it outright.  Any ideas?

Hugs.

Jeff
