Sorry I didn't respond sooner, I was out almost all day. I hope dinner with
Saar was fun, he never changes. We should definitely get together when you
come to NYC. My tel # is 212.732.2277.
Cell # is 1.917.806.0571. Speak to you soon, and by the way I hear that you
are the King....Enron up 8% today.

You are the king.  I'm in London this week, and am having dinner with Saar
tonight.  He also mentioned you got engaged--congrats!  I'll be in the
office in houston next week, and am coming to NY the week of April
8---let's have dinner.  What's a phone number to reach you?
