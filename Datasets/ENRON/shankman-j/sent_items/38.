Jeff,

Hi there......sounds like Penny has been equally emphatic on both sides
about meeting...

So sorry not to have responded earlier ...it has been such a completely
psychotic week for me. I have been in London and Stockholm this week - I
don't think I slept more than 3 hours a night all week. I am on my way
tomorrow to India (Bombay and Bangalore)...London on Thursday...and back to
New York on Thursday night or Friday morning. Friday and Saturday (April 13
& 14) are fairly free for me - would Friday night work for you?

It will be difficult for me to reach you from India- given schedule and time
difference, but I will be accessing email. I can be reached on a mobile
number in Europe on today and on Thursday - ++44 7990 973 620. As of Friday
- in New York, the best place to reach me is on - 1 917 862 6552. By the
way, how is the Peninsula post-renovations? I liked it before the
renovations - am sure its even more wonderful.

Elizabeth

Hi Elizabeth,

I'm Penny and Sam Britell's friend (Sam's from college) who have
mentioned (truthfully, insisted) that we should get together for a drink
next time I'm in NYC.
I'll be in new york sunday the 7th through the 14th and would love to
get together for that drink Penny and Sam keep telling me about.
Fortunately I have a pretty open schedule next week, so if you have any
time, I'd like to meet you.

I'll be staying at the Penninsula next week, or feel free to call me on
my cell phone at 713 854 4952.  As well, I'll be checking voicemail in
the office (713) 853 1761.

I'll be out of the office the next two days, but leave a message if you
have time.

Regards,

Jeff
