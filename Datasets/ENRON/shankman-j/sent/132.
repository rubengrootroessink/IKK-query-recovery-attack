Jeff,

We are reviewing the P+ spread option book.    One item of note is that the 
correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from 
what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that 
John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact 
he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not 
allow it, so he was using 0.999.

We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If 
you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just 
let me know what time would be convenient.
