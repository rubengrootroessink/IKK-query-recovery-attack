First--Ted your voicemail isn't working.

I would like to get active in recruiting products traders, in a real attempt 
to high grade the group.  Can we, and how do we make a full court press with 
the headhunters out there?  Also, what do you guys think of putting a big ad 
in the Chronicle, and the WSJ?  We could also look for originators and 
marketers.  

Thanks.  Jeff
