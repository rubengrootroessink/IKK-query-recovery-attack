I need to add some depth to the group. I would like to bring this  person in 
for an interview. I think he would be very helpful in developing models and 
structures.
Thanks

Dear Ms. Fraser,

I am writing after having heard from a contact at Enron that you are seeking 
a number of people to fill various vacancies at your Houston office.  If this 
is the case I would very much like to be considered for one of these 
vacancies.

As you will notice from the attached Curriculum Vitae I am currently employed 
as an Energy Markets Consultant at Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh, the energy 
consultancy arm of Deutsche Bank.  My prior work experience includes two 
years as a Gas Markets Analyst for a Management Consultancy firm in London, 
time as an Energy Journalist covering the European gas and electricity 
markets and a year long spell as an academic Research Assistant.

Prior to these positions I read for an MSc in Energy Studies at the Centre 
for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy at the University of Dundee, 
Scotland.  Whilst reading for the MSc I elected to specialise in oil and gas 
industry economics and law.

Before undertaking the MSc I read for a B.A. (Hons) Business Administration 
degree.  This allowed me to build, develop and hone to a high standard the 
essential skills of financial, strategic, business and economic analysis.  
Having majored in Management Accountancy I am well versed in undertaking 
analysis tasks of this type at both a micro and macro level, from both a 
qualitative and quantitative approach.

Given the opportunity, I feel confident I could make an immediately tangible 
contribution to the work of Enron.  I have attached my CV in Word 97 format.  
If this is incompatible with your systems please do not hesitate to contact 
me and I will send it in a different format.

I apologise in advance for this unsolicited approach.  If you feel that there 
is a likelihood that my skills and background could potentially be of 
interest to Enron I look forward hopefully to hearing from you in due course.

Yours faithfully,

Andrew Hill B.A. (Hons) MSc  M. Inst. Pet.
