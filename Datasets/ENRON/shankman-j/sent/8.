Thanks for the update.  What you point out in your email is exactly what we 
need to be doing.  Also, I'll be happy to meet with you regarding rotations 
when you are ready.  

Jeff

I am pleased that Jason Fischer is doing a fine job as he took my place in 
the role of checking out NYMEX trades and formulating new
relationships with brokers.

One of the key aspects of this job was moving trades to brokerage houses with 
credit financing available at no cost.  Basically,
the brokerage houses want to capture the brokerage fees, in volume, and 
believe that they are able to not worry about charging
for the credit lines.

I'd like to meet you with about this.  An contact of mine in accounting and I 
developed a spreadsheet (see attached: Xpit analysis) to measure
how much we are able to save by these movements.  Also, according to the 
accomplishments list, you'll notice that because of our actions on Fri Oct
13 directed by John Wilson in Products, only for CL, HO, and HU, we were able 
to see an instantaneous change from paying out millions each day to 
the numerous brokers to having millions of dollars wired to us by the brokers.

One of the critical functions of my former job was to manage the positions of 
all futures and options
for all commodities.  From my experience in working closely with the traders, 
we discovered, especially on
Friday, October 13, that moving positions to brokerage houses with credit 
financing dramatically 
reduced our margin expenses thus increasing our daily cashflow in our wired 
brokerage 
accounts. 

Most of September and the week of Oct 9 had negative cashflows.

In addition, I worked with our global finance group, (Sarah Wesner) , to 
increase existing lines and open
other lines of credit at other brokerage houses.

This action, provided we monitor this vigilantly and remind the traders on a 
frequent basis to stay
focused on clearing trades with houses that have financing, will save Enron 
millions of dollars everyday.

Our treasury group, (Mary Perkins), is pleased with this type of financing 
approach as we
are using the additional money to reduce Enron's short term debt.
 
I have informed my former group (esp. Jason Fischer) of the tremendous value 
which my prior
function may add to Enron's financial well-being. 

It is this type of proactive thinking and creative financing that I hope to 
generate in my next rotations. Currently, I am in 
EnronCredit.com.

Furthermore, now that I am in the analyst program, I'd like to discuss with 
you in the late summer/early fall for rotation opportunities.

Thanks
David
