Subject: NEW EOL PRODUCTS

Jeff:

About a month ago, we asked EOL to create three new products for the 
financial petrochemical and plastics desk.  They are:

1.  propylene (polymer grade), 
2.  a polypropylene to propylene spread, and
3.  a polyethylene to ethylene spread.

We expect to have these rolled out this week.


Doug
