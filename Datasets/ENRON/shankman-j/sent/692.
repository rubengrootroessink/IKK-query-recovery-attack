Just talk to Hunter about the transition.  I'll call Steve Horn if you'd 
like.  Jeff

Subject: Rotation

Jeff,

HTC got back to me saying that they are interested in having me rotate to 
their group. They want me to schedule a brief meeting with Steve Horn to let 
him know that I will be the next Enron person over there. My only concern is 
that they would like me to get there a bit earlier than scheduled (probably 
around 15 to 30 days before). I am extremely interested in this rotation but  
hope that transferring early does not create any problems. Do you have any 
suggestions on how I might tackle this issue?

Thank you so much for everything

Massimo
