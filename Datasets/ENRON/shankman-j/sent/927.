Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 39/2000




Highlight
Had a meeting with Bocimar in our offices this week as they were interested 
in knowing our plans with ABC.  From meeting it became very clear that they 
were out of the running for ABC as they were unwilling to purchase that 
company without a significant discount to current market levels.  Few days 
later, met with CEO of ABC as he had just received a bid from a rival 
shipping company ( Zodiac ) and he was basically begging us to join the 
bidding as he really did not want his company  to fall in the hands of 
Zodiac.  Pierre and I continued to express our interest in ABC but told him 
that we needed more time to evaluate their assets and could not counter on 
such short notice.  Told ABC that we would continue to follow with interest 
and that if buy out by Zodiac failed, we would come back to discuss.  Our 
goal all along was to make sure that Bocimar were not going to get their 
hands on ABC or they would have effectively controlled 50 % of the spot cape 
fleet and made our short position into next year look worrisome.  Having 
shown interest we not only were kept well advised as to what Bocimar was up 
to but it could have reacted quickly to protect our position.  We are 
relatively pleased with the potential of Zodiac buying ABC. 

Also, this week we fixed another Coeclerici cape for period.  We fixed the 
cape Asia build in 1990 for minimum 4-6 months to allow us to use the vessel 
to load out of Australia for CLP in December and hedge ourselves against a 
late winter surge in cape rates but we have the added advantage of having an 
option for a further two years to be declared mid January 2001.  We bought 
ourselves a very cheap call option with an exercise date in three months time 
in a very volatile market.  Further, Coeclerici gave us a put in year two to 
cap our downside and gave us a call option to extend the deal into an 
additional third year .  We are currently discussing with Bocimar the idea of 
putting that cape into their pool if they secure us a floor for year one and 
a share in any upside.  Will keep you posted  !!!


Fixed a 6 panamax contract as vessel owner with National power from South 
Africa to Bristol with option Immingham to give us a very useful short 
position into next year in the panamax sector.  This deal will add to our 
already significant business in South Africa for next year and will allow us 
to arbitrage between cape and panamax vessels as we hold contracts in both 
sectors.  

Furthermore, Intercore has asked us to offer them 6 capes from Bolivar into 
ARA from next March till September which if we were to win the contract would 
make us a definite market maker in the two busiest coal routes ( RBCT/ARA and 
COLOMBIA/ARA ).  


Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Flat	Flat	Flat


Panamax : Market continues to fall for balance of the year as China/Asia was 
on holiday this week and fixings were relatively few 
Capes : Market is steady but few expect a fall in rates for balance of 2000.  
Owners and charterers waiting for coal trans to fix for next year.

Deals Done

Fixed 6 panamaxes from RBCT to UK ports for National Power for all of 2001 at 
around $10
Trying to sell 4 capes to Billiton from RBCT to Rotterdam and again  buying

OTC 
FFA s
No trades
      
EOL
No trades this week but EOL trader joining our group Thursday and new routes 
to be added shortly which should add liquidity and new players.

Miscellaneous
Our position as it stands now is short about 350,000 tons for balance of 2000 
mostly attributed to our November/December Colombia/LBT panamax short.  For 
cal 01 we are 6.2 million tons short and cal 02 1.7 million short and cal 03 
about 400,000 tons short.  These figures do not take into account our two 
Coeclerici cape deals as those have not been finalised with counterparty and 
have not been booked as of yet

Travels
Pierre is in Asia all week and I am in the office
