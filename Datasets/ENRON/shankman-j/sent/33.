I met with Carlo (as did several other Enron employees) last week and we are 
talking to them about a number of ideas.  One of which is detailed below 
(from them) and has technology and paper/lubmer points.  I believe Carlo from 
Dow will be calling you guys shortly.  Take a look at the attachment and 
you'll understand the points he's making that are relevant to your 
businesses.

Jeff, thanks for agreeing to make the introduction with Philip and Ray. I
have attached below a summary of Buildscape(Driving to Liquidity) as well a
high level PowerPoint presentation on Buildscape.

As you are aware, we have had introductory meetings with Rob Scheuer from
the Industrial markets, Brandon Wax, John Pavetto and Rahil Jafry. There is
interest in Buildscape from the group and Rahil has offered a sweat equity
option. Rob advised that he would come back to us in the shortly on his
thoughts around a strategic relationship.

We see the possibility of a broader strategic opportunity combining
technology functionality from the Networks Division, risk and credit
management tools available through your market making initiatives, as well
using the Buildscape providing an efficient channel to market for Enron
products and services in the Building industry and the home. In order for
this opportunity to receive senior management attention and to talk through
the possibilities, we will contact Philip Bibi and Ray Bowen shortly as per
your recommendation.

Could you confirm back that you have passed on the information so that we
don't surprise either of them on the topic and we will aim to arrange a
meeting with them in Houston in the next couple of weeks. We may call on
your help to sponsor the meeting if required.

In the meantime, we will press on with confirming the Dow/Enron April 27th
meeting in midland to pursue Chemicals and Plastics opportunities and we
would be very pleased if Mark Fievert can attend as well. If we need to move
the date slightly to accommodate Mark, then lets talk through the options.
Thanks.
