Subject: Analyst Meeting Review Session

Please plan on attending a meeting on Friday, January 12 at 1:30 p.m. in the 
Boardroom for a "dry-run" of the Analyst Meeting presentations.  This session 
is intended to review the content of each presentation, and also to insure a 
consistent message among all presentations and Enron attendees.  Please call 
Paula (x3-7209) or myself (x3-5981) if you have any questions.
