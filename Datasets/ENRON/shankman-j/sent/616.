Jeff-
 Please call Gary this afternoon when you have a chance.  He just called me 
this morning and I really think all he needs to hear is a little selling and 
to talk to you.

him.  Come up today when you get a minute....Jeff

Jeff,
 This weekend while I was at Penn I spent some time with Gary (he interned 
with us last summer) and found out that he has received an offer from JP 
Morgan for Trading.  It is a pretty good offer overall but I still think that 
Enron is a better opportunity and we just need to convince him of that.  I 
was hoping you could take a few minutes out to call him and talk to him about 
it.  I really thought we would be able to have him sign full-time but now 
this throws a little curveball into things.  His home number is 215-386-4251 
and his cell phone number is 215-432-5635.  This is a really bright, great 
guy that I think would end up becoming a major asset to Enron.  If there is 
anything I can do please let me know, but I'm sure hearing from you will make 
a difference.

Sarah
