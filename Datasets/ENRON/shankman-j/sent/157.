Where does our 50% (the 1.65 million dollars) show up?   Can you provide me

Great job gentlemen!  This deviation shows that Eco definitely has a 
significant amount of option value which can be exploited with quick 
reactions and favourable market movements.

Finally completed tonight

Net to Enron LNG Marketing Company - $ 272,000 ( $0.10/ mmbtu )
Net to Eco  about $3,300,000   ( Enron 50% share about $ 1,650,000 )

Enron total gain not counting  ENA's trading desk margin is $1,922,000 

Not bad for a single cargo.

Wayne
