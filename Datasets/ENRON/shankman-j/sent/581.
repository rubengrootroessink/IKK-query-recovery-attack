Jeff
To reconfirm our discussion Sunday:
RMB indicated to Talbot to find buyer for his business - short list to be 
presented to board on 15 Dec
RMB electricity book under water and may present opportunity to lever out 
Talbot's business as part of combined package
There is an immediate opportunity to finalise due diligence and avoid any 
"beauty competitions" for Talbot's business

Steps required:
CA to be presented to RMB on Tue (Aust time).  CA to contain period of 
exclusivity to conduct due diligence (see attached)
Enron to decide on due diligence team and be ready in Australia Thursday for 
commencement
SPV structure to be resolved 

Goal is to get an Memorandum of Understanding signed by 12 December should we 
chose to progress.

I will call your Monday to discuss.

Paul
