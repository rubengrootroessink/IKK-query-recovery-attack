Subject: MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE - You've Been Selected to Participate in an 
Interactive Panel

You have been selected to participate in an interactive panel at next week's 
Enron Management Conference.  The panel, which is scheduled to take place at 
10:30 a.m. on Friday, November 17, will be the last session of the conference 
and will last approximately an hour and fifteen minutes.

You don't have to do any significant preparation.  All I ask is that you 1.) 
review an article, 2.) give some thought to your experiences at Enron, and
3.) come willing to talk.  Peter Skarzynski, founder and CEO of Strategos, 
will moderate the panel.  With Gary Hamel as its chairman, Strategos is a 
leading innovation consulting company. Gary will be presenting at the 
conference on Thursday.  His presentation will revolve around his latest 
book, Leading the Revolution.  In it, Gary outlines ten rules for designing a 
culture that fosters innovation.  We will focus the panel discussion around 
seven of the ten rules:

Set Unreasonable Expectations
Stretch Your Business Definition
Design an Open Market for Ideas
Offer an Open Market for Capital
Open up the Market for Talent
Lower the Risks of Experimentation
Make Like a Cell - Divide and Divide

To familiarize yourself with these rules, I will be sending you a Fortune 
magazine article (June 12) that provides an overview.  (You'll notice that 
Enron is used as an example for several of the rules.)  During the course of 
discussion, you will be asked to talk about your own experiences with 
innovation within Enron.  In sharing examples of innovation, Peter will ask 
you to address the following questions:

How did you do it?  (Were one or more of the rules applied?)
What were the hurdles? 
Where did you stumble?
What, if anything, was surprising?

Outside of discussing specific examples of innovation, the discussion might 
also include conversation around how to maintain a focus on innovation while 
running the day to day business or how to spot a good idea.

You'll notice I referred to this as an interactive panel.  Another element to 
this panel will be audience participation.  At this year's conference, for 
the first time  we will be utilizing an electronic audience response system 
(ARS).  Through the ARS, presenters will be able to pose yes/no, true/false, 
or multiple choice questions to the audience.  During the course of the panel 
discussion, Peter will solicit feedback from the audience on certain topics.  
The audience will be able to respond to questions immediately by simply 
pressing a button on an electronic keypad.  Responses will be instantaneously 
recorded and graphically displayed on the screen.

I want your participation in this panel to be as easy and painless as 
possible.  I will not be scheduling any meetings to discuss this further.  I 
will merely ask that you forego the scheduled break at 10:15 a.m. on Friday, 
and come to the front of the meeting room to speak briefly with Peter and to 
be equipped with a microphone.  If you wish to speak with Peter prior to 
November 17, he has assured me that he will make himself available to talk 
with any of you.  I will be happy to arrange a call for you.

If you will not be at the conference and therefore not able to participate, 
please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can consider a 
replacement for you.  Feel free to contact me with any other additional 
questions or concerns.  

I'm looking forward to working with each of you on this endeavor,
