hey there.  freak show central here.  this week is bad, unfortunately.  
florida was awsome...and it put me in the mood to get back on the diet, and 
exercise.  did you buy that watch?  you should leave the office now and get 
it if you didn't, and on your way back, you should stop for a tennis lesson!

how are you?  it must have been a little bit easier to come back to such 
beautiful weather.  I can't wait to hear about the rest of your trip!  I had 
a great weekend.  I relaxed and spent a lot of time outside which was great.  
I had my best tennis lesson yesterday!  I just wish that I could play more.  

let me know if you have any free time this week to get together with Mish and 
I.  we could grab dinner after a run again!  I'd love to exercise if you 
can.  let me know!
I think that Wednesday is good for both of us if it works for you.
