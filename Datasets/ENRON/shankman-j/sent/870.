I will schedule you for Nov. 11th.  If you are around on Dec. 9th we will use 
you but I will also make sure we have someone else.  We don't generally do a 
spring Super Saturday.  We ask the teams to bring back their best two or 
three candidates and then we get together informally to decide.  I will let 
you know when that begins to take place.  I would like to get a small group 
of commercial people for that process as we did with the summer offer 
process.    It generally takes place in February and March.
I will keep you informed.
Thanks Charlene

Nov 11 is great, and I'll try to help out Dec 9.  (I'll be out of town Nov 
4).  I'd also be happy to look now at the spring schedule.

Jeff thanks alot.  I really appreciate it.  Here are the schedule of schools:

November4th (Analysts)
Rice, UT, Baylor, Texas A&M, OU, Florida, LSU and Univ. of Houston

November 11th (Associates)
Columbia, NYU Stern, UCLA, UVA (Darden), Cornell and Vanderbilt

December 9th 
Wellesley, overflow and re-schedules from previous Super Saturdays

If you don't have a preference. I would prefer that you do either November 
4th or 11th.  I think that would be most beneficial.  You are certainly 
welcome to do both but I didn't want to push my luck (smile). Please let me 
know as soon as possible so that I can get someone else for the ones you 
can't attend.

Again, thanks alot.
Charlene

Jeff,
To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:

Be the speaker at breakfast
Interview candidates 
Facilitate the decision making meeting

The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will 
provide the administrative assistance.
Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible of your availability.
Thanks in advance.

By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.

Charlene
