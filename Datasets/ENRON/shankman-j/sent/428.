Jeff,
The main problem that our customers are identifying is that the products are 
randomly put on EnronOnline.  Unfortunately, this pushes our customers to 
other systems that are consistently showing numbers (such as Altrade's 
Chalkboard).  Here are some comments that Jennifer McQuade and Beth Cowan 
have received over the past two weeks:

NGL products (Jennifer McQuade):
Products that come on and off-line throughout the day (or sometimes are never 
put out all day): Natural Gasoline (physical only), Normal Butane, Purity 
Ethane and Physical Conway Propane (Craig Story).  These products are less 
liquid and the traders (Wade Hicks- physical, Adam Gross-financial) find it 
difficult  to keep the products out all day.  However, Chalkboard (which has 
the LPG on-line market share) consistently has 4-5 postings in each of these 
products.  Companies that have commented on this include Dynegy, Gulfsream 
Trading, Huntsman Petrochemicals, and Taylor Gas Liquids.
Lately, when one of the traders is out of the office, his products are not 
being posted (i.e. 12/14 Wade Hicks was out of the office and there were no 
physical Mt. Belvieu products).   
The product details say these market are open from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm, but 
the products often don't come on until 8/8:30 and are often gone shortly 
after 2:00 pm.

Crude/Products (Beth Cowan):
Beth spoke with Kirk Kinnear at Hess Energy Trading Company LLC (2nd largest 
crude counterparty).  Kirk commented that we are posting various products but 
the hours that they trade are not consistent - he compares EOL to other 
exchanges where the numbers are up all day long.  J
John Brewer at Occidental Energy Marketing said, "we are interested mostly in 
the PT market & West Texas but weren't seeing many quotes out there so I quit 
looking at it."
