After weeks of media reports and official Brazilian govt forecasts of a 25-=

million bag crop, we are finally getting to the real likely crop figure of =
35=20
million bags, which we forecast in mid-November  (see report below the Dow=

RE:  Brazilian Coffee Crop Forecast
DATE:  06 November 2000

1. 2000-2001 Crop

This crop flowered from September 1999 to January 2000 and was harvested fr=
om=20
April 2000 to November 2000. The peak of the harvest occurred in June/July.=
 =20
The 2000-2001 crop is currently being exported, and exports from the crop=

will continue into the first half of 2001.  The consensus from our sources =
is=20
that this crop will be bigger than expected and total 32-33 million bags. =
=20
Brazil=01,s Ministry of Agriculture (Embrapa) is expected to release an off=
icial=20
total in the next 10 days, which may or may not be accurate.  The most rece=
nt=20
government forecast called for 28.9 million bags.  Growers have been issuin=
g=20
similarly lower crop yield estimates for 2000-2001 as a way of calling=20
attention to a probable bad harvest and pressuring the government to provid=
e=20
more generous financing subsidies.

The current dry weather impacts the 2001-2002 crop, not the 2000-2001 crop,=
=20
which is largely harvested.  Crop receipts issued by cooperatives in Brazil=
=20
are 11 percent greater than they were in 1999-2000.   Our top source in=20
London believes that the 2000-2001 crop has been largely discounted by the=
=20
market and that the focus should be on 2001-2002.

2. 2001-2002 Crop

This is the crop that should be currently flowering in Brazil, but was=20
impacted by the June frost and the October dry weather.  The harvest for th=
e=20
2001-2002 crop will run from April 2001 to November 2001 and will be export=
ed=20
in the second half of 2001 and in the first half of 2002.  The Brazilian=20
government is likely to release its 2001-2002 forecast in December or Janua=
ry=20
2001.  The 1999 plantings garnered expectations of a 2001-2002 crop yield o=
f=20
44-46 million bags.  However, recent weather problems have caused a=20
significant downgrade of this forecast to between 33 and 40 million bags.

Other sources in contact with coffee growers in Brazil report the potential=
=20
for even greater damage to the 2001-2002 crop, in the range of up to a 50=
=20
percent drop, or 22-23 million bags.  Agronomists from Cooxupe, the largest=
=20
coffee cooperative in Brazil, have already pegged their first estimate at=
=20
27.8 million bags.  Again, however, it is critical to remember that growers=
=20
tend to exaggerate weather damage, which is then further exacerbated by=20
market rumors.  As evidence, dry weather in the spring (Sept-Dec in Brazil)=
=20
of 1999 caused alarm regarding the 2000-2001 crop.  Even though the dry=20
weather did not end until December 1999, there was still time for flowering=
,=20
which caused many market watchers to upgrade their forecasts.

While analysts and growers agree that the highly irregular status of the=20
coffee trees makes the 2001/2002 crop one of the most difficult to evaluate=
,=20
the occurrence of average to normal rainfall will greatly sharpen crop=20
forecasting efforts.  It is most critical for the rest of November and=20
December.  Recent rains since the last week of October have begun to addres=
s=20
the hydrological deficit in the soil.  Continued, steady, well-dispersed=20
rains will help offset losses, but estimated irreversible damage to the=20
expected yield of 44-46 million bags from frost and dry weather to date wil=
l=20
be a minimum of 15 percent, making the new yield forecast no greater than=
=20
38-40 million bags.  A shortage of significant rainfall between now and the=
=20
end of December could bring yield down to a 30 percent loss from the=20
forecast, in the range of 33-36 million bags.

Rain is particularly significant because the new planting in recent years h=
as=20

=20
coffee can be mechanically harvested in this region, but requires significa=
nt=20
irrigation.  The irrigation alone will only partially offset the dry=20
weather. =20

The frost damage from June 2000 accounts for a 75 percent crop loss in Para=
na=20
and a 20 percent crop loss in Sao Paulo, but these states only account for =
20=20
percent of total Brazilian production.  In Minas Gerais (almost 60 percent =
of=20
production), the crop losses are only 10 percent.  Crop losses in Espiritu=
=20
Santo, which accounts for 10 percent of production, have been negligible.

Our sources will monitor rainfall and flowering/cherry formation on the=20
coffee trees, which must occur by January 2001.  The recent rainfall is=20
viewed as promising and supports our basis for a 33 million bag estimate.
