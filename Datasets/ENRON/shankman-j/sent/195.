This is hands down, one of the smartest kids to come out of wharton this year 
and we got him.  Kevin, I know you really liked the guy and I'm going to see 
him on wed at a dinner and see what hes interested in doing, but i'm pretty 
sure its a trading rotation.  please feel free to contact him if you'd like.

Sarah,

Thanks for your email last week. I wanted to drop you a note that I
decided to accept the offer and appreciate all that you and the
recruiting team has done for us. I'm looking foward to getting to TX in a
few months and getting started.

I do want to speak to you later in the year regarding groups, teams and
such, especially regarding your team. Take care.
