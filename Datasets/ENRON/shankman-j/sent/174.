What a fun weekend!  Mine was a little boring.  Did you dance at the club 
before or after you ate all those burgers?  How's the pooch?

I totally forgot we were celebrating my sister's birthday on Saturday.  We 
had a blast.  Went to an after hours club and had burgers for breakfast at 
4am.  And of course vegged on Sunday.
