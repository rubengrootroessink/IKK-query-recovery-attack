I'll defer to you.  How does this supplement your reports now?

Mike and Jeff:

I am rethinking the legal reports.  Alan and I am preparing a monthly trading 
and transactional summary, a litigation report and the TOP TEN legal risk 
report.  To me the last two are the most important.  On a conceptual basis, 
is that what you need or want to see?

Mark
