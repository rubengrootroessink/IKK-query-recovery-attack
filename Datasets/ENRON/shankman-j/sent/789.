Ahead of tonight's stats, I've gone through last week's numbers (note - DOE, 
not API) and a few things leap out as worth noting and looking for this week.

Despite the API numbers, and the Mexican hurricane, crude imports were down 
just 150 kb/d, just 40 of which was in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast). Although imports 
are down from the peak in August, they still lie at least 500 kb/d above 
recent years' levels.
Bizarrely, the SPR rose by 0.5 mbbls last week, and 70kb/d of imports were 
specifically allocated to SPR - partly offsetting the 4.5 mbbl commercial 
stock draw.
There is no sign yet of distillate demand slowing, rather it continues to 
climb, and is well into winter levels.
Distillate output is strong, due to very high yields, rather than high 
throughput.

What does this mean for stocks?

The refinery runs show we are well into the maintenance season, and crude 
stocks almost always rise this time of year. But if the weather disruptions 
did not show up in last week's DOEs, they may appear tomorrow. DOE crude 
stocks are 2.5mbbls above API.
With distillate demand still storming, and runs falling, we could be in for 
another week or two of distillate draws.
As a result of the yield and the runs, gasoline stocks will likely follow the 
seasonal pattern and fall once more. DOE mogas stocks are 3.5 mbbls below API.

The consensus appears to be for builds across the board, but some of these 
factors might argue otherwise. Some charts are attached illustrating the 
points.
