Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat
