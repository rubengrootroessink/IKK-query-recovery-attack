To our Valued Palm.Net Customers:

Please read this in its entirety, you will not incur a charge for the receipt 
of
this e-mail on your palm.net account.

This notice is to advise you that our e-mail service is being upgraded, making
the service unavailable for approximately 12-hours starting Sat., Dec. 9 at 
8pm
PST/11pm EST, and ending at 4am PST/ 7am EST on Sun., Dec. 10. During that 
time,
if you try to "check and send" or "get more" you will receive an error message
saying "Server Busy" tap details for more information". The details box will
state  "The iMessenger server is temporarily unavailable due to system
upgrading. Please check www.palm.net for current upgrade status". Incoming 
mail
will be queued up and delivered when the service resumes. A final 24-hour 
notice
will be sent to your desktop e-mail address on Friday, Dec. 8. If the upgrade
takes longer than expected, service will remain unavailable and we'll post
periodic updates to the www.palm.net Network Status page, with a plan to be up
and running no later than 4am PST/ 7am EST, on Mon., Dec.11. This upgrade will
be transparent to you.  There will be no change in functionality.  Web 
clipping
will not be impacted.

THANK YOU for your support and patience during this upgrade. For questions,
