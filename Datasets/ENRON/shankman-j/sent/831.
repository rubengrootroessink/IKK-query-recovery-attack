I know you guys have been working to secure supply for the H. Galleon.  I 
wonder if we should do some sort of tender for fob princing, allowing us 
whatever freedom we want with the ship.  I'm not sure we should kill 
ourselves for a few pennies--I'd even let the ship stay empty and maybe force 
some of our will on the LNG market if possible, in effect creating more of a 
spot market.  Maybe EOL.   Any thoughts?
