Subject: Wharton Super Saturday Invites

Wharton interviews were a huge success - we interviewed approximately 48 
students in the first round of interviews, 28 students in the second round 
and invited 19 back to Super Saturday on Dec. 2.  A list of the students that 
we invited is in Kristin's email below.  I think that we've got a great group 
of candidates.  A huge thank you to all of the interviewers - Jayshree Desai, 
Tom Dutta, Bill Keeney, John King, Catherine Clark, Ranabir Dutt, Jeff 
Golden, Chuck Ward, Rajesh Chettiar, Natalie Halich and  Colin Jackson. It 
you haven't already done so, it would be great if you could sign up to either 
attend a dinner or interview for the Dec. 2 Super Saturday.  To sign up, go 
to the analyst/associate web site at http://axis.enron.com/aaxis.asp.

Upcoming Events
Nov. 30 & Dec. 1 - Entrepreneurship Conference.  Tom Gros will be speaking on 
a panel on Corporate Intrapreurship.  Laura Howenstine is leading this 
conference, if you are interested in attending call Laura at 30308.

Dec. 7  & 8 - Finance Conference - Jeff Shankman and a to be named person 
will be speaking on panels.  There is also a career fair associated with the 
conference.  We need 2-3 more people who can attend and man the booth at the 
career fair.  If you are interested in going, please let me know.
