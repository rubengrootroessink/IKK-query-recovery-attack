FYI. Just thought I'd let you know we're pushing the crude ideas and getting 
positive feed back. Should lead to business shortly.  Per

Hi Chris- thanks for getting on the horn with Harvard last week- because we 
know they are already long the spreads, we will have to work on them amending 
the position or putting more on longer term.

Below is feedback from another fund- Tudor, who we trade a lot with- same 
thing- we will have to work on other ideas.  I am getting a bit more 
comfortable with the flow of crude and appreciate your help on ideas.

These guys generally look at us as nat gas/ power only but are very willing 
to trade crude/ products- just need to build credibility.

Talk to you later,
CA

Dwight/Jason-

We have done some analysis on the Brent / WTI spread- we would recommend
buying WTI/ selling Brent for 2Q01 (as well as 02 and 03).

We looked back to 1995 to see how each 2Q of these years traded 1 year
prior to it being prompt.  The graph attached gives the raw data and the
word doc some risk/ reward analysis (1995 was a weird year).

(See attached file: Brent_TI Analysis.xls)(See attached file:
Brent_WTI-Trade.doc)

The spread is pretty constant at 1.25- 1.40 up until the contracts are
prompt- then the average is more like 1.80.  2000 was particularly striking
because of the gasoline shortage in the Mid West which put pressure on WTI
at Cushing (and in general kept cracks high)- we got out to 2.70.  We are
looking for a repeat this year.  The Arb has generally moved to 2.70
minimum (to bring Brent to Cushing) because of higher freight rates this
year- this looks to continue.

The spread has moved out the last few days as Dec Brent is getting tight
(due to UK tax affect)- now 1.52 at 1.57

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.
Rgds,
CA
