As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with 
each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is 
important that both business units work together to determine which 
individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will 
begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious 
that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the 
synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power 
businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.
