I will begin soliciting random friends to go on the trip with you so you 
won't be lonely!  Did you tell Jennifer about Yolanda?  I'm out of here at 
3:30--getting my hair highlighted.

this weekend in so crazy.  We will have to do something really fun when you 
get back.  where are you going for so long?  I just got out of a three hour 
meeting.  It was so freaking boring that I wrote a long letter to my best 
friend from college.  About 15 minutes pertained to me.  To top it off, for 
lunch they had four sausage pizzas.  Yum.  Who the hell orders that?  
anyway...

Yolandas desk near you.  when will you be there?  I'll come say hi!

Emergency calls are great.  Used it, but dinner was quick.  So the kids 
singing wasn't as good as barbara streisand's singing prayer songs?  I'm sure 
it was fun, though.  

Jeff is the king.  Already left him a message.  
I'm out dec 19-28, so do you want to try to do something this weekend--FUN.  
(I have a party to go to sat eve for a little while)  
How's the day going?  Did you talk to Beth about Pinnacle?

Did you use the emergency call?  I almost called you on your cell phone in 
case you needed another out!  I didn't get anything else at Saks but after 
the singing I got the stuff an Neiman's that I needed.  I had a freak out 
attack though b/c I thought I lost the Saks bag with the $600 bracelet in it 
and was running around Neiman's like an idiot.  Then I remembered that I 
DROVE from Saks to Neiman's and it was in my car.  I think I was just a 
little bit on edge last night!  I met my friend at Barnaby's for dinner and 
then got under the covers and finished my book.  It was great.  By the way, I 
wish I dragged you to the singing b/c Sarah, the 10 month old cutest baby on 
the planet was there.  She was clapping and singing along the whole time 
which was the cutest thing especially b/c she was on my lap the entire time.  
It was worth sitting through a horrible rendition of every Hanukkah song you 
have ever heard! 

How about your buddy Jeff!!!!  Have you congratulated him yet?  That is great!

That glass of wine did the trick--I felt better  (more relaxed too!)  Dinner 
was boring--so I got home and had another glass of wine!
