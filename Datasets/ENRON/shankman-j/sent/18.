Joe,  

Saar Banin's work number in the UK at Goldman is 0207 774 6181.  He had been 
in metals for them for some time, and just moved over to gas and power (in 
the UK)  He's an aggressive, smart guy who I've known for 10 years.  Top 
notch.

Hope all is well

Jeff

PS  has Doug Rottenburg been calling anyone over there?  We haven't heard a 
sound from him.....
