Yes, Love to have dinner, either the 17th or 18th--you pick.  Let's have a 
drink at my house first so I can show you the digs.  Sorry I couldn't make 
it...last minute schedule problems...

Jeff

Jeff -

Jean and the boys will be heading to my parents for X-Mas on 12/17.  I am in
Houston until the morning of the 21st, and would love to get together for 
dinner
sometime during that interval.

Are you scheduled to be in town during that period?  If so give me a call at
713.653.8207 (day) or at home at 713.522.9381.  I'll also be happy fill you in
on what happened at the MFAH subcomittee meeting today as well.

JRG
