Jeff:

Attached you will find three files:

1) The brief description of the Envera deal you requested. ("deal summary 
final")
2) A diagram showing one potential view of how the e-Marketplace for 
Chemicals will look and where Enron would fit in. ("deal summary e-commerce 
marketplace")
3) A slide from Envera displaying their connectivity concept.  Enron will 
participate as a Member, a Service Provider and an Owner. ("basic envera 
concept")

Deals obviously are never done till they're done, but this one is 95+ % 
there.  We've received Envera Board Approval and signatures from 1/3 of the 
Owners' granting consent to issue equity to Enron.


Thanks to both you and John for your support.  We could not have come this 
far without it.





Doug
