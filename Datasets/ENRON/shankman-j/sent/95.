Gentleman,

We are currently planning a three day trip in early March to provide you with 
the opportunity to visit the coal properties in our portfolio and meet the 
principals.  These include the following:


DPR Holding Company  Chris Cline  Beckley W. Va.
The American Coal Company Bob Murray  Galatia, Ill.
BMR Resources  Richard Gilliam  Benham, Ky.

We plan to use the corporate jet in order to facilitate transportation to 
these garden spots. You will have the option of touring all three operations 
or limiting your visits to a specific mine/principal. Each visit will include 
an underground mine tour.

Bill Giuliani will be coordinating the visits for Enron and will be 
contacting your assistant  this week. Please let us know of your availability 
and particular areas of interest.

Mike
