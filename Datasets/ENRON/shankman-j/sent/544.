How's it going?  I'm sure busy and great.  Good luck with the ice men--I 
still think you should cut something.  I'm excited to finish unpacking this 
weekend, and just relaxing a little.  If you're not completely wiped on 
sunday, give me a ring.  Oh, could you wear your new party pants tuesday to 
my house?  Great, thanks. 
Have fun!

Jeff
