Soon, soon, soon.  Last minute changes to the house.  I'll probably have a 
big open house within a couple of months, but I'll have you over sooner.  My 
dogs are moving to Connecticut Friday, so after then.  

Congrats on a great year.

Jeff

Jeff,

Just a quick note to say "thank you" for your comments at year end.  I 
sincerely appreciated your comments and support.
I hope your Holidays were safe, healthy, and happy.  Say when am I going to 
see that new home of yours?  You know it is hard to continue to live 
vicariously through you if I don't know what to picture!   


Sandra
