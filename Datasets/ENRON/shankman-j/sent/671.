I spoke with Tom Piazze at Wharton again this morning, about a reduction in 
the financial commit. from us.  He was not receptive, and in the past, I've 
suggested energy outsourcing for the University, and more recently discussing 
their broadband needs.  Others here have thought about this at Enron (like 
the California University system).  Jeremy Blachman and I are going to run 
with this in a more direct approach and see what happends.  (Tom P.  was open 
to all of this, of course).

FYI,  thanks.   Jeff
