Subject: Super Saturday Interviewers

Jeff/Larry,

To follow up on my voicemail, the Associate and Analyst Program is in great 
need of interviewers for October 28th and November 4th Super Saturdays.  
These weekends are the most critical at this time.  To date, we are in need 
of an additional 38 interviewers for October 28th and 67 for November 4th.  
In order to have a successful recruiting season, we would greatly appreciate 
your assistance in getting more EGM executives to participate in this 
effort.  Please contact me at x39233 with any questions.  Thanks for your 
continued support.
