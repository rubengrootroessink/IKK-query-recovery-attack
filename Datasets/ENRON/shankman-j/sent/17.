Jeff, I tried to contact Jennifer Burn regarding Mark Fievert's availability
for April 27th and May 11th and I understand that she is out of the office .
I am meeting with Pedro Reinhard on monday around the planning for your trip
to midland and it would be good to know if Mark is joining you on the trip.
Thanks.

Best Regards,

Jeff, I think this is a good potential. We are going to setup for you to
meet with Arnold Allemang - VP of Operations to discuss this option.

Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have
you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in
particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite
a bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and
gas markets, that can be extremely valuable...

Best,

Jeff

Jeff, thanks for your help on the introduction and follow up. I'll let you

Talk to you soon.
