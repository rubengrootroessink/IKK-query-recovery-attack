Get with Nowlan and talk to Andy Zipper on this.  There are a number of 
options for us with brokers, and Andy has been involved in this aspect of our 
business for some time.   I'd like to hear your views.  Thanks.   

Jeff

Subject: EOL and the brokers

I have been contacted by ICAP and Man regarding different co-ops between EOL 
and the services provided by these brokers. Icap wants Enron to be the market 
maker for the ICAP electronic system (swap-net) , MAN wants to represent EOL 
to the market and act as a principal between Enron and Man customers.

There are benefits and draw-backs using the brokers. I have my views on the 
matter.  

Jeff, what is our policy for EOL regarding working with the brokers?

regards
chris glaas
