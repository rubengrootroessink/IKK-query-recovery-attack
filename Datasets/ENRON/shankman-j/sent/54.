him down here....have to go now though.......hugs    Jeff

Jeff...Watch out for an e-mail from me or Michael called something like
"check out". Do not open. It's the horrible virus they have been talking
about in the news and unfortunately my assistant opened it so it is now
automatically sent to everyone in our address books...sorry!

Also, on Sunday at our Valentine's brunch, Dan Fuller asked that I speak
with you regarding summer position. I think he has e-mailed you in the
past couple of weeks.  He wants to firm us his plans for the summer and
was hoping Enron was still a possibility. Sorry to be a pain!

Missed you on Sunday but I hope we'll see you soon.    halley
