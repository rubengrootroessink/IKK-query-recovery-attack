Can you please identify for me by return Email or phone (66474) the person on 
your staff to whom I can speak regarding the services your company provides 
for Enron customers?

I am putting together a short presentation on "Other Enron Services" for a 
conference our TECASO group is hosting to discuss/promote our planned on-line 
lender's engineer due diligence services amongst numerous major financial 
institutions in early February.  The purpose of this"Other Enron Services" 
agenda item is simply to take the opportunity to summarize the multitude of 
services offered by Enron for those in attendance who may not be familiar 
with some or all of these services.  Accordingly, I'm in the process of 
gathering information on the various services Enron has to offer and, in 
particular, slides/viewgraphs covering the services offered by your company 
which may already exist in order not to have to duplicate prior efforts. 

Thank you in advance for your attention to this request.

Regards,

Ed Hlopak, Sr.
