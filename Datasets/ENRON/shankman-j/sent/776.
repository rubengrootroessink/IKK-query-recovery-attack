1.  Brent-Dubai calendar swap differential.  Idea would be to trade this 
differential on a quarterly basis.
2.  WTI-Brent calendar swap differential.  Same timing idea, Nymex v IPE..
3.  WTI-Dated Brent calendar swap differential.  Nymex v Platts Dated Brent.
4.  WTI-Brent  futures differential.  Issue would be settlement dates given 
the time lag between expiry.
