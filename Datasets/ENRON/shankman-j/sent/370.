I have a book you should read--How to Raise a Puppy--by the Monks of New 
Skete.  These Monks have perfected the art of raising a dog--so they 
think--but the book is helpful.  I'm leaving at 1 ish.

Awesome.

Santa brought me a weimeraner!  He's so cute.  He has a silver coat with blue 
eyes.  As he gets older the eyes will change to hazel.  I took him to the vet 
yesterday.  He was not too happy about that. He was pretty upset with me.  I 
did find it hard leaving him home alone.  I was thinking of taking the rest 
of the day off to see him?  

Do you have any tips?
