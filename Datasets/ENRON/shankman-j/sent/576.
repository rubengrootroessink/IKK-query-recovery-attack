 Attached for your information please find the text and slides of a
presentation titled "Natural gas utilization - will LNG stay competitive?"
It was presented at GASTECH 2000 in Houston 15 November 2000.  The
presentation focuses on innovative ways to improve project planning and
execution.  I hope you find it of use, and please let me know if you have
any comments.  Thanks you.
