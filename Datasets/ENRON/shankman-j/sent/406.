Subject: Weather Meetings

I received a brief report on the meetings we today with the IFC on weather 
derivatives.  It sounds like the meetings wenet very well and that there is 
much to follow up on here in DC.  We are pleased to do so.   I would like to 
ask that we have more consultation with your group in planning the meetings 
as we move forward.   John Hardy and his folks know these groups well and we 
can give valuable input in how to maximize our time with the multilateral 
institutions.  Thanks.
