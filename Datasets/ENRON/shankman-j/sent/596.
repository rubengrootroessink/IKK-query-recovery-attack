Thank you for your note.  It is always appreciated.  I'm sure you will find 
your career here very exciting, and Dan is a leader in our company and I know 
he is excited to have you as part of his team.  

If you are running into some employee issues, I'd ask you to get Shanna 
Funkhouser involved as well.  A good work environment is crucial to 
everyone's success.  

Welcome.  

Jeff

Mr. Shankman:

     I am Dan Reck's new administrative assistant.  I initially interviewed
with Jennifer and Shanna Funkhouser and knew that they were both special.
However, since I have been here (an entire 5 days now!), Jennifer has been
invaluable to me.  On my first day at my desk, she called and asked me to
come to her office and she introduced me to Cathy Phillips and Yolanda
Martinez.  The reason for this e-mail is that I have encountered some
employee problems at my location and have confided in Jennifer.  Her
professionalism, eloquence and intelligence belies her youth.  As I am sure
you are aware, Jennifer is a diamond and she will only shine brighter as
her experience grows.  Life is short and I was raised to say nice things
when warranted.  I am so impressed with Jennifer  and I am proud and feel
privileged to be a member of her team.  Thank you for your time.
