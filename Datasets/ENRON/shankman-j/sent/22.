You are right, let's just do a contract.  I'll put one together.  Jeff

Last night Jennifer and I did my PRC review over dinner.  Of course 
everything went well and Jen always does criticism in the most professional 
manner.  I know you and I just talked about putting me in the trading track 
program in order to get a salary increase, but I'd also like to discuss the 
possibility of signing a contract.  I don't know if the trading track program 
is right for me since I'm already working on a  book right now and would not 
be rotating through different areas.  Please let me know when you might have 
some time to talk about this.  Thanks.

Sarah
