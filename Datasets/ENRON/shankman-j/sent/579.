Good afternoon Ida  (better name for you than me).  EC was uneventful, given 
that I wore no crazy hat.  At the right time though.  I know the party will 
be great--try not to stress too much, besides your plans sounded great and 
I'm sure everyone will have a great time.  I'm leaving in a little while to 
go to the closing ( and collect some cash!), and am out the rest of the 
afternoon--cruising in the ida-mobile!  In case you were wondering, I used 
almost  a half mile of bubble wrap yesterday moving my art to the new house 
and will recycle it if there are some cool kid things to do with it.  Ideas? 

Later.

how was the EC meeting this morning?  did you wear funky shoes or a hat?  I 
have had a crazy morning.  so much is going on for this weekend.  
I trying not to stress, but I already have some butterflies.  I know 
everything is going to be great, there are just so many pieces to keep track 
of.  I have a meeting this afternoon with about 10 people on my event team, 
so I'll feel better when that is over.

I am glad that you brought the Ida mobile b/c it is going to be gorgeous 
today!  what time is your closing?  good luck with that.
have a great day!
