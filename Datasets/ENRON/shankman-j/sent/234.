Before I call Don, I just want to confirm with you that your understanding is 
that we will assist EES in putting their publications on their own site.  In 
other words, Don would need to appoint his own people - an IT person to build 
the site (which we can assist with) and someone to research all their 
publications to see whether they're available electronically.  The EES Marcom 
group sent me 33 publications which they subscribe to and before I call Don 
to tell him he needs an EES person to take care of these, I want to make sure 
you and I have the same understanding.  We briefly talked about this before, 
but I want to be certain.  Thanks.
