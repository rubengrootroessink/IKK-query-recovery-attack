Yikes!  That girl's mother sounds like a real problem.  I'm not sure how I 
would have handled it.  How's school going?  Any plans for the weekend?

What happened?  

Here's a story...as I was waiting at the bus stop (7:35am) to go to school, a 
lady approached me and asked if I'd make sure her daughter got on a certain 
bus.  The mother was running late for work and could not wait.  I couldn't 
say no...so Nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and I waited for the bus.  It 
was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus.  

On top of  things, I had quiz at 8am.  Which I then realized I missed.  I 
decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own.  I asked her if she 
had any relatives that  would want to know of her whereabouts.  I called her 
grandmother and explained things to her.  Pretty strange...aye. 

A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her, but I 
couldn't do it.  Finally, I told the little girl that she would have to 
accompany me to school (8:30am).  There were only 15 minutes left of class.  
I stayed for the remainder of the lecture. After class we went back to bus 
stop and within minutes her bus arrived.  I told the bus driver where to drop 
her off.  I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure.  And I 
was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe.
