Jeff:

It was a pleasure to meet you last week at the Inn at Penn.  It sounds as
though Enron is doing some very exciting things with more to come in the
future.

I called Vince Kaminski a few times last week.  His secretary mentioned that
he was off again this week on a business trip returning on Oct 9th, I
believe.  I am confident that he will get a project proposal to us by the 13
Oct deadline.

Thank you for your support of the Wharton School.  We look forward to having
Enron host a Tiger Team Project.

Sincerely,
Donna Piazze
