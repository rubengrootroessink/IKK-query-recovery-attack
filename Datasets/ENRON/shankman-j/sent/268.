Sarah, Let's get her an interview schedule if you think it's worthwhile

Thanks.  Jeff

Beth-
 Is there anyway we can get an interview for her for the program.  I know it 
would be off-cycle but she's available ASAP and very interested.  Not your 
normal business school cantidate but I'd really appreciate if someone gave 
her a call or an interview.  We need more of these around.  Thanks

Sarah
