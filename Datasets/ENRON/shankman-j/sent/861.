Guys - We need representation at a senior level from your groups.  Please get 
your Directors and VP's to "volunteer" to help the AA Program out with 
interviewers.  For example, the November 4 Super Saturday has only 13 Manager 
and above level interviewers and there are 38 candidates from UT alone.  
These candidates will become our next crop of AA's.  We control that with the 
Super Saturday process.  Be represented - have your people sign up now 
on-line (see below).  Thanks.  Ted
