Subject: Metgas Selldown

There ae meetings scheduled in Singapore starting early next week to disclose 
key information to potential buyers of Metgas, including BP and presumably 
other competitors.  Disclosures will include the terms of the Metgas Malaysia 
Sales contract and will quickly get into our concept for EGM to sign a master 
supply agreement with Metgas.

Have you talked with Baxter/Sanjay about this?  I still believe that selldown 
of Metgas is a mistake that will cost Enron dearly down the road.
