Thanks for the thought.  We are trying to get more fund business already 
through Per in the NY office.  Do you have any funds you'd like to sign up.  
In terms of products, I was thinking more depth in products we feel 
comfortable managing.  Maybe different spreads/cracks, whatever.  You can 
control product launch, not the funds.  Can you give a some ideas of more/new 
products we trade or more/new products you'd like to get on eol.  What more 
products will your customers want?  

Jeff

Jeff,
One thought that will take some work with the credit department is to try and 
get more of the fund and small trading companies to do
their day trading with us.  I would think getting the small specs on our 
system would give us much greater daily deal flow.  On the oil
side, our main counterparties are the large speculative trading shops and 
this reflects that it is mainly proprietary traders that we
are attracting at this stage.  Not sure how realistic this is from a credit 
perspective but if we could create some type of margin account
for the smaller players, similiar to the futures exchange clearing houses,  
we might be able to significantly increase our volumes with 
the existing instruments that we are presently offering.

FYI.  I'd like to be number 2 behind ENA.  And a close 2nd that is. This 
should be a priority for us. I'd like to set up a meeting shortly to put 
together a strategy on how we can get there.  More to follow.
