Jeff,

I spoke with your assistant earlier this week to get a date where you would 
be available to meet with El Paso regarding current LNG opportunities.  
Unfortunately, Eisbrenner (Senior VP El Paso Merchant Energy Services) was 
only available on Friday October 13th.    

Please come back to me if you can juggle your schedule to join us.  I have 
not invited any of the initial team for the time being.

Thanks
Eric
