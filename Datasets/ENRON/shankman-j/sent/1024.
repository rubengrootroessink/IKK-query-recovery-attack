Our analysts were covered during the summer, weren't they?  Why not use 
whomever was used then.  I thought you were going to change the A/A review 
process from mid year, since that was a disaster by most accounts.

Do you know to whom you submitted your PRC Reps?  I don't believe that any 
one in the Associate and Analyst Program has received that information.  We 
will be using the same format as mid-year and we are looking for 1 Director 
for the Analyst PRC and 1 VP for the Associate PRC from your EGM groups.  
Each would represent approximately 15 individuals.  Do you think you could 
forward me a copy of your submitted list so we can move forward?  I would 
greatly appreciate it. 

Just to let you know, I did forward an email to Shanna Funkhouser and Brent 
Price (on Oct. 3rd and 4th) to make sure that all Analysts and Associates in 
an EGM group go through a pre-rate meeting prior to the final A/A PRC which 
has been scheduled for December 12th and 13th.  We must have the pre-ratings 
loaded into the PEP system prior to these dates and hope they can be final by 
November 30th.  These results are imperative to a successful 
cross-calibration in the final PRC meeting.  We already have dates set for 
the EES and ESA meetings.  I will be glad to attend the Associate and Analyst 
piece of EGM's PRC meetings to assist in facilitation.  Please advise when 
the EGM pre-rating meeting is scheduled.  Thank you for your cooperation.

We had submitted a list of PRC reps already.  Who is currentlyreviewing, and 
are you using the same format as midyear, and how many people do you need?

Jeff,
I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
requesting a recommendation for a Director and Vice President to represent 
Analyst and Associates in the final 2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and 
additions to the Associate and Analyst Programs, we have an additional slot 
for both the Associate PRC and Analyst PRC that we would like to fill with an 
EGM participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout the business 
units equitable.  

We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
choice for Global Markets representation to me by this date or contact me to 
discuss.  Thanks so much for your continued support.
