Jeff,

Last week we discussed looking at your cost of people in the Singapore 
office.  If you could check out the cost for lower-level manager types I 
would be most appreciative.  I have already discussed this with Lilian Low of 
HR Singapore so if this was your planned course of action I've already 
covered that base - she told me managers are about the same US$ amount as in 
Houston.

Thanks,

Bob

PS - That was a most evil joke you played on Lavorato......I enjoyed it 
immensely.
