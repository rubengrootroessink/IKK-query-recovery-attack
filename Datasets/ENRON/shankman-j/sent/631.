Subject: Wharton Super Saturday

Good morning team,

First,  I want to thank you for helping with on campus interviews last week 
at Wharton.  

To conclude the process I have scheduled a meeting for Tuesday November 14th 
at 9am in room 11C2 to discuss candidate invites for Super Saturday.  It is 
imperative that we meet to discuss who you will be passing on to the final 
round of interviews.  With the holidays coming up the sooner we get letters 
out for invites the better our results might be for attendance.  If you can 
not make this meeting please call me as soon as possible at extension 53214.  
Otherwise I will see you tomorrow.

Natalie if you can please respond with a call in number we will patch you 
into the meeting.

Thank you,

Kristin Gandy
