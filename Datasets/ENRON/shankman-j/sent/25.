Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have 
you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in 
particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite a 
bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and gas 
markets, that can be extremely valuable...

Best,

Jeff
