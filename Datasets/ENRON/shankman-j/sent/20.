Cool.  They sell their music CD's at the front desk.  They may even have two 
out.  Would you mind picking them up for me?  I'll pay you back, I promise.  
If you have time, check out the gym/pool/message in the basement of the 
hotel--it's great.  Also try to get a room overlooking the interior 
courtyard, and don't change money at the hotel--they'll bend you as only the 
french can. 
Have a great time.....and definitely hang out in the lounge of the hotel.
Jeff.

PS, would you mind swinging over to the Hermes and pick me up a 
briefcase?--they're about $5,000 or so.  Great, thanks.
