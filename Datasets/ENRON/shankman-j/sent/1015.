My guess is that we'll bring him back for another round of interviews, so we 
can have you talk to him them.

This was the guy that I mentioned that I was interviewing this Friday for the 
Associate program.  He was at Network Oil and seems to have a good 
background.  Let me know if you or someone else in your group would like to 
interview him.

I would wait.  Otherwise if we bring him in now and he gets offer, then we 
would have to place him elsewhere for his first six months.  If you want him 
for a first rotation, it may make sense to wait until we get closer to 
February.

We will have a need for another associate in February and would be interested 
in evaluating Randall for that position.  Does that mean that we should wait 
a few months to interview him?  I don't think that Kevin has any immediate 
openings either.

We can bring him in for a round of interviews for the Associate Program.  If 
you have an immediate need and he passes interviews then its likely we can 
make offer now.  Confirm thats what you want and we will facilitate getting 
him in for interviews.

The attached resume comes highly recommended to us and it looks like he's got 
some very relevant experience to some of the things going on in EBS.  Kevin 
Howard and I would both be interested in talking to him about positions in 
our group, but it seems to make the most sense to bring him into the 
Associate/Analyst Program.  He's been out of school for 2 years and was one 
of the founders of Network Oil, a Houston based startup.  What is the best 
way to proceed with this?

That's a good idea.  If we get him in for interviewing, it would probably be 
a couple of months before he has an offer and starts - they'd probably just 
lump him in with the MBA recruiting and Super Saturday timing.  We'd 
definitely have an interest in talking to him about opportunities in our 
group to see if there is a fit.  Do you want me to work with the Associate 
program to try to make that happen?

Michelle:

This would be as an associate in the EBS program.  I am full right now but 
seemed like someone we would want in the family.  Louie Fischer is very high 
on him and she is typically a tough critic.  If we could get him in for 
interviews, we could consider placement and timing.
