I agree.  We do not need anyone speaking at this.

Subject: Invitation to the EUROFORUM Conference "Emissions Trading"

I received the message below from you, forwarded from Steve Kean severral 
weeks ago asking if we wanted to send anyone to speak at this conference, 
which John Palmisano previously spoke at.

They have suggested that Jeff speak on the topic of "Joint Implementation 
(JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as a business opportunity."   
While Palmisano was focused on these issues in the past, it seems to me that 
the current Enron strategy does not really include pursuing "business 
opportunities" related to these mechanisms, as they involve investment of 
capital in power projects in developing countries.  I don't think it would be 
a good fit for us at all right now.

While emissions traders in EGM are looking at the Kyoto process and the 
potential for global carbon trading, we are still a long way from there being 
any viable trading market whatsoever.  EES is interested in following the JI 
and CDM issues for potential opportunities related to energy efficiency.   
Our role has been to participate in the process and monitor the development 
of these issues and see if there are effects on our markets or 
opportunities.   I may have someone attend or may see if someone in Mark 
Schroeder's group in London can attend, but I would not recommend our 
speaking at this time.  

Please let me know if you have any questions,

Jeff Keeler
