Subject: Performance - Weather Trader

Jeff,
my name is Brando Hayden and I am a trader and second year Associate on the 
Weather Derivatives desk.  Mark Tawney, my supervisor, has made a few 
attempts to set up a meeting for the three of us to discuss a few issues 
involving my performance and status in the group.  I believe that I have 
applied myself over the last seventeen months to produce significant results 
in my book and for the group.   My portfolio is up $6.7M YTD (12/17/00) which 
represents a significant contribution to the group's total revenues this 
year.  The issue here is that despite this significant contribution among 
other contributions to the group my performance has been portrayed in the PRC 
process as sub-standard and worthy of demotion.  I do not believe that this 
is just and would like to get this issue addressed.  As a result I would like 
to set up an appointment to speak with you about this matter.

I have attached a report of my trading performance through 12/17/00 for your 
review.  I have done this only because I know your position as President/COO 
of Global Markets grants you access to this information.

Regards,
Brando



PS: Mark has just passed by to tell me you can meet in January.  However, I 
would still like you to have this message.
