Boy did I unpack last night.  I couldn't go to sleep so I went a little 
crazy.  Tuesday is good.  we could have a frasier marathon.  Which one of us 
is cooking at my house?  

Would it be crazy if I asked you to be my guest at the wholesale christmas 
party next sat?  (Nothing like email to ask that sort of question, and I 
certainly don't mean to be impersonal about it)

I have to head home to work out for a few hours....

This week is crazy...as you know.  Let's get together next week.  I have book 
club Monday and Wednesday, so probably Tuesday or Thursday would be better.  
Of course if it is Tuesday....we can watch Frasier!

You know Jeff, I was thinking this morning about what a great time I have 
with you.  I am so happy that we have gotten to know eachother.  Having guy 
friends is something that I have missed out on for the past two and a half 
years.  I am really happy to have that back in my life.  

My meeting at the crack of dawn went well this morning.  I got here before 
7.  Needless to say I am tired!  Of course, I stayed up reading my cheezy 
book last night.  Did you unpack when you got home?
