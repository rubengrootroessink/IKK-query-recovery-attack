I have some real concerns over this contract Louise put together for 
Jonathan.  Shanna, can you check this out with Robert Jones.  I'd like to 
restructure this contract.  

Jeff

I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG 
job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him 
coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side 
provided you are happy with the numbers.

Louise

ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers.
