All,

Here is the latest draft.  Please make any changes you want and return.  
Paper mark up is best.  Also please leave as a separate word document if you 
do it via email  for ease of changing and converting to email late afternoon.

Cathy, please review for your normal grammar and corrections.  I realize that 
this is a draft but it will help to have your changes early even though we 
will be making additional changes in the afternoon.

Larry, I would like your feedback and commentary as well.

Thanks,
mike
