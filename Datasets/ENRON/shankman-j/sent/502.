Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 49/2000




Highlight

The freight market for cape and panamax size vessels appear to be on the 
verge of a significant downward correction.  The news from Japan and the 
Asian economies as a whole is bleak with fear of more bankruptcies looming 
and low to flat growth projections. Furthermore, the US economy is showing 
strong signs that it has peaked.  As a result, ship owners are openly worried 
about demand for next year and are desperately seeking cargo contracts while 
rates are still attractive.  The cape time charter rate has lost more than $ 
3,000 over the last 3 weeks and Panamaxes have lost $ 1,500.  On the cape 
side, Bocimar is unable to prevent the index sliding even though they still 
control 60 ships ( on Friday index fell 33 pts, single biggest point drop 
ever recorded ) and other owners are fighting for the few spot cargoes still 
unfixed before the Christmas break. 

Of significance, we fixed on subs a four cargo contract with Bao Steel ( one 
of the biggest Chinese steel mills ) that runs into March 2002 from Brazil 
into China and also fixed a a four panamax contract with Adaro from Indonesia 
to Spain, which is on subs until or if Adaro sells the coal into Spain.
