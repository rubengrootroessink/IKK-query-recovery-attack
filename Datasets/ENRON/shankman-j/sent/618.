Jeff,
 Bill and I are new to this whole referral procedure.  We have talked with 
the HR people and they asked us to fill out the attached form and send it to 
you to validate our story that we referred Mario and forward this document to 
the "Enron Employee Referrals" email address with your concurrence.  Thanks 
Jeff and I am sure you will be very happy with Mario's performance.


Mark Smith
