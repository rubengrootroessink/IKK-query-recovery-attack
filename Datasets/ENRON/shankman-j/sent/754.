Jeff

Find enclosed a resume for this guy who wants to trade crude / products.  He 
used to trade fx forwards for a few years and was profitable. He has been 
trading energy  for last six months to an year. I know him some, and he seems 
to have good trader sense. He is pretty hungry.  Just in case the 
crude/products desk is looking !

Good afternoon Harry,

Thank you very much for returning my phone call so promptly.  I have
attached my CV for your review.  I am quite excited to meet with you and any
of your colleagues to discuss where I can best contribute to Enron.  Please
feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.  I am leaving
slightly early this afternoon for Austin (Go Longhorns) but will obviously
be back in the office Monday.  Have a super weekend.

Best regards,

David Kane
