Jeff,
Great to meet you this morning.  I enjoyed learning about the directions
that you have Enron moving in and I look forward to continuing discussions
with you in the new year.  It was also nice to exchange notes with someone
who shares the collecting bug.

Have a good time out west and don't let Michael and Halley con you into more
cold weather fishing.

Thanks for breakfast,

Nat
