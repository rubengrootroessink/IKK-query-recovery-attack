How could I leave Tx?    Where are you looking for a house? That's exciting!  
I'll start shopping for a house warming gift!

Why are they moving?  Are you leaving Texas as well?

I'm doing okay.  Did I tell you I bought a truck?  It's a 1500 dodge ram.  
It's pretty neat.  I don't drive it in to work.  Parking is too expensive.  

I'm in the considering buying a home.  My former landlord referred me to a 
real estate agent.  I'd like to know how much house I can afford before I 
start looking at property.

Are you staying at your new house?

Good morning.

How are you?  The puppy is just getting huge.  He has the strongest paws.  I 
need to get him into obedience school.  He's  a bit too energetic and 
stubborn.

Talk to you soon.  Alma
