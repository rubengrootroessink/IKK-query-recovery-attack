What is the opportunity to look at Elba Island space in conjunction with the 
Dhabol supply contract?  That is, could we go to our LNG suppliers for India, 
and regotiate that contract and provide space for diverted cargoes if 
necessary.  Jim Hughes is spending his time figuring out what to do with 
Dhabol and any suggestions we have may be helpful.  

Thanks.
