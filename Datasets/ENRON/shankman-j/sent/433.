Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 51/2000




Highlight

The cape market continues on its downward momentum with this time bunkers ( 
Fuel Oil ) helping the slide as they have lost approx. $30 in the last couple 
weeks and make the costs of running the ships significantly less.  Panamaxes 
have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.  Most bundits think that 
this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.  The Japanese buyers and the 
US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks 
while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops 
while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news 
of resumed shipping.  When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, 
Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market 
quickly reversed trend and starting going up.  

With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow 
down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining 
positions quickly.   This is the last report in 2000.  Have a good holiday 
and see you next year !!!
