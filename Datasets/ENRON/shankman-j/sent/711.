Jeff,

If you have a minute, can you give me a call/email and let me know what you 
decided as far as the GasTech Presentation?  Alhamd called for my revisions 
and I told him they were with your's, but he didn't receive them.  Did you 
want to go forward with any of those slides I suggested?  Otherwise, I'll 
tell Alhamd it was fine.  I'll drop you a voice-mail to the same effect.

Thanks,
Merritt
