Hi, hope you are doing great.  I was wondering if you've met Russell Dyke, 
who is in Lagrasta's group, and who I told could get into the LNG before you 
came over.  He has great international experience, and LNG experience.  He 
might be a great match with the Jose team, since I'm uncomfortable with their 
understanding of MTM, and their overall appreciation of the Enron way of 
doing business.  (Today, Russel (assoc/mgr at year end) closed a deal with 
CSFB worth 19 million to us.)  Overall a solid guy.   Let me know what you 
think.  (Merritt and Russell know each other well, and have worked on 
projects together)

Also, I mentioned to Merritt that I was excited about her opportunity to 
trade dutch power, but was very interested in staying in touch with her, 
possibly to trade freight, etc.  

Jeff
