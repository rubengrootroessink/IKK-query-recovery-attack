Yes, absolutely.  There is a ton of work in Japan, and as you know Joe Hirl 
runs the office, but the products in EGM are crucial to its success.  I'd be 
happy to meet her.  Let me know how I can help.

I think he has a strong resume.  He's definitely worth putting on the 
interview list.

As for Japan opportunities, is there a way to get Tess Dyar plugged into 
those?  She just started (from Wharton) after spending nearly 10 years at 
Goldman in Japan.  She definitely has an interest in continuing her work with 
the country.  I think she's been a little disappointed since getting here and 
seeing APACHI dissolved.

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Christopher Handte
