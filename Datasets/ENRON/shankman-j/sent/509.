No issues, and this will benefit Enron company wide.  It will come out of 
either Kristie Patrick's (in Mark Palmer's office) or my budget.

Subject: Enron Gift to Wharton School

Cindy:

I have just received from Jeff Shankman's office under a cover letter dated 
November 9, 2000 a draft of a Gifting Agreement between The Wharton School 
and Enron, outlining a gift of $1,000,000 to Wharton for its eBusiness 
Initiative at the Corporate Partner level. The draft reflects that we would 
pay $250,000 for each of the next 4 years, commencing in December 2000.  My 
understanding is that Jeff Shankman and Jeff Skilling have approved of this 
gift.

Before we finalize this arrangement, are you aware of any 
issues/matters/provisions that Enron typically attempts to deal with in these 
types of gifting arrangements? I just want to make sure that we don't 
overlook anything material. If you would like to see a copy of the draft 
Agreement, I can have it delivered to you.

Your prompt reply is appreciated.Thanks.

Best Regards, Alan
