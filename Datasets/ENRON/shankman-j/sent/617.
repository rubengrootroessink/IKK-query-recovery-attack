Your party sounds great!!!  You are so funny.  I will fill you in on my 
events.  Dan's was fabulous.  Vikki's was pretty low key.  I want to hear 
about your first being meeting!  You are such a superstar.  You have to admit 
that you felt pretty cool.  I'd be dissapointed if you didn't.  
let me know when you are free.  my only plans so far are for sat day.  I am 
walking with Julia, and spending the day with my little cousin.  for all my 
little cousins' birthdays I take them to do something fun for their present.  
who knows what I'll be roped into doing!  I am trying to convince her to go 
for manicures, but she is nine so she probably wants to go make a teddy bear 
or something.  Anyway...let me know when you are free.  We could go for a 
really fun dinner or something.  I am also dying to see the house, so that is 
a must!

Of course I want to get together next (this?) weekend.  In fact, the house 
should be almost done, and I'd love to show it to you, too.  I'm pretty open 
also, but am doing super saturday again, and am not sure what my deal is 
friday evening (if anything, and will know by tomorrow).  

Last night on A&E was a special about Palm Beach, and the good life, charity 
balls, social scene, etc.  So I had a Palm Beach Party--bought caviar, fruit 
tarts, champagne and sat around watching the show.  I made everyone wear 
Lacoste shirts, loafters (no socks) and not put down their glass full of 
champagne (as much as possible!)  Fun, casual, and last minute.  For not 
being in your biz, I liked the idea and we had fun.   

Went to my first exec committee meeting.  Pretty interesting.  But can't wait 
to hear about your parties for Vicki and Dan....

I hope that Super Saturday went well.  Are you kidding....I am most excited 
for your parties!  We will think of some really different things to do.  I am 
really open next weekend so let me know if you want to get together.  We can 
do something fun to let you blow off steam from the Managment Conference.

Super Saturday is super early---7:15 sat. morn. and I'm at my desk.   Sounds 
like all your events will be fun.  I'm counting on your helping me with my 
parties, too!
Sounds like this week is busy, but I'm around next weekend.  We'll figure it 
out this week.  No message yesterday, so I rescheduled it for late afternoon 
today, can wait.  

Later--Jeff

this was the wierdest book I have ever read.  It was called The Story of O, 
and it about this sex cult in Paris and it totally freaked me out.  I am glad 
that it is over.  I started another one last night that is a little bit 
lighter.  Three generations of Jewish women in the south kind of thing.  tell 
me if yours is good.  I haven't read it.  I am going to the chronicle book 
dinner on sunday and I am totally psyched.  if you want me to get any of the 
books signed for you let me know.  Ted Coppel will be there with his new 
book.  I am running out so leave me a message if you want it.  Have a great 
weekend!  I am bummed you can't make next thursday, so we will have to plan 
something fun soon.

Everything was ok, just busy.  Good book?  I just started "When the sons of 
heaven meet the daughters of earth"  have you heard of it?  I'd absolutely 
love to go the the Anne Frank thing, but I can't get back from the management 
conference.  I'm on a panel (with Jeremy) early Friday a.m.

they must make you sign a confidentiality agreement when you walk in the

juicy details would be kind of fun!  
Her piano was so bad they had to do it twice.  At least I got to finish a 
book.

ok...so I do want the low-down on last night b/c I am sure there is a lot 
that is inappropriate for email!  I will be out of the office all afternoon 
so if you want to talk I'll be on my cell phone 256-5582.
Big....small....it is still the Enron Executive Committee and you should feel 
extremely proud.  I am so happy for you!
I hope that you have a great lunch and that your speech went will this 
morning.

Great!  Sorry YOU weren't there...
I'm on my way out  for a lunch.  I'll call you later.   (I'm excited about 
the exec committee, but it is a little big, so I told Skilling we should 
rename it the exec villiage!)
