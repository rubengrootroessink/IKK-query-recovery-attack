Draft:

We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets:

Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new 
finance origination activities.  In this role, he will work with all 
commodity products, assets,  and teams and lever our existing businesses with 
new this new focus.  (Do you want to put in his background--which you 
probably now more than I?)  He will be reporting to the Office of the 
Chairman.

Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick 
Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG 
markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.  (Do you want to put in 
his background?)  Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket 
relationships and  industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project 
Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.  Eric 
and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman.  

Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all 
products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet 
pages exist today.  Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination 
group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial 
interface for our intranet page.  Heather was with Azurix, where she worked 
on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives. 

Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.  This group will be 
comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management 
businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics 
important to their individual markets, and discuss other  markets in a macro 
sense.  We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.  In this 
group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability 
will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a 
bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group will not be involved in 
customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.   Gary will 
manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, 
Equity, and Agriculture initiatives. 

(anything else?)
