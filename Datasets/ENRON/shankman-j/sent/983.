Will discuss this with Clay to get a better idea of his perceived workload.  
In the interim, we will follow up with Andrew to let him know that we will 
probably have a spot for him in the Enron organization so that he doesn't 
slip off the hook

Jeff,

I don't know if I'm going to get to meet Andrew, but he looks good on paper.  
My only question is whether we need another person working on LNG in Dubai.  
Obviously, I don't know quite what structure you want to put in place, and 
perhaps there are some projects I'm not aware of, but from what I've seen I 
would be worried that this guy would get bored. 

Just a thought, but looking at this guy's resume he'd be an ideal guy to work 
with Jonathan Whitehead and Joe Hirl in Tokyo.  He speaks fluent Japanese, 
knows the Japanese market, has contacts at Mitsubishi, and knows the LNG 
world.  Quite frankly, he might do more good for Enron's LNG effort working 
for Enron Japan than for LNG.

Also, regarding Elba Island, do you think you'd be ready for a conference 
call on Monday?

Thanks,
Brad
