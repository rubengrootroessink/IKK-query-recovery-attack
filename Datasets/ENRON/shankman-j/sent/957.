Please reserve Thursday, October 19, 2000 from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. to=20
participate in our third  annual oil spill training program.  Some of you=
=20
were part of the task force that helped to design the Oil Spill Crisis=20
Management Plan, and it is well recognized that periodic training is an=20
essential part of implementing the Plan.  The training program (8:30 a.m. -=

noon) and a brief tabletop exercise (1:00 p.m.- 3:00 p.m.) are being design=
ed=20
by ENA Legal and Enron Global Markets Commercial Support (Scott Earnest and=
=20
Kevin Sweeney), and our oil spill consultant, Robert J. Meyers and=20
Associates, Inc. Typically, these types of programs run for 3 or 4 days, bu=
t=20
we have condensed the curriculum so that we can get sufficiently trained in=
=20
3/4's of a day.  We believe that this intensive training effort will give u=
s=20
all a chance to learn more about the Plan and the role that each of us are=
=20
assigned.  The company=01,s success in dealing with a future spill crisis w=
ill=20
depend on how well we are prepared to perform in such circumstances.

The training is scheduled to occur in Houston in the Enron Building in Room=
=20
49C1.  If any other person in your group should be included in this program=
,=20
please let Nony Flores know at ext. 37541 and we will add them to the list.=

A full copy of the Plan will be distributed during training. =20
