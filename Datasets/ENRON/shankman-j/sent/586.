Subject: Participation in Houston Analyst Meeting People Video

You have been nominated to participate in a video which will be shown during 
the Houston analyst meeting. The objective of the video is to demonstrate the 
depth, diversity and transferability of Enron people. The video will be shown 
early in the day's presentations and will also help set up the theme for the 
day which is Execute and Extend.

I am attaching a briefing note which outlines the questions that we would 
like you to answer on video. In addition I would be grateful if you could 
supply me with a map of your career - ie a list of all the business units and 
associated groups in which you have held positions at  Enron.   

Laura Valencia  - Houston ( Ext 3-6785)  or Fiona Grant - London (Ext 5308)  
will be calling you to  schedule a specific date and time for the shoot.

Many thanks for your help with this video.
If you have any questions please call me on 3-4785.   

Kathryn
