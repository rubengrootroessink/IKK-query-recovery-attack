As we begin our summer recruitment process, it is crucial that we continue to 
be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates.  As you know, Enron has 
committed over $1million during the next four years to University of 
Pennsylvania, and Wharton..  I want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in 
getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number 
of summer employees.  I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for 
the summer.  In fact, I'd like to be as aggressive as possible.  I am 
operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have 
positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs.  I will not accept the 
notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.

In addition, I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift 
certificates is viewed as good one.  I'm not sure that is a good use of 
Enron's dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for 
the sell weekends.
