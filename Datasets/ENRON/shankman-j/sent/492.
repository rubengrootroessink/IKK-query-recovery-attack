Subject: Potential 4th Qtr. Write-offs

Attached is a revised 4th Qtr. outlook schedule with potential write-offs 
included as discussed this morning.  We will be verifying these amounts over 
the next few days and I will let you know if there are any changes.  Let me 
know if you have any questions or comments
