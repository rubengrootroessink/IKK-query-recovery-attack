Lets at least try to participate somehow in Sales and Trading--but I will 
leave this up to you.  

Thanks for all of your help.

Please see attached for our sponsorship form.  Can you let me know ASAP which 
panel we are on - I think we would be a great contributer to either the Sales 
and Trading or Corporate Finance panels.  Looking forward to a great 
conference.
