Thanks for the email.  Can you fax or email a  resume to me.  After I review, 
I'll reply with more info.

Dear Mr. Shankman,
     I obtained your name from the Penn Alum Network.  Sorry if this email is 
a bit long.  I came across a listing for a position with Enron in NY and am 
highly interested in applying for it. But, I would like to ask your advice 
regarding the approach I should take.
     When I was an undergraduate at Penn (Wharton & CAS), I started my own 
fertilizer trading company.  With zero capital and zero contacts in the 
industry, I built up a company with $ 15 mil in revenues and clients all over 
the world.  I personally developed relationships with clients like ConAgra, 
Transammonia, Mitsui and numerous others in Latin America and Europe.  
     Six years ago, outside factors forced me to join my family business, 
which is in the entertainment industry.  Now, I am at a point where I can, 
and want, to return to what I originally did.  The Enron position describes 
the exact objectives I faced in developing my own company - selling to large 
commercial and industrial customers.  That is exactly what I did and did 
well.  But, I am afraid that if I send my resume to the Human Resource dept.  
they will overlook my early experience and will be confused why a Broadway 
producer is applying for the job.
     Do you happen to have any suggestions ?  Perhaps you might know someone 
in the New York office that I can meet with.  I am very interested in working 
for Enron and know that I posses the right skills.  I would greatly 
appreciate your advice.
Thank you,
Rina Kirshner
