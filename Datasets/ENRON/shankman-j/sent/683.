You are correct, JBLOCK got longer 495K barrels.  However, crude is a huge=

hedge component on this deal and net crude position for Liquids is short.
As you can see on the Component VaR graph, with the short position in crude=

it is eating up most of Agg-Liquids VaR.  Therefore, putting on any long=20
position in products (this includes LPG's) would act as a hedge. =20

JBlock does take up some of the VaR for Agg-Liquids; however, it is not a=

contributor of VaR violation for effective date Nov. 6.  As matter of fact,=

the VaR for JBlock went down.  The component VaR graph below shows that=20
heating oil was a hedge but no longer as of yesterday.  Gasoil is still a=

hedge for Agg-Liquids but the hedge is reduced.   =20

The violation was due to heating and gasoil going shorter by 939K barrels. =
