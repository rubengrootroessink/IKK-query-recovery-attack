Jeff,

Where does Tom Piazze work (Enron)?  Or is he a contact at the school.  There 
is a Tara Piazze in the phone directory.

ask him what he thinks

Looks like they've got good participation from IBs.  The fact that they are 
having it at one of the most expensive places in the city leads me to believe 
that they are putting a lot of effort into strong attendance and putting 
together a good conference.  Of course that is also why sponsorship is so 
expensive.  Do you want me to take care of signing us up?  Jeff, any ideas 
for panelists?

Hi Michele

thanks for getting back to me with regards to the finance conference.
I am in the process of collecting the committed speaker list. Just
wanted to give you a flavor for kind of people that we are targeting.

The major committed sponsors so far are some of the top investment banks
(Chase, Merrill
Goldman, MSDW) and we are lining up the either heads of investment banking,
asset management or some well know research analysts from these firms to
adress the panelists and the conference attendees.

I will have specific names for you in a couple of days are we are still in
the
process of confirming speakers.

The conference will be at the Park Hyatt in Center City along with the
Bullish
on Finance reception the previous day.

This conference will be a good platform for Enron to talk about its unique
position in trading and can utilize the Sales and Trading panel to expose
the
students and the conference attendees to Enrons capabilities and the firm in
general.

I will provide you with more information in the coming days and I sincerely
hope
you will choose to sponsor one of the panels and have a strong presence at
the finance conference this year.

Regards
Suresh
