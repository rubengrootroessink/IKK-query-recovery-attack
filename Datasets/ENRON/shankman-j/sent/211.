No problem about the book!  I'm sure it's a fun chew toy.  So it sounds like 
school is keeping you busy.  Let me know when you want to talk to my friend 
at Continental. 
I'm so tired from work--I'm going to watch a couple of movies tonight at 
home--the media room is all done with carpet, etc.  If you want to come over 
and watch movies and maybe eat that would be great.  Tomorrow I have friends 
in from out to town, a dinner on sunday for work, and I may be in London most 
of next week...

let me borrow.  He tore one page.  I had to put him in time-out.  He's really 
sorry!
