Jeff,

After speaking with Gayla about the message below,  you were listed as Brad's 
supervisor.

Eric,

Please call Gayla to set up a time to meet with Fred Kelly regarding Brad

Subject: Final Associate/analyst 2000 PRC - Fred Kelly

I have tried to reach all of you by phone or left a voice mail to schedule an 
appointment with Fred Kelly before the final PRC on Dec. 13.  He feels it is 
very important that he meet with you and your supervisor before Dec 13.  
Please call me at X66157 to schedule a time .  Attached is a "cheat sheet" 
that Fred would like you to fill out and email or bring to him.

If you have already set up a meeting please disregard this email.

Thank you.
