They are looking at trading advertising time.  Ed Ondarza may be the guy.  
I'd be happy to introduce you to him, if you'd like.

okay-i have a question-have you heard anything about a new group in Broadband 
that will be trading commercial air time?
I believe it involves Edward Andarza and some other guy named Ben Freeman. I 
thought it might be of interest to someone with 
a communications background, that purchased television air time.....

thanks-Kim
