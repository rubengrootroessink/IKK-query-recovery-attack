According to sources, funds are being told this morning that OPEC is likely 
to cut production by 800,000 - 1 million b/d in Q1 2001, no later than the 
end of February.  Most likely scenario as of now is that OPEC will hold an 
extraordinary meeting in February to make the decision.  In the unlikely 
event that prices continue to slide significantly, the decision might be 
moved up to the January 17 meeting.
