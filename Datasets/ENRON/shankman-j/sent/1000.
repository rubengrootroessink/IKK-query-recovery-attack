Eric thought you might want to see this.  Obviously Brad can tell you more if 
you are interested.

Merritt,

Call me to hear the latest about the Northwest Shelf deal.  V V  left me a 
message saying that he would still let us "work on the pricing, structuring 
side", but that he's been kicking his bid around with Wayne, Clay and Rick 
and they're going to put together their own idea.  Gee, are you getting the 
impression that they don't get it?  They seem to want to go long on 
Australian cargoes by bidding at a price that would only make economic sense 
if it goes into India.  They're not going to go through us to get there.  
They didn't comprehend that to take a long position means that you are 
putting that position in a book.  I'm going to lose it.
