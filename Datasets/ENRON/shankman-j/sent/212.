As we continue with the India LNG issues, and grow the fundamentals research 
capabilities, I need a "map of the world" showing all LNG producers, and the 
specs of the product they produce, and all of the receiving terminals (demand 
side) in the world that match up with those specs of the producers.  (In a 
nutshell, what can go where)  Can I get this ASAP?  

Thanks  

Jeff
