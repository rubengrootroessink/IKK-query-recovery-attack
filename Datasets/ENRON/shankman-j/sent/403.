Charles - Potential candidate for Donahue, Dietrich or EIM.  Johnny - See if 
there is anything in EGM that would be a fit.  Ted

Ted,
This is the resume of someone I know socially (through Houston Ballet Guild) 
who happens to work for Azurix.  He, like so many others over there, really 
would like to explore opportunities at Enron.  He has a very strong resume 
and is someone I think we should really take a look at.  He realizes he may 
have to take a step down to make the transition.  Who would you suggest we 
forward him to?

Thanks,
Amy
