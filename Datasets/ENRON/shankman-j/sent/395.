Larry Gagliardi has been with us for 6 months marketing EOL crude/products 
for 6 months and has signed up well over 50 customers according to Nowlan.  
He came from the crude and products broker TCT and knows the traders in the 
business.  He's our guy, and I want to expand his role in the group, as well.
