anything in your world.  Jeff

Visited with a ship owner this week who has 2 vessel's they are looking at 
taking ownership and would like us to work with them on a 5 year time 
charter. Both vessels are clean products vessels and we can go over the 
opportunity in more detail. My questions, are this something 1) we are 
looking to pursue? 2) is it being coordinated at some level? The opportunity 
we are looking at would have some MTM value and some forward risk but the 
vessels do handle all the products we trade so we can keep the active and we 
also could use the space to market online. I like the structure and believe 
it is worth a good look.
