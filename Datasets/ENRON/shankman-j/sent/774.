Jeff,

The LNG group currently has 4 development engineers where their reporting was 
previously into Haug.  I was wondering if within EGM, we had any other 
engineers that we could group these resources with in terms of reporting.  

If not, I would suggest that we make the most senior one group lead (Dave 
Glessner) and have them report directly to you or Mike.  Although these guys 
are currently focused on LNG activities, I know from experience with a couple 
of them they also have generalists capabilities.  In Europe, Brian Stanley 
leads this develop engineering effort where he represents the owner (Enron 
Europe).  He has dual reporting into Sherriff and Larry Reynolds (one of 
Izzo's guys).  

If you could come back to me on this quickly it would be very helpful as this 
is the last thing we need to finalise in our group structure.

Thanks
Eric

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.
