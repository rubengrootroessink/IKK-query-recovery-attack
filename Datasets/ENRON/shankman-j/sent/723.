Can we try and get these LNG guys on 29 when we move Nowlan's group????  I 
think there are about 15 of them.

Jennifer,

Could you please co-ordinate with Brenda Johnston (Rick's Houston assistant) 
to help facilitate the move of the LNG group to the Enron Building.  I 
appreciate your help on this issue.  Send me note when you are able to 
confirm timing etc.

Thanks
Eric
