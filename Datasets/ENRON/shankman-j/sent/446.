Hi Hillary, hope you are well.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it 
tomorrow.  I just couldn't work out the schedule, but it was extremely 
thoughtful of you to invite me.  I hope you have a great time.....(I'll send 
something to Ben in the gallery tomorrow)...

Best,

Jeff

Jeff,
It was a pleasure meeting you on Saturday evening.  I hope that you will be
able to join us for Ben's 30th celebration.  I would love to send you an
official invitation so if you wouldn't mind sending your address to me via
this email I'd be happy to send you all of the details.
Saturday, December 16th at 8:45pm at Gonzales y Gonzales, dinner and
dancing.
If you can make it let me know.
Thanks,
Hillary
