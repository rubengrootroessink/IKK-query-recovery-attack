Hi John

Things are heating up for year end keeping us all pretty busy.  As we go 
forward in many of our businesses, it's clear several need fine tuning.  One 
of which is weather worldwide.  Mark Tawney and I have spent quite a bit of 
time during the last several weeks working on a plan for next year and 
forward.  We've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add 
a London operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer 
interaction, immediate scalability, and more portfolio diversification.  I 
would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that 
portion of the operation, and continue to have Thor manage Scandinavia.  Mark 
and I will get together to structure the London based group and keep you 
advised.  

Mark has some great ideas, and I'd like to talk to you about this rather than 
go on in an email.  I'll give you a ring first thing in the morning.  

Best--

Jeff
