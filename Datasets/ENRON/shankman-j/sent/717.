Jeff,

Attached is a calendar of events for the whole year at Wharton.  I faxed an 
updated version to Jennifer yesterday.  Call if you have any questions.

Here's my stab at a calendar of events.  We can try to fill in the gaps when 
we sit down.  What time is good for you tomorrow?  I'm free other than lunch 
and after 4pm.
