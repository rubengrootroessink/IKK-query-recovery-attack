FYI

Today EnronCredit completed a deal for Cargill.  Cargill sold to us a 1yr 
Bankruptcy Swap on Farmland credit .
Two months ago, European Freight traders completed financial freight trades 
with grain cargos originating in 
the states for EU and Japanese destinations (Cargill, Dreyfus).  Over the 
past two months, MG Structured Finance 
(NY) has been working on an export finance deal with ConAgra for grains of 
South American origin (US destination 
presumably).  Continuing client discussions continue to surface more than a 
passing interest for weather products 
in the softs (and other agricultural markets from previous discussions).
