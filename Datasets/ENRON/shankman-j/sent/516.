Subject: Equity Group Presentation

Gentlemen,

 The meeting today with our equity traders should be an informal discussion.  
My intention is to encourage you to get to know them, to educate you about 
how they run their separate businesses and to discuss future prospects of the 
fund.  Although we will be touching on some heavy topics, such as accepting 
third party money, the tone of the meeting should be relaxed, informative and 
a good debate.  I will be sending you a presentation shortly.

Thanks,

Gary
