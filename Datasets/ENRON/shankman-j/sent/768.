Subject: Help Improve ENA's, EGM's and EIM's Participation in The Pulse!

The opportunity to provide feedback via The Pulse ends on Friday, October 27 
and we need your help to improve our participation rate.  I have attached the 
latest figures below, but in a nutshell, only 52.76% of our employees have 
participated, which is below the company average.

We would like to do a lot better.

Here are the business unit participation rates:

EES   90.63%
Enron India  85.71%
Enron Wind  81.85%
Net Works  71.35%
EE&CC   66.67%
NEPCO   59.95%
Corporate  58.74%
Enron South America 58.24%

COMPANY AVERAGE 54.64%

ENA/EGM/EIM  52.76%
ETS (formerly GPG) 49.59%
Enron Europe  39.95%
EBS   39.07%
APACHI  26.90%

On behalf of Mark Frevert, I would like to ask each of you to personally 
encourage your direct reports to log on to the system at survey.enron.com and 
provide the much needed feedback.  Whether you send an e-mail, use a staff 
meeting or walk around to your employees' desks, we need you to let them know 
that the survey is important to Enron and we would appreciate their 
feedback.  While many fear some sort of response tracking, please remind them 
that their responses are completely confidential.

If you have any questions, please call me at ext. 3-9053.
