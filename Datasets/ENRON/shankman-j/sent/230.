No, I don't have that CD.  Can I crank it up so loud in my house, and piss 
off the neighbors?  I was out til about 11:30 last night.  (another two shift 
evening).  I'm pretty close  to the point where I can't drink after 10 ish on 
a school night.  Then, my neighbors house alarm went off for over 1/2 hour at 
2:30.  Of course i called the police.  So i didn't wag my butt out of bed til 
7:30.  
So first party may be feb 24.  any thoughts?
I'd forward an email that has gone around a few times about your dad's girly 
friend, only then letting her know she's invited.  maybe tell her the wrong 
time.

When are you off to san fran?  I have a wallet i'm trying to have made out 
there at some stuffy, but cool store off union square.

how are you?  do you have the Dido CD?  if not, I am going to get it for 
you.  I love it.  Beth called, and I am going to get the Palm.  She wanted me 
to get the Blackberry, which is the new awesome one, but of course it doesn't 
work on the Enron system.  
my dad just called and yelled at me again that he wants his bitch invited to 
my sister's shower.  he swore that she would not go, so the whole thing is so 
stupid.  I am out of invites.  can I send her an email about it?  this is the 
last thing that I have time to worry about.  

what is going on with you?  I am sure that you have another crazy day.  write 
back when you can!
