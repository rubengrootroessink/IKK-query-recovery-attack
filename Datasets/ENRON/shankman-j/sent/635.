Joe Sutton is gone so now you are going to have to play fair and per the 
contract. I have tried on numerous occasions to resolve this issue with you 
and Dan Rogers and you have stonewalled me every time. I would be glad to 
talk about it in San Antonio, but you are not going to dictate the terms of 
the transition of the DPC FMA.

Doug Leach call me  this morning and told me that the offer that he made to 
the LNG group 6 months ago is now off the table. He said that this has also 
been transmitted to Mike McConnell in writing. His reason was that he had 
bent over backwards to make the proposal originally and the LNG group has 
been slow to respond. I reminded him that we were delayed in getting back 
because of some legal issues but now that we were all part of EGM that this 
was no longer an issue. He went on to say that he will not turn over any of 
the fees until phase 2 kicks in, some time next year (Marc de La Roche said 
something to me the other day about Jan.01). That the LNG group will have to 
bear all expenses until that time just like EFI had to for liquid fuels. He 
did say that in their case India did reimburse them on their previous 
expenses as a reduction/credit to the fee. He also went on to say that he was 
not happy with India's attempt to get a piece of EFI's fee.
Please advise how you would like me to proceed.
