Mike/Jeff,

I met with Jim Bernhard, Chairman, President and CEO of the Shaw Group, who 
owns Stone & Webster (see below) on Monday and he gave his blessing to move 
forward asap with a crude supply and/or product off take JV at the Orion 
refinery in Norco, La. I am going to NYC in early November to meet with First 
Boston and see how real this opportunity could be and whether we want to 
enter into an MOU with Shaw. I have been keeping Larry Lawyer advised and he 
is willing to help the process any way possible. 

Doug

Larry,

I am working with Stone & Webster, a large EPC company who wants Enron Global 
Fuels to work with them regarding the crude oil supply and refined products 
offtake at a refinery in Norco, La. This is a 200,000 barrel per day refinery 
capable of using heavy crude oil and has a 75,000 barrel a day coker unit. 
They own a 12.5% interest in the Orion refinery (formerly called Goodhope) 
and Credit Suisse and First Boston own a combined 68% equity share. Jack 
Stanley, who was involved in this refinery in the past has no current or 
future ownership or involvement in the refinery. I told S&W that it was a 
prerequisite that Mr. Stanley not be involved in any way before I would send 
them a standard ENA confidentiality agreement and start preliminary 
discussions about our role with the refinery. So far they have neither 
offered, nor asked Enron for any equity involvement, but rather are focused 
on us proposing physical liquid fuels and risk management structures. 

I am waiting for S&W to schedule a meeting in Baton Rouge with their top 
management to discuss their plans and how we can assist. Hopefully, this will 
lead to something tangible and I will bring you into the picture so we can do 
some kind of financial structure or equity along with, or in lieu of, the 
supply/offtake angle. I realize refineries have been a non-starter with Mr. 
Skilling, but with good crack spreads and new management within EGM maybe 
there is a possibility here. 

Please keep this very confidential. 

Regards,
Doug
