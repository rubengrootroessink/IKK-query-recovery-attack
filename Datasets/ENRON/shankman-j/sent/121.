Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the 
gas trading h.r. people with respect to robin menear.  she was listed as 
commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a 
commercial manager.  Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though 
this was a problem at mid year as well.   Of course he told me it had been 
taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over 
her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.  he too was involved in 
the hiring decision.

Shall i do brad's termination, or will you.
