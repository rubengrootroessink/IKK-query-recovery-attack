The V@R violation memo should state that the reason we had a violation was 
the additional trading positions relating to the EOL 24 hr. trading 
activity.  There is currently a memo requesting an additional $2mm of V@R on 
Greg Whalley's desk.  This addtional V@R will be temporary until there are 
Board approved limits for these trading positions.  

Scott
