Any time you'd like to get here.  I'll be happy to set you up with a strong 
schedule.  
I'm glad you finally met Per.  He's been a little busy since I reorg'd the 
group and put him in charge.  Thanks for your patience, however.  

Jeff

Jeff,
Finally spoke to Per yesterday and we agreed to have lunch on the 26th (he's
in Houston this week and on vacation next week).  Any thoughts on my getting
down to Houston?  Hope you are well.
Nat

Hi, thanks for the update.  Per was in Houston last week,  and I've asked
him to get with you soon.  Please call him (he should be expecting your
call) at our office in NY at.   212-702-3910.  Would you also like to come
to houston for a visit and interview?   Jeff

Jeff,
Quick update.  I called Jeff to see if is going to be in NY next week, his
sec. said that he's out of the office today and apparently not scheduled to
be in NY next week.  I am hoping that we will talk soon.  No call for Per
(sp?) in the NY office.  Hope you are well,
Nat

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat
