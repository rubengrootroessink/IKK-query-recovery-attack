Subject: Eric Gonzales

I was researching something on Eric and noticed that he is assigned to the 
expat payroll which I think is correct.  He is also assigned to EEL, John 
Sheriff which I think is incorrect. 

I have asked Kim to leave him on the expat payroll, but pointing 
organizationally to you and McConnell in EGM rather than Sheriff in EEL -- 
correct?
