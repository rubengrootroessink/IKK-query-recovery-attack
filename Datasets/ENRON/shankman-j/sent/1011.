I'm not sure that thor understands dollars flowing with risk.  What should we 
do with him?

fyi - it doesn't sound like the weather piece of the Oslo long-term deals is 
going to have much value.  We are still trying to get that value from Oslo 
and ensure that the weather risk is captured appropriately in EGM risk 
books.  I will keep you updated.

This deal was done as a Power game and when we split it, the main value will 
be on the power book, so don't calc on anything substantial on this

Thor - We are going to meet with Jeff Shankman on Thursday to discuss 3rd 
Quarter earnings.  If we can get an idea by then of the value associated with 
the weather piece of the Kotka deal it would be helpful.  Call me if you have 
any concerns regarding this request.  Thanks for your help.

We haven't finalised the strip out of the remaining weather risk from the 
power book, but we will surely send that over as soon as we have done it

Bjarne and Thor,

Thanks for the confirmation and other information that you provided on this 
deal.  I still need the associated P&L and Weather Risk transferred from the 
Nordic Power books to the Weather book.

It is imperative that this be done immediately from a Risk controls 
standpoint not to mention the fact that Quarter-end is fast approaching.  
Please call or e-mail so as to update me of your progress.


Thanks,
Todd
