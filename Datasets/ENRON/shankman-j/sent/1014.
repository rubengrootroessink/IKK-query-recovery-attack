Subject: systems developments in london

we are working with the systems development group here in london to create 
for the global products trading group a curve spreadsheet and options
calculator (can do cracks spreads and asian options).  the aim is that we can 
have a central site that is accessible to other groups and all 
traders/marketers in this group to facilitate our ability to service customer 
business.  brian hudson is the person who developed this system for the gas 
and power groups here in europe and has been recommened to us by steven 
leppard who heads the IT research department.   Without going into the 
systems history story here I think we are inadequately prepared on this side 
and need to strengthen in this area.  We understand from Steve that in order 
for them to dedicate the resources required for what we are asking they would 
like to take on an additional person that would be partly for our and the 
coal group's acct.  Steve can keep this individual busy with other projects 
so it would not be a full time expense for Global Products.  our excel 
spreadsheets methodology is not stable enough given the increasing 
unreliability of the London servers which keep falling over and thus the 
traders without any pricing tools.  This is what brought about our 
discussions with the IT department to try and improve the present system.
