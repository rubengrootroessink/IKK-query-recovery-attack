Please call him.  I'd be happy to spend time talking to them about the info 
below if that is what they want.

J, I don't have any additional information other than what is in the quote 
below.  I can call Mr. Barlett or if you are not adverse to Chris calling you 
directly, I will give him your number.

Let me know...

Cindy

Good afternoon Jeff,

Cindy Olson referred me to you, suggesting that you would have the 
information mentioned below.  Enron University Affairs, Ken Lay, Jeff 
Skilling, Andy Fastow and Gene Humphrey have been working with Harvard 
Business School, specifically Chris Bartlett and Meg Wozny of Harvard, on a 
case study of Enron.  This study is in its last phase and the only 
'roadblock' is gathering additional information.  In particular, Harvard 
would like information on the 'size and growth of the risk management group'. 
 

This information will help facilitate drawing an effective comparison of the 
'old' Enron and the 'new' Enron.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey
University Affairs
Enron Corp.
