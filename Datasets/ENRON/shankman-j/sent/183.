Jeff:

 During my assessment of your machine, I noted your current hardware 
configuration:
SP750 with Dual 800Mhz PIII processors
512MB RAM
Matrox Quad video card

We currently do not have hardware in stock that matches these 
specifications.  Our current practice is to prepare a machine that is like or 
better than the machine the customer has currently, then swap that hardware.  
The benefits here are minimal downtime and the ability to switch back to the 
old machine quickly if an application does not work correctly in Windows 
2000.  Because we do not have a machine of equal or greater speed in stock, 
here is what I propose:

Every machine we migrate is Ghosted.  By this, I mean we run a program called 
Ghost which takes a snapshot of the machine in its current state.  This image 
can then be put back on the machine or accessed to retrieve files or other 
data.  I propose we Ghost your existing machine, make a backup copy of that 
image (after verifying it works correctly), then re-use your current hardware 
with Windows 2000.  The risk here is that we cannot go back to Windows NT 
(your current system) as quickly if something does not work.  

If you would like to move ahead with this plan, please let me know.  
Otherwise, we will order a machine with the same specifications, but it will 
take some time to get here.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
