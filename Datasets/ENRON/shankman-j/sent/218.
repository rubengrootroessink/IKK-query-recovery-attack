If you've had a corp fin class about int rates, bonds, etc, I'd take the 
Funding Investments class.  
Have a great weekend.

Hi Jeff-
Hope things are well with you.  Classes started here this week and I'm
still getting my schedule straigtened out.  Fortunately, I got into the
Speculative Markets course.  However, I still need to choose a second
finance class.

I have until friday at 3 PM EST to choose between FIXED INCOME (dealing
primarily with bond replication, fairly quantitative) and FUNDING
INVESTMENTS (a broad examination of how firms finance investment with
corporate securities).

Which of the two do you think would help me out the most at Enron Global
Markets?  Sorry for the short notice, but I just won the course permit
tonight!

Thanks,
Matthew
