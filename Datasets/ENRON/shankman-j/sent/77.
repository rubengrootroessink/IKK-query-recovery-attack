Philippe, this has been going on for a while.  Can you address this right 
away?  Thanks.   Jeff

Can't get bigger with lousy IT support in London.  This has been an issue for 
some time.  Lot's of people look concerned -but not too much improvement.

as usual we were the first group in london to spot that the enron server in 
houston was having some problems and a big back log of messages (for good 
reasons as we were anxiously awaiting  an incoming message which never came 
on one of our ship which is in a delicate situation).
why on earth is it that we don t get a warning that there is a problem so 
that we can tell our customers, suppliers to use direct fax line s or other 
means of communications  . in this instance the long awaited message was 
worth 60 000 usd but could have been much more .
