Subject: Opportunities in Japan


Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Christopher Handte
