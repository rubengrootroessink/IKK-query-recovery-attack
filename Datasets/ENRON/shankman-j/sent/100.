Jeff, I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders 
for some of your transportation work.  Please do not go directly to the 
traders, rather the structuring desk.  Also, please coordinate your activites 
with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and 
rail issues.  We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of 
the customers you've pitched.  In most cases, we have been covering many of 
these customers from the energy side already.

Thanks for your cooperation

Jeff
