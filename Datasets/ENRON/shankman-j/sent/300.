I just spoke to my sister and she goes to the doctor on monday.  the baby's 
heart is the size of a poppy seed, and the baby is the size of a bean.  she 
and josh are calling it their "beanie baby."  isn't that cute?

maybe we can go to a fun dinner and blow off some steam.

I think my head spun, then exploded.  Ditto on the busy part!  Trying to get 
Max and Chloe ready for their departure Friday, meeting with contractors, and 
work.  OY.
