Hi Jeff:
?
Hope you're doing great, everything is pointing  towards your company making 
more money than the rest of the Dow combined this  year!!!!
?
We have two open invoices for you, which I've  attached for your 
convenience.? We also have a lot of bills to pay.?  Can you take care of 
these please?? Thank you in advance.
?
I know you wanted to send back the Rousseau hanger  and the Galle mushroom 
ceramic.? I spoke with my Dad, and he said it's ok  to send it back to us to 
sell for you.
?
We want to ship you all the fabulous objects you've  acquired here, when can 
we do that?
?
How's your new home?
?
Ben
