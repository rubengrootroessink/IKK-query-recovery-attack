Dear Larry,

Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday.  
Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add 
even more value as we explore your basis risks.  I've asked Mark Tawney, 
Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly 
linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities.  
His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge 
research.  

We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but 
I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate 
relationship.  If there is anything else I can do, please call. 

It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier.  
Again thanks for your time.

Regards,
