What do you think of this:

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering most of 
the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross 
commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and 
promote aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in room 3321.
