Subject: Int'l Coal & Freight - Stats for Dec '00


A brief summary of stats from the month of December.  Volumes were off a bit 
from November, reflective of the seriousness with which members of the 
coal/shipping community take the holiday season - however, exponential growth 
from summer period continues.  This has exacerbated systems and back office 
problems we have been having for the past year, thus internal focus during Q1 
will be on this issue.
