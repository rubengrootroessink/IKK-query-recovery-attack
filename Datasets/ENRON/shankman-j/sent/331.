Shanna, Cindy;

Tracee is an ESA associate who is ready to promote out of the program into a 
manager level position.  Could you take a look at her resume for potential 
opportunities within EGM/EIM?  Thank you.

Janie,

Per our telephone conversation, I am attaching my resume for your review. As 
we discussed, I am seeking a permanent (Manager level) position where my 
finance and origination skills would be best leveraged.  I am very interested 
in a role in financing and/or orginating energy deals - wholesale or retail.  
If you or one of the groups interested in interviewing me require a 
reference, please contact my current supervisor, Rob Gay, or current and 
former colleagues Peter Anderson and Greg Blair, respectively. 

Thanks again for your help and advice.

Regards,
Tracee
