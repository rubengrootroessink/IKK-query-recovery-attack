Dear Naomi,

Thanks for the opportunity to work with you on my new home.  I've enclosed a 
virtual tour disk (just follow the prompts), and some floor plans from my 
architect.  If there is anything else you need, please call anytime.  I'm 
excited for you to see the house in person, and have the chance to discover 
my passion for 20th century design.  Dennis and Daniel have been a great 
source of the best objects and knowledge.  Of course it is a primary concern 
to make sure the home, the objects, the furnishings, and the space work 
together.

Dennis and Daniel speak very highly of you and it is important to me that I 
have the help to complete this project with great attention, and all that 
results from that attention.

Best Regards,



Jeff
