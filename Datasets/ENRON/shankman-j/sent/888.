Did you have any doubt that the best logistics school is  Wharton?  (I think 
they call it transportation sciences, no really).  I'll call up there this 
morn and get back with you....

I spoke with Geoff Pollock (Stacey Rosen's cousin) who is the logistics mgr 
at Frigidaire.  He's helping me identify candidates for the transportation 
group.  He said that the best Logistics school is Wharton.  Can you help me 
get into their placement office.  Do they have alumni job boards?

Thanks,

Dan
