In light of the forthcoming analyst presentations, the following may be of 
interest:  

We submitted an award application to AsiaRisk Magazine (A Risk magazine 
publication) on 15 September nominating Enron for our innovative Online 
weather derivatives trading in the region.

We have received advice from AsiaRisk Editor, Ellen Leander, Enron has won 
Energy/Commodity House of the Year Award for the Asia region.  This will be 
published in their November issue.  We are awaiting final written 
confirmation beyond the email below.
