Yes, I think it would be a great experience, and I'd encourage you to 
continue to meet as many people as possible in the organization.  Jeff

Jeff,
I have talked to Geoff Storey and he told me that rotating early should not 
be a problem. I will also talk to Hunter asap. Thank you for offering to talk 
to Steve Horn; I would greatly appreciate it. I will meet with him on Friday 
morning. 
Could I also ask you for your general opinion on this rotation  and whether 
you see it as a good experience?

Thanks for everything
Massimo
