Jeff,

I visited the Networks-sponsored Houston Technology Center and had a chance 
to interview with all the people working there. I believe that a rotation 
there could give me the opportunity to learn a great deal about the 
entrepreneurial/technology circles and at the same be a good tie-back to 
enron for my third stage. I would appreciate any suggestions or comments you 
might have. Again, thank you for your help.

Massimo
