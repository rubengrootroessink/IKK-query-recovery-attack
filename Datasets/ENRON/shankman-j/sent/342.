Unfortunately I cannot be there.  What about Grey Whalley?  (Even though he 
is Stanford)

Jeff-

As you know, Enron has been working diligently to further its relationship 
with Wharton.  We have recently been asked and have committed to provide a 
speaker for the Wharton Fellows in e-Business conference on the morning of 
January 11th in the San Francisco area.  

We are, of course, in need of a high level speaker from Enron who can speak 
with expertise to the topic of Enron's evolution as a company (from gas 
pipelines to financial products and beyond).  

Are you available?  A Wharton grad with your background would be a stand-out 
contribution to the program.  

I have more detailed information regarding the program and the attendees for 
your review.  Please let me know if you can fit this into your schedule.

Thanks.

Mike
