Mr. Shankman,

I apologize for any inconvenience, however I just found out that Mrs. Fastow 
was aware that you guys would be unavailable.  There is also an artist from 
Spain in attendance, therefore the meeting will still be held in your 
absence.  I am assuming meeting notes will be provided for you at a later 
date.

Regards-Tiko
