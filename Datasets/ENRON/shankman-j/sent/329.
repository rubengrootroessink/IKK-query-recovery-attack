Thank you for expressing interest in investing in C.E. Unterberg, Towbin
Communications Fund, L.P. (COMM) whose portfolio manager is Amanda
Macklowe.
We have been conducting monthly openings since the fund's inception.

We will allow monthly contributions into the fund on December 1, 2000 and
January 1, 2001.  After that, subscriptions will be quarterly as per the
Limited Partnership Agreement.

To date we have raised $12 million.  Despite the challenging market we have
experienced over the past few months, COMM had returned approximately 4.2%
through the end of October.  November continues along this trend.

If you are interested, please respond to this e-mail or you may give me a
call at
(212) 389-8027.

We thank you for your attention and wish you a joyous upcoming holiday
season.
