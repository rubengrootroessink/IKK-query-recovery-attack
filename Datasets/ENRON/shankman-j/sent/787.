I have forwarded your resume to John Lavorato, who runs gas and power.  
Thanks.  Jeff

Jeff,

Occidental and I have developed significant philosophical differences on how
to run our gas and liquids business.  I am committed to making a career
change shortly after the first of the year.  I know that you are busy, but I
would appreciate you taking a brief look at my resume and giving me a heads
up on the best way to approach Enron.  Thanks.

Alan Batt
