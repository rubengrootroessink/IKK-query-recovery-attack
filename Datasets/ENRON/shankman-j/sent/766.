Hi Michele

I am writing to confirm that Enron will be participating in the
Sales/Trading
panel.

I have some great news. We have decided to give Enron the Sponsorship
spot for the Sales and Trading panel.


Key benifits of being a Panel Sponsor

- A big Enron Banner can be displayed indicating that you are the official
sponsor of the entire Sales/Trading panel
- Mention in the program guide and all other conference material
- In addition to the panelist spot on the Sales/Trading panel, Enron
gets to open the panel session with a 15-20min presentation on general
trends in the sales and trading industry, an excellent opportunity
for a senior person from Enron to address the audience.

Also for folks from Enron coming to the conference we have hotel rooms
blocked at a discount price at the Park Hyatt.

I will be getting you a lot of the details with regards to logistics for the
panel and Enrons participation in the conference in the coming weeks..

Once again, I would like to thank you for the sponsorship and presence at
The finance conference.

Looking forward to it..

Regards
Suresh Balasubramanian
