Thanks for the offer. I was really hoping to do a structuring rotation. I 
have some interviews set up this week, so I will let you know what I decide 
to do this week.  Thanks again.

Thanks for the note.   I have a spot for you in our fundamentals group, which 
there is a lot of interaction with tech, traders, and marketers, and good, 
broad exposure to a number of enron's businesses.  We'd like to have you join 
us.  Let me know if that is of interest.  

Jeff

Jeff-
Pete Keavey asked me to send you my resume. I was working in Dutch Quigley's 
group for my first rotation. My second rotation was in the CALME Structuring 
Group. Since CALME is going through a reorganization, the analysts were told 
to find new rotations. I am currently interviewing with a few groups and I 
would like for you to take a look at my resume. Please contact me if you have 
any questions. Thank you for your time.
