Great.  Thanks for the update.  What about signing some of the big locals up 
to EOL?

We had one of our most successful days on Enron Online today.  In addition to 
the frontline NYMEX look-a-like trades, we did six jet swaps and two heat 
cracks online.  Although it is from a small base, this business continues to 
grow.  This business we are doing is also better than the NYMEX look-a-like 
business in that we are developing a mix of counterparties who are paying the 
bid/offer. Today's counterparties included Valero, Hess, Cargill and Bank of 
America. 

Next week we will launch our NYMEX heat and gas crack products.  Many of our 
counterparties have expressed interest in this product so we believe our 
volumes will continue to grow.
