We have completed the preliminary Transammonia valuation analysis with an 
equity range of $70MM to $80MM (enterprise value of $250MM to $260MM).  The 
conditional and non-binding letter to the counterparty will be faxed today 
with an equity range of $60MM to $80MM.  I lowered the bottom end of the 
range to $60MM for negotiation purposes.

Attached is a presentation we've put together focusing on Transammonia's 
business, deal specifics, and our financial valuation.

Raul
