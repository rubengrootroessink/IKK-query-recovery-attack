Good Morning,
Thank you very much for your reply on my questions regarding the rest of the 
winter season in Europe, 
it is very useful information for us to get a commentary from professionals.

It would be good to get such an extensive report from time to time, or 
whenever a major change in the weather pattern take place.
On a day to day basis, is it possible to get a short comment on your opinions 
on the weather situation in Europe.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Frank Lien

Subject: Europe Winter Weather

Frank,

Here is an outline of what Mike, Jose and I put together today concerning the 
remainder of the winter across Europe:




The Bottom Line:

Much of the continent should feature temperatures, on average, cooler than 
the past few months.  Overall temperatures should be normal to below normal 
in the February and March timeframe.  An active sub-tropical jetstream will 
continue to provide a wet pattern near the Mediterranean keeping temperatures 
on the below side of normal.  Western Europe will also see the best chances 
for colder weather intrusions as the NAO trends positive.  Even with this 
cooler trend across Europe, there are no signs that the Arctic Pool of air in 
Siberia will move westward toward eastern Europe.  Overall no extreme 
deviations from normal are expected, only a slight trend toward cooler than 
normal.

Let me Know if there is more we can do:
Steve
