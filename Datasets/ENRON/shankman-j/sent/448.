Since only I know I'm not trying to offend you, that's all I can say.  I'm 
not sure I'm worthy of your being concerned either  (I don't deserve it--I'd 
guess)  You know, after we talked the other day, I felt better for a while.  
I don't know what to say, and I'm sure I'm embarrassed by this whole 
thing--most particularly how I've handled our relationship.  I really want to 
see you, but I need some time to myself I guess.  I do know glen doesn't have 
all the answers, but I find him to be impartial and helpful--really the only 
one these days.  My mother suggested a trip home this weekend, and i may go.  
I wish this were easy.....I think part of my issue is I've always felt our 
friendship is one I wanted to keep always, and I feel I tend to jeopardize 
friendships....

I'm so confused by you.

Sorry about your week.  Hopefully, since it's the weekend your week will
only get better, but as for my part in it, if any, I'm losing patience.
I don't know whether to be concerned about you or offended by you.  It's
increasingly difficult to be both.  Since you don't call as much as to
check in with me or respond to my calls, clearly you don't want to bother
with me and aren't particularly concerned whether I'm ok or not, and I have
to resist the urge to call and check on you because you are unresponsive
and seemingly untruthful, so I feel foolish even trying.  As a result, I'm
leaning more and more toward the offended/annoyed side.

Maybe Glen will have "all the answers" for you, but I don't think that's
possible and I think you just need to accept it and move forward.   It will
all pass and you will be fine in the long run.

I saw you called on the cell this a.m.  Sorry I missed you.  (I was in the
shower).  I have had a shitty week--I suspect my silence (not only to you,
but others) after our phone call is a result of the week.  I'm seeing Glen
at 11:15....talk to you
