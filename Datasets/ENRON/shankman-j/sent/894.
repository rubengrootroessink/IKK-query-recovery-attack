Thanks for the email.  You do know that Networks and our Broadband businesses 
are different, I trust.  If you have and questions, please let me know, and 
I'll be happy to help you get to the next group that most interests you.

Subject: Rotation

Jeff,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on the Gas Trading Floor. I 
believe I have learned a great deal not only about the technical aspects of 
the business but also about the less tangible but as important sides of Gas 
Trading such as teamwork, open communication, and freedom of thought. In all 
honesty, the overall environment and rhythm of the floor are the things I 
have enjoyed most and I can now better understand how these elements have 
been successfully applied to new ventures. 
I will be due for rotation in about 2 months and have started to attend 
brownbag lunches hosted by the various ENRON divisions. The one I enjoyed 
most was given by the ENRON Networks' E-Commerce group and its relationship 
with the Houston Technology Center. This group was initially signalled to me 
by an associate friend of mine working there as an ENRON loaned executive who 
is also due for rotation in December.  From what I gathered, the group's goal 
to bring together entrepreneurs, new technologies, and venture capitalists 
could be a good match with my skills and interests.
I recall you mentioning Networks to me as a possible rotation and would be 
very grateful if I could benefit from your feedback and advice on the matter. 
I thank you again for your assistance and hope all is well in Global Markets.

Massimo
