I did receive an envelope from you last evening.  No problem to postpone our 
meeting.  However, when should I pick up the car?  

Best,

Jeff

Jeff,
A)   I hope you received the courier delivered envelope re:the Range Rover 
detail.
B)   Would you think me rude if I were respectfully to ask to postpone our 
meet tomorrow -
   I do fully recognize the many requests for your time and trust this will 
not preclude me    chatting with you again shortly.
Alan
