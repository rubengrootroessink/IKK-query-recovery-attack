Here are my selections.  We will be interviewing 60 candidates in the first 
round of interviews, so you can actually select more than 10-12 candidates to 
put on the closed list.  Also, I've attached  2 resumes from students who 
have been corresponding with me since the presentation.  Both are interested 
in Associate positions, but for some reason were not included in the resume 
book.

Resume books are being distributed tomorrow morning and should arrive at your 
EB location later in the day.  Please review the resumes and select 10-12 
candidates you believe should be on the closed list.  I need your selections 
no later than Wednesday October 11th because the closed list is due in the 
Career Management office the following day.  Send your selections via email 
and carbon copy my coordinator Alyse Herasimchuk.  Thank you for your 
participation and I look forward to another successful recruiting season at 
Wharton.

If you have any questions feel free to call me at extension 53214.
