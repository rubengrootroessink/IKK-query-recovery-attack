Shanna,

I have two personnel that we need to place on contract.

Ted Noble was promoted to manager at year-end.  I need to put him on a one 
year contract.

Eric Scott is an analyst.  You know the story.  I need a one year contract 
for him too.  Is the "Trader Track" available for Eric?

Thanks,

Gary
