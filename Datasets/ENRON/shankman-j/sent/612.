Jeff,
I'm the researcher who works with Ted Bland and has been surfacing 
Associate/Analyst type resumes for you and Lavorato (the binders we gave you 
guys).  Attached is the resume of a personal friend of mine, Robert Brown 
(Bobby), who may be a good fit for your group.  He is a '97 University of 
Pennsylvania graduate (3.1 GPA) with a degree in Economics and an 
International Finance concentration.  Additionally, he holds Series 7, 63, 65 
licenses.  

Bobby had expressed an interest in Enron to me some time ago, but didn't want 
to pursue anything at the time as he was going to be traveling for quite a 
while.  He contacted me last week, ready to explore opportunities at Enron.  
Upon reading his resume, I felt it is very much in line with many of the 
other resumes I'd surfaced for you and Lavorato to you last month (given to 
you by Ted Bland).  He's very bright, ambitious and I feel would fit very 
well into the Enron environment.

Let me know what you think and don't hesitate to call if you have any 
questions!
Amy
