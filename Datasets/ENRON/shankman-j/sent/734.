No doubt about drinks with you being more fun!  (My haircut is perfect, 
you'll be pleased to know)  I did go out with my neighbors last night--I 
needed to because the guy who is buying my house on woodhead st.  came over 
last night and backed out of his contract.  Boy was I annoyed.  And still am, 
but the good news is he loses his earnest money to me.  So I'm going to take 
out a bunch of friends to dinner when i get back.  Want to go?  I'm thinking 
Tony's or something else fun/festive.  To be determined...but fun.

I had a lunch meeting today.  I love lunch meetings.  I am leaving early 
too.  yeah!  I have to go to the invitation store for work, then I have a new 
book I want to get (I love to read), and I have some other random stuff to 
do.  are you leaving early for fun or work?  dinner was great.  thanks for 
asking.  I hope that your drinks were fun and that your haircut is just how 
you like it.  I still think that drinks with me would have been much more fun 
than your haircut!
