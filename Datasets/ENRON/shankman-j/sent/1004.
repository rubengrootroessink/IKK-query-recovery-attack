Jeff:
I stopped by your office to deliver the following in person, but you moved 
recently.

I talked to Jennifer, discovered your new office location, and will have this 
on your desk today.

Thanks,

Jeff:

Do you have an interest in providing a recommendation letter for my 
application to the analyst program?

During my tenure of one year at Enron, I've assisted Errol and Dutch manage 
Mike Maggi and John
Arnold's positions including xpits/deliveries, etc. to effectively ensure 
that their positions (and risks) have
complete accuracy. As you know, I am responsible for this task for all groups.

Furthermore, I constantly seek new methods of creating value in the natural 
gas (and other) groups.
As you may know, I am working with John Arnold on a project to evaluate our 
existing brokers to utilize their credit lines
properly which are interest-free (most of them) so that we may reduce our 
interest costs associated with initial
margins.

I'd like to meet with you briefly to discuss your thoughts on the MG meeting 
last week and assist you in
any follow-up endeavors.  I'll contact Sheila Glover, if you wish, next week, 
to see if she has received the contact
list which you requested.

Representatives of Wharton's admissions group will be here on Monday, October 
16 for a presentation for prospective graduate
business school students which I will be attending.

Thanks.

Hi,
May I arrange a brief meeting when your schedule permits?

As you know, I work closely with Dutch and Errol to ensure that the NG 
positions
are correct.
