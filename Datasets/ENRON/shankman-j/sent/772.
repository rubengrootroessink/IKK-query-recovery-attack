I had to cancel my trip to Phila today--bummer.  Nov 7 is fine.  (I'm out of 
town this sunday for one week)  I'm psyched about australia, but only for two 
days is a little sad.  Anyway, I'm here through sunday if there is a woe 
emergency.....

I am looking forward to it as well.  Don't worry...I am not planning on 
spending too much time on our sob stories!  Tuesday, November 7 is the best 
for me.  If that doesn't work, Thursday may work, but on the later side.  I 
think I have to have a drink with a consultant coming into town, but I am not 
sure.  

Have a safe trip and I can't wait to hear all about it.  If you decide that 
Australia is to amazing to leave, I will completely understand and we can 
reschedule.  I wouldn't blame you a bit!  In fact, we could have drinks 
there....I've never been!

I'm looking forward to our drinks/dinner of woes.  (But not too long on woes, 
I don't like not being in a good mood).  When is good for you week after next?

P.S.  I really don't like that expression "misery loves company"  by the 
way......
