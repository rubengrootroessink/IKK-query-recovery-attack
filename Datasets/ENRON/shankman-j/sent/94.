Bjarne was reviewed as a part of Enron Europe this time and his promotion was 
based on a long period of  high performance.   He is viewed as one of the 
most valuable people in the business and there was no controversy whatsoever 
in London about his promotion.   In fact I repeatedly get calls for his 
services from various groups around Europe who would love to hire him if they 
had the opportunity.  In Oslo he has been one of the main contributors behind 
most off our models, and I think that the job he has done with setting up the 
Weather desk here in Oslo deserves very positive feedback, even if we didn't 
make money last year.  We have really moved up the deal flow and are poised 
for an outstanding year 2001 in Weather.

In the future I will obviously cross check all things like this with you and 
Mark, so there aren't any misunderstandings going forward.  

Regards 

Thor

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.  

Jeff
