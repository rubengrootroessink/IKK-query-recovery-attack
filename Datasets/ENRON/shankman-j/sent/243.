Hi Drew, hope the London digs are working out!  

I have a HR problem that we need to address immediately.  Today we let Britta 
Dinndahl go.  Her termination was a case study in how to screw up a 
termination.  She was let back onto the trading floor where she called and 
email people telling them about her termination.  I understand from Chris 
Mahoney that (neither Nigel nor) Yvonne Scoroer was ready to handle this 
today, even though they had been briefed many times about her upcoming 
termination.  It wasn't until early afternoon that I called Phillipe Bibi to 
tell him of her termination, when she was taken off system access.  

In addition Yvonne has had Erik Hansen's contract for over three weeks and 
has not produced paper for Erik to sign.  It was my hope to have him under 
contract before the bonus period.  Further Jen Fraser was trying to hire 
Andrew Hill as a new employee for the Fundamentals group in London, and on 
three occasions Yvonne told Jonny Palmer that she would get an offer letter 
to him "today".  It took three weeks.

Obviously these are extremely serious lapses, and I do not want Yvonne 
involved in any more Enron Global Markets.  Cindy and Shanna have done a 
heroic job for us in the U.S. and they have been extremely frustrated with 
their counterparts in London.

Thanks for addressing this issue.

Jeff
