Dear Rick and Clay:

I thought you you would be interested in a "look-in-advance" at the article
about Enron LNG to be published by POTEN in this month's LNG IN WORLD
MARKETS.  

Clay, sorry I missed you this time around in September when I was in the
Middle East.  For your guidance, we heard a lot of nice things from OLNG
management about you guys -- and well deserved I may add.

Best regards,

Gabriel F. Avgerinos
