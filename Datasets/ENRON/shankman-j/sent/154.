Dear Mr. Shankman,
     Thank you very much for your quick reply.  Attached is my resume.  I
highlight the relevant skills in the summary.  The position is with the EES
MMC EAST department / WHOLESALE, RETAIL & COMM, ENRON ENERGY SERVICES. It was
posted on Dec. 11, but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on
the internet, it is open.
     Look forward to hearing your comments / suggestions.
Regards,
Rina
