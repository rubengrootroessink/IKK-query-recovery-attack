Jeff -

Let's do dinner on the 17th.   I'd be happy to stop by your house for a quick
drink and tour.  I will assume 6:30 p.m. works unless I hear that this does 
not
work for you. I look forward to seeing you on Sunday.

Yes, Love to have dinner, either the 17th or 18th--you pick.  Let's have a
drink at my house first so I can show you the digs.  Sorry I couldn't make
it...last minute schedule problems...

Jeff -

Jean and the boys will be heading to my parents for X-Mas on 12/17.  I am
in
Houston until the morning of the 21st, and would love to get together for
dinner
sometime during that interval.

Are you scheduled to be in town during that period?  If so give me a call
at
713.653.8207 (day) or at home at 713.522.9381.  I'll also be happy fill you
in
on what happened at the MFAH subcomittee meeting today as well.
