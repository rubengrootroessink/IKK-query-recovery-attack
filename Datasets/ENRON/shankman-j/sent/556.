When she was hired, there was no 3rd year analyst program.  She is going to 
be placed in the trading non-rotational program, as well.  In addition, she 
has made well over 1million dollars trading a book on the gas floor, and has 
been made our resid trader.

Jeff,

According to our criteria, Sara is not eligible to be promoted to an 
Associate at this time.  Sara would only have 20 months in the program as of 
3/31/01and does not have the 2 years of relevant commercial experience prior 
to Enron necessary to promote her to the Associate level.  However, Sara 
could be promoted to a 3rd Year Analyst at the mid-year PRC.  

Thank you,

Lisa Jones

Jeffrey,

Below is a list of Analysts and/or Associates in your group who are eligible 
to be nominated for promotion during the year-end PRC.  Please review and 
advise if you would like to nominate any or all of them for promotion.  
Please understand that a promotion is dependent upon the rating they receive 
in the final PRC.  We would like to receive your feedback regarding this 
information by November 27 in order to include it in the pre-rate meeting for 
your business unit.
