Jeff:
Just a short note to touch base on MetGas related activities. We, (the MetGas 
Development Team) will be meeting with the Global LNG Team (Bergsieker et.al) 
starting on Wednesday, October 4.  The agenda is attached for your 
information.  If you have any questions or would like direct feedback please 
let me know.

When can we discuss the way forward for MetGas LNG supplies and the 
integrated approach among the upstream team and the MetGas team that is 
crucial to securing terms and conditions that fit the market?
