Nina, it is hard for Mike and I to attend these meetings in the middle of the 
afternoon.  We'd both like to participate, but could we start having these 
meetings later in the afternnon....Thanks.  Jeff

This is to confirm that there will be an Art Committee meeting on Tuesday, 
November 7, at 1:30 p.m. in conference room 461 of the Enron Building.  We 
realize that some of the committee members will not be able to attend.
