I'm not happy today.  Going back to last night, I got home, fell asleep on 
the couch in the new house, went upstairs at 4, and slept til 830.  Late all 
day, and just had a pretty crappy meeting with one of my direct reports and 
Jeff Skilling.  I can't describe the weight of the world feeling I have, and 
I'm not good at not being in control.  I wish I had the answers.

How are you?
