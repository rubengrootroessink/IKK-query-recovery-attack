		 Subject: Summary of EES "Bear Trap"

Purpose
To explain the EES strategy for 2001 and how they will deliver on their 
number.

Details
EES has 3 product lines: Global National Outsourcing - Bundled Services 
(Angela Swarz / Mike Mann), Fast Track (Craig Sutter) and Regional Commodity 
(Greg Sharpe / Greg Cordell)
 1. National Accounts
 Part A - Bundled Service
 * This is the full bundled product (DSM, Commodity and Risk Mgmt)
 * Angela Swarz is the team lead
 *They are targetting large commercials (i.e shopping centers, hotels etc). 
 *They are also going aftersome large industrials (i.e. they closed Quaker 
Oats on 1/25)
 Part  B: Midddle Marketing- - Industrial Origination
 * Mike Mann heads this up
 *They are targetting heavy industrials including the Refining, Petchem and 
Chemical industries

 * Approaching customer at the executive Level
 * Already approached Farmland and IMC
 * Have a deal with Kerr McGee for outsourcing
 2. Fast Track "Boiler Room"
 *Run by Craig Sutter
 * ABC - always be closing-- They have written a script for originators to 
close a deal in 4 calls.
 *They have a computer that generates leads for their new marketing products 
( "ENvest" (Asset capex), ENpower "commodity swaps", Commodity sales  
"ENsomething" and "Entelligence" -
 3. Commodity Sales

 *Basically anythinmg smaller than the wholesale load

Impact on EGM
In August 1999, all NAICS (SIC) codes except Pulp and Paper and Steel 
reverted to EES in September 2000. This includes Refining, Petchems, 
Transport, Chemicals, Coal, Ags, etc...They a model "Value Enhancement" that  
shows an itemized account of a customer's VAR by commodity (metals, plastics, 
petchems,
products, gas, power, etc). They planon covering the whole universe of risk 
management. Obviously we need to manage the relationship with EES.

Next Steps:
Meet with Mike Mann. I have his target list. We probably need to see how we 
help them bring business to the EGM books, since they are cross-selling 
everything.

Let me know what you want to do.
