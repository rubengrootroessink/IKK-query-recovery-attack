Here is the updated list of interviewers for Super Saturday's.  As you can 
see the AA Program is still short .  We need to make a good showing with our 
people.  To sign up, the interviewers need to go to 
http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp.  Thanks again for your support and 
help.  Ted

interviewers.

Hi Shelly,

Here is an updated volunteer listing.  There should be no more duplicates 
(until someone decides to go in and sign up for the third time).  If you have 
any questions please let me know. 

Thanks,
John
