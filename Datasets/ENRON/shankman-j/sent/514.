Thanks for the email.  Actually, you are completely wrong about my view of 
Joe.  He has tremedous integrity, and is a very strong team builder, and has 
added much value to our organization.  I was however a little surprised by 
your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position.  I would 
have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind 
of capacity here, or in london, or elsewhere if you liked.  In addition, I 
could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products.  
(Which I will remind you about frequently)

I'm sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe, and hopefully to you as 
well.  Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both 
respect your business sense.

As far as the guilt thing goes, I can't help you.  I'm Jewish and our people 
have suffered much longer than everyone else combined.

Jeff
