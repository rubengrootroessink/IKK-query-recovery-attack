Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 08/2001




Highlight
Despite sharp movement in spot rates for both sectors week in general has 
been relatively quiet. Capes saw majority of strength in Pacific with Intra 
Pacific rates rising around $1800 since last week. Late surge in Japanese 
buying ahead of the close of their financial year is main reason attributed 
to this rise. Atlantic Capesize been pretty flat to marginally better, no 
exciting news. Outlook for coming week is that Far East strength will be 
maintained although pace definitely slowing. No change sentiment in Pacific.

Panamax has seen opposite effect, grain stems finally rolling from S America 
which has been the major driver of the Atlantic market, for March loaders. 
market was under impression that Pacific likely to come under downward 
pressure but once the demand has been strong enough epecially for modern 
tonnage and outlook for coming week is that reates are likely to maintain 
firmness. Atlantic expected continue run for next week.

Short term we have established small long for nearby Capes, but maintain 
overall perspective to sell forward curve on appreciable rallies. Panamax 
very similar approach.

Panamax we fixed timecharter tonnage to cover 14 / 26 Mch Dreyfus Ist 
nomination USG / Far East grain cargo. Have also taken option to extend 
period of vessel for short Trans-Pacific voyage if market maintains strength 
longer than we think.
