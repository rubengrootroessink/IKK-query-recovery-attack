Mike and Jeff,

The following is an update we sent out to Harvard and Ospraie regarding the 
status of our transaction pipeline.  I thought it would be of interest to 
both of you as well.



Gentlemen,

We have sent the final version of the CA to Hallwood to be signed, hopefully 
we will receive information either tomorrow or early next week and have a 
preliminary valuation and structure proposal by the end of next week.   We 
are negotiating a CA with Nuevo and they appear anxious to get started.  
Their general counsel told me they have prepared a box of due diligence items 
to be delivered as soon as we agree on certain terms.  The DevX CA should be 
finalized today as well and we will get started on that prospect hopefully 
next week also.  We are still waiting on information from Chesapeake, but I 
spoke with Marc Rowland last week and he is getting his new reserve report 
finalized and will send it to us when it ready.  Benton is progressing albeit 
slowly because of the complicated nature of the structure.  We are also 
analyzing a new transaction that another group within Enron has originated 
and structured a VPP around but they may not have favorable financing.  It 
could represent an opportunity for both of you to see if a small equity 
participation in the SPV is of interest.  That's it, call me if you have any 
questions or comments.

Doug,

I just wanted to say that you handled Hallwood perfectly. Also if it is time
to move on other fronts -- Benton / Nuevo -- I am ready to go. I think Nuevo
will probably be under pressure in the next few weeks after missing 4q and
reducing reserves.
