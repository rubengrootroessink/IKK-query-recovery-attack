Crude: Stocks have risen during this week over the last five years by an 
average of 7 mbbls, the smallest increase being last year's 3 mbbls. One 
reason the trend is likely to be repeated is that the SPR shipped 2.45 mbbls 
last week, and this should again show up in PADD 3, while the drop in PADD 5 
stocks (led by a sharp drop in imports) which offset the PADD 3 rise last 
week is unlikely to occur a second week. Overall imports remain high, and 
additional October barrels might just have found their way to the US from its 
closer OPEC neghbours. On the other hand, we have the Capline shutdown (due 
to lack of crude) which took place last week, and an increase in refinery 
runs out of turnaround, but I don't believe that will offset the factors 
pointing to a large build in crude stocks. (Consensus forecast up 2.5 mbbls. 
API still lower than the DOE by 2.4 mbbls)

Distillate: After rising steadily since mid July, demand finally turned south 
last week, with a 640 kbd drop. This is the first evidence that borrowed 
demand is now being paid back. A second week of stats would confirm this, but 
the weakening sentiment on cracks lends some support to the theory. The build 
last week occurred despite a strong drop in imports - providing demand stays 
low, higher runs and high distillate yields should see a build, perhaps in 
excess of 1 mbbls. (Consensus forecast up 1 mbbls)

Mogas: Gasoline demand has been sluggish for most of the year, but October 
sales were relatively strong, especially last week, which topped 8.7 mbd (8.9 
in the DOEs), not far off the year's highs. October deliveries are invariably 
higher than both Sep and Nov, so the most likely direction for demand is 
down. Imports from Canada and Europe are said to be on the way, but may take 
some time before they show up in the stats - although some improvement should 
be seen after last week's miserly 212 kbd which accounted for much of the 
draw. However, the gasoline tanker stuck in NYH may skew the stats. PADD 1 
again bore the lion's share of last week's draw, bringing stocks down to 
their lowest level since at least 1976 - it has lost 7 mbbls in four weeks. 
For RFG too, the region is looking short. This week is hard to call, but may 
point to a build, on the basis that strong demand and weak imports aren't 
sustained. (Consensus forecast down 1.5 mbbls. API still higher than DOE by 
2.6 mbbls.)
