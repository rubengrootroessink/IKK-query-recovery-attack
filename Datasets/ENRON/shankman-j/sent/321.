Thanks for all your help with Sempra.  Hard work, but certainly worth it.  On 
another note, Mike and I have discussed this $2 million issue with American 
Coal, and the interest rate hedge in the MPR.  Bottom line, we are not taking 
this hit.  It seems it was a problem with Treasury, so send it to them.  

Thanks. 

Jeff
