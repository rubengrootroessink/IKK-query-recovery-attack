Subject: Wharton Interviews

Hello Wharton/Penn Team!


Can you believe interviews are just around the corner.  



So that we are fully prepared for the November 9th and 10th interviews dates 
a team meeting will be held on:

Monday October 9th at 2:00pm in room 11C2

In the meeting we will review resumes that have been received for our 
pre-select list and coordinate any further campus events. Also, in the 
meeting we will select the people who will conduct first and second round 
interviews.  So if you would like to interview please plan on attending this 
meeting.   I look forward to seeing you all there.

Thank You,

Kristin Gandy
