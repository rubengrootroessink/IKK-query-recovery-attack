WHERE are my macadamias?  Did you break the scales at the doctor?  Do you 
know how funny I am?  I'm finally leaving for the evening, and I'm so psyched 
to go home and play fetch with myself with the glow in the dark ball!  Have a 
great weekend if I don't talk to you during the hour I'll be here in the 
morn....

Hugs to Emma
