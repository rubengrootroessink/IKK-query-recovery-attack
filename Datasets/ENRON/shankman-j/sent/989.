Clear it with arnold if you want dutch.  Let me know as people come to you.  
the goal is to have people rotate into your group directly, or from the gas 
fundamentals group if possible, and vice versa.  

Keep me updated, and you, I and Lavo will work this out.  Jeff

JS:
Several analysts have approached me with the desire to join me in EGM. What 
are the limitations on this? Also Dutch quigley is interested in coming over 
as well. He would like to start in research with a view that he would later 
trade or market something in EGM.
Thanks
Jen
