Clay, get with Nowlan to see who else should be put on this system.  You are 
missing products traders, and others who should be on this system.  Thanks.  
Jeff

Jeff has asked me to get instant messenger so that i can flash fast breaking 
news to all crude traders at once without using email.  I think the best app 
for this is Yahoo Instant Messenger.  Once you have it, please email me your 
screen name or just write to me (mine is clay_seigle) and we'll be ready.

Also, if there are other traders who should be included, let me know.

Thanks
