Subject: LNG Opportunity

A friend of mine, formerly with Bankers Trust, called to see if we are 
interested in hearing a story about a floating LNG facility. He is with 
Merlin Production, a small producer, that thinks there is a large market for 
accessing stranded gas in offshore fields.  If you have an interest let me 
know and I'll arrange a meeting. I owe this guy nothing other that a call 
back so if you have no interest say so. Rick
