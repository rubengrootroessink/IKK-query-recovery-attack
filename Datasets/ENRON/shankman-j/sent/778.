I was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated.  

The problem with the P&L loss is one of time.  We have given back 25 million 
this quarter, and very few traders took profits at any time.  I expect 
traders to lose money at times, but we have other constraints.  I'd be happy 
to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will 
get to our numbers next year. Of course spread trading is a good idea, but 
when I look at the portfolio in aggregate, the position story I'm being told 
doesn't make sense.  
We'll get there.

The issue of making the morning meetings more inspiring is a challege we need 
to take up.  I would suggest we move to traders
telling what the main positions are in their books (3 max) and then give a 
bullish (max +2) to bearish (max -2) view of their mkt.  If we
moved more quickly through this we might have time for more meaningful 
discussion at the end.  I think that the discussion at the
end we can keep flexible but for instance when we have major issues like spr 
sales or an opec meeting we should delegate somebody
to do a review of that.  In terms of the wed meeting, unless there is 
something special, I would recommend letting the new research
analyst we have hired in London do a quick API review.

The issue of high volatility in the markets makes a good argument for 
lowering position sizes but the issue of not having
any money to lose won't ever go away.  I base that statement on the premise 
that with the budget for next year set at 175 million
we will always be under pressure to meet budget and not give back any 
profits.  The books that have historically made the most
money in enron global products have been more spread trading/view oriented 
rather then flat price/momentum oriented.  I know
you would prefer we move away from this and become more the latter but I 
would encourage you to consider the fact that we have
little edge in forecasting short term price movements but hopefully have 
enough staying power and experience to position ourselves
correctly for the big moves.

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff
