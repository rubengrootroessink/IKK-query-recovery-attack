are you using the same format as midyear, and how many people do you need?

Subject: PRC Rep

Jeff,
I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
requesting a recommendation for a Director and Vice President to represent 
Analyst and Associates in the final 2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and 
additions to the Associate and Analyst Programs, we have an additional slot 
for both the Associate PRC and Analyst PRC that we would like to fill with an 
EGM participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout the business 
units equitable.  

We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
choice for Global Markets representation to me by this date or contact me to 
discuss.  Thanks so much for your continued support.
