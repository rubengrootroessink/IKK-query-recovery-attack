It sounds so fun!  we will have to pick a weekend.  I have to wait to think 
of a good idea for the bet...not something lame.  how about a puppy!  just 
kidding...but that would be really fun.  anyway, I have a situation to talk 
to you about later.  I need some good advice.

Your call on the bet.  I talked to my friend at Sat. Night Live, and she said 
no problem about being extras.  I'll get a list of scheduled hosts/bands--you 
pick!  (If that is still ok)

yes...my mom left this morning, and I have three weeks to recoup before I see 
her again.  She is the nicest person ever, and I feel so guilty that she 
annoys me.  I am sure I will have a daughter one day who thinks I am totally 
annoying too.  what goes around comes around!  
are you better today?  what are you doing for lunch?  did anything good get 
delivered???
