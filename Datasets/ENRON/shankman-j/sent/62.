Hi, hope things are well.  I'd like to talk about LNG trading vessels  
(merchant).  Have you been  talking with Pierre about all of this activity.   
George Mclellan is concerned about the exmar contract, and wants Pierre more 
involved with the business.  What do you think of this idea?  What are some 
of your thoughts regarding this business.  

Jeff
