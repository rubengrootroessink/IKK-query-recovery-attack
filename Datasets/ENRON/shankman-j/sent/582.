Subject: Sempra meeting

We are scheduled to meet Sempra in Stamford on Tuesday, Nov. 28 to discuss 
our differences.  I have reserved a flight  at 6:50 am Tuesday for me, Dan 
and Matt to return Tues. pm.  I'm not sure if both of you need to go, but we 
can decide Monday.

I will be reachable on my cell Thurs - Sun, (713-304-7306) and home Sun. pm 
(281-242-4001) if anything new comes up.

Thanks.
