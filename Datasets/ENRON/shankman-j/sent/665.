Looks like there is plenty of work to do, and I continue to believe shipping, 
etc. has great possibility for Enron.  I'd like to get a group of people to 
talk about plans going forward, and will fill you in shortly on time, where, 
etc.  One point is that it is our policy not to speak to the press without it 
being cleared through public relations first.  Your comments were 
interesting, but I was concerned about perception.  Please coordinate public 
statements, interviews, and the like through the proper channels going 
forward.   

Thanks.  

Jeff
