Hi guys,

Shawn Cumberlan, the former head of the CALME region, is very interested in 
learning about the transportation businesses we are pursuing.  He will be in 
London end of next week or so and I'd like you guys to spend some time with 
him.  

Dan, expect a call from him before he heads to London.  Mark Frevert is 
having him explore opportunities within the wholesale businesses.

Later,

Jeff
