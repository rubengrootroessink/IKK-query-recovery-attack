yes.  Economics look good.  However, I have not seen the basic confirm letter 
or associated term sheet.  I will review before we decide to pull the trigger.

I am not sure what the fee is but yes there has already been a firm 
commitment to speak at the meeting (Haug days).  I tried to get out of it but 
too late.  We are turning our presentation into an EOL push for electronic 
trading for LPG and LNG.  

I will run down if we actually have to pay 200 grand as well.  Brochures - 
yes there is a draft floating around but I have told these guys that I do not 
want anything put together specifically for the meeting.  I thought we could 
wait till we start making some cash and have a better handle on who we want 
to focus on in terms of customers

Eric.

Are we sponsoring gas tech (in houston) Nov 15 ish for $200,000?  What's up 
with the brochures?  Yes? No?  Your call on all of this.
