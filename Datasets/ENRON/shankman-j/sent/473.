This tool is really a breakthrough.  Real-time off our new satellite 
controller, meteorological info from NOAA's satellite!!!

Simple and easy.

just go to...

http://sassy.ect.enron.com/weather/current/desktop.html

further instruction (there is only one instruction)..

type in your station of interest, example: KHOU for Houston, Texas, LIRF for 
Rome, Italy, EDDH for Hamburg, etc (see attached city code list)

you will be constantly updated way before the competition!



enjoy...
