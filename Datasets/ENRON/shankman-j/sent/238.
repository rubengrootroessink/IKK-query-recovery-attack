In order:

If the A/A program will pay, otherwise, get with my asst Jennifer, and she'll 
help you out with cost allocations.
I have your pitcher, and will bring it to the office.
I'll be happy to have you sit with some of the traders.  Any commodities in 
particular?
I'll try to go to dinner--I may end up with a conflict.

Jeff

Thanks again for hosting the BBQ on Saturday night.  Your house was Couple of 
things . . .

Where should we charge all of the expenses for the weekend?  Should we charge 
them to recruiting or to your cost center?  If we should charge your cost 
center, what is it?
I think that I left my glass pitcher at your house Saturday night - can I 
come pick it up one night this week?
A while back I mentioned to you that I wanted to spend a day with a gas or 
power trader to understand more about our trading business.  Could you help 
me set that up?  Also, are there any materials that I can look at in advance 
to help me get up to speed or understand what's going on?
Are you planning on going to the dinner Thursday night for the Tiger Teams?
