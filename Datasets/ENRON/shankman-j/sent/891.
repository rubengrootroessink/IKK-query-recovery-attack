Jeff,Eric   Platt's just reporting what Euell said so they really have no 
reason to aplogize, other than to us for running a story with our name with 
no confirmation as to the validity of what was said. I do not think it a good 
idea for us to be saying too much about this publically and being too 
defensive as it may be interpreted wrongly. I agree with Eric' s decision 
which will be confirmed by  Mark Palmer that we keep our reply to the WSJ 
where we can have some comfort that the facts will be properly reported.
