Jeff,

I need to get your address, please.  Would like to invite you to mine and 
Rick's wedding on November 25, 2000.  Hope you will be able to make it.

Also, forgot...next Thursday I have to go get fitted for my dress.  I'll try 
to start doing more recruiting with you after the wedding.  Up until then, I 
feel swamped with things to do everyday!  Sorry.

Still, let's do dinner the following week when you get back from Singapore.  
October 3rd?

Nicole
