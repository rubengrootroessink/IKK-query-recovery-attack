ARGENTINA:THE UNPALATABLE CHOICE AMONG DEFLATING, DEFAULTING OR DEVALUING

Executive Summary
The recession in Argentina is deepening and the government faces painful=20
choices in addressing it
While the current strategy of deflation is unpopular, default or devaluatio=
n=20
could be even more painful
Deflation will remain the strategy of choice so long as De la Rua survives;=
=20
if his government falls, both default
      and devaluation become likely
Mexico and Brazil are in a stronger position to face the fallout from a=20
devaluation than they were in 1998

November 16, 2000

1. Argentina Recession

The question haunting observers of Argentina is whether the De la R?a=20
administration will succeed
in stabilizing the country=01,s economy and pulling it out of its second=20
recession in five years. Indeed,
the 11-month old administration has not lived up to expectations and is=20
quickly losing market
confidence. Although the country has so far maintained the support of the I=
MF=20
and Washington,
the outcome of the unfolding crisis is by no means certain. Argentina is=20
trapped in a fixed
exchange regime that succeeded in taming inflation but is now impairing its=
=20
competitiveness and
long-term prospects.

2. Deflate, Default, or Devalue?

The administration faces a number of unenviable choices as it tries to redu=
ce=20
the difference
between internal and external prices. It can continue with its present cour=
se=20
of action, attempting
to cut its fiscal deficit amid a deepening recession and a growing debt=20
crisis. The adjustment of
relative prices would thus be accomplished through continued deflation. A=
=20
variant of this scenario
would be to renegotiate part of its external debt, in order to reduce the=
=20
increasingly onerous interest
payments, or default on its sovereign bonds. This, however, would destroy t=
he=20
last shred of
confidence, jeopardize Argentina=01,s future access to international capita=
l=20
markets, and ruin the
country=01,s relations with major industrialized countries. Finally, the co=
untry=20
could opt to devalue.
Arguably, the financial and social cost of this action would be high, but t=
he=20
country could recover
relatively quickly, as the cases of Mexico and Brazil suggest.

3. Recession Threatens De la Rua Survival

The outcome will depend on whether the De la R?a administration remains in=
=20
power. The
government is committed to pursuing a deflationary adjustment, hoping that =
it=20
will pay off by next
year, provided that the US dollar weakens and that its access to=20
international markets is
maintained. However, if the deflation is more prolonged and the economic=20
recession becomes
socially and politically untenable, the ruling coalition could disintegrate=
=20
and the president could be
forced to resign. In that case, the new government would probably decide to=
=20
devalue immediately
after taking power.

4. Brazil and Mexico Less Vulnerable to Contagion than in 1998

The Argentine crisis has raised the specter of emerging market financial=20
instability, notably in
Brazil and Mexico. However, these fears may be unfounded given the progress=
=20
made by the latter
countries in improving their fundamentals. Indeed, both Brazil and Mexico n=
ow=20
feature a floating
exchange rate regime and have gone a long way in terms of balancing their=
=20
fiscal accounts. Thus,
in the event of an escalation of Argentina=01,s difficulties, both countrie=
s are=20
well equipped to
overcome temporary financial turmoil.
