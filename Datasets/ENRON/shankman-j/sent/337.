Subject: Request for 12/31/00 Stock Holdings

I am in the process of updating the quarterly report that is provided to the 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which details Executive 
Committee member stock holdings.

Please provide me your current personal ENE stock holdings as of 12/31/00.

Such holdings include:
shares held in a family trust
your personal brokerage account
in certificate form
in an IRA
etc.

Such holdings do NOT include any shares held in connection with Company plans 
(i.e., ESOP, savings plans, phantom shares, option grants, or restricted 
stock grants), although shares acquired that are held free-and-clear should 
be included.

Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information 
(713-345-8085)

I appreciate your response

Mary
