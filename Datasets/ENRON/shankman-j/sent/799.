Do you have an answer for me regarding the simulation I asked you to run?

jeff,we have bought approx. 2.75mmbbls. of dec crude and reduced heat cracks 
300mb. This means we should be close to our var limits
but not sure if under. Secondly,products has var coming from heat cracks (we 
got hit on EOL for 975 mb  on friday),jet swaps  (also EOL earlier
last week  of about 1mm bbl.),and some gasoline cracks in 2002.Otherwise our 
products positions on both dides of the Atlantic are as small
as anytime in recent history.

John, you guys have to be under Var tonight before we leave for the evening.  
That means buying on access if necessary.
