Hey, I'll be around this weekend, trying to get myself together.  I can't 
tell you how overwhelmed I've felt recently, and I think our conversation 
while I was awol (in NY for the day last weekend) really got to me.  I'll 
tell you this weekend about my meeting with my the shrink the other day.  
(The part where I'm NOT good at compartmentalizing).  I think that threw me 
for a loop too.  Oh, your message got to me this morn.  Please don't ever 
think you are bothering me.  I guess I'm a little less mature about my 
emotions than I thought.  (I know this is all personal, but email seems to be 
a little easier for me to communicate this to you right now).  I'm not sure 
that my home number is on yet, so the cell phone is where I'll be.  Thanks 
for checking up on me.
