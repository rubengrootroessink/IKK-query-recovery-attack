Hey Jeff, 

I don't know--- you tell me?  How many people would you like to attend and 
who out of the listed participants would you like to attend?  I will be more 
than happy to give those a call who  you feel no longer need to 
participate.   When I spoke with Sarah M.  she was trying to get Sarah W. to 
come.  Sarah W.  is not confirmed therefore she can easily be removed from 
this event.  Let me know what you would like to do.  

Shawna

Hi!

I apologize for the changes.  Jeff Shankman will now be joining us and he is 
added to the event sheet.  You each now have your own confirmation number.  
Again, review the event sheet and confirm your hotel dates and contact me 
with any changes.  If you should have any questions regarding the itinerary 
please do not hesitate to call.

Have fun!
