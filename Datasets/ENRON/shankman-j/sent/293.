Attached is a new paper by James T. "Jim" Jensen of Jensen Associates,
Inc., entitled "Oil-to-Gas Price Competition - Can it Place a Cap on Gas
Prices?".  The paper is very thoughtful and timely.  Because of the
immediacy of the issue, we have elected to distribute this article by
e-mail and to post it on the USAEE website (www.usaee.org) rather than wait
to publish it in the next issue of "Dialogue".

We are grateful to Jim for providing this excellent article.  If you have
questions for Jim, he can be reached by e-mail at JAI-Energy@att.net.
