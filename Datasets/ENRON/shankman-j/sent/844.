Hi John, hope things are well...Hickerson and I were talking yesterday about 
the convert bond desk, and he mentioned to me that it make sense for it to 
come to his group.  I understand you have had prelim discussions about this, 
and wanted to catch up with you on this matter.  I'll give you a ring by 
week's end if we want to proceed.  My initial reaction is that it probably 
makes sense....

Jeff
