Greg and I would like to have an informal meeting of our Wholesale leadership 
team when we meet in San Antonio for the annual Management Conference.  If 
your schedule permits, we would like to get together at 4pm on Thursday to 
talk about the new organization, resources, next year plans, and anything 
else you would like to discuss.  Appropriate refreshments will be served.  
Hope to see your there.
