I'm glad I can have my life back, for awhile at least.  Our group is moving 
next week.  We're going to the 47th floor with Shelley Corman's group.  My 
former boss, Dave Schafer has joined Cindy Olson's group.  

I'm spending christmas with my family.  We're having fireworks.  Doesn't that 
sound like fun.  Are you going away for the holidays?
