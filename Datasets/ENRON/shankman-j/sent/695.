Jeff,
Thanks for agreeing to participate in the Super Saturday on November 11th.  
Your speech should be about 10-15 minutes and begins at 7:50 at the Hyatt 
Hotel.  The interviews are from 8:45 until 12:30.  The decision-making 
meeting starts at 1:15 pm.  

I will meet with you on Thursday or Friday to review the format etc.  I am 
out of the office until Wednesday.  Please leave me a message about whether 
Thursday or Friday is better for you.  Thanks
Charlene x 3-9523
