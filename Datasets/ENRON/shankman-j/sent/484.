No, he cannot come to the crude meeting, but I'd be happy for him to have a 
tour of the gas and crude floors and introduce him to some traders.

Jeff- Hi- 

WE finally started trading with them- have done some Brent/ WTI and heating 
oil.

Jason Hotra- the younger trader is coming into the Houston office tomorrow 
all day with me- I was hoping he could come into the crude meeting-

Would this be OK? We'd have to announce him to all the traders- it would be a 
great forum for him to get a feel for what we are doing.

Sorry for last minute- 

Per probably told you they are very interested in the syndication deal he is 
working.

On other fund fronts: Tudor started trading Brent with us and is putting on a 
large position in nat gas/ heat.

We have documents signed with 3 other funds - ready to roll on Jan1

On funds and metals, I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.

Thanks and Regards,
Caroline
