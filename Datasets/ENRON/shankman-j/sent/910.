Dear Jeff:
?
Hello!? I wanted to make a bill for you for  the table and ceramic pieces, is 
that ok?
?
?
Can you be in Washington on October 28??  There's a great day-long symposium 
in conjunction with the Art Nouveau show  (which I saw on Friday, and which 
is, incidentally, much bigger and better than  the one in London was) which 
I'm going to, and I would love to be able to tour  around the show with you.? 
Also, Macklowe Gallery is having a cocktail  party that night for our 
clients, friends, experts, and assorted fabulous  hangers-on.? You'll get an 
invite in the mail, but I?wanted to give  you advance notice since I know how 
hectic your schedule is.
?
I hope it was an easy and meaningful fast for you,  and that this year brings 
you happiness beyond your wildest  imagination.
Tell me what's up
love.
ben?
