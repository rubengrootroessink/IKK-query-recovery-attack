I've known her for some time, and interviewed her on the gas floor, and we 
didn't really have a fit.  I'm not sure what I'd do with her

Gentlemen:

Below is an email and resume from a person I met recently through mutual 
friends.  I have not dealt with her in a business context and can't comment 
positively or negatively on her capabilities.  She seems bright and 
personable from my brief conversation with her.  Given the shortage of 
traders we constantly seem to face, I thought it worthwhile forwarding her 
resume.

If you have any interest, feel free to contact Pamela directly.  If you would 
like me to call on your behalf, I would be happy to do so.

Jim Hughes

Dear Jim,

I would appreciate any advice or assistance  you could provide.? I do know 
Jeff Shankman.? However, he is very hard  to get in touch with.? You 
mentioned on Friday that you would not mind  giving him a call for me.
?
I know that my knowledge and experience would be a  great asset to the team 
at Enron.
?

I have attached my resume for your review.?  The resume?details my 
accomplishments in the  Natural Gas?business.? However, my marketing, trading 
and management  skills?are transferable to any commodity?in any industry.? 
Some  of my past accomplishments include:? proven track record in marketing 
of a commodity; established customer base  across a multi state region; 
successful in?achieving regional goals and  exceeding profit targets; utilize 
analytical skills in developing strategy for  meeting customer needs; 
experience in educating and providing?internal and  external customers with 
derivative and financial products to meet the customer  needs; customer base 
includes brokers, marketers, producers, utilities and end  users. 
?

I have?provided  some additional information about my background below:
?
I am a highly successful sales and marketing  professional.? I have over nine 
years  experience and a proven track record in the Natural Gas Industry.? My  
experience ranges from marketing, origination,?running a desk and profit  
center in trading, market making, and management.? Most recently I ran a  
regional trading desk and profit center?at TXU Energy Trading.? My
