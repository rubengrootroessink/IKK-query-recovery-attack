Hey, call me on this kid.  He is the next king for you.  I met him at Wharton.

Dear Mr. Shankman,
? How are you doing? We met last week at the  undergraduate Enron 
presentation and discussed the possibility of an Enron/ESPN  deal that would 
enable television viewers to order old sporting events over the  television 
(similar to the Blockbuster deal). You told me to send you an email  around 
this time to follow up, so I can find out who to contact to get the ball  
rolling. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my idea.
?
Sincerely,
Zachary Costello
