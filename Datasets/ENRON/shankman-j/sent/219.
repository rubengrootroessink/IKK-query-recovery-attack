Jeff,
As you suggested last week, I am letting you know that I have yet to hear
from Jeff about setting something up.  I did manage to speak with Michelle
about what she is doing and I was exited about what she had to say.  let me
know how proactive I should be about getting in touch with Jeff.  Hope you
are well.
Nat
