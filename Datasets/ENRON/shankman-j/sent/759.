thanks.  are there any other companys that make a substitutable connector?  
Meaning, do they (Amp) have any competitors of any sort?  I appreciate the 
insights.

Jeff,

The company that makes the connectors for the 12 pair cable is called "Amp".  
They make both the existing and the substitute connector.
