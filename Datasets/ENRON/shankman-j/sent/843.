Mark, Thor, and Todd,

Thanks for the video conference this morning.  Mike and I are convinced 
weather can and will be an extremely profitable business.  One issue I would 
like to address is EnergyDesk.com.  It seems like an interesting idea, but 
I'd like to find out more about it, and in relation to the work Tom Gros in 
doing in NetWorks.  I'd also like to understand more about the scalability of 
this model, and our relationship with Kiodex.  

To that end, I do not want any proprietary data, product interface, and or 
other weather related matter and material to be part of EnergyDesk.com.  I 
will keep you updated as I learn more about these and other issues.  

Regards

Jeff
