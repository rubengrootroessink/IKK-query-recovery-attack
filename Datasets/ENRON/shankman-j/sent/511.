Sorry it's been so hard.  Nothing meant by it.  To where are you moving?

Hey Jeff.  You're a tough date.  Call me when you have time to go out--lunch
or drinks.  I am moving from Houston next week, so hopefully it can be soon.
Just wanted to catch up with you.  Could also use your advice on possible
opportunities out there.

Thanks,
Barry
