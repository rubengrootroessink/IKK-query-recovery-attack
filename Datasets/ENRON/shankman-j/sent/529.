Subject: Potential Dow Chemical Visit to Enron - Jan.23rd

The purpose of this email is to notify you and obtain your feedback and 
interest level on the above referenced visit. 

Dow Chemical has requested a visit to Enron on Jan. 23rd from 5:30 pm to 7:00 
pm.  Dow is looking at ways to speed up their supply chain manufacturing 
process.   Eighty of their global operations leaders want to visit Enron and 
learn how Enron has moved from an old economy business model to a new economy 
business model and the impact of that change on Enron's operations and 
organization.   The Dow operations people are in Houston for their annual 
Operational Leadership conference being held in the Woodlands.

Also, Jeff Skilling will be speaking to another Dow Chemical commercial group 
in late April as well as a having a one on one meeting with Dow's CEO to 
discuss how Enron and Dow can work closer together.   

At your earliest convenience, please let me know your feedback.  

Thank you
Carrie
