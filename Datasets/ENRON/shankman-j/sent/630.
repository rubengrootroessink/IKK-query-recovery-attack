Subject: VaR on Long-dated deals

Per our conversation this morning, the graph below shows the combined VaR for 
the last 30 days on just the long-dated deals.  Unfortunately, there is some 
intra-day trading and long term strategic trading for Energy Trend and 
JBlock.  The Risk Management group have started breaking out intra-day 
trading for FGH  and PAN-NAT, and they are currently in the process of 
breaking-out Energy Trend and JBlock.   This process requires setting up new 
books and re-booking new deals.  However, the graph below should give you an 
idea of how much VaR these deals are eating up.  I will send an updated graph 
once all books are successfully setup.
