Subject: Talk again

Would like to talk again this week - I plan to get to Houston/London in the 
beginning of January and want to consider a path to start thinking on now - 
if I do make a change (or it is forced on me).

By the bye, a former analyst of mine says that you all might enter the 
fertilizer business...I tried to get Houston to enter it a year and a half 
ago - we ran the correlations and had a global market study done (Chem 
Systems - An IBM company).  The corr that Grant ran between ammonia/urea to 
corn was high (like above 92% if I recall)...we looked at investing in a 
plant here in Argentina (obviously significant supply/demand mix of 
agriculture and fert products in Arg/Brazil) at that time and were analyzing 
a potential hedge - I killed it because it was not competitive let alone the 
lack of interest in Houston...The market is on the way up...as long as you 
stick to the base products - pure fert futures never made a go from what I 
was told...take care...

Please let me know when you are available...

Thanks,
jf
