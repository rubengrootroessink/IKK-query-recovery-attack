Subject: Summary of DPC Project Update Call

Wade, Bill & Neil,

Attached please find a summary compilation of the various issues and 
discussions that occured on the Dabhol project status update call that was 
presented to the LNG vessel interests.  I initially put this together as a 
way of organizing my notes, as well as communicating the latest status to 
Mark Haedicke and Alan Aronowitz in EWS/EGM Legal, who have asked to be kept 
advised of developments affecting the LNG contracts.  However, in discussions 
during this morning's Dabhol project lawyers' call, the issue was raised 
whether any written record of the discussions would be sent on to the 
shiplenders or the Greenfield sponsors.   I offered to make this summary 
available to the group if it would be of any assistance, my offer was 
promptly accepted, and that's why you see all the "cc" names in the address 
line above.
  
Of course, this summary is derived from my notes and somewhat contemporaneous 
recollections of the call, and as such I'm quite open to any suggested 
revisions to ensure the record is set as straight as possible.

Kind regards,
Dan
