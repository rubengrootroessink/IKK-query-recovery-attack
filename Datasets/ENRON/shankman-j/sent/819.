Subject: Unleaded Trade

fyi,

Hats off to Larry Gagliardi and the Unleaded desk. They have done another 
large crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 
2001. This trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second 
largest transaction conducted to date on EOL.
