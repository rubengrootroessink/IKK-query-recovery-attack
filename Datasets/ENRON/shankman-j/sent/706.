Subject: Bankers Trust / Deutsche downsizing

Jeff- a couple of weeks ago, BT decided to close the Houston office and move 
the 6 people they have to New York - only 1 or 2 will go up there.  I just 
thought I'd tell you my thoughts of the Houston people - I worked with most 
for 4 years.  I know you probably know most of them.

Nigel Patterson- basically trained me - he is the NYMEX trader- worked for BT 
almost 13 years in London, NY, and Houston .  Andy Zipper trained him.  He's 
a good trader - traded currencies, commods (metals, energy).  He could trade 
any of our products- would be especially good at new businesses.  He has been 
in Houston for 4 years and is originally from New Zealand- has a wife and 2 
girls.  Vice President.

Calvin Schlenker- ran Calgary office for 2 years before we shut it in 1997- 
he then took on head of marketing role in Houston - his successes have been 
with producers - being able to exploit lending and hedging.  Most recently, 
he's been trading the nat gas options book.  Very smart guy with good ideas- 
analytical and conceptual- he'd be VERY good with Per's syndication efforts 
or credit derivative initiative.  Knows gas and crude.  He is Canadian- 
ex-wife and 2 kids.  Director.

Steve Provenzano - basis trader - very good contacts in the industry.  Worked 
for MG before BT. He did a lot of marketing with me.  Because he's done both 
trading and marketing, he's got a good edge with customers.  Only has gas 
experience.  He is likely to go to New York but recently got married and has 
a kid on the way.  Director.

Also, Deutsche's two head oil traders in London just quit- but I am not sure 
what they are doing yet- will find out.  That is Janelle Matharoo and Jason 
Thiel (MD and Director)- both been with BT almost 15 years- very good 
traders- always in London.  Jason used to be BT's head gold trader: Janelle 
has also traded metals.

Looks like Deutsche is crumbling on energy- I know they have added a few 
crude traders in NY to service their hedge fund clients (our prospective 
clients) but they have not been able to pull everything together- they are 
loosing all the key people in the business.

I'd like to help in the process of pulling some of these people in if we have 
the desire.

Kind Regards,
Caroline
