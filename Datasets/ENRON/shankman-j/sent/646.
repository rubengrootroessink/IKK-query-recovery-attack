As I was packing some books this weekend, I stumbled across an old copy of 
The Story of O, and almost fell over.  I knew I had heard of that book--I 
must have read it some time ago--I think it was orig published in 1954 or 
1965.  Now I remember how much I didn't like it!  Hope you've recovered from 
all your parties.  How was the book dinner.  Did I mention I had a spur of 
the moment party last night? 

Jeff

this was the wierdest book I have ever read.  It was called The Story of O, 
and it about this sex cult in Paris and it totally freaked me out.  I am glad 
that it is over.  I started another one last night that is a little bit 
lighter.  Three generations of Jewish women in the south kind of thing.  tell 
me if yours is good.  I haven't read it.  I am going to the chronicle book 
dinner on sunday and I am totally psyched.  if you want me to get any of the 
books signed for you let me know.  Ted Coppel will be there with his new 
book.  I am running out so leave me a message if you want it.  Have a great 
weekend!  I am bummed you can't make next thursday, so we will have to plan 
something fun soon.

Everything was ok, just busy.  Good book?  I just started "When the sons of 
heaven meet the daughters of earth"  have you heard of it?  I'd absolutely 
love to go the the Anne Frank thing, but I can't get back from the management 
conference.  I'm on a panel (with Jeremy) early Friday a.m.

they must make you sign a confidentiality agreement when you walk in the 
door!  well, I guess I have no choice but to believe you, even though some 
juicy details would be kind of fun!  
Her piano was so bad they had to do it twice.  At least I got to finish a 
book.

ok...so I do want the low-down on last night b/c I am sure there is a lot 
that is inappropriate for email!  I will be out of the office all afternoon 
so if you want to talk I'll be on my cell phone 256-5582.
Big....small....it is still the Enron Executive Committee and you should feel 
extremely proud.  I am so happy for you!
I hope that you have a great lunch and that your speech went will this 
morning.

Great!  Sorry YOU weren't there...
I'm on my way out  for a lunch.  I'll call you later.   (I'm excited about 
the exec committee, but it is a little big, so I told Skilling we should 
rename it the exec villiage!)
