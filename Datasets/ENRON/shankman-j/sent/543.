Let's get together and get this traders' roundtable going.  I propose:  You, 
me Lavo (if he's interested), Vince K, John Arnold, Phillip Allen, Mike 
Grigsby, (those three from US gas), Rogers Hearndon, and Fletch Sturm (East 
Power), Mike Bradley, John Nowlan,.  This list covers gas, power, 
crude/products, rates, and vince's economic views.  Any other 
people/groups/commodities we should have represented?
