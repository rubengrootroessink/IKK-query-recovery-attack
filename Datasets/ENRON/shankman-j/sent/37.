you're doing a great job.  don't be rattled, I was going to ask you to assess 
someone, but I'm not ready to ask you yet.  
keep up the good work.  By the way, do you have a current resume so the 
trading track people can keep track of you.  I need one to get you in the 
program.

Jeff-
 When I was in your office you rattled me a quite a bit when you said you 
weren't ready to ask me a certain question.  I know that you and I have not 
had the chance to really talk lately and I've actually been in and out of the 
office in the late afternoons trying to get some health issues resolved.  I 
want to let you know I'm trying very hard to focus and work with Niamh in 
London, learn as much about reisd, and trade into what we think are solid 
positions.  So far I feel like its been going better than I even expected, 
but I know I have a lot more to learn.  I'm enjoying this product and working 
in EGM.  I'm trying to manage this Penn thing on the side and still help out 
Jenn and Fundamentals when they need it.  I'm begining to see what it means 
to be streched thin, something I'm sure you experience quite often.  I do 
want you to feel like you can ask me anything.  I'm here to express my ideas 
to you or if you feel like I'm not working hard enough, I'd like to know.  
I've really appreciated everything you've done.

Sarah
