Will do.  With regard to storage, we will proceed on the assumption that you 
will not want to query any period longer than the previous calendar month and 
thus will not store any data that is more than 45 days old.

proceed with your recommendation.  Also, we do not need to store any data 
once I see report.

Jeff:

If further conversations with our technical folks, they have a suggestion 
which I believe increases the flexibility of this report and a key question 
which helps determine the resources required to support it.

First the suggestion.  If the report is designed to run with a Start date and 
End date, you will be able to pick the reporting period.  For example a 
particular week, a calendar month, the latest four weeks, etc.  This would be 
in lieu of the more structured (hard coded) format in my e-mail of 
yesterday.  I recommend this option.

Second the question.  How far back in time do you want to query?   60 days?  
90 days?

There is an extensive data capture requirement to prepare this report.  Each 
product will be queried a minimum of 24 times each day to capture the time, 
bid price, bid volume, offer price, offer volume.  All of this data will need 
to be stored for as long as you want to be able to query.   By limiting the 
amount of time the data is kept, we can minimize the amount of data storage 
resources required to support this report.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

-Bob
