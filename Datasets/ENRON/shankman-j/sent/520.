Why did I just eat the largest fajita papasito's EVER made?   Put a few of 
those macadamias in interoffice mail, would you?

you are dead...I have already dug into the nuts, and now I think you did it 
on purpose so that I lose the bet!

I'm picking out the carpet this weekend--so I'll also run out and get a 
picnic basket!  Your desert capabilities are impressive!  (Next time I'll get 
a quart of whipped cream instead of a pint so you can have twice as much, and 
I can win our contest)

You are a lot of fun--I like hanging out with you.

I had a great time too.  next time when the carpet is in, we can have a 
little carpet picnic and watch the 8:00!  by the way...I am still full.  Have 
you ever seen a girl put away so much dessert?  I am actually known for it!  
Mark almost died the first time he saw me eat dessert!!!  I am only coming 
for dinner again if you promise we can have homemade whipped cream.  I think 
it is one of the only white things that I like to eat.
