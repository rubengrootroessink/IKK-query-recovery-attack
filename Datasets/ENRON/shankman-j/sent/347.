Let's send our a memo to deal makers, book admins, and business heads to 
remind everyone what the process should be regarding desk notification of big 
transactions/cash flows.  Why don't you take a stab at writing a memo, send 
it back to me, and I'll review.  Let's try to get it out this week.

Thanks.
