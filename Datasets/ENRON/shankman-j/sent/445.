No problem!  In fact, it is likely I'll be in NY wed-sat next week--I'm sure 
I'll stop by the gallery.  Hope to see you...

Sorry to hear that you won't be joining us. I will be sure to let Ben know
that you wanted to attend.  Please do me a favor - an obvious favor but one
that I will feel remiss if I do not ask...Please do not send him something
before tomorrow night as it is still a surprise. I only ask because you
mentioned that you would try to send him something tomorrow.  His actual
birthday is on the 22nd so he still has no idea.
Thank you and perhaps we can all get together on your next trip to NY.
Be well and have a happy holiday season.
Hillary

Hi Hillary, hope you are well.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it
tomorrow.  I just couldn't work out the schedule, but it was extremely
thoughtful of you to invite me.  I hope you have a great time.....(I'll
send something to Ben in the gallery tomorrow)...

Best,

Jeff

Jeff,
It was a pleasure meeting you on Saturday evening.  I hope that you will be
able to join us for Ben's 30th celebration.  I would love to send you an
official invitation so if you wouldn't mind sending your address to me via
this email I'd be happy to send you all of the details.
Saturday, December 16th at 8:45pm at Gonzales y Gonzales, dinner and
dancing.
If you can make it let me know.
Thanks,
Hillary
