Subject: Subscription Renewal

Dear Jeff:

This is to inform you that the following subscriptions are up for renewal:

Forbes
Futures/The Magazine of Commodities & Options
Gas Utility Report
Harvard Business Review
Inside Ferc

In the past, such renewals were routed to Info Central to be paid.  Our 
department has changed its focus to research.
If you would like to renew as a courtesy, we would be happy to take care of 
this for you.  We will contact the publisher and let them know that for the 
next renewal to send the invoice directly to you, and from then on, you would 
take care of payment.
Please let me know if you would like to renew this publication, as it will 
expire shortly.

Sincerely,

Susan Kennedy
713/853-9135
