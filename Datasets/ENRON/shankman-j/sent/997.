Jeff/ John--I left a voice message  with you re: the attached.

BICC ( formerly known as General Cable)  is one of  EES's key national 
accounts. They have expressed interest  in whether  Enron might help them 
manage the  volumetric/price risk associated with  the below commodities. 
They have provided us this information  on a confidential basis. Are these 
volumes of interest to you? With whom might we work on your staff?

Thanks for  your help,

Chris,

Here's the amounts of metals and plastics that BICC uses.  I'm assuming these 
are annual numbers.  Thanks for your help.
