Notes for this Week's Report:

* The average daily number of Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen 
eleven-fold since September, from a daily average of 11 to an average-to-date 
for October of 121 trades per day. This upward trend has also been increasing 
significantly as Enron Metals has averaged better nearly 212 transactions per 
day on EOL for the last three trading days (16th, 17th and 18th of October).

* Average daily volumes for Austrian Power have dropped off considerably 
since September due to the inclusion last month of several very large OTC 
physical transactions, including a forward done with Slovenske Elektrarne 
A.S. which alone accounted for over 1,890,000 MWH.

* The average daily deal count and volumes for Swiss Power have returned to 
the levels seen prior to August.  Both the months of August and September 
included several very large OTC physical transactions which have not been 
seen so far this month.

* Average daily volumes for ENA - Canada East Gas have increased considerably 
since September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical 
transactions, including a forward done with the Westcourt Group, Inc. which 
alone accounted for over 33,167,715 MMBtu's.  At the same time, the average 
daily  deal count has decreased slightly.

* Average daily volumes for Central Gas have decreased considerably since 
September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical transactions, 
including three spot transactions done with the Trailblazer Pipeline Company 
and J. M. Huber Corporation.  Each of the three transactions alone accounted 
for over 140,630,000 MMBtu's.
