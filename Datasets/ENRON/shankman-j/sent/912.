Rick, fyi, we are contemplating signing a simple expression of interest 
letter with the Tampa Bay Port Authority for a potential site for an LNG 
Terminal to supply S. Florida markets.

Our development efforts to date have not been as focussed on T.B. as they 
have been on the Bahamas proposal.  However, we came across a potential site 
in the Tampa Bay port which meets many of our criteria for a terminal site  
(e.g. existing deep water port, sufficient acreage adjacent to the port, 
industrial zoning).  We have yet to test the rationale of injecting 
significant quantities of gas into that market location, but the port is 
willing to commit to exclusivity on their part until the end of the year.  In 
this period of time we can easily determine if the project makes sense.

I believe its a good defense against others making a similar move and we are 
committing to nothing and paying no dollars.

Please let me know if you concur.  The draft letter is attached below (I've 
got legal sign-off on it already).

Thanks
