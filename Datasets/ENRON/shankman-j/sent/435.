Love the new place!  Hopefully you kept warm last night!  (You didn't have to 
sleep in your car, did you?) (Or did you have to drink the champagne to keep 
from freezing?)   Unfortunately I won't know about the Lay's party until 
tomorrow.  Hopefully it will work out.  
My first party--first week in Feb--Ali's planning it.
Aren't I cooler than Kenneth's brother Mark?  Just checking.

Later

Jeff
