No problem.  Doug is a good guy that I want to put under contract.  What's 
the status with his immigration?  Could we be in a scenario that he has to 
work our of canada for a while?

Jeff,

Jane Allen and I met with Doug today to discuss the green card procedure for 
he and his wife.  We will start this process immediately, but it's a long 
road - approx 2.5 years.

Doug asked if we would be willing to cover immigration attorney fees for his 
wife should she find an employer willing to file for a work permit, but is 
unable to pay legal fees of  $2-3,000.  It is fairly common that Enron would 
cover legal fees for the spouse in this situation, but I will need your ok.

Shanna
