Subject: Happy New Year

Jeff,

It was a pleasure seeing you at the ENA party earlier this month. Thank you 
for your help and advice with regards to my new rotation. I am enjoying the 
new work immensely and have the opportunity to review all sort of new 
technologies and business plans. We recently  came up with the idea of 
creating a separate program aimed at the big energy companies in Houston 
whereby the generation of new ideas and technologies aimed at the energy 
industry could be outsourced to the Houston Technology Center and therefore 
benefit from a level of freedom and flexibility that is difficult to achieve 
within the hierarchical structures of most big energy players in town. These 
"idea labs" would be set up as separate companies and would only require 
funding from investors such as Shell, Exxon Mobil, and the likes. I assume 
that Enron would not be particularly interested  given its own internal 
entrepreneurial spirit although it could benefit from the exposure to such 
new  ventures and potentially find candidates with technologies it might 
want  to invest in. This idea was just recently floated and no real steps 
have been taken in any direction which is why I am wondering if I can ask you 
for your opinion. Please let me know of any questions you might have and have 
a wonderful holiday.

Again thank you and my best wishes for the New Year
Massimo
