Jeff,
We realize that you are no longer a direct report to Greg, however, he would 
like you to submit feedback on him as a "direct report" from the  good old 
ENA trading days.  READ BELOW

Many Thanks,

Liz

Well, we finally got Greg Whalley enrolled in the "Executive Impact & 
Influence" seminar.  Each of you have been listed for feedback in the "direct 
report" category.  It is crucial to Greg's success in the program that all 
feedback to be submitted.  Don't let this opportunity pass you by!

I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to make sure you are in receipt 
of the feedback forms.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
