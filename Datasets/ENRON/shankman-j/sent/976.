Very strong need for people in Japan next august.  I'd like to get some 
people interested in helping start there, or get there after some enron 
indoctrination.  Thanks.  Jeff

I asked Tess about Japan while we were up at Wharton and she wanted to try to 
remain under the radar screen as far as her Japanese expertise because she 
was trying to get some personal issues resolved.  She also wanted to stick it 
out in the Steel Group until some of the uncertaintly was resolved.

I agree that we should put Chris on the resume list.  I am very hesitant to 
guarantee or even indicate where people would go once they get to Enron 
during the interview process.  I know that last year we were looking for 
people who were interested in Asian opportunities (especially Korea and 
China), yet by the time these folks started we no longer had opportunities 
available there, leading to a lot of disappointment and disenchantment with 
Enron.  Jeff, how likely is it that we will still have a strong need for 
people in Japan next August?

I think he has a strong resume.  He's definitely worth putting on the 
interview list.

As for Japan opportunities, is there a way to get Tess Dyar plugged into 
those?  She just started (from Wharton) after spending nearly 10 years at 
Goldman in Japan.  She definitely has an interest in continuing her work with 
the country.  I think she's been a little disappointed since getting here and 
seeing APACHI dissolved.

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Christopher Handte
