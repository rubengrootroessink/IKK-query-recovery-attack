Okay, we've finally got it.  This meeting (in regards to the EOC charge for Claude Straub) is set up for this Friday, 7/20 from 2:00-3:00 p.m. in EB3824.
 
I have left a message with John Nowlan's assistant (Helen Taylor) to let us know when would be a good time for John to be contacted in London on either Monday or Tuesday.
 
Thanks,
Angie O'Brian
