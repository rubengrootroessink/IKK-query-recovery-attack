Karen, 

Please extend my personal thanks to Jeff and the others involved for the video conference last Friday.  A few highlights for me:

Jeff/Enron's attention to the speaker's background--referencing the questioner's resume in formulation of his response--was impressive.  Further, as the vast majority of the attendees on the UT side were first year students concerned with future employment, the fact that someone as high-level as Jeff looked at the resumes was of real value.  That level of exposure can be hard to come by. 
The relaxed atmosphere was also pleasant and encouraged the question-and-answer process.  
It was abundantly clear that Jeff was eager and able to authoriatatively speak on a wide variety of topics.  This was the heart of the value of the conference.

Thanks again and best regards,
Charles Earthman 
Class of 2002
