Jeff,

Hi, I Donnis, Jennifer's mom.  I know we have not formally met but I fill like I know you.

Jeff, I am in serious trouble.  During my dad's last few months, I had to pay his expenses plus most of his funeral. As a result, I am now in forclosure on my home.  The worst part of that is my husband does not know.  He can't find out because he would kill me and I am not just using that as a figure of speech. I am very scared.  Jennifer must not know because she is on top of the world right now and she doesn't need to have my worrries.

Jeff could you please loan me $6500 just for a few months.  I can reinstate the loan but I have to do it within the next 24 hours.

I know this is very strange for you but I am so desperate that I can not eat or sleep.

I am not usually like this but I have noone that can help me.

I can be reached at 281-703-5935.

Thanks,

Donnis
