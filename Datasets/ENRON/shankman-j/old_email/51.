Hi Jeff!

This is so very exciting! I will write you an official "thank you" from
Temple, but I also wanted to fly you an email again. I look forward to your
Bulletin Article and as a mother of 2 Youth Groupers, I would love it when
you are in town some time next year (youth group is kind of down for the
summer now) to have you come and speak to the kids, if you would. All of us
ex-TYGers have a powerful message and yours will certainly reach these kids.
Thank you again!

Warm regards,
Julie Benson
