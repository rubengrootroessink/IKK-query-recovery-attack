Dear Jeff: 
Here's a copy of the letter I received from Italy. I will keep trying for you. 
Peter 
Hallo Peter, 
We are all glad you are doing well. The latest news shocked all Europe too, and thinghs are changed here as well. Today Mr. George Bush senior is here in Milano, and the city is on siege. There are the fashion shows on right now, but everybody is really laying low... 
 But eventually, and hopefully, things will settle, and (hopefully) business will be as usual again. 
Your Mies chair was quite a lucky find! Giovanni and I were looking for a similar chair for a while, but came out empty handed. All the other Design dealers we know have'nt seen one for a while... but we'll keep looking. 
We were also planning a visit to the NY Modernism show at the beginning of November. We thought they were going to cancel the event.... but they said "business as usual"! 
And we were happy to hear this. So we will be in the USA for a while, and a trip to Houston could be part of it.
