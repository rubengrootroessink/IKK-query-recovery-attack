Jeff,
Thank you very much.  I understand the agreement for Dec. and I will not let you down.  I will be in the office in about 2hrs., can you leave an envelope for me at the security desk in the Enron bldg.?  I work at 2AC and my ext. is 5-5667.

I just want you to know that I am very proud of Jennifer and I know that she respects you and enjoys working for you.  Thank you for giving her the opportunity of a life time.

Once again, thank you and I am going to get out of my situation because I can do better.
