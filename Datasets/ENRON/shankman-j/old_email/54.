Jeff

First, let me say on behalf of The Temple how grateful I am for your desire
to make this contribution.  This will certainly make a difference for Temple
youth and I am glad to be able to help put this together.

I am sorry for your frustration. I hope to minimize that from here on out.
I am attaching a prototype of the resolution the board would pass
documenting your wishes.  Hopefully this will attach, if not call me when
you return from your trip. As you can see there will be a couple of things
to work out and I do have some suggestions for you. I will check the names
other funds to make sure they are sufficiently distinct, although I think it
will be no problem.

Give me a call after you have had a chance to look at these.
