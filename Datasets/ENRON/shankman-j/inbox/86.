Electricity  Risk Management 101 Workshop 
And
Portfolio  Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference
January  22-25, 2002, New York City, NY
 
OVERVIEW
 

In the current environment of  volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more  important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI  presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk  management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior  experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts  in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the  more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

Transmission  Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference
Feb.  5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida
OVERVIEW

 
This conference will examine the  business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in  effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger  and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO  initiatives.  The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.
