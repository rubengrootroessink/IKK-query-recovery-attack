Jeff:

You and Mike were given limited authority by EEL to sign employment agreements for European EGM employees.You are not on the board nor are you an officer.

I am scheduled to meet with you and Mike at 3:00 today. We can discuss these issues and others that you want to address.

Alan

Alan, where is the special narrative of my EEL board membership.  Should I resign from all of these companies immediately?

Mike/Jeff:

Attached is a list from the Enron Corporate Secretay's Office of the Enron companies where you are a Board member and/or an officer, noting your title.

It is my understanding that the Enron Director/Officer Liability Insurance Policy does apply to directors/officers of each of these companies.

Let me know what questions you have and I'll do my best to answer them or promptly find an answer.

Regards, Alan
