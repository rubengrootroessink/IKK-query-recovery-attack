Jeff,

We have been working to try and get the crude products available in yen, but have not had much luck after Darren left.  You can see the general summary of the situation below.  We'd like to get the product up and believe that with some basic publicity it could be quite successful.  Any ideas on how to overcome these points?

Joe

Joe

After spending some time with Houston and London people over the past 2 weeks, the conclusion is that George cannot be up and running within the next 2-3 months. Obtaining live FX quotes is the major issue. Options that we considered were:

(a) Connect up to a bank's FX online system

Shane Dallman (UK) identified potential issues with this, the main one being technical issues associated with the EOL application. After consulting with EOL people, it appears the FX manager application is not suitable for linking to an external party at the moment. They are working on these issues as part of a larger development project but I cannot get a clear timetable out of them

(b) Get Thomas Cheng to run the FX manager

Issues include: 
* Thomas doesn't feel comfortable having to watch the FX market on a real time basis and update prices accordingly, given most of his time is spent on metals
* In that case, FX group would like automatic updates of the FX price from the market so he would not have to watch it all the time (we then get back to IT issues which Shane is checking out)

(c) Get a FX trader in Japan

The FX group is currently considering their staffing requirements but Pushkar Shahi (Director, FX Houston) said that there are no immediate plans to get someone out here.

I will keep monitoring the FX situation. Perhaps if you have time next week, you could speak to Gary Hickerson to get his thoughts.

Regards
Rousseau
