Hi Laura,

I was just called into a meeting with Ken Lay, and Greg Whalley, the CEO
and President, respectively, of Enron at 3:00 pm central time.
Unfortunately we will have to reschedule our call.  I am copying my asst,
Jennifer Burns, on this, so she can facilitate our rescheduling the demo.

Thanks for understanding, and I look forward to speaking with you.

Jeff

   Hi Jeff.  Thanks to Jenne for the introduction. Bob Verratti tells me
   that
   we are confirmed for a call and web-ex demo at 1:30 Pacific tomorrow,
   Wednesday, November 14. I will call you at (713) 853-1761 and the demo
   will
   be directed to your email address. We have had extensive discussions
   about
   the Opt4 platform with Greg Whalley, Greg Piper, Jay Webb and a number
   of
   others at Enron and I look forward to having the opportunity to
   demonstrate
   it for you.  Although the Opt4 platform can be used for many purposes,
   its
   unique application is in the trading of customized (OTC style)
   derivatives
   for any underlying market. The platform itself  allows an infinite
   amount of
   deal customization which we have chosen to constrain through the use of
   "smart templates" each of which reflects a structure recognized and
   traded
   on the OTC.  Traders then specify all terms within the template and post
   bids, offers or RFQ's to the site. All activity on the site (both
   postings
   and trade match) are constrained by our "pre-permissioning" system which
   checks in real time the trade specific and portfolio VaR to assure head
   room
   limits would not be exceeded.   We have spent a year building out with
   BOTCC
   the first ever clearing interface capable of handling this level of
   trade
   customization.  All standard clearance and settlement services are
   available
   through our  strategic partnership with BOTCC.  The end result is a
   fully
   integrated solution bringing transparency and credit support to OTC
   markets,
   whether in emerging markets such as chemicals, weather, or steel, or in
   established commodity and financial markets.  Our target customers fall
   into
   three categories:  1) established exchanges wanting to expand into
   customized trades linked to their existing product lines, 2) dealers or
   market makers seeking to automate and expand their phone business, 3)
   B2B's
   wanting to offer risk management products to support their cash market
   trading. The attached documents are quite high level but may help to get
   you
   oriented before our call tomorrow. They include a brief description of
   the
   Company, product summary,  a synopsis of platform functionality and
   hosting
   services and a white paper on our proprietary permssioning and risk
   management systems. I'll look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.
