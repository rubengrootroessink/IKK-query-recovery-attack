Jeff-
I was going through my emails when I came across one from you to
which I never responded. A few days after you asked if I was working
with anthrax, I was whisked to DCv on a charter flight to assist with
the investigation there.
It was an amazing and intense experience during which I learned a
tremendous amount. It was very different being a part of a team, as
opposed to directing an investigation. I unfortunately did not have
much time to explore DC, although we were staying in a very nice part
of Dupont Circle. I am happy to be back in Atlanta (where I have been
for only 3 weeks since July). I still have quite a bit of work to
complete related to the investigation before letting the rest of the
team make their advice, suggestions, and contributions.
How have you been? I read briefly that Enron was having some tough
times. Did this affect you directly, or were the happenings in
another division?
Are you going back to Louisville for Thanksgiving or will you be
traveling? I will be here in Atlanta, working, and hopefully taking a
couple of hours off to enjoy a little turkey nwith friends.
The PennAtlanta alumni club will be holding an holiday party in 2
weeks which I hope to attend if I am in town. I know 2 other other
Penn-Atlanta couples, so perhaps it will be a good way to reconnect
with some people. Does Houston have any similar events?
I hope that things are going well for you. I will be an aunt by the
time that I will next speak to you!!!!
Best,
andi
