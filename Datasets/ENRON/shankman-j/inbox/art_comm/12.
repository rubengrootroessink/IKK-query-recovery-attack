Dear Jeff:

I spoke to you at the Chicago Fair & have asked Mai to email you
images & information for the 2 Burtynsky images you were interested
in.

We were very successful with Ed's work at the fair and the 40x50"
Rock of Ages #7 that was at the Chicago Fair sold. All of the
Burtynsky prints we exhibited were sold as well as others. The last
print from the 40x50" edition priced at $6,100. may be released to us
in the beginning of June. Please let me know if you would be
interested in this print and I can hold it for you if it is released
to us. It is the very last 40x50" print of this very popular image.

We'll mail you an information package on Ed Burtynsky as soon as we
receive copies of the most recent press. As I may have mentioned to
you at the fair, Ed has received a lot of very favorable press
recently including a review of our show in the current issue of
ArtNews. He has an upcoming retrospective exhibition at the Canadian
National Gallery of Art and a one-person exhibition at Toronto's
prestigious venue The Power Plant.Two publishers have expressed
interest in publishing a monograph for Ed. So it's a very exciting
time for Burtrynsky; his career is really taking off.

If I can answer any questions for you, please email me or give me a
call 415-421-0122. Please let me know about Rock of Ages #7.

Ada Takahashi
