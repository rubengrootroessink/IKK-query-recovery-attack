Dear Mr. Shankman,

last Friday our new show

"2 Painters - 2 Sculptors: Johannes H?ppi, Nikolaus List - Thadd?us H?ppi, Marcus Weber"

was opened with great success. All visitors - including some curators - where enthusiastic about the show and the works. Many works where already sold at the opening reception.

Unfortunately we where not able to update our website properly until yesterday. Now, all information (images, exhibition view, press release etc.) are on the site. If you visited our site and if you where wondering about the little information about the show, a revisit is a good idea.

The pages about the show are linked directly from our start page at:

http://www.galerie-haus-schneider.com

We also would like to inform you, that we will participate at the following artfairs:

ART COLOGNE: 31.October - 4.November.2001
Booth 1.1. A 14

ART ATHINA (Athens, Greece): 22.November. - 26.November.2001

We will send you another newsletter about our participation at those fairs in the next weeks.

Warmest regards,

Heinz-Martin Weigand
