Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the fax about the dunand tea set.  I'm still doing some research into it.  Do you have an idea when I should expect the Fedex of the two pieces I bought about 10 days ago.  I'll be out of the office next week, but you may comminicate with my asst Jennifer Burns at 1-713 853 9440 when to expect it.

Best Regards,

Jeff Shankman
