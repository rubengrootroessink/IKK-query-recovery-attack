Dear Jeff,

I have not received any payment from the following Pledges to our annual
gala which took place on April 7, 2001:

Natsource        Contact:                 Address:
EDF Mann         Contact:                 Address:
Banque Paribas   Contact:                 Address:
Spectron         Contact:                 Address:

I have pledges of $5,000 from each company.  Marti told me that you did
write to the appropriate contacts.  Do we need to follow up again?

I do want to close out the gala pledges by June 30, 2001.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Please let me know what I can
do to help.  My direct line is 713-284-8262.

Grace Pierce
Assistant Director of Development
