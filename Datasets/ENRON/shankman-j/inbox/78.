Throughout this holiday season we have been reminded by press and media of
the changes to our lives' normality because of the events these last few
months.  When we travel we observe uniformed soldiers and added security
that tell us our way of living and business conduct has forever changed.

The messages of this holiday season, Hope, Peace, Love and Joy have
significant meaning.  All our hearts desire these feelings to endure.
Perhaps like never before we should commit to be instruments that bring
Hope, Peace, Love and Joy to our country and to our world.  Our faith in
those principles and ideas that have carried us and made us great has been
renewed.  Our resolve to make a difference in every endeavor has been
strengthened.  We know we will get better after being in the valley of
adversity and trial.

Tom James Company and all our employees across the United States, the United
Kingdom, Japan and Holland join me in thanking you for your business in
2001.  We have been tested and we are strengthened.  Our partners, who call
on you, are better equipped entering 2002 than ever before to serve you.  We
have significantly added quality products in all our price points and
expanded our casual wear.  The addition in 2001 of the finest footwear made
in the world has given us the highest quality footwear product available.

Our partners in our 11 factories have been touched by the events of
September 11th and after.  Most of our manufacturing facilities are in the
Northeast part of the United States.  Tom James, like so many others,
experienced loss.  So, going forward forever in our memories will be the
faces and pictures of 2001.

Our commitment to you is to be better and our obligation to life is to give
back to life with what we are and who we become.  Your patronage is very
important to Tom James.  Please let us know when we do not perform to your
expectation.  Our guarantee is 100% satisfaction.  We live by our creed.

Thank you for helping us enjoy a fine year.  We will pursue excellence in
serving you, our valued client.  Best wishes for your continued health,
happiness and prosperity in the New Year.

Happy Holidays!
Respect and Regards
Robert F. Sherrer
Chairman and President, Tom James Company
