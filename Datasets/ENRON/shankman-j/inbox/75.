Wharton Connect
December 2001						Volume 1     Issue 2


Dear Alumni:

In a year of great change in the world, Wharton alumni have come together as never before.  In my position as Associate Dean, I have held a unique vantage point in seeing how you have helped and supported one another personally and professionally in good times and difficult ones.

I would ask you to consider yet another way that you could make an impact on the Wharton network.  As you can imagine, in the current economy, it has been especially challenging for our students as they embark on their job searches.  We are about to embark on a new mentoring program in the School, which will bring current and future alumni together.  Please read the story below for more details about how you could help in this effort next year.

As 2001 draws to a close, let me take the opportunity to wish you and yours a very happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year.

Sincerely,
Steven Oliveira
Associate Dean
Wharton External Affairs

Wharton [Connect]: On the Road Again!

On October 24, the largest group of alumni yet came together for a Wharton [Connect] (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni/connect/index.html) event.  Close to 300 alumni gathered at the Menlo Circus Club in Atherton, CA to hear the latest developments at the School from Dean Pat Harker.  Jon Huntsman, W'59, Chairman of the Board of Overseers, shared his thoughts about staying active with the Wharton network.   John Dean, WG'74, and the Wharton Club of Northern California were co-hosts of the evening along with the School.

In addition, Dean Harker met with alumni and other business leaders in Mumbai, India in November in two very well attended events.   The first was a panel discussion entitled, "The Challenges of Leading in Turbulent Times," which was carried by CNBC in India and parts of Asia.  The Dean also met with alumni and parents of students for a special briefing over lunch.  Wharton's network in this part of the world is strong, and enthusiasm for the School's initiatives runs very high.

These events were part of almost 30 Wharton [Connect] events Wharton will host over the next 18 months in order to bring alumni closer to one another and to the School.  The next events will be in Miami on Thursday, January 10; Palm Beach on January 12;  Monterrey, Mexico on January 15; and Hong Kong on January 22. Visit the Wharton [Connect] website (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni/connect/index.html) to see pictures of previous events, as well as learn more about when a Wharton [Connect] event may be coming to your city.

--------------------------------------------------------------

New Mentoring Program for Future Alumni

Graduates of the School and "future alumni" are about to be linked in a new program that will connect generations within the Wharton experience.  The inaugural offering of the new Wharton Alumni/Student Network will be a mentoring program that will give current students the opportunity to learn from the expertise of the School's alumni.  More details will be sent shortly, but if you are interested in mentoring the next generation of Wharton alumni, e-mail alumni.affairs@wharton.upenn.edu.

Wharton Fellows - Exclusive Decision Support Network for Transformation Leaders

The Wharton Fellows program (http://fellows.wharton.upenn.edu/) is designed for a select group of senior executives who are charged with leading transformation in their firms.  The program structure includes a CEO and a transformation agent track; short sessions in diverse locations around the world; "living cases" through company visits with senior leaders, and continuous networked access via an exclusive online community.  For more information, please contact: Ray Del Bianco, Director, Business Development at 215.573.9205 or delbianr@wharton.upenn.edu.

Live! From the Corner of 38th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia

Progress continues towards the construction of Jon M. Hunstman Hall, the School's new 300,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art academic center.   The Huntsman Hall website (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/news/building/index.html) provides facts about the new building, a "virtual tour" of the completed structure, and a "Livecam" view of the site.  Huntsman Hall will open for students in August 2002.

Have You Caught the WAVE?

The Wharton Alumni Virtual Experience (WAVE) offers alumni a password-protected, searchable alumni database, message boards and chat rooms, lifelong e-mail (a Wharton-specific, e-mail forwarding address system) and electronic mailing lists to create and join. This on-line community will only be as dynamic as the participation level of our alumni, so we hope you will visit the site often at http://wave.wharton.upenn.edu.
