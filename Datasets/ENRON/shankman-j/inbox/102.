		I was just cleaning out my mailboxes, and hoped the tone of
my last one
		wasn't misinterpreted by you.  Sorry--but you know I'm still
that same
		loveable guy.

		I think I'll be in NYC toward the end of next week.  Drinks?
I'll bring
		the watch for you to wear out to the bars, so you can see
how it attracts
		the ladies.

		Later,

		Jeff

		           Bubbee,

		           How's it going?  Definitely, next time I'm in NY,
I'll let
		   you take me
		           to dinner--at least drinks.  By the way, I don't
know if you
		   know that
		           I'm currently offerring a car to anyone who finds
me a wife.
		   Keep it in
		           mind.

		           Anyway,  I paid $10,900 plus tax, total
$11799.25.  For you
		   $6,000.
		           There are no more available, only 1912 were made
in total.
		   (divided
		           between white, yellow and rose gold.)  1912 was
when the
		   model came out,
		           and this was a reissue.  I have all papers, and
box.

		           Find me a girlfriend, please.

		           Jeff
