Jeff,
 
Here is a resume for a potential trader.  Julie Lim, an associate that used to work here before she went to Harvard recommended him to me.  I have not met the guy, but thought it was worth a look.  Let me know if you would like me to contact him.
 
Thanks,
Justin

Hi Justin,
 
Heres the resume. If you have a problem with the cell number then just email me and I will call you back. Cellular service is very patchy in NYC these days.
 
Best Regards,

Hi Justin,
 
Julie Lim said I could get in touch with you in response to my questions on Enron's energy trading business and my interest in working for such a business.
 
My experience has been in institutional sales & trading of mostly Asian equities, servicing fund managers in Asia, Australia and North America and in the last couple of years I have been helping startups with strategic business development.
 
Thanks in advance for volunteering to chat with me; let me know when would be good time and if it would be OK to send you my resume.
 
Best regards,
