     Just after your email someone came to my shop and expressed interest in
the Knox Cup. . .so I didn't reply until interest waned.  This Knox cup is a
variant of the cup that is on the cover of Steve Martin's book.   Steve has
now brought out a new book on Knox and this cup is illustrated in it.   You
might be able to get the book from Amazon.com.   Full title is: Archibald
Knox by  Stephen A Martin.  Artmedia Press.
