Mike,

I had a short conversation with Michael Brown regarding this organizational announcement.  As you can see, Eric Shaw is now responsible among other areas LNG terminal development in Europe.  Michael explained that this expansion of EEL's efforts was at the initiative of John Sheriff.  He recommended that you and John have a conversation in order to agree on our groups responsibilities and efforts.  As per our 2002 plan we have already begun the review of Europe to determine the economic feasibility of a terminal with the objective of making a determination in Q1 2002.

I agree with Michael in that it would be my preference for you and John to iron this out as opposed to having conflicts at the working levels among our groups.  Obviously, we need the EEL gas desk to make a sharp market for current and future LNG deliveries.

My pitch to John would be that we would like to have a similar relationship with EEL as we do with ENA.  (i.e. they make a market for pipeline gas and we develop terminals, we take terminal positions, we build and manage the global Enron merchant portfolio, etc.)  Two obvious benefits to our current structure are a coherent global LNG strategy and one risk book to manage the associated business risks.

Regards,
Eric
