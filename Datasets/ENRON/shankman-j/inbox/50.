OK. let me know what time works and we'll meet.  I also have ( I need to
look for it) a whole bunch of magazine cutouts that I had gathered earlier
when you first bought your house to show you.  These are just examples of
possible styles, tables, accessories etc. that you might like and that I can
help you find to place in your house.  We can go over these as well if you
want. I also have books I can lend you for you to look through and let me
know if you like something.
Tina

   Importance:  High

   I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a ribbed
   off
   white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
   Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
   Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
   I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing your
   house
   ( I hear it's empty).
   If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can
   meet
   you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that I
   can
   stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.  Fabric
   can
   be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
   I think 2 day is plenty of time.

   50% now - (not including taxes)
   50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery (6-8
   wks.).

   Need now
   $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
   I will give you a receipt.
   Let me know when you can see the fabric........
   Tina

   Good.  I'm going to Cabo thursday and will be back early sunday.  If you
   have a few samples, I'll pick one, and well go forward.  Can we order
   the 3
   sofas, and send them the fabric when it comes so we can get in the line
   of
   orders?  No problem on the check.

   What do you think of them?  Be brutal.

      Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
      Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
      I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one
   you
      need
      at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture
      stores
      only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if
      they
      are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday
   during
      lunch
      and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to
   order
      the
      fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.
   Also,
      I'll
      find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then
      the
      other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.
   Checks
      payable to me and I pay with my company check.
      I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
      Sound good?

      Holy cow this is expensive.  Of course I don't care about your 5% or
   so,
      but what is the retail on these babies?  I'm pretty flexible on the
      fabric--mid range would be fine.  Let's move ahead.  (2 loveseats
      though,
      not 1)  How long did they say?

         OK...
         Sofa = $4290
         Loveseat = $3300
         8.25% tax = $626.18.
         Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

         You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a
      30-35%
         discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can
   go
      to
         the
         Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose
   from.
      I
         have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but
   I'll
      get
         a
         range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and
         expensive
         type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.
         Thanks, Tina

         Hi Tina,

         Thanks for you help.

         The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly
      there.
         The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

         If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab
   that
         says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

         I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very
   plain
         off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor
      fabric.

         Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

         Regards,

         Jeff
