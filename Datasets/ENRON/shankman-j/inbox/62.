Hi Jeff:

I just got your message and am heading out the door again.  I spoke with
Chris Shelton about your Pesce mirror and silver projects.  He is going to
give you a call.  Since he is the one doing the work, he will have a better
idea than I about where/how he should receive the objects.

Let me know if you have not heard from him in the next day or so and I will
get on it.

Thanks!
