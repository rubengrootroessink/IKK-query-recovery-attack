Subject:	NOxTech Performance
Importance:	High

Yesterday we tried pushing the NOxTech perfromance for the first time on the 30 MW boiler at Mitsui Babcock's Technology Centre.  We achieved

Aprroximately 0.09 lb/mmBtu at less than 2 ppm ammonia slip, and
approximately 0.07 lb/mmBtu at less than 5 ppm ammonia slip.

We have indications that the kinetic limit for this process is lower than we first guessed, and probably extends down to 21 ppm NOx outlet or approximately 0.03 lb/mmBtu.  This all means that we are able to compete commercially with SCR systems on efficiency and cost, and meet all prospective NOx control regulations except in the very worst ozone non-attainment areas.

We are continuing testing to further evaluate the control system for the chemical injection grid.  Once that is completed, we will reposition the grid to study the effectiveness of injecting through the tubebanks, without incurring the expense of opening a dedicated cavlity.  I will be returning as planned on Wednesday.

Congratulations team, you've just made the world a safer place for air-breathing mammals everywhere!!!
Vince

I heard a rumor that we're in the money on NOxTech?  Congradulations!
