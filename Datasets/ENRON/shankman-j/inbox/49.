Jeff - Fred is half the firm of Resnicow/Schroeder, who we have hired
(approved by the board in Sept.) to work with us in developing our new
strategic plan.  They are also going to develop our institutional identity
(brand!) and will rep us p.r. Wise in NYC and abroad, where we are mostly
ignored.   Sorry, should have caught you up before.
