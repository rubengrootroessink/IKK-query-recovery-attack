I am totally remiss!  I am only now sending  you the email you asked for with the breakdowns, etc.  The total sale was  $50,000, and I devised net prices as such:
 
KPM set: $25,000
Royal Copenhagen vase: $3,000
Mars Vallet bronze: $11,000
Rozenburg vase: $11,000
 
I've attached the original invoice for you as  well.
 
My Dear Jeff, I hope you are holding up through all  this shit that your company is putting you through and I am truly sorry that  it's happening to you.  You deserve a whole lot better than  this.
 
Love,
Ben
