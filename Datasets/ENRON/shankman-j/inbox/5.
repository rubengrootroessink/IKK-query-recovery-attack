Mike/Jeff,

Don't know if you have seen this, but believe it would be worthwhile to provide something like this to EGM.  This is certainly more info than is being made available via daily voice mails from OOC.


Joe

In the wake of what is happening with Enron's stock price and the publicity about the LJM partnership among other issues, we will be providing a daily report to you on what the press, our competitors and the analysts are saying about Enron.  There is clearly a lot of information out there - some good, some bad - and we want to make sure you are seeing as much of it as possible in an effort to keep you appraised of the latest actions being taken by the business.

The information contained within these reports is for each of you to distribute as necessary to your team members.  There are understandably a lot of questions that our staff has about the health of the business and, while we may not be in a position to answer all of their questions, the more information you can share with your teams, the further we can go in putting their concerns about the business to rest.

On a separate, but related note, we have put together some talking points for use by our traders and originators in addressing concerns raised by counterparties about the current issues Enron is facing.  We have a lot of positive things to say about the business, but we want to ensure that we are consistent in the messages we are giving to our counterparties.  To this end, we would ask that you distribute these messages as necessary to your team members.

Thank you.

John Sherriff & Michael Brown
