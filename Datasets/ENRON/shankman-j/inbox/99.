As an industry, the generation business has gradually moved from an
environment focused on surplus reserve requirements to one of highly
volatile prices and robust generation margin spikes.  As this shift has
occurred, the industry has had to adopt many of the risk management
practices employed in other commodity industries.  For the most part, these
risk management practices have their genesis in the financial markets, where
sophisticated tools have also been developed to measure the success of these
practices.

The most commonly recognized measure of profit exposure to unforeseen events
has been Value at Risk (VAR).  This Wall Street metric measures the
statistically supported loss exposure of a portfolio of assets and forward
positions to a short-term negative turn of events.  While this is a very
useful measure of a speculative trading portfolio, its value does not
translate easily to measuring exposure of generation assets to profit
erosion.

Savvy power companies are deploying an additional risk metric, Profit at
Risk, to more accurately assess risks specific to the volatile electricity
trading market.  A key feature of PAR is that, unlike VAR, it assumes that
positions will be taken through to delivery rather than closed out.  The
full financial risk of highly volatile spot prices and volume risks
including unplanned outages, sudden increases in demand and delivery
failures by contract partners, is comprehended in this metric.

A blend of VAR and PAR risk metrics will create links between the front,
middle and back office trading operations, allowing traders to operate
within established risk parameters that both protect the enterprise and
maximize trading profits.
