As I mentioned in our meeting the other day EGLI buys approximately 9,000 MMbtus per day of natural gas for the Morgan's Pt. MTBE plant. Since the price risk of this natural gas is for the account of EGLI I would appreciate your help as to when is a good buying opportunity for physical or financial natural gas. During July through September we bought on a floating price since the market was going down during each of those months. For October we bought fixed at $1.94/MMbtu. We purchase the physical gas from AEP delivered through the old HPL system.
