Hi Jeffrey:

I was just thinking of e-mailing you -- happy birthday, or happy birthday 3
days late!  I can never remeber if it is the 21st or the 24th?  Which is it?

I don't know that I'm really used to being someone's mother.  I prefer to
think of myself as an older sister. :)  Michael gets really annoyed (and I
think scared) when I say that.  I'm actually in tampa right now visiting for
a couple weeks (until June 7th).  Lezzie is coming in too this weekend with
her daughter, who my father described as "the Bruiser".  Apparently, she's on
the larger side.  Not even fat, just LARGE. Ann Kelley will also be here with
her daughter.

I will call you while I am here - maybe today or tomorrow.

Not neccessary, but if you want to send something to Quinn (perhaps a piggy
bank:) you could either send it to my parents house while I'm here or to our
address in Sao Paulo.   Below are both addresses.

I hope all is good with you  -- will call for an update.  And I'm very
saddened by the passing of the Couch Potato.  I feel as though we need to
have a service of somekind.  After the Delano-style pool, will there still be
room in your yard for a small burial site?:)
