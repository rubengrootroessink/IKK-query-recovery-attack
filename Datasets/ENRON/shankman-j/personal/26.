Dear Jeff --

So wonderful to see you yesterday and hear all your news.  I have mailed
your business card to my friend the star lobbyist, Vince Versage, and I am
sure he will be in touch.  You will really like him -- he is extremely
smart, extremely connected and -- most unusually in Washington -- seems to
have NO enemies whatsoever.  I can't tell you how rare this is -- and how
important for the clients!

On the other, more important front, please do give Elizabeth Danes (nice
name, don't you think?) a call the next time you're in New York.  She is 32,
very cute, very smart, very fun.  She is currently a principal with Capital
Z (a unit of the Zurich) and spends her life deciding which funds her fund
of funds should back.   Very well-traveled, lives in Tribeca... you will
really like her.

I can already see myself zipping around London in that adorable little
convertible.

Kisses and maniest thanks again for breakfast!
