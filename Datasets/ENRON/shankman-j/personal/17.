Hi Nicole!

Happy Birthday.  (Imagine a chorus singing).  Hope you've been well.  How's the family?  Details, please.Generally, things have been status quo around here--swamped in the office, although I've been on a lot of dates these last few months.  Surprisingly, I don't hate them all.  I've been travelling quite a bit and am ready for a little home life.  (Australia, London, Mexico, various U.S.etc, although, I'm trying not to go to Nigeria for a big deal we are working on.)  I'm putting in a pool, and hopefully, that will help me "vacation at home" a little.  It should be down in 2 months.  Of course it should have been done last year, but I have no time to do anything.  

Drop a line when you can....

Lots of love and hugs,

Jeff
