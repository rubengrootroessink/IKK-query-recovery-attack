ARTNET.COM BOOKSTORE ANNOUNCES SOME NEWLY UNCOVERED GEMS

**EARLY WORK OF CINDY SHERMAN features two scarcely-seen photographic series shot in 1976--"Bus Riders" and "Murder Mystery People." Previously only available directly through the publisher, artnet.com is proud to offer this rare monograph in a handsome clothbound format, that includes an audio CD of found sounds by "The Glove Compartment."

**Lately, one of our more frequent customer requests is for material on artist MATTHEW RITCHIE. In response we've tracked down a outstanding little catalogue published by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Miami. Entitled THE FAST SET, it contains excellent full-color reproductions, with texts by Ritchie and curator Bonnie Clearwater. It's a slim but densely packed and beautifully produced document that will be a must for all Ritchie fans.

**Another artist whose published work can be maddeningly difficult to locate is Czech photographer Josef Sudek. We're delighted to announce the arrival of JOSEF SUDEK: PIGMENT PRINTS by Salander-O'Reilly Galleries. The new volume documents his breakthrough works of the 1940s and 1950s, and includes studio pictures, landscapes, and architectural photography.
