Jeff,
Angela asked me to contact you regarding an introduction to the Private
Bank.  I know she outlined many of the Private Banks capabilities in your
meeting today, and as the next step she would like to bring me and the
applicable specialists out to see you to find advantageous solutions to your
situation.   Congratulations on your success at Enron.   I look forward to
meeting you.

Samantha
