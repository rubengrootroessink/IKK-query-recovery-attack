Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemster!

I got your email address from someone, I forgot who, and I thought I'd actually send a note.  How are you?  Where are you?  (Tampa last I heard).  What are you doing these days?  Please share all sorts of details.  

I've been in touch with several people over the years...Sarah Chang, Stefanie Verkauf, Dave Herman, and others....(If they knew I was emailing you, I'm sure they would all say hi)

Can you believe I've been in Texas 9 1/2 years?  

Let me know what's up!


Jeff
