The attacks on New York and Washington have stunned the world.  The magnitude
of the devastation and sheer barbarism of these acts utterly defy explanation.
Our community has been deeply affected by this tragedy.  In the coming days and
weeks, we will begin to learn just how many alumni, family members, colleagues
and associates have been personally touched -- and as a community, we mourn
their loss.

We are in the process of setting up means by which our alumni can share
information relevant to the whereabouts of themselves, their classmates, families
and friends, as well as links to other sites where information may be available.
Information will be available on the School's website at
http://www.wharton.upenn.edu.  Additional information regarding the University of
Pennsylvania's efforts for students, alumni, families, faculty and staff is available
at http://www.upenn.edu/emergencyinfosite.

These are times that challenge us all to reckon with the impact that such
unfathomable events have in our ability to move forward.  As an institution --
and as a worldwide community -- Wharton faces this task as well.

The Wharton School, from its founding and throughout its 120-year history, has
had a singular educational mission:  to create leaders.  Generations of men and
women from all over the world have come to the Wharton School to prepare for
leadership in the global society.  Wharton alumni are leaders of vision, of passion
and of the highest moral character.  An essential quality of their service to the
world is their deep respect for views of others and their commitment to unity and
cooperation.  Their contributions to the economic and social advancement of
humankind have consistently built a better future for the generations that follow.

What is clear and certain in the wake of these attacks is that the mission of this
institution is more important than ever.  We cannot falter in our ultimate purpose.
We must continue to offer today's - and tomorrow's - students the opportunities to
grow into leaders and to take on the mantle of global responsibility that is the
hallmark of all of our alumni throughout the world.

While we rededicate ourselves to our global mission of service and leadership, we
must also serve each other in this difficult time.  Above all, this is a tragedy of
personal, human impact.  We must console each other in our grief and join
together in a spirit of healing.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and our
entire Wharton community around the world.
