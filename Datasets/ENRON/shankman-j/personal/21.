eing someone's mother.  (Did I tell you my maids broke the couch potatoe?) =
 So how's everything?  Happy birthday, by the way.  What is your address do=
wn there?  What is the best place to send the kid something.  Maybe a nice =
metric toy.   =20

Subject:=09It's a menina...

Hi All:

Here's a picture of Quinn Isabel Costello, born on Sunday January 28th in S=
ao
Paulo, Brasil and weighing in at 3.1 kg (@6.5 lbs) and 50 cm (@19.5 inches)=
.

All three of us will be in the US for a visit sometime this summer (as soon
as Quinn gets her US and Brasilian passorts :), and we hope to see many of
you then.

In the meantime, please e-mail us with news about all of you in the outside
adult world -- we probably won't be getting out much for a couple of weeks.=
..
(*Please e-mail stefanie at her new address above.)

Tchau,

Stefanie and Michael
