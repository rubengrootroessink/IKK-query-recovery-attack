Thanks for the email.  Life is crazy--work of course is great, and every day I learn more, fire a few people, hire others, you know the usual.  I've been dating a few women, and have a few opportunities in NY, but no love connection yet.  How's it going for you?  What are you doing these days?  Are you hanging out in NY chasing Jewish babes?

I like the third paragraph of your email disclosure--very classy.

Be well,  Jeff

Just wanted to see how you are.
Hanging out in NY chasing Jewish babes? (A questionable hobby at best.)
