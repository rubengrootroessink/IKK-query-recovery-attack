It was nice talking last night.  Despite the fact that Jennifer told you
you're cranky a lot, you sound like you're doing much better than you were
a few months ago.  Hope that's the case.

I'd be happy to touch base with Dan/Elizabeth while they're in Florida or
take a stroll down Worth Ave. (<-:) with them, but I'm not sure at this
point when I'll have "designated free time" and I suspect they'll want to
spend time alone.  You can tell them I'm staying at The Breakers from 5/3
to 5/6.
