Hi Jeff,

Happy Birthday to you too!  I've been meaning to call
or write, but the last two weeks have been a little
crazy.  Our cat had to have surgery 2 weeks ago, last
week Maddie was sick all week, and on Sunday she feel
off the front steps and got a big black eye (very
impressive).

Not too much else is going on.  I'm still working 3
days a week, but will be going up to 4 in the fall.  I
feel pretty mixed about it.  I'm hoping that I'll
actually be less stressed because I'll have more time
to get my job done and won't have to do so much work
at home.  Of course I don't want to be away from
Maddie, but she's pretty happy going to day care, and
we'll enjoy the extra income.

We haven't traveled too much.  In October we went to
Oregon, March to Baltimore to visit family, and May to
Florida.  Sounds like you have been having some great
adventures!  Maddie travels pretty well but we're not
up for foreign travel yet.

Adam has begun a private practice.  So far lots of
referrals but few actual clients.  It takes a while
for these things to fall into place.

Maddie is doing well.  She wasn't really eating last
fall and winter, but she is getting back on track and
gaining weight.  She's lots of fun - silly and flirty
like her mother.  I'm going to be in big trouble when
she goes to Kutz.

I can't remember when I spoke to you last, but we had
kind of a difficult fall/winter.  Two friends died,
plus a few older relatives.  It's made us very
grateful for what we have.  We're hoping that the
cluster of bad things is gone now that spring is here!

Well, I'd love to talk to you sometime to hear more
about all your dates (I need to live vicariously
through you).  I have a great Jewish girl for you
here, but I don't know if she would ever move to
Houston.  Good luck with work stuff, and take good
care of yourself.

Lots of love, Nicole
