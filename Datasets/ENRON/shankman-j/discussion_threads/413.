   Veteran Was Behind Wheel in Lake Crash

    A part from an airplane that crashed in the Great Salt Lake on Sunday.
                       (Danny La/ The Salt Lake Tribune)

    BY NESREEN KHASHAN
    THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE

        GREAT SALT LAKE -- Tooele Valley Airport weekend manager Gary Parks
    heard the steady buzz of the KingAir Beech overhead.
        It was 5:20 p.m. on Sunday when he recognized the unmistakable
    sound of the twin-engine aircraft flying over the Great Salt Lake,
    minutes before it spiraled into the icy waters below, killing all nine
    people on board.
        When the plane went down, snow was driving down hard, and there was
    about a quarter-mile visibility around Tooele Valley, Parks said. While
    he wondered if the plane might land at a different airport, having
    unshakable confidence in John Cashman, the plane's veteran pilot, he
    didn't think the worst.
        "No, I didn't have a bad feeling," Parks said. "He was the best,
    most competent pilot I'd ever seen in my life."
        Today, federal investigators, including an official from the
    National Transportation Safety Board, are expected to begin examining
    the conditions that led to the crash. A barge hauling a crane is
    scheduled to arrive around noon to recover the shattered remains of the
    plane, which rests in about 5 feet of water 11 miles west and one mile
    north of the Salt Lake Marina.
        Preliminary reports indicate that the plane was flying under visual
    flight regulations, or VFR, which require that minimum visibility and
    weather standards be met, said Federal Aviation Administration
    spokesman Michael Fergus from Seattle. But federal investigators said
    there are no indications yet whether adverse weather played a role in
    the crash. Investigators still don't know if the pilot used or switched
    to flight instruments to navigate, which are most commonly used to
    compensate for poor visibility.
        The plane carrying Cashman and eight skydivers was returning from a
    weekend of jumping in Mesquite, Nev. Two of the skydivers, husband and
    wife, were the owners of Skydive Salt Lake, a Tooele-based company.
    Keith Stewart, the company's only other full-time employee, said the
    plane was used to make up to 23 jumps in Nevada from Friday through
    Sunday.
        Parks said he attempted to make radio contact with the plane
    immediately after he heard its engines. Investigators said Cashman
    never signaled for help, and Parks' efforts to reach the pilot were
    fruitless, he said.
        About five minutes later, the husband of one of the plane's
    passengers arrived at the airport to pick up his wife. Parks said at
    around 3:15 p.m. the man's wife had called her husband to say she was
    boarding.
        The 35-year-old plane didn't have a registered flight plan with the
    FAA. That meant airport officials didn't know it was in the air when
    Parks began calling around to see if the plane had landed at an
    alternate location. So when airport officials began searching for the
    aircraft about two hours after it disappeared, they examined several
    hours of radar reports to determine the plane's location, said Tooele
    County sheriff's Deputy Lt. Frank Park.
        Search-and-rescue officials believe that the four women and five
    men died instantly as the plane hit the water, fragmenting into pieces.

        Flying in from the southwest, the plane was probably making a
    180-degree turn into the Tooele airport runway when it went down,
    airport officials say.
        The first body was found at 1:30 a.m. Monday by the shores of the
    marina. During the next several hours, all nine bodies were recovered.
    Seven of the bodies were also found on the shore.
        Through the rest of Monday morning, a crew of at least three dozen
    on three boats concentrated on recovering personal effects from the
    plane.
        Brian Hall, one of the rescue workers who scoured the waters with
    flashlights that pierced the darkness, said the hardest part was "not
    knowing what you were going to find until you got there."
        Recovery crews retrieved foam pads, helmets, parachutes and other
    skydiving equipment.
        Parks said he was struck more than once by the commonplace items --
    like a single shoe floating in the water -- that were meticulously
    plucked from the scene. Most backpacks, duffle bags and other luggage
    that were floating were still zipped shut, but Parks recalled one large
    blue suitcase that had burst open, scattering articles of clothing over
    the water.
        "I've been doing this for a lot of years and it never gets easy,"
    Parks commented. "Unfortunately, any time you're involved with any
    tragedy like this, there will always be reminders of its personal
    nature."
        Monday's crash comes exactly five years after a small plane crash
    in Idaho in which six Utah businessmen and two pilots were killed.
