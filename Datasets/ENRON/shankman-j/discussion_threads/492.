Hi Jeff-
Has my Spec Markets professor been in touch with you yet?  I gave him your
card last week and he said he would contact you.  In case you want to
reach him directly, his contact info is:

Leonid Kogan
Assistant Professor of Finance
The Wharton School,
University of Pennsylvania
Phone: 215-898-7617
e-mail: lkogan@wharton.upenn.edu

On another note, all of campus was delighted that Billybob's reopened
today.  It is now run by his widow, since Billybob himself was shot last
Summer (as you remember, they found him in the walk-in freezer).  The
decor is back to the traditional "ghetto style," which means no more pink
walls or bad chinese food.  Forties of malt liquor will return in two
weeks once the liquor license is approved.

Looking forward to seeing you later in the semester...
Matt
