On another HR matter, I thought I'd tell you about Jannie Bonnard in the old 
Calme group.  Her work (for PRC and bonus process) was poor at best, late, 
and disorganized, and frequently wrong.  I can't imaging sending her to EES 
is a good idea.  I would terminate her.  

Sorry for the downer on this one.

Jeff
