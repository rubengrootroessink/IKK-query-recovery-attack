The US/UK Arbitrage book, the Finland Arbitrage book, and the Products 
Arbitrage book in Singapore have been shut down, and no positions are 
authorized to go into those books going forward.  In addition, all positions 
in those books must be pulled out as of today, and I want them removed from 
the P&L reports I get.

Also, we need to set up a separate book for the 24 hour, 4 cent wide EOL 
crude market.  

Thanks. 

Jeff
