Hey Jeff,

Sorry it took me so long to write.  I haven't actually
used my e-mail in about 2 months, but I'm trying to
turn over a new leaf.

Freak show, huh?  What's been going on?

Happy Belated Birthday.  Again, I'm so sorry I didn't
call you on the day.  I'm quite scattered now with
being a Mom and working 3 days a week.

Maddie is doing great.  She's 8 and 1/2 months now,
crawling up a storm, pulling herself up, drinking from
a straw, waving goodbye, and even dancing.  She's
still a pain in the ass at night however, waking up
2-4 times.  UUUGH!

I'd love to talk to you.  Here's my info AGAIN!
Nicole Lesser
37 Grant Street

Love you, Nicole
