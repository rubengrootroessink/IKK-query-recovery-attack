Hi Jeff,

How are things in Houston?  Sorry it's taken us so long to write.  No
excuses, just forgot actually.

Last night however, we heard about an art exhibit that will be here in
October called SOFA.  We were wondering if you were planning to come up for
that and thought we should shoot you an e-mail and find out.   Even if you
don't plan to come for that, we'd still love for you to come up and visit.
We have a few friends we'd like to introduce you to (no, Alyson has not
forgotten about your BMW offer).

Talk with you soon!

Jeff and Alyson Goldberg


ps - Alyson stopped working, so you can call her at our home any time
