Look forward to seeing you when next in New York. How did your presentation  
go at the board meeting? I guess it was overshadowed by the resignation and  
the price of the stock. Put on a covered call position. Stock at 37.5 sold  
the 1/04 40's at 9.60. . Am in Southampton for the weekend. 631-283 5417.  
Call if you have time. Regards, DAB
