Hi Phil, It was nice meeting you at Larry's bar mitzvah anniversary at the Temple a few weeks ago.  I was hoping you could help me with one more thing.  I've spoken with Mr Kennedy (I think) from bank of Lousiville, and I was a little confused after I hung up the phone.  As you know the 2 gifts of $50,000 each are for separate awards, etc.  Does Bank of Louisville know this? Or is it kept track of differently through the Temple.  I ask because when I told him both "scholarships" or funds were open to future additions via donations to them from whomever, he wasn't sure what I was talking about.  Should I make out 2 checks for $50k each payable to the Temple of Bank of Louisville?  Or 1 check for the total?  Any help would be appreciated as I'm anxious to get these open for future contributions.

Best regards,

Jeff

Jeff

First, let me say on behalf of The Temple how grateful I am for your desire
to make this contribution.  This will certainly make a difference for Temple
youth and I am glad to be able to help put this together.

I am sorry for your frustration. I hope to minimize that from here on out.
I am attaching a prototype of the resolution the board would pass
documenting your wishes.  Hopefully this will attach, if not call me when
you return from your trip. As you can see there will be a couple of things
to work out and I do have some suggestions for you. I will check the names
other funds to make sure they are sufficiently distinct, although I think it
will be no problem.

Give me a call after you have had a chance to look at these.
