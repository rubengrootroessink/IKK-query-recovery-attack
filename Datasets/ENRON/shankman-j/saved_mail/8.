Hi Jeff:

I think yesterday was Dave's birthday.  Sorry I wasn't around to remind you,
but maybe you remembered on your own :)  I still don't know what the hell his
e-mail is -- will you send it to me?

How are you?  How is work?  How is the house?  Did you put the pool in?
Whatever happened with Lisa?

All is good here, been traveling a little.  Attached is a picture of me and
Quinn from our last trip, mostly because I know it will freak you out :)
We're coming to the US next week.  We fly through Houston, but for about an
hour at 6am, so I'm guessing we won't see you:)

Write or call for a second when you can.  Want to know how you are.

Stefanie
