sounds like we are the hold-up .... that is probably a good sign.

- lets go ahead with Elsa; however, I think she should handle propane and heating oil as well; she probably should have one of her folks down on six.

Dave, our need is becoming acute for an interface with EGM, particularly around weather and propane.  Any news on your recruiting efforts?  Would like to get the resource(s) on board quickly so we can make some progress in July.

Thanks.

Richard
