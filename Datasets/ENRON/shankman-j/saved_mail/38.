Thanks for your email. I am very sorry but we sold this book the day after we
received your order. We did not realise that it was  someone else ordering it
and presumed it was from the same initial inquiry. However, we should be able
to locate another copy at the same price, if you would still like it. Once
again - many apologies.

Kind Regards - Nick Higbee
