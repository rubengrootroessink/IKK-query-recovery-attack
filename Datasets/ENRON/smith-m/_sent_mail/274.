Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mat
