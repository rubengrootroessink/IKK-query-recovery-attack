Angela,

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D Historicals Only"

Thanks.

Mat
