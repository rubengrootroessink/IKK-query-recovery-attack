I will take a look at it. It is valued correctly but for some reason that deals got booked with the 9th date so your p&l has some curve shift/changed deals to get you back to the full value.  
Our systems are down now but I will get the reports back to you asap.

Kam,

Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.  The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.  It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.  I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.  Thanks.

Mat
