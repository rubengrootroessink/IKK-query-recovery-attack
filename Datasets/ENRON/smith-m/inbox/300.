Hey Mat,

I would like to talk with you some more about some of
the things we talked about the other day on the phone.
 I hope that you didn't think that I was calling you
all this time because there was a problem.  I have
been calling because I think we had a good time, and
you are a great guy.  I would love to keep in touch
with you and chat.  I know things are hard because you
are far away ( and I am far away from you!), but I
would like to continue talking with you.

I'll try to get ahold of you in the next couple of
days.  Hope you day is good!

Christine:)
