Karen O'Day is setting it up in her absence.  I spoke with her yesterday and she is working on it.

Kam,

Apparently, Stephanie is out of the office, do you know if someone else can set up the EOL?

Your new cash books are being set up ASAP.  They tell me they will be ready no later than tomorrow.
Once those are set-up, Stephanie Sever will email you your new EOL id's.
