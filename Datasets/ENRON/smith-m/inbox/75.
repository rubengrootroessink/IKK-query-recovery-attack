Only submit your timesheet if you have exceptional time, or if your rotation information has changed.

 Sorry, we are no longer tracking overtime since you are salary based. 


To all A/A Pool members: 

?	It is important to inform us if you have exceptional time.

?	To those members who are submitting time to your assistant, please make sure the assistant forwards this information on to the A/A program. 

?	With the Roll-Out of SAP, you have the ability to go on-line @ http://ehronline.enron.com/ and input your time. 


I will continue to email for timesheets regardless if you go on-line. 

This memo is to inform you to complete your timesheet.


Quick Reminder: 

 You may receive your present or previous paychecks @ EB 1195
 (if delivery is not set-up to your location/mail stop). 


Thank You for Your Cooperation
