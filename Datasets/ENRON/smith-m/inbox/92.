Guys,

Some of you have noticed that on many of today's reports, we are able to see flow value for a meter for 5/1/2000, but the MDT column showed
"na" on the daily report. "na" is also shown on the historical report for the average of May.  It is very easy to get confused (at least I was in the beginnieng, even 
though I wrote the program myself) when you see things like this, you may ask why isn't the average the value shown for today since there is 
only one day's data? The answer is that they are from different cycles. Coding used the business logic that grab the flow value from the latest
successful cycle,  while always use the last cycle when deal with average. At the time of report generation if the last cycle is not available, this will
happen. Fortunately this only happens on the first day of each month.

Please explain this to those who may raise this question when they see this "discrepancy".
