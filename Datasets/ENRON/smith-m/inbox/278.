Hey everyone!
So, this Friday is my 27th (YIKES!!) birthday.  I plan on going over to Little Woodrows (by Brazos and Hadley) around 5:00 to celebrate.  Please come and help me forget that I'm that much closer to 30.  (No, Massimo, I'm not going to do 27 shots!)
Not sure what the plan is after Little Woodrows, but we'll go from there.
Feel free to invite anyone else I may have left off the list.
Hope to see you then!
Tara
