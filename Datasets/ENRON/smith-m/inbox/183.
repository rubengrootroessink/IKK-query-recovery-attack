Hey baby,
Well, as per usual, the plans are getting all botched.  Why can't people
just commit to a plan and roll with it?  Bill is now going to Disney...what
the f is that all about?  After checking into some new ideas (different
rental properties located near water) we quickly determined that that option
is near impossible at this late date.....	So, now we are trying a few last
ideas and have determined that most likely we will probably just have to
settle for chilling at the point, using Mom and Don's boat and tying up at
the sandbar with Kelly and Mike and their boat, bbq, beer and oh yea, lot's
of beer.  Come to think of it, that sounds great.  I think a few of my
girlfriends from Roch may join us as well.  Should be good!  So what does
your itinerary look likle?   love, k
