We are launching a number of committees to perform key functions across Enron.  Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company.  Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below.  Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance.  We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair.

VP PRC

The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.  Additionally, the VP PRC will review and propose changes to the PRC process, the performance evaluation criteria and the promotion criteria.

The VP PRC will be chaired by Dave Delainey and its membership is as follows:

Analyst/Associate Program

The most essential determinant of Enron's continued growth is our ability to attract and develop new talent.  The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area.  Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization.  We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program.  Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe.  The members of this committee are listed below.  Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.  Please join us in congratulating Billy on his new responsibilities.

Culture

We are combining the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility committees into a single corporate culture committee chaired by Ken Lay.  Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Kelly Kimberly will serve as executive directors of this committee.  This committee will focus on leadership and work-life issues (making it easier to attract and retain the best talent), in addition to continuing the work of the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility task forces.  The members of this committee are as follows:


Greg Adams	Louise Kitchen	Mark Palmer	
Shelley Corman	Michael Kopper	Paula Rieker	
Janet Dietrich	Richard Lewis	Jeff Shankman	
Jeff Donahue	Sean Long	Mitch Taylor	
Gene Humphrey	Dan McCarty	Mike Terraso	
Robert Jones	Jean Mrha		


The Corporate Policy Committee will conduct the MD PRC and review the recommendations of the other committees, giving substantial deference to the decisions of those other committees.  We will be forming other committees to deal with other significant functions, tasks and issues facing the company.
