View your SAP Inbox directly in Outlook! Introducing the SAP Office Connector! 
The SAP Office Connector is a piece of software that seamlessly displays your SAP Office folders as Outlook folders. You already have the SAP Office Connector if you have the new SAPGUI 4.6D installed. If you are an SAP user, there are several reasons why you might receive an SAP Office message: 
?	You are the agent for an SAP workflow item 
?	An error has occurred for which you are the person responsible 
?	Someone (or some process) just sent you SAP mail
You can launch attached links to SAP transactions directly from Outlook, including workflow tasks!
Use of the SAP Office Connector is optional. If you use SAP only to enter your timesheet information, you probably won't get much mail in your SAP Inbox - and so probably won't benefit from using this product.
In most cases, it will make sense to use the SAP Office Connector to view your SAP notifications INSTEAD of forwarding them out of SAP to your Enron Internet mail address.  If you have configured your SAP Office to forward your mail, you should delete the forwarding when you enable the MAPI Connector.  See the attached document for more details on forwarding.
NOTE: there are several SAP systems, including Apollo Production (FI) and HR Production. You (may) have a separate set of SAP Office folders in each system. Repeat the setup steps in the attachment for EACH SAP system you want to be displayed as folders in Outlook.
