As you already know Ozzie Pagan is leaving East Power Origination to pursue=
 a position in Enron's Energy Services.  Not only is he deserting us, but h=
e is stealing Christy Chapman away as well! (smile) Please join me in congr=
atulating them both, and wishing them much success in the future.  To see t=
hat they don't forget us too soon, let's make his and Christy's farewell a =
memorable one.  And what better way to do that than, of course.....Happy Ho=
ur....yea baby!
