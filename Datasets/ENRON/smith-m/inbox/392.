Thank you.  Kim Olinger faxed me a copy of the August production and it reflected the correct volumes (43,559 mmbtu).  We are now tied except for the 3/00 and 8/00 as I stated yesterday.

Marlo,

The name and number of the person to contact regarding the billing discrepancy for July 2001 is Mary Reid @ 213-244-3898.  Gasselect clearly shows only one trade for 43,559 mmbtu's from account 2527 to Z99.
