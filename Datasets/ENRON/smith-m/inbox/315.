I can come pick you up at around 1:00.  Do you need to be there an 1 1/2
early?  Call me to confirm.  I am not that busy today, and I have my car
already down here.  Plus, I want to say goodbye.

I'm on the 3 pm flight today.  If you wanted to take me, I wouldn't say
no, but, as always, don't feel like you have to...

Have you scheduled a flight?  Let me know what time.  I can probably
drive
you to the airport on my lunch.
