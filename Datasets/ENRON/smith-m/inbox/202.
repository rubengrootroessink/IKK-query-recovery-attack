um, I don't really know.  I did a search for "VB6" and did find one file.  When you get a chance, can you make the long journey across the isle to take a look.  Thanks.

Mat,

Do you have VB6 installed on your machine? If you have I can show you a few lines to do an experiment to see if SendKeys work with your program at all. If not, please come to my desk after 2pm.

Thanks,

Ronggen

Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.  Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required:


Enter
Alt-F
P
Enter
Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks.

Mat
