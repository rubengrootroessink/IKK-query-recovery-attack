As of this morning, Northwest - Cycle 3, 7, 9 and Kern's all cycle (1 - 4) all ran successfully yesterday, they were down since Sunday (NW) and Monday(Kern).  NW cycle 13, 6 ran as well.  Therefore, all cycles'data of NW and Kern were captured for 5/2/2001.  I just checked a minute ago, Kern and NW sites appear to be down again.
