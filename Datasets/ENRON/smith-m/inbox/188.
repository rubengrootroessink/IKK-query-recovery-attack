I have the changes in place in order to start capturing the storage balance(s) for the 2 identified PG&E points ("PG&E Storage" and "Wild Goose Storage").  The next scrape time for PG&E is 12:30 today, so we can evaluate the first run of these values shortly after that.

Through the end of the week (and even beyond), this data should be monitored closely, to make sure the calculations are correct.

Any questions/concerns, let me know.
