This is to let you know that for those of you who has a link to point to my machine to see the pipeline report, that link will not work any more. Because after checking with Tara and Matt, we made change in the report engine so that all reports are to write this folder O:\WebContent\Fundamentals\ENA\Gas\Pipelines\Ops Reports\. You'll need to go to http://gasfundy.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp, Testing section, and West Desk Operations Report, to see all the reports. 
Please forward the information to anyone who will run pipeline reports and not on my mailing list.  Thanks.
