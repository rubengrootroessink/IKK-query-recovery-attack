Tara and Matt,


Following is list of error message for west pl 6/05/2001 - 6/06/2001 as of this morning --



Pipeline Name		Msg_Received_DTM		Msg_Desc			Status
----------------------		------------------------------------	--------------------------		-----------------------------------
N/A			N/A				N/A				N/A







Notice --

Jaguar service was trurned off accidentally last night at about 5:00 pm.  It was turned back on this morining at about 7:50 am.  I checked all the job in DB and files in server folder and appear that all the data has been captured.  But we still need to verify cycle 1 and 2 for some of the sites because they may be the same.
