hey guys,

sorry for being such a bum by not keeping in touch.  i've been VERY stressed
recently.  i have pretty much avoided all communication with anyone and
locked myself indoors.  and, (you'll find this hard to believe), i haven't
even been going out!  i am really nervous about my exam, so i've just been
trying to concentrate on studying.  after my exam (2 weeks from wednesday),
 i will be SO ready to party.  i promise i'll get in touch afterwards.
until then, i am going to continue my seclusion...

see ya,
kathy
