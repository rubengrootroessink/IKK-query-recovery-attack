I discussed your request with my supervisor and we are happy to provide you=
 with the dialy use reports that you've requested for the points where you =
 actively move gas.  We do not have the resources at this time to provide d=
ata for all points on our system.  If you can give me a list of specific po=
ints I can get those for you by tomorrow afternoon.  I would suggest that y=
ou refer to our web site for other data.  Pipeviewer posts daily billing es=
timates for all meters and up to 30 days history for those meters.

Lori,

Can you please give me an estimate of when you can provide the requested
historical flows we discussed yesterday.  I'm trying to manage a number
of tasks that depend on this data,. and it would be helpful to know when
it might be available.  Thank you.
