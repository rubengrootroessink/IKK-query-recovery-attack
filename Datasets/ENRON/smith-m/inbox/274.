Unfortunately for this particular trip there is no flexibility in my
schedule.  The company is usually very good about this kind of stuff, but
we're in a crunch on this and many projects so it's just get out and get
back.  It looks like the best I can do getting an earlier flight is to be in
IAH by 7:55 with my flight to B'Ham at 9:55.  We'd have to get dinner at the
airport unfortunately, but it's better than nothing.  I'll call you
Wednesday and let you know what's happening.

Becky,

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about
$100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my
fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go
to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could
stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work
pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have
my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

Mat

   Hey Mat - I haven't heard from you since we played phone tag about a
   month
   ago.  Wanted to let you know that I have a trip coming up next week and
   I'll
   be passing through IAH Wednesday night around 9:00.  Right now my
   layover is
   for only 50 minutes but I may be able to catch an earlier connection out
   of
   Denver if you're going to be around that night.  If you're around I'll
   call
   your cell on Wednesday as I'm leaving Denver & let you know if I catch
   the
   earlier connection and maybe you can meet me at the airport for a drink.
   Anyway, let me know what your plans are.

   Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I
   see
   each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at
   the
   beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.
