Finding and solution --

Kinder Morgan and Transcolorado web site has no data for cycle 2 (since 5/6/2001) and cycle 4 (since 5/5/2001).  These cycle infomation were up this morning after I checked few times.  I reset these jobs and all the missing data has been captured and saved to shares and database.
