A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"
