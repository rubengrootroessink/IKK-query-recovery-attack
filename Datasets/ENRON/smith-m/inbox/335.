Hey Mat!

How have you been?  I have been trying to call you to
chat, but can't get through to you.  Is everything ok?
 I wasn't sure exactly when you were going to
Portland, so maybe you are there now.  If you don't
want me to call, please let me know.

I hope all is well.  Please write me and let me know
what's up!

Christine:)
