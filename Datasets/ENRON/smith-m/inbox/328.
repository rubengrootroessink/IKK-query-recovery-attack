Hey Matteo,

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my 
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, where 
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a 
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as 
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent 
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I 
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on 
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best 
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and 
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in 
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking about 
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k
