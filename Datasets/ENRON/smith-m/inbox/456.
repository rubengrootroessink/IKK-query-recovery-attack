Dear Traveler: 

As the busy holiday travel season begins, Northwest Airlines 
looks forward to welcoming you onboard our flights and wishes 
you a pleasant travel experience. We remind all travelers that 
extra security procedures are in place at all airports and 
we request your continued cooperation with these new requirements.   
Please consider the following travel tips as you prepare for 
your flights.

Allow for extra time at the airport.  Domestic travelers should 
arrive at the airport 75 minutes prior to departure. International 
travelers should arrive 2 hours in advance. 

Bring photo identification with you. All passengers age 18 and 
older must carry government-issued photo identification at all 
times and may be asked to show identification at check-in 
and during boarding. 

Avoid wrapping your holiday gifts prior to travel.  Due to the 
heightened airport security measures and the random and thorough 
nature of security searches, travelers should not bring wrapped 
packages on-board the aircraft. Please include your unwrapped 
gifts or packages with your checked luggage or ship your packages 
in advance of your departure.

Additionally, certain items cannot be carried onboard the aircraft 
and will not be allowed beyond security checkpoints. These items 
include knives/cutting instruments, all "non-safety" type razor 
blades, corkscrews, baseball bats, golf clubs, ski poles and hockey 
sticks.  If you do need these items, please plan to check them 
with your luggage. 

Northwest offers several convenient self-service check-in options 
to help speed your way through the airport.  E-Ticket customers 
may check in online from their home or office with nwa.com Check-In 
or use an E-Service Center located at most major airports in the U.S.  
WorldClubs members may continue to check-in at the club, but will 
need proper documentation to pass through security as noted below.  
Customers may also check-in at the airport check-in counters or 
at one of our many curbside check-in locations.  If you have proper 
ticket documentation and no luggage to check, you may proceed directly 
to your departure gate. 

As a final reminder, all passengers will need one of the following 
to pass through security checkpoints at the airport: 
- A receipt for an electronic ticket - including ticket number
- An itinerary generated by an airline or a travel agency confirming 
an electronic ticket - including ticket number
- Boarding Pass 
- A paper ticket

We thank you again for choosing Northwest Airlines and we wish you a 
happy holiday season.
