Pete-
Thanks so much for doing this. We are looking for a map of the entire state of California, and both major pipelines.

These are the things we are looking for on the SoCal/PG&E map:
-Entire Pipelines
-State borders
-County borders
-Cities:  Bakersfield
	Concord
	Fresno
	Modesto
	Oakland
	Palo Alto
	Sacramento
	San Fran
	San Jose
	Stockton
	Burbank
	Fullerton
	L.A.
	Long Beach
	Ontario
	Oxnard
	Riverside
	San Diego
	Santa Ana

Please let me know when you can get this done, so we can plan accordingly.
Thanks again,
Tara
