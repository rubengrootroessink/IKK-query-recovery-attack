We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you need more info.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Mat
