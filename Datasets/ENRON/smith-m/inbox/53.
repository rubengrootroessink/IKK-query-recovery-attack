I had to move the AIESEC intern interviews to this afternoon due to the group meetings that were scheduled for yesterday afternoon.  Since the group meetings are now scheduled for today and I do not want to move the interviews again, you will be conducting the interviews and making recomendations on who to hire.  Here is the schedule:

All three of us will interview Milen and Grzegorz at 2:00 and 2:30.
Tara & Mat will interview Mohit and Guilherme at 3:00 and 3:30.
All three of us will interview Jenny on Thursday at 2:30.

Make sure their English and technical (Excel/Database) skill are sufficient.  If you would like, we can talk briefly about what to ask the candidates.  We will meet Thursday afternoon to make a decision.

Chris
