It appears that the wrong service was stopped last night...a request to stop/restart the real-time weather service also seems to have resulted in the stopping of the Jaguar harvester.  This caused no scrape jobs to run last night.

This morning the service has been restarted, and data has been recovered.  This should be examined closely, as there is the possibility that information is the same for cycles 1 and 2 of certain pipes (this may or may not be an issue...if it is, please advise us on what should be done).

Thanks,
Chris
