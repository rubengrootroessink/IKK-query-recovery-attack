Dear Matthew,

HB 1877, by Rep. Patricia Gray, has been set on the House of
Representatives Calendar for debate TODAY, Wednesday, May 09, 2001.

This bill would protect your right to choose where you purchase your
contact lenses by providing for automatic release of contact lens
prescriptions upon final fitting and allowing for a faxed copy of your
prescription, instead of requiring a hand written original.

Legislators need to hear from contact lens wearers in support of this
important bill IMMEDIATELY.

Please call your state representative's office now and let them know:
1) You are a constituent of their district.
2) You would like them to vote for HB 1877.
3) You support automatic release of contact lens prescriptions, and a faxed
copy instead of an original handwritten one because it protects your right
to choose where you buy your contact lenses.

Here is your legislator's information
Beverly Woolley
Phone: 512-463-0696

We know this is short notice, but at the end of legislative session things
change quickly.  Thank you in advance for your time and effort.

Sincerely,


1-800 CONTACTS
