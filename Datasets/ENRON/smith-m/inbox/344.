Matt,

This is the new template for imbalance trades. So far, I think this is the one they want you to use.

I have set up a template in o:/common/logistics for the recording of imbalance trading as we discussed 
in our meeting on Friday. 

Let me know if this looks ok and if you think more information is needed.

Thanks,
Kim
