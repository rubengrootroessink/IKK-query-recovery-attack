Chris,

For the following dates, we do not have Cycle 7 data in the database for PG&E (Pipeline #17).  These should have been reloaded from the saved html files.  Do we have these files, and if so, can you load the appropriate dates, in order the get the Cycle 7 data in for these points.


2/8/01
3/7/01	
3/8/01	
3/9/01	
3/10/01	
3/11/01	
3/12/01	


For the following dates, the data we have for Cycle 7 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains.  We need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct, and if it isn't, get it corrected.  I could check them, if you could print out the saved pages for me.	

2/12/01
2/27/01 
3/1/01 
4/11/01 	
4/16/01 	
4/17/01 	
4/18/01

For both of these, the actual date of capture will be several days later than the effective date for cycle 7.

Mat
