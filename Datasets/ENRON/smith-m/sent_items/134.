Aaron, this is Mike's latest sheet with all transporation path combinations included.  The files includes rates, receipt and delivery points, and live links to an EOL listen sheet.  It's basically everything you need to have an internet version developed.  Also, we do need an ops sheet modified.  Basically, we're trying to develop a net total for Keystone production.  More importantly, by the weekend we're going to need my Keytext Socal capture to work.  This is absolutely critical since we have a Nuke going out on Saturday and a major coal plant down.  Let me know if you have any issues.  Stop by sometime about the Keystone modification.

Mat
