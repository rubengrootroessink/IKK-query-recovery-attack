Becky,

Have you heard anything yet from Questar?  Now we also need data for May 24 through June 1st because their site did not report all week.  Should I give Lori a call again?

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

Becky,

I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.  As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.  I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, Tara Piazze
