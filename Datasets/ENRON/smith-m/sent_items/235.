Motorcross...white trashyness...sounds like fun.  i think i'm going to go home and pass out.  i'm so fucking tired.  went to the Dynegy bar last night and i think i had a few too many beers.  only thing is my roommates gone for the weekend so i'll probably get a little lonely.  oh well...i hope there's some good tv on.  sure wish i had some motorcross to attend!

Mat

I am glad to hear that you're not freaking out.  As for Kate, she is pretty
much ambiguous to the whole thing.  She doesn't have and money invested in
Enron, so if she looses her job she won't be that sad.  I talked to her last
night and she seemed not to care one way or the other.  She said that
yesterday the traders were freaking out and most of them left the office for
"lunch" and didn't come back.  So, you aren't sure what you're going to do?
At least you have options.  Kate and I are going to see some motorcross
tonight and have some white-trash loving fun.  It should be interesting
people watching.  Kate said she going to find herself a mullet.  Any big
plans this weekend?

well, people are in better spirits now that the deal is done.  Too bad
there's still a bunch of uncertainty as to how we'll integrate the two
companies.  at least i'm pretty sure that i will keep my job.  so now i
just need to decide whether i want to keep it.  there's going to be some
opportunities elsewhere as people leave Enron and join other companies.
How's Kate doing?  are they worried?  there probably aren't a ton of
other trading shops in Portand.  At least there are a bunch of other
shops in Houston for people who get screwed from this deal...
