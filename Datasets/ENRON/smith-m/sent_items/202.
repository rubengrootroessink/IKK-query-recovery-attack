i feel a little awful...plus i'm tired.  I hope you weren't looking forward to speaking with a sober Mat yesterday.  i don't think i was that drunk, but who knows.  plus, i must be allergic to something because i can't stop sneezing.  oh, my life just sucks these days...j/k.  anyway, are you looking forward to tonight...especially with a nice full moon...make sure to look out for the goblins...
