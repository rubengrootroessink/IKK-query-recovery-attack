Actually, I don't know the number yet.  Cell phone still the best.  Sorry, I haven't been available last night.  I was out.  Anyway, what's the news?

Mat

Hey there!

How was your birthday?  I wasn't able to get ahold of
you.  I feel badly because I wanted to wish you a
Happy one.  I hope that it was, and that you were able
to relax a little bit.

Do you know your new phone number?  I would like to
talk with you soon if you do.  I have news to tell
you!
Tis weekend is a long weekend.  I was originally
supposed to go to Boston, but Loretta and I changed
our minds.  I think she is moving into a new place
this weekend.

I hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Christine:)
