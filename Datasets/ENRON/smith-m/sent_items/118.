not too bad...i was late to work, though.  Fortunately...the day is over for me.  I'm leaving for the airport shortly. AND, i'm in a good mood because some the girl that him my car called and confessed!  She said she thought she hit a garbage can, but when she heard from the girl having the party that someone hit my car...she realized it was her.  Anyway, she called her insurance and it's all good now.

Well, I should get going now...

See you soon.

Mat
