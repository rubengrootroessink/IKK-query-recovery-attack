Moody's cuts Enron's ratings, may cut again

    NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's
Investors Service on Friday said it cut its long-term and
short-term ratings for embattled energy trader Enron Corp.
<ENE.N> and warned it could cut the ratings again because of a
substantial loss of investor confidence.
    Moody's cut Enron's senior unsecured debt ratings to
"Baa3," its lowest investment grade, from "Baa2." It also cut
the company's commercial paper rating to "Not Prime" from
"Prime-2."
    If Moody's cut Enron's long-term rating again, it would
take it to a junk level. A downgrade would make it tougher for
Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business. The
downgrade also adds uncertainty to a potential merger with
rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N>, which has been in talks to acquire
Enron.
    Dynegy and Enron have asked for an expedited review of the
merger from Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
    Enron shares traded Friday on the New York Stock Exchange
down $1.15 at $7.25.
