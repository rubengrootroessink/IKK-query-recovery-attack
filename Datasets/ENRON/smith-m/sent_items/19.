Anytime you get a chance is fine.  Just let me know, but I'll tentatively plan on 3 pm.

Matt,
When you get a chance tomorrow, I want to show you some eol reports that I used to provide for the group.  Mike would like to have the fundies group provide this report for our group going forward.  My method is a bit inefficient..so I'm sure your group will be able to pull the data a lot easier; but, you'll be able to get the general idea from what I've done out of Access 97.
Anytime after 3 will be best for me since it is bid week.  Just let me know what works.
Thanks,
Mo.

Mo,

Are your reports still available for EOL that you created months ago?  I would like to turn them over to the fundies group ( Matt Smith) tomorrow.

Mike
