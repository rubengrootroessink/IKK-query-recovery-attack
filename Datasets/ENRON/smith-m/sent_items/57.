Just wanted to let you know that i'm having some flowers delivered to the house tomorrow (Sat) for Mother's day.  They couldn't give me a time, though.  I told them to leave them on the porch if noone is home.

Also, I just got invited to play golf at TPC, which if you don't know, is the venue for the Houston Shell Open.  A round costs at least $100, but free for me.  I better get to the range tomorrow.  Unfortunately every muscle in my body aches from working out and today we did arms, so i'm really in trouble.  Oh well.....

Talk to you soon.

Mat
