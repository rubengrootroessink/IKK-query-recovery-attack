Chris,

Please add the following new point to the database for PGT (#15) and make sure we begin to scape it along with the others:

DRN:  288499
Name:  Klamath Cogeneration - PacifiCorp

This is a scraped point currently being posted.  This DRN is the same as the IHS DRN for this point.

Thanks.

Mat
