Yup, my little bro is coming to visit.  We'll definitely be hitting the town.  Are you around?  I may organize something, so I'll let you know.

not back before the weekend.  Utah was great!  Tons of fresh powder and good
weather.  Are you in town this weekend?

Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.  I went to NYC for a long
weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a
great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

Mat

Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off.  I'm heading to Utah for some
skiing next week for a little break myself.  Anything going on tonight?

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mat

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Subject:  Sat night - the plan

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.
