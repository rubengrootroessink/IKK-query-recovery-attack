Hey, what up?  i'm still in Portland, in the office right now.  Had a prett=
y cool time this weekend.  Checked out Hood River, a little town on the Col=
umbia River Gorge and then headed up to Mt. Hood yesterday.  I think its ab=
out 11,000 ft high. There's a really old lodge half way up...it was almost =
snowing!  Actually, up near the summit you can ski year round....but i don'=
t think many people do.  The little trip made me think about our ski plans,=
 which we should definitely keep pursueing.  I apologize i'm a little out o=
f touch up here in Portland, maybe I'll do some surfing when i get a chance=
.  So, this chick fun...i don't really know what it is, but i feel comforta=
ble hanging out with her...I think maybe its just that she's pretty down to=
 earth.  She ski's a lot and plays soccer every week, so i guess there some=
 common interests there.  She's totally not into fancy expensive things...w=
hich is good because she's broke...want's to go back to school so she can t=
each.  Only other comment is that she's got a little hippie in her...but i =
guess you can't have everything...
=20
Anyway, I took some pictures, so I'll send them to you sometime.  I have to=
 run.  Thanks for the email.=20
=20
Talk to you soon.

Mat

Hey Matteo,

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, wher=
e
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking abou=
t
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k
