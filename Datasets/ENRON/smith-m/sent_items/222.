For real, I have your sock.  I can keep it, if you don't want it, but it
is
too big for me.  What ever happened to those pictures you were going to
send
me?  Hmmmmm?

Oh yes, it was a good contest.  Gannon is quite the quarterback.  Did
you?  I only watched the first half, though, because I was tired and
went to bed.  Today, I'm watching our stock go to shit once again.  It's
only a matter of time before we shut the doors.  I think the only thing
that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt
too much.  Maybe the government will bail us out.  Anwyay, how's
everything with you?
