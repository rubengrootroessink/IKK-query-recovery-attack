Eliminating the effect NULL values have on MDX AVG's in History is progressing but has been filled with additional problems.

The solution to divide the sum from the cube by the count of nonnull days from SQL is practically done. In addition to 
all day Friday.  Five hours were put in over the weekend.  Much of this time has been spent resolving the underlying problems
that pose a problem to consistiency of results..

Done:
Develop query -- spRPT_GetAllDaysWithData
Parameterize query
Modify Program structure to call query with necessary parameters
Determine most complete cycle to use (Get cycle with most number of days of data) 
Verify Queries -- Started

To Do:
Determine how to use all retrieved cycles in NonNullDaysCount query.
Prove this approach is workable.
