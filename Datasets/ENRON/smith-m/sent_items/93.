Phil,

How's this for starters...

 

The San Juan plant receipts and Rockies production information should be accurate.  The third tab, Keystone Receipts, is definitely not comprehensive.  That information is for El Paso Natural Gas only, and only the first section of the table has the receipt points values.  Unfortunately, a lot of production in Keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for.  I'll see if I can get together at least some TW and Northern numbers for the Perm and that might be as good as we can get.
