Remember, you want to install the "Client Tools" only...

Chris

P.S. - the license key you need is in O:\Fundy_Ops\IT\Applications\SQL 2000 Enterprise\Serial key.txt

Chris,

I need to reinstall SQL on my machine.  Can you send me the link to the setup file in the IT directory.  I can't remember where it is.

Thanks.

Mat
