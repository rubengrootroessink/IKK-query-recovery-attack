Ina,

A month or so ago, you requested access to sitara reports for me.  You said it was completed, but the icon on the sitara launch pad is still greyed out.  Can you please pass this on to the appropriate person.  Also, i still don't have access to TDS which we requested before last week.  Thanks.

Mat
