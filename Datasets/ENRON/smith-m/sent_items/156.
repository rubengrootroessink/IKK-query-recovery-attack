What?  You didn't like that story.  You know it wasn't my idea, I was
coerced into the closet.  Ok, that doesn't sound very good.  I just found
out that the goat was originally man's best friend.  Interesting eh?

No foreced drinking, just one ceremonial shot of tequilla.  I think
they're saving it up for this weekend.  I think we're having a party on
Saturday.  I don't know if we have any closet shelves that I can fit
into, though.....

Did people try and force glasses of alcohol on you just because it's
your
birthday?  That is always nice.  Sometimes it seems like other people
are
way more excited that it's your birthday than you are, and they just
really
want you to party.  I don't know, I am rambling.  I was up kind of late
and
so this morning I am a little slow.

Hi there,

How are you feeling?  Like a million dollars or more like .50 cents?
