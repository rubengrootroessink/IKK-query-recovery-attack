Let's see...I worked a little on Sunday, but wasn't too motivated because of all of the turmoil at the company.  Weather was really nice, so Mark and I went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football.  Only thing is, the one game we wanted to watch, wasn't on.  At least there was plenty of beer.  Then we went home and grilled some steaks.  I like steak.  That's about it.  How about you?  Did you get all of your laundry done.  I didn't.

Mat
