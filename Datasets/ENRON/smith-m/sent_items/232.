well, people are in better spirits now that the deal is done.  Too bad there's still a bunch of uncertainty as to how we'll integrate the two companies.  at least i'm pretty sure that i will keep my job.  so now i just need to decide whether i want to keep it.  there's going to be some opportunities elsewhere as people leave Enron and join other companies.  How's Kate doing?  are they worried?  there probably aren't a ton of other trading shops in Portand.  At least there are a bunch of other shops in Houston for people who get screwed from this deal...
