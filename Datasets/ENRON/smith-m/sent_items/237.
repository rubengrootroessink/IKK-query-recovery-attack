Kam,

It appears my TDS is linked to Keith's book and not mine.  I don't mind having access to his position, and i actually will probably want it, but the book names probably got confused since his is WT and mine is WC.

Matt,

You're positions will not show up tonight until we "load" them.  This will be done once your P&L is calculated for the night.  After tonight, your trades will hit immediately after they are executed.

Please call with any questions.

Kam,

Now I tried msmith18_pc and my trading track simulation book was available to select, but nothing else.
