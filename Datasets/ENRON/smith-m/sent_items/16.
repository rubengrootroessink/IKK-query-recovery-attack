Gerry,

Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided flows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith
