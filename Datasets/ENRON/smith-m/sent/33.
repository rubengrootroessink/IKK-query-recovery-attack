I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I 
would prefer a month long stay.  Ammenities required include, very large hot 
tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large 
(I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, 
and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending 
women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to 
take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.

With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,

Mateo.
