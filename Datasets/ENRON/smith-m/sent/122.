Hmmm, I don't if I could pass up an opportunity to dive the Caymen islands.  
Timing wise the end of February still works best, but if you're still working 
then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were March and you weren't 
working, so I'm willing to hold out until you know your fate.  Definitely 
keep me informed, though.  I'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold 
me over.  Say hi to the crew for me...and of course, Jewels.
