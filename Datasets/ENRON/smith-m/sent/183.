Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary 
link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be 
called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm 
still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Mat
