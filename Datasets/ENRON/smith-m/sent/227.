Angela,

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with 
a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be 
loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D 
Historicals Only"

Thanks.

Mat
