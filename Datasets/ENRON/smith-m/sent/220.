Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on 
the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 
mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not 
physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five 
synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong 
counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the 
meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

Mat
