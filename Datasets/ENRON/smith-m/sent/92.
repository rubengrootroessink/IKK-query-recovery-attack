Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late 
when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided 
not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did 
you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you 
little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I 
bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were 
wondering.  

Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick 
ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading 
book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, 
and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was 
a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.

Have a nice day.

Mat
