Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I 
have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that 
they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they 
are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not 
have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it 
would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying 
when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's 
friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just 
don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and 
I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you 
never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know 
whether I should use it to get in touch with you.

Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that 
Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just 
kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed 
quickly.

Mat

Hey baby,
If you haven't already, I say let's go with the 22nd-25th in Feb.  We have
our six and can add on others as they fill in, but I'm done waiting for
people to get back to me!!!! Did you get my card yet?
Can't wait!!!

The snow was heavy on Sunday but what a great time!!!   Last night I took a
lesson and we hit the moguls (or as those "in the know" refer to them as,
"the bumps").  What a rush.  My ski's are a tad long for me (180's) and so
it was tough at first but about three runs into it I started feeling the
rhythm and that was it....total addiction!!

So what's going on???

love, k
