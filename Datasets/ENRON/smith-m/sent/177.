Chris,

This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mat
