Brad,

What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a 
matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the 
streets!

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so 
because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what 
yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around 
here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  

Mat
