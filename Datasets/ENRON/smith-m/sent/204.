Subject: FW: Column Names for Historical Files

Here are the headers:

1.  PIPELINE_ID
2.  EFFECTIVE_DTM
3.  DATA_REFERENCE_NUM
4.  FLOW_TYPE_CD
5.  MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_QTY
6.  UTILIZED_CAPACITY_QTY
7.  AVAILABLE_CAPACITY_QTY
8.  PIPELINE_CYCLE_ID

These are the column headings needed for the historical data Excel files 
(they do not have to be in any particular order, but initially a template 
should be created, and then used throughout).  This format makes it a simple 
process to load this information into the database.

Thanks for all of your hard work!!

Chris
