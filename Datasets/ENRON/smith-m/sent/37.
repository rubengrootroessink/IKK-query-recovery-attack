What are we going to do, Brief.  I can only say that will probably hit the 
City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some 
warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day 
this time...

Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work 
responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and 
I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.

Mat
