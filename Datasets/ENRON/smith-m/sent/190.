It's on the website under the power tab.  The link is already created and 
ready to go!

i haven't created it yet.  I was hoping to have the link there, so that I can 
put the file in the directory tomorrow morning (before you get in).  It will 
be called "curtailments.xls".

Amanda,

Please add add a link called "Plant Outages (portland)", to the Gas 
Fundamentals website under the Power tab.  The description is as follows:

"Query of Portland's database of plant outages for yesterday and today."

Thanks.

Mat
