I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I 
can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely 
want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam 
for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think 
we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you 
want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so 
inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later.
