Amanda,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a 
slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages 
(portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add 
an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", 
with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the 
California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Mat
