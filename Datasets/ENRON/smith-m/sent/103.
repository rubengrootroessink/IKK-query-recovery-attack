Ina,

I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you 
please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for 
a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you 
need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.  
Thank you.

Mat
