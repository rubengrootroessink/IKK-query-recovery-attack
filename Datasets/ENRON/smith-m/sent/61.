Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to 
refresh it manually.  It sucks....

So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes 
you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be 
thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, 
so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.

Later.

Mat
