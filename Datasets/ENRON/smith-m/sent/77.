Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico 
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you 
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth 
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm 
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment 
than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there 
are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of 
holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently 
been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so 
my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the 
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help 
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae 
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some 
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in 
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a 
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, 
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just 
drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was 
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I 
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to 
hear what's happening on the island these days.  

Take care,

Mat
