David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and 
"Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.  

Mat
