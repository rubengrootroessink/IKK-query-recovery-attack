Jennifer,

As it stands right now, don't count me in for dinner.  I may call you tonight 
or tomorrow if it works out that I can come.  I think my friends would like 
it, but they're here seeing someone else as well.  If I don't make it to 
dinner, we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards.

Mat
