Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the 
meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.  
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here 
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to run.

Mat
