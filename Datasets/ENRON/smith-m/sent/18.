Reagan,

Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is 
listed in the directory for you.  Since I didn't remember your number, we 
told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with 
Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  

Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had 
a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in 
the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung 
out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The 
broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, 
and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and 
he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.


Mat
