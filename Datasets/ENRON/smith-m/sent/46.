I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole 
program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more 
candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing 
thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six 
people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing 
that they know and aren't offering any info.
