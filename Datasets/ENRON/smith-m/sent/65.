Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email 
until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How 
about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a 
message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.
