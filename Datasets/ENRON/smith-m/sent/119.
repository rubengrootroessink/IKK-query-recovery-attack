Trading was boring today, well, boring because I'm not participating yet.  
Soon though.  The superbowl isn't until 6 pm I think, so yes, I say we go 
someplace or your place.  I'll just tell everyone I have to work, which I do 
anyway.  It'll be my second to last weekend stint.  I'm jealous about you 
being in NY.  Have a drinky for me.  I'm going to look for some pussy on 
saturday...big "frat" style party at some chics place.  Too bad you're 
away...I'm sure we could do well.  Anyway, have fun in NY.
