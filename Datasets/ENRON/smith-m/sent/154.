Oh, I had fun as well.  I'm glad you guys came.  Unfortunately the rest of 
the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at 
about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!  It's a great 
story!  I went flying on Sunday too which was nice.  Give me a call if you 
want to chat sometime.

Hey boy.  HOw's it goin?  Hey, I just wanted to write to say thanks for the
fun while we were in Houston and the week in general, but mostly for taking
care of my drunk, annoying ass at the airport.  I think I was still a little
looped the next morning.  Totally sorry if that turned into a big
babysitting job for you!!!

So, did you have a fantastic weekend after we left?  How did you avoid the
freaks?  love, k
