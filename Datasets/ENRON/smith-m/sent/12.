Marlo,

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.

Mat
