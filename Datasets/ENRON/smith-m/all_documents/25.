Steve,

as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to 
determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.  
In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from 
Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily, 
Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.

Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily 
decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold.

This will probably be an extensive project so see about the pulling of the 
curves first, and we can move forward from there.  Please call either myself 
or Matt Smith with any questions.

Ken
