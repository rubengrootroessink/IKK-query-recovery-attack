Since your names are the only ones I know in the off cycle program I am 
forwarding you this email.  please send this on to any and all off cycle 
associates you know.  I am going to contact Ted Bland to get a comprehensive 
list but this will have to do for now.

It's hell getting back into the swing of things, isn't it?  Misery loves 
company, so share your tales of woe at our first post-training Happy Hour 
tomorrow night before everyone blows out of town for the long weekend.


Where:   The Ale House
Directions:   Take 59 south to the Kirby exit and go right (north) to 
Alabama.  Take another right.  A block down on your right, just past the 
Border's Books under construction, is the Ale House.  
When:  5:30 'til whenever

Hope to see you there!
