According to El Paso, the only thing preventing line 1110 from coming back online is the delivery and installation of a release valve which OPS has ordered to be installed on the line.  We are now hearing that there is a possibility the September 1st date reported earlier this week could slip to the next couple of weeks to give additional time for the valve installation.  Furthermore, sources report that OPS has not begun the process of approving the entire system to return to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d, and this could take several months.  

As always, we will notify you as we learn new information. Please contact me at x51623 or Kristin Walsh at x39510 if you have any questions.
