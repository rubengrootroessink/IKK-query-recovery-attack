Thanks Mat!  Don't worry about the other question I had--I found what I needed.

Have a great weekend!

Hey Matt,

How's it going?

When you get a chance, would you mind sending me the updated Net Inj/WD activity for SoCal for Thursday (10/25)?

I also had a question on the injection for 10-18-01.  When I was updating everything for last week's report, our ops report at the time showed a 366,000 injection, but now it's back to 101,000...  Which is the correct number?  Any idea why it does that?

Thanks Matt!
Sheila
