Steve,

Here are the adjusted 714 hourly loads.  I verified that they now are exactly trued up to the WSCC data.  For your records, the following load areas were not included in this years 714 forms:

CA - Place County Water Authority, City of Riverside
DSW - Plains Elec Gen & Trans
PNW-US - Clark County PUD, PEND, WA Water Power (Avista)
RM - WAPA Loveland, WAPA Salt Lake City

Also, as discussed, WAPA Billings was not used.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mat
