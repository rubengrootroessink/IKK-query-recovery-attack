I know someone in IT picked the computer up to send back to NYMEX.  I don't have confirmation if they had sent it back prior to the filing.  I have called this individual several times at home but have not heard back.

Any update on the location of the terminals?  The clock is ticking before we become UBS employees...!

Danielle:

It was never moved here from ECN during our move.  Do you have a bar code or any type of serial number for me to be able to find it?  I don't see how the computer could have just dissappeared. When Dutch originally talked to Paul Jordan and told him that it was not being used anymore, he was going to have it moved. Who else can we talk to about where this computer could have gone?  I will go over to the new building tommorrow and take a look again.  Will you meet me there?  I will call you before I go.
Thanks,

John,

If you cannot locate your NYMEX access computer terminal its cost will be docked from your cost center.  You need to get it tracked down ASAP!

Tana:
No, I went to 32 and it was gone. 

Clay:
Do you know if anyone from your group picked up a computer from John Arnold's old desk on 32 that was an HP or IBM?

Thanks,

Danielle
