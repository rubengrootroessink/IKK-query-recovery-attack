Dutch - Per your request, I have switched your Futures assignment with
Andy's Forwards assignment. Your new assignment is detailed below.

 |------------------+----------------------+------------------------|

 |------------------+----------------------+------------------------|
 | Dutch Quigley    | Options, Futures     | Risk Management Inputs,|

Determining Option Premiums
   Inputs to determing options premiums:
   ?  Price Curve
   ?  Strike Price
   ?  Interest Rate
   ?  Volatility
   ?  Expiry or maturity
   Relationship between these inputs and how it relates to option premium
   (e.g. Holding all other things constant, if volatility increases, what
   does this do to your option premium?)

Futures Market
   Thoughts to include:
     Traded over an exchange
     Clearinghouse is always counterparty, but does not set the price
     Prices determined by open auction on trading floor
     Prices are transparent and real-time
     Comparison to spot market
     Bi-directional trading
     Expiry and settlement

Dutch -

As we've discussed before, you will be responsible for developing the Risk
Identification and Commodities Fundamentals topics for the Knowledge
System. Once we complete our development phase, you will also be
responsible for reviewing the Options and Accounting & Reporting topics.

For this first week you will be developing in Microsoft Word (or even in an
email) instead of the online content development tool. Below, I've included
the high-level outline for each content area that you should follow when
writing this content.

This Week's Assignment: This week's assignment will be to create two-three
paragraphs of content for each of the following areas:
1) Determining Option Premiums
2) Forward Market

Due Date: Friday, October 12th, 2001
 *NOTE: We are giving this assignment to you a few days early. In the
future expect your assignments on a Friday to be due by EOD the following
Friday.

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing
Determining Option Premiums
   Inputs to determing options premiums:
   ?  Price Curve
   ?  Strike Price
   ?  Interest Rate
   ?  Volatility
   ?  Expiry or maturity
   Relationship between these inputs and how it relates to option premium
   (e.g. Holding all other things constant, if volatility increases, what
   does this do to your option premium?)

Forward Market
   Traded on the OTC
   Known counterparty
   Prices are transparent
   Comparison to spot market
   Expiry and settlement

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project
to stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete an
assignment for a given week, please notify me ahead of time and provide an
estimated time for completion of that assignment.

Thank you.
