This crap is worse than the frickin BSC.  It's nice to see that Ernie
represented our division in the first round of the playoffs.  Way to go
jackass!  I of course would have lost in the first round also, but at least
I would have scored a legit amount of points.  Once again the flee circus is
winning with smoke and mirrors.  His last three week's scores don't even add
up to 100 and he won all three.  He must be cheating.  I would also like to
congratulate the Lions, I mean Extreme for its one win season.

This is a perfect example of why we cant change the rule about wild cards.
If Mark were to have his way he would have gotten the wild card even though
someone had a better record.  So I say screw any changes and obviously the
system works.

P.S.  Mark that really sucks to score the most points and not make the
playoffs.
