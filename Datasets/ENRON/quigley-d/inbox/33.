Hello Dutch.

Below, I've detailed your assignment for the upcoming week. I've included
the high-level outline for each content area that you should follow when
writing this content. Remember - this assignment should be placed in the
ECW that Monica and I showed you last week. I've included instructions to
remind you how to use this tool.  Note - If the content you have written
does not fit onto the page, please just send it to us in an email. Thank
you!
