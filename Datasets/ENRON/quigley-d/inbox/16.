Hey Dutch,
I had lunch with Kay yesterday and she suggested I email you.  Would you be
able to find tickets to the Dixie Chicks at the rodeo?  I will pay.  I
wasn't sure if you were still talking to any brokers that had some
available.  If you don't, no big deal.  Just thought I would try.  Hope all
is well.
Thanks,
Rebecca P.
