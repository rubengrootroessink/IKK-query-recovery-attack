Good question. I am not sure what the copyright regulations are in regards
to that website. I know we have full access to Enron's BRM course content -
you can copy/paste straight from there.

I will ask Kirk McDaniels about the Nymex website first thing tomorrow
morning and get back to you.

Have a good night.
