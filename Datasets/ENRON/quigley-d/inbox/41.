The NCAA is expected to move closer next week toward new
guidelines that one official estimates could pare as many as 20
schools from college football's big-time Division I-A.

The association's Management Council, meeting in Indianapolis on
Monday and Tuesday, will weigh proposed scheduling, attendance,
scholarship and other requirements designed to weed out I-A
pretenders and discourage lower-division wannabes. Further votes
are scheduled for the spring and, if ultimately approved, the
measures could go into effect in 2004.

They would require I-A schools to hand out at least 90% (or 76.5)
of the 85 football scholarships allotted to major-college programs
in a given season and offer a minimum of 16 sports (including at
least four men's and six women's) and 200 scholarships overall.

More problematic for some schools, however, could be additional
stipulations that football programs play at least five regular-
season home games vs. I-A opponents each season and average no
less than 15,000 in attendance. Twenty-eight of the 115 I-A
programs failed to meet one of those criteria over the past two
seasons, and several schools - including many in the Mid-American
Conference and the Sun Belt - fell short of both.

MAC member Kent State, for example, met four I-A opponents at home
a year ago and will play only four again this season, and the
Golden Flashes averaged a division-low 8,473 for home games vs.
major-college opponents the past two seasons. They drew just 2,973
for last week's victory over Northern Illinois.

"The track it's on right now, I would see maybe 20" schools
falling out of Division I-A, Management Council chairman Charles
Harris, commissioner of the I-AA Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.

In danger of falling from I-A

Among other things, if the NCAA approves proposed new criteria for
membership in Division I-A, schools will have to play at least
five home games vs. I-A opponents every year and average at least
15,000 in attendance - probably over a rolling two-year period.

Averaged fewer than five home games vs. I-A:

* Mid-American Conference (9): Ball State, Bowling Green, Buffalo,
Central Michigan, Kent State, Miami (Ohio), Northern Illinois,
Ohio U., Western Michigan.

* Sun Belt (7): Arkansas State, Idaho, Louisiana-Lafayette,
Louisiana-Monroe, Middle Tennessee State, New Mexico State, North
Texas.

* Western Athletic (5): Boise State, Louisiana Tech, Rice, San
Jose State, Texas-El Paso.

* Conference USA (3): Houston, Southern Mississippi, UAB.

* Independents (2): Central Florida, Utah State

Averaged less than 15,000 in home attendance:

* Kent State

* Eastern Michigan

* Middle Tennessee

* Akron

* Bowling Green

* Northern Illinios

* Arkansas State

* Louisville-Monroe

* San Jose State

* Buffalo
