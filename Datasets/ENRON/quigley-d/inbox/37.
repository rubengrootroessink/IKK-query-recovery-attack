since there are only 4 of us that seem to check the message board
then i will try my luck here:

i've got 4 talented receivers in holt, pathon, muhammed & t. taylor.  i need
to establish more than 8 points over 5 weeks from my rb position.  to date
i have received offers like pinkston, price, garner, mack or allen and
flutie.  is it getting this bad where i'm actually considering these guys just
to spawn some new life into my team????  i certainly need rb help but
could use a back up qb as well.

All transactions must be completed by this Thursday at 9am due to the game on Thursday night.  After the game starts on Thursday, no transactions will be accepted.  For players that are playing in the game on Thursday, please remember to change your lineups before the game to include or exclude them.  You can still make changes to your lineup after Thursday for players that do not play in the game on Thursday.
