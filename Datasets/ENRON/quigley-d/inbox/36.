Absolutely. We'll see you in John Arnold's office today at 2:30.

Have a good morning!

By the way, Kirk isn't in yet - so I couldn't ask him about Nymex's
website. I'll let you know as soon as I do.

   Good question. I am not sure what the copyright regulations are in
   regards
   to that website. I know we have full access to Enron's BRM course
   content -
   you can copy/paste straight from there.

   I will ask Kirk McDaniels about the Nymex website first thing tomorrow
   morning and get back to you.

   Have a good night.
