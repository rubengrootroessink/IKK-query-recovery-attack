I need to have a new folder set up under the new O drive, it is as follows:

O:\Financial_Trading

I should be listed as owner.  Also, please give the following people read and write access to these folders:

Mike Maggi
John Lavarato
Dutch Quigley
Larry May
Jeb Ligums
Andy Zipper

Thanks for you help.  I need these set up as soon as possible.  Please call with any questions or concerns.
