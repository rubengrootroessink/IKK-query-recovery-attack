Attached are the futures positions for each of wti, heat, and unleaded.

Still don't know exactly what you want to see for the options positions (gross, net, strike by strike, longs separated from shorts, etc).  Please let me know.  Also, the risk guy that put the below together for me tells me that Jeff Shankman is asking for similar info.  Please let me know if we are doubling up on the effort - - if so, i will let him get it.
