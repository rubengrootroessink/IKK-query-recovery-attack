okay - here's what i know -- we are trying to hire some of the best
people out there at whatever they may do -- one position that we are
looking at is kinda what you are already doing -- our nymex trader is
bob shiring -- take that however you wish -- but that's who you  would
be working directly with so that's who you would need to talk to.  i
know this position is in the budget for this year but i'm not sure what
the time frame is.  bob's email is bob.shiring@rweamericas.com -- you
can tell him that you got his name from me and then i'm sure he'll
approach me about it -- that is, of course, if you are interested and to
the extent that you do not have any contractual issues in talking to us.
