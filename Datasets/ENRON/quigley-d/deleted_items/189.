atest NFL Player News  Trent Green , QB KC - Barking Spiders Updated 10/18/=
01 Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. Bu=
t the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken D=
ilger , TE IND - Money Shots Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor =
in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him agains=
t the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND -=
 High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' t=
op option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing g=
ame against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Barking Spide=
rs Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first ga=
me against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home=
 turf this week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne=
 is expecte! d ! to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the sec=
ond consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your=
 Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Up=
dated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and h=
as burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good number=
s against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Money Shots Updated 10/18=
/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He wa=
s intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better agains=
t them at home this week.  Randy Moss  , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated =
10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore rig=
ht ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against=
 Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear wh=
ether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - The Replacements U=
pdated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. H=
e is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress b=
efore deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn, WR NE - Addison =
Red Cornholes Updated 10/18/01Glenn might have another good game this week.=
 Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately=
 proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week. Antowain Smith , =
RB NE - CYSWC Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the fi=
rst time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at=
 least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chre=
bet , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been=
 very disappointing so far. He c! ou! ld have a good week if the Jets engag=
e in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York =
will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ =
- Team T-Bone Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for th=
e Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs sh=
ould be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Addiso=
n Red Cornholes Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New =
York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock=
 against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Up=
dated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday agai=
nst Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's =
horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so s=
tarting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday n=
ight, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At t=
his point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. =
  Michael Westbrook , WR WA! S ! - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook=
 has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing=
 against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, =
but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , =
QB NYJ - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good sta=
rt this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very we=
ll make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby=
 , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the w=
ork at ! ti! ght end now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrant=
s no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Wat=
er Boys Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questio=
nable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fan=
tasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - High Shrivel=
 Factor Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against=
 a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and=
 should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce  , WR S=
TL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent =
thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him=
 to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Erni=
e Conwell , TE STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a =
decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring=
 on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your rost=
er.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/18/01 Canidate w=
ill likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend =
against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is =
easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner ,=
 QB STL - Team T-Bone Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts=
 up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post =
another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him=
 your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/18/01 B=
uck! ha! lter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets th=
e majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Re=
id will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be t=
he more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Addison Re=
d Cornholes Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in th=
e league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giant=
s for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get hi=
m into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - The Replacements Updated 10/=
18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets =
this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a b=
it suspect at this point.    Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated =
10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medi=
al collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatle=
y will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for=
 Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI=
 - CYSWC Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some sol=
id Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the leagu=
e's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.=
