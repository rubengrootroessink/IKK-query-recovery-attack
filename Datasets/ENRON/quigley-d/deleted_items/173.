I don't see the need to mix franchise and non-franchise on the first round.
We're trying to get less confusing - not more.  What we do not need is some
major change in the draft methodology 2 days before the draft.

The system that Kevin initially described is the fairest, least confusing
and works fine.  The franchise keepers (including me) should pick after
those that do not keep anyone.    It best simulates the outcome of a
non-franchise snake draft.  Assuming the franchise keepers retain picks 1
through 5 of  a true first round, they would naturally pick last in a
second round.  This system worked fine last year.

Dutch and Jeff have brought up ranking the franchise players instead of a
2nd random drawing for franchise keepers.  I would vote for that (even
though I would pick last in the 1st round - 28th pick!).  There are
questions with players that might have been injured part of the year or
otherwise, but at least you know exactly where you stand.

I believe in using the snake draft and a 2nd drawing for franchise keepers,
but I would be fine with ranking the franchise players based on prior year.

Jeff Smith is just whining because he kept (potentially) the 10th overall
player in Manning and would now potentially has Manning and the 28th pick.
This is a large sacrifice, but this is Jeff's fault not the system.  Look
at the other 4 franchise players - they are all in the top 5 in most draft
rankings.  Only Smith is complaining.

suggested draft order:

scenario
5 franchise teams and 7 non-franchise
franchise teams ranked 1 - 5 based on total points of franchise player
from previous year

First the supplemental draft

Round one
# 5 franchise team, # 7 supplemental , # 4 franchise , # 6 supplemental
and so forth and so on

with a non snake system going from there

ok everyone chew on that and spit back
