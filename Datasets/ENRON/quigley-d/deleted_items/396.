, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- Blue Star Boys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards =
against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent =
weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents c=
ontinue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - High Shrivel Facto=
r Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five pas=
ses for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remain! =
s ! a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - =
South Park Cows Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches f=
or 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a mu=
st-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and un=
derrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - High Shrivel Fact=
or Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonvill=
e, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be=
 a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Money Sho=
ts Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against O=
akland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the se=
ason.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Barber ru=
shed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 =
yards. He has played well recently, ! al! though his owners would still lik=
e to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD=
 - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone,=
 but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had=
 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.  =
 Doug Flutie , QB SD - Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game,=
 throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's o=
nly worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. !   Jake Plummer ,=
 QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday=
, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also th=
rew two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Bosto=
n , WR ARI - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding=
 game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego.=
 He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is wort=
h starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty=
 Mullets Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, ca=
tching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most de=
pendable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Jo=
e Horn , WR NO - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another so=
lid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's bee=
n a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a wee=
kly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 In his r=
eturn from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards=
. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley=
 does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near futur=
e. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries a=
way from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 S=
mith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans.=
 After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty goo! d ! weekly option for F=
antasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/25/01 Brad=
y put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and fo=
ur touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his perfor=
mance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week=
.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw =
for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignore=
d rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB i=
n Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated=
 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating=
 a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return =
to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Mould=
s finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards=
 and ! tw! o TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners s=
hould still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the =
year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a m=
ediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets U=
pdated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, thr=
ee TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy conside=
ration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden =
, WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes =
for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fu=
mble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these im=
portant final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/25/01=
 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. Hi=
s performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is sti=
ll too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI=
 - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held Mc! Na! bb to 9=
2 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect =
the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  Jame=
s Thrash , WR PHI - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught four pas=
ses for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter=
 on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS -=
 Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards o=
n Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, an=
d now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , =
RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday =
as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 y=
ards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis =
has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place o! f ! the injured Muhsin Muh=
ammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, ca=
tching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsi=
n Muhammad , WR CAR - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed S=
unday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next =
weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexa=
nder , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 ya=
rds in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander m=
ay continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chan=
dler , QB ATL - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday=
, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack=
 Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor =
Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Alexa=
nder caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a! r! ib injury. He =
was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointme=
