 Player News  Todd Heap , TE BAL  Updated 10/18/01 Heap practiced Wednesday=
 but remains questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland. Reserve Heap on y=
our roster this week. It would be wise to keep him inactive until he is eff=
ective in a game.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF  Updated 10/18/01 According to publ=
ished reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football until t=
he Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore t=
hrowing elbow, as well as a few other ! na! gging bumps and bruises. Howeve=
r, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against =
Chicago.   Peerless Price , WR BUF  Updated 10/18/01 Price might post respe=
ctable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin becaus=
e of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF  Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in =
the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around of=
ten against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF  =
Updated 10/18/0!  Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far,=
 but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to at=
tack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price a=
nd TE Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE  Updated 10/18/01 There's a very=
 slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this w=
eek .     Bledsoe was upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on the injury repor=
t, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit.=
 He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the b=
all if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined.   Bledsoe's p=
rogress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable for his retu=
rn.      Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK  Updated 10/18/01 Wheatley won't practice =
during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of=
 an injured right knee.          "Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - I d=
on't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,"' coach Jon Gruden said =
Wednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Ph=
iladelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progre=
ssed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks.   "I wou=
ld not agree with that at this time," Gruden said.     Chris Weinke , QB CA=
R  Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain wh=
ether he will play in ! Wa! shington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. T=
he injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Mo=
nday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wedn=
esday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Damey=
une Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.   Brian Griese , QB DEN  Updat=
ed 10/18/01 Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's c=
onfident he'll play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese complained of should=
er soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The probl=
em was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawk=
s defensive end Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no structural damage to h=
is shoulder.     Redskins , DT WAS  Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Baile=
y missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected! =
t! o play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing thi=
s weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if =
he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI  Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring)=
 is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't bee=
n full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his status is d=
owngraded over the next two days.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR  Updated 10/17=
/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready t=
o play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to s=
tart from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Updated 10/17/=
01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's =
game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he =
may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week,=
 Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. =
  Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesd=
ay due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the ro=
okie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quart=
erback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defen=
se.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL  Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returned to p=
ractice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans=
, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective=
.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL  Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to =
practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunda=
y against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan =
Leaf , QB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense d! u=
r! ing practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was=
 given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chanc=
e to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at th=
is time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas =
is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullb=
ack. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy =
player is still minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN  Updated =
10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay =
due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Tra=
vis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Mos=
s , WR MIN  Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's ga=
me against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you =
to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for u=
nless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI  =
Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his=
 old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell =
Davis , RB DEN  Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis woul=
d like to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a=
 knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by N=
ovember 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this develo=
pment also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back. =
 Stacey Mack , RB JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this=
 week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on=
 nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC  Update=
d 10/17/01  McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, bu=
t looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play=
 well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC  Update=
d 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He wil=
l catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mar=
k Brunell , QB JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by=
 headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for o=
ver 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Brady =
is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed=
 as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has fi=
ve catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Smith has =
been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and =
score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET  Updated 10/17/01=
 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his =
hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disappointed the injury is mu=
ch worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We beli=
eved it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the musc=
le." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes the No=
. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 10/17/01 Ac=
cording to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a=
 right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charl=
ie Garner before he was hurt.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commis=
