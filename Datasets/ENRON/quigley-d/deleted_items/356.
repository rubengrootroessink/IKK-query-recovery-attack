 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - KMB Exp=
ress Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game =
against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is uncle=
ar.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed =
for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried =
the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy=
 of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to! s! ee some=
 work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman =
Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Den=
ver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is=
 getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI =
- She Said Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was i=
ntercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer,=
 who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ca=
li Bound Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 r=
ushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unles=
s your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Pumpdog Updated 11=
/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If=
 you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular =
looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/1=
8/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes fo=
r 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third =
downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backu=
p for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman =
Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but=
 he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for con=
sistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosi=
ve, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Baby Blues Updated =
11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he fa=
iled to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch=
 unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Cali B=
ound Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. Th=
e rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams. =
 Marty Booker , WR CHI - Xtreme Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes=
 for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has =
become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, =
no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The s=
econd-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy playe=
r.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated! 1! 1/18/01 Tomlinso=
n put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a tou=
chdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, whi=
ch may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire p=
reseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - She Said Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nin=
e passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't scor=
e often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, an=
d he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillro=
ds Updated 11/18! /0!  Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland,=
 throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, star=
ting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtre=
me Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at =
Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owne=
rs this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/18/0=
1 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and f=
our touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league=
 and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - Third World Countr=
yman Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes=
 for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an e=
very-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up hug=
e Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free A=
gent Updated 11/18/01 Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter =
of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graha=
m.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Cali Bound Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 y=
ards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times an=
d lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's po=
tential for big games makes him a must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , =
WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 ya=
rds against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be =
considered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Wounded D=
ucks Updated 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yard=
s, two TDs and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when hea=
lthy.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushe=
d for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcon=
s are using him more often, and Christian makes a go! od! backup RB right n=
ow.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/18/01 Grbac thr=
ew for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The=
 veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start fo=
r most Fantasy teams.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated =
11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The=
 rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give y=
ou some occasional TDs down the stretch.   Tim Couch , QB CLE - Pierres Fle=
a Circus Updated 11/18/01 Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepte=
d three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a=
 Fantasy backup right now.  Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/1=
8/01 Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 t=
imes for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and later=
al quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB=
.   James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/18/01 Jackson =
(ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carr=
ies in his place.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Xtreme Updated 11/18/01 Smith ru=
shed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be =
mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack dept=
h at RB.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01!  The rooki=
e wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Chambers is=
 still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.  More Updates  Tra=
