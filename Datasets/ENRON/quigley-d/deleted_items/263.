layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/23/01 Acc=
ording to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says t=
hat Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, whi=
ch could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come =
to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back =
into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander)=
 has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play,=
 he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to=
 stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the j=
ob back from Alexander down! t! he stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free A=
gent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groi=
n injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't=
 be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Pumpd=
og Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback f=
or Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer=
. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined=
 with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbec! k =
! from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , =
WR NYJ - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questi=
onable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday t=
o determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Ram=
s.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's=
 practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Sea=
ttle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar=
 Smith , RB MIA - Xtreme Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due=
 to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don=
't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Cali Bound Upda=
ted 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might s=
tart ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don'=
t recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' second=
ary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter t=
his week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might mi=
ss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right =
foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due=
 to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this we=
ek.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Cali Bound Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still ta=
rgeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthros=
copic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will a! c=
t! ivate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to kn=
ow by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in=
 a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting run=
ning back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World =
Countryman Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doe=
sn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practi=
ce until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday ag=
ainst Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - KMB Express Updated 10/23/01 Stal=
ey started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. =
Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late=
 in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gaine! d ! 34 yards on 11 ca=
rries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to po=
st consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster all=
ows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
3/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play=
 this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 Kinney wi=
ll be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is =
expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - She Said Upd=
ated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to pl=
ay in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in =
practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/23/01 Georg=
e suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this =
week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 McNair i=
s suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. Howev=
er, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - =
Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc =
problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist t=
his week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don'=
t expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his=
 absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is exp=
ected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that=
 his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor! , RB JAC - She Said U=
pdated 10/23/01Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore=
 and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that=
, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," =
head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be see=
n when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds =
well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a ret=
urn date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his =
groin on Sept 23.    Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/0=
1 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to p=
lay when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billi=
ck told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in thi=
s week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a =
sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - She Said Updated 10/23/01 Allen, w=
ho left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is que=
stionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back i=
f Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The ! Le! ather Cheerios Upda=
ted 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's gam=
e against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day=
. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There cou=
ld be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or =
thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will=
 replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Xtrem=
e Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win=
 over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this w=
eekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS =
Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expe=
cted to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. =
"I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said.=
 "He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to =
let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himse=
lf as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be star=
ting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - =
KMB Express Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to h=
is injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the =
bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because! I! was able to ge=
t treatment every day," Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced t=
oday good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has b=
een less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unle=
ss he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - KMB Exp=
ress Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now b=
ack in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches=
 for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though hi=
s surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NY=
G - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to t=
he Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-=
to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 According t=
o Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against Ne=
w Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz=
 said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's g=
ot to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him pla=
y." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable=
