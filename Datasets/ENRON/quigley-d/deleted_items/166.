hey commissioners....
i put in a transaction last week to kevin & via the website.
w/ kevin i requested goings/jamel white/cecil martin (1st available)
for dominic rhodes.
at website could only request goings for rhodes (which kiske snagged 1st).

someone needs to give us jamel white.  i tried to pick him up yesterday
and the site wouldn't let me.  if we still want to make any other waivers
this week is it possible?

Please do all transaction requests via the web site.  If you want more then one player, then let me know via email and I will add the second player to your list if the first one is not available.  All owners have until Friday, at 9am to enter transaction requests.  The requests will be given to owners with the worst record first then the worst point total second.  After Friday at 9am, you can still enter a request on a first come first served basis.

Kevin
