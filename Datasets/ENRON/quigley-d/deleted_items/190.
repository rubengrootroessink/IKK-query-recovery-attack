atest NFL Player News  Trent Green , QB KC - She Said Updated 10/18/01 Gree=
n should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the C=
hiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger ,=
 TE IND - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor i=
n the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against=
 the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - =
Pumpdog Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at =
tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against N=
ew England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Leather Cheerios Updat=
ed 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game again=
st New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf th=
is week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expe=
cted to ! st! art in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second cons=
ecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy=
 lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/=
01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Pa=
triots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against Ne=
w England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - KMB Express Updated 10/18/01 Manning =
did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepte=
d by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at ho=
me this week.  Randy Moss  , WR MIN - Cali Bound Updated 10/18/01 Moss did =
not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He shoul=
d be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but ho=
ld off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be a=
ble to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Baby Blues Updated 10/18/01 Schroede=
r missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment=
 and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether t=
o use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE! -! The Hillrods Updated 10/18/01=
 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary migh=
t have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layof=
f didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - She Said Updated 10/=
18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Col=
ts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in=
 his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Baby Blues=
 Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He=
 could have a g! oo! d week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams.=
 He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan aroun=
d Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 =
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down =
by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downf=
ield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/=
01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Je=
ts will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen D=
avis , RB WAS - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18/01  Davis had his first decent ga=
me of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fant=
asy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an adva=
ntageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants considerati=
on.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very medi=
ocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 13=
2 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster s=
pot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World C=
ount! ry! man Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this s=
eason, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some su=
ccess against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting =
in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Third World Countryman Upd=
ated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis=
 defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw h=
is first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of th! e ! work at tight end now th=
at Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy considera=
tion at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Ga=
rdner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on=
 Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larg=
er leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Pumpdog Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the p=
otential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday.=
 He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a=
 weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Cali Bound Updated 10/18/01 Bruce h=
asn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever cons=
ider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable =
N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Xtreme Updated 10/18/01 Con=
well has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. =
He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tigh=
t end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18=
/01 Canida! te! will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured b=
ack this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams=
' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective=
.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - The Hillrods Updated 10/18/01 Considering the hu=
ge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every=
 week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so =
be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - The Wounded=
 Ducks Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be su=
rprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the =
Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckha=
lter will likely be ! th! e more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McN=
abb , QB PHI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantas=
y players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should=
 beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be=
 sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Xtreme Update=
d 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite tar=
gets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary i=
s a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated=
 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained med=
ial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatl=
ey will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable fo=
r Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PH=
I - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at =
producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He'=
s one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup =
on a weekly basis.   More Updates   Transactions NFL Reports  [IMAGE]'); [I=
