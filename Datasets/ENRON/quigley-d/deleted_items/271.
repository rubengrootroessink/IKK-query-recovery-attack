 PHI  Updated 10/24/01 Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to pla=
y in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Ron Dixon=
 , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01 Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained =
ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.  Joe =
Jurevi! ci! us , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01 Ike Hilliard regained his startin=
g position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jureviciu=
s was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be us=
eless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to star=
ting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this sea=
son. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game whil=
e Toomer stood on the sidelines.   Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/0=
1 Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sund=
ay's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday=
 and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be av=
ailable," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini an! d ! Raghib Isma=
il will get more playing time in his absence.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL  Upd=
ated 10/24/01 Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game again=
st the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playi=
ng. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited pr=
actice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that=
 it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head c=
oach Dave Campo.     Darrin Chiaverini , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Chiaverin=
i practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the =
Cardinals. ! He! is recovering from a left knee injury.   Raghib Ismail , W=
R DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced =
Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.=
   Ricky Watters , RB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tr=
ibune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to t=
he starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or=
 longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I wo=
uld be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our =
best player when! h! e got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played w=
ell. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If yo=
u have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your=
 team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander do=
wn the stretch.   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable=
 to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB j=
ob to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this poin=
t.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seaha=
wks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the=
 Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Has=
selbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorabl=
e matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fan! ta! sy perspective, so don't use him t=
his week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ  Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Ch=
rebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an M=
RI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday =
against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA  Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monda=
y's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at =
Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  La=
mar Smith , RB MIA  Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to a=
n ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be=
 afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC  Updated 10/23/01 Chie=
fs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chr=
is Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you u=
se either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imp=
osing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome=
 Pathon , WR IND  Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight gam=
e Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this =
week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND  Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable =
for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend y=
ou use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN  Updated =
10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his =
comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not deci=
ded whether they will activate him. He will work in p! ra! ctice this week =
and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't =
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain =
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick D=
unn , RB TB  Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn d=
oesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't prac=
tice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday =
against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI  Updated 10/23/01 Staley started =
Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carr=
ied the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the gam=
e by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in t=
he game. ! At! this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consisten=
t Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a so=
lid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN  Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a n=
eck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinn=
ey , TE TEN  Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report be=
cause of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game=
.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN  Updated 10/23/01 D! ys! on is recovering from a t=
humb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. =
He is expected to participate in practice.   Eddie George , RB TEN  Updated=
 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected t=
o play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 10/23/01 McNai=
r is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. Ho=
wever, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN=
  Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem i=
n his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week.=
 Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect =
Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.=
   Damon Jones , TE JAC  Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume pract=
icing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not=
 require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC  Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been =
ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his! s! tatus for next wee=
k's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they in=
crease his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told=
 The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to =
play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can =
make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor=
 has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis=
 Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because =
of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action ne=
xt week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL  Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday bu=
t head coach ! Br! ian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that=
 the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the l=
ast four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL  Updated=
 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a spra=
ined ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start=
 at running back if Allen is inactive.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=
