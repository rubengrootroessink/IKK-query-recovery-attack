   Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keyshawn John=
son , WR TB - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half =
of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right =
knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a=
 sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI =
in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are sayin=
g that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could n=
ot have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Sm=
ith! , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself OK =
despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victor=
y over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll =
be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know th=
e degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk=
 off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at =
the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on M=
onday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunte =
Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/28/01 According to publi=
shed reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tam=
pa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DE=
N - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time fo=
r 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideo=
ut has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of produc=
tivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Anderson ru=
shed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score! o!=
 n an eight-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 ti=
mes for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Ander=
son this year.  David Patten , WR NE - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/28/01=
 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should conti=
nue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top t=
wo receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/2=
8/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carr=
ied the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat =
against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conwa=
y , WR SD - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 =
yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he =
is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally per=
forming up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - A=
ddison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to pl=
ay against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catc=
hes was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers o=
n short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight=
 end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - =
The Replacements Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving ya=
rds on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball do=
wnfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers f=
rom Centers ecery week.  Peerless P! ri! ce  , WR BUF - The Replacements Up=
dated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Dieg=
o. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to=
 start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Lake Aus=
tin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, =
throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to h=
ave some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on i=
mportant downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Th=
e Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the streng=
th of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but =
he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage nu=
mbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Or=
onde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught =
only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing=
 well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight  , =
WR MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94=
 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver cont=
inues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Mone=
y Shots Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries b=
y Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should no=
t start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Team T-B=
one Updated 10/28/01 ! To! omer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD a=
gainst Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what t=
he opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Upda=
ted 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held ou=
t of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Reds=
kins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  T=
ony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards,=
 two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB i=
s playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PH=
I - Water Boys Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but wa=
s held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 3=
5 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should =
post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Bu=
ckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither bac=
k is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie =
Garner , RB OAK - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times fo=
r 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put hi=
m firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remai=
ns sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/28/01 G=
annon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sund=
ay's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' se=
condary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  =
Dono! va! n McNabb  , QB PHI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 McNab=
b passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but h=
e didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great =
stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. Mc=
Nabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be=
 a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael =
Pittman , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16=
 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than =
Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliab=
le Fantasy option for the remainder of the ! ye! ar.  David Boston , WR ARI=
 - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards =
in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent qua=
rterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player beca=
use he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a so=
lid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Team T-Bone Update=
d 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interception=
s in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be=
. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for usef=
ul stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/=
28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded t=
wo sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewh=
at decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let th=
is performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consist=
ent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns a=
nd an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score i=
n Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy=
 owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recomme=
nd Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bl=
ue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late=
 in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushi=
ng yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quar=
ter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for furth=
er examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned=
