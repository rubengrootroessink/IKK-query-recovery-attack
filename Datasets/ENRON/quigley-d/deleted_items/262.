layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01 Acco=
rding to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says th=
at Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, whic=
h could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come t=
o it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back i=
nto the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) =
has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, =
he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to =
stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the jo=
b back from Alexander down th! e ! stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free A=
gent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groi=
n injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't=
 be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Lake =
Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' sta=
rting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle=
 Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck =
as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchu=
! p ! for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week=
.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have =
listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will =
have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffere=
d Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23=
/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to m=
iss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this poi=
nt in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01 Sm=
ith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to=
 play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin M=
innis , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail=
 said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's ga=
me against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite=
 the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is g=
oing to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - High Sh=
rivel Fac! to! r Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game=
 Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this w=
eek.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is=
 questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don=
't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB=
 DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting=
 Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic k=
nee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whet! he! r they will activat=
e him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by W=
ednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fant=
asy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running ba=
ck and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated=
 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstr=
ing strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in t=
he week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  =
 Duce Staley , RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's=
 game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the =
ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by roo=
kie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11! c! arries late in the ga=
me. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantas=
y numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid repl=
acement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - CYSWC Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a ne=
ck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinne=
y , TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injur=
y report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this =
week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 Dyso=
n is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's gam=
e against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie G=
eorge , RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb i=
njury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve=
 McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a =
sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected =
to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated=
 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his bac=
k. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatmen=
t options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders t=
o play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon =
Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume pr=
acticing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would =
not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - High S! hr! ivel Factor Updat=
ed 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore an=
d his status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, f=
rom week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," hea=
d coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen w=
hen Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds wel=
l this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return=
 date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his gro=
in on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 =
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to pla=
y when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Money =
Shots Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billic=
k told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this=
 week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a s=
prained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01 A=
llen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle,=
 is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running=
 back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL -! S! outh Park Cows Upd=
ated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's ga=
me against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-da=
y. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There co=
uld be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or=
 thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham wil=
l replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High=
 Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday=
's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be availa=
ble for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL =
- Barking Spiders Updated 10/23/01  According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatc=
h, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend ag=
ainst New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coa=
ch Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced=
 that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Ca=
nidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets,=
 and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J=
. Stokes , WR SF - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much=
 of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being complet=
ely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing fo! =
r ! me because I was able to get treatment every day," Stokes told the Cont=
ra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent bu=
t I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't us=
e him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   =
Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard contin=
ues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. H=
illiard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against=
 Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost =
completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon=
 missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprain=
ed ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Da=
llas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk=
 is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just taking th=
e same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Mar=
shall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'=
ll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate would once =
again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    More Updates  Roste=
