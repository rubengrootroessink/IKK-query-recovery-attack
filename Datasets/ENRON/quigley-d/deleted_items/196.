layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford s=
tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Hillrods Updated 10/21=
/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions=
 was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six gam=
es this year and has become a m! aj! or scoring threat even though he is no=
t very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She =
Said Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards re=
ceiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most =
part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough t=
o bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - She Said Updated 10/21/01 Green threw =
for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been=
 inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod e=
very week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman r=
ushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not =
great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chap=
man may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay hea=
lthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods Update=
d 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven recepti=
ons for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers i=
n the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Michael Pittman , R=
B ARI - Cali Bound Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday ag=
ainst Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pitt=
man won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valu=
able player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - KMB Express Upd=
ated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven p=
asses for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable =
enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.=
   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated 10/2! 1/! 01 Tomlinso=
n was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The=
 rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of=
 the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - The Hill=
rods Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes f=
or 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tig=
ht ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly=
 basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Xtreme Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder)=
 st! ar! ted Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He po=
sted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10=
 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caug=
ht eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive=
 wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often=
.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - KMB Express Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dil=
lon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce bac=
k from such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against C=
incinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more promi=
nent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati,=
 clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bea=
rs' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The L=
eather Cheerios Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 ! ya! =
rds and a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he rem=
ains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent a=
t wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bat=
ch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Ten=
nessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he =
remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNa=
ir , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD =
and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, =
and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might =
be bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie George , RB TEN - The Wounded Duck=
s Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. Th=
e lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his p=
roduction this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Pumpdog Updated 10/21/01 =
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The=
 speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good n=
umbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10=
/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orlean=
s. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of th=
e year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Xtreme Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught on=
ly one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give u=
p on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Count=
ryman Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on fiv=
e catches against the Falc! on! s. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality=
 Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with r=
egularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - She Said Updated 10/21/01 Wa=
rd was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still mak=
ing important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limite=
d because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warr=
ick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played desp=
ite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited=
 to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht=
 , TE NYJ - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. =
Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsis=
tent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him=
 worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson ,=
 WR TB - Baby Blues Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards=
 against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB =
Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numb=
ers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21=
/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. H=
e also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile g=
ood numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS Upd=
ated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 2=
32 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured ba=
ck may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marsha=
ll Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had =
a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score agains=
t Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 recei=
ving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspe=
