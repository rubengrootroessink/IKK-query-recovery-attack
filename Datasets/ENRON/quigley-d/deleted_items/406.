FL Player News  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Pumpdog Updated 11/26/01 The Bronco=
s placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the ac=
tive roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken le=
g on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Pump=
dog Updated 11/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in th=
e second half of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. H=
e did not throw a touchdown pass for! t! he first time this season, however=
, and has been very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper =
continues to struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injur=
y by Week 12.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 It is u=
nclear who will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicag=
o, as Batch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on T=
hursday. Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch =
can't go, but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough =
Bears secondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.  Quincy C=
arter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday t=
hat Carter will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Su=
nday's game against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season=
 for Dallas, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. W=
e don't recommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI -=
 The Hillrods Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Min=
nesota with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against D=
etroit. Keep an eye on his progress during practice this week before you ma=
ke a final decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 1=
1/26/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstri=
ng problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game agains=
t San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him=
 for Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - KMB Express Updated 11/26/01 Graham su=
ffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is d=
ay to day.  Jason Broo! k! ins  , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/26/=
01 Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore w=
ill elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Ay=
anbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - The Hillrods Updated 11/26/01=
 Barlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has n=
ot been determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Upda=
ted 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury o! n ! Sunday. His curr=
ent status is day to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/=
26/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Bucca=
neers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarte=
r of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despi=
te being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an inef=
fective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the gam=
e. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  =
Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught s=
ix passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level=
 of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the=
 stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB J=
AC - Xtreme U! pd! ated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and c=
aught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing,=
 Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail ,=
 WR BAL - She Said Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catche=
s for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a=
 must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and=
 underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Du=
cks Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonvil=
le, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to b=
e a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Cali Bou=
nd Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against O=
akland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the se=
ason.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Barber r=
ushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passe! s ! fo=
r 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still li=
ke to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB S=
D - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, b=
ut he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 1=
45 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   D=
oug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game,=
 throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's o=
nly worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , Q=
B ARI - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, po=
sting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw =
two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , =
WR ARI - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game,=
 catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Di! eg! o. H=
e's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth =
starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countrym=
an Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching=
 five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependab=
le Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn=
 , WR NO - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid out=
ing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a ver=
y dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly bas=
is.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/25/01 In his return from =
a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Croc=
kett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not a=
ppear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even whe=
n he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Ch=
arlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Smith had=
 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a=
 slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footb=
allers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge n=
umbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. =
He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will like=
ly keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon =
, QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards,=
 three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked =
conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Foot=
ball.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left S=
unday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He =
was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Mould=
s , WR BUF - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an ex=
tended slump, catchin! g ! six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Mia=
mi. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Mo=
ulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if =
he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  More U=
