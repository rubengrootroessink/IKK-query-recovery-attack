 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Xtreme =
Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers=
. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett m=
ay be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather C=
heerios Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expecte=
d to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky =
start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated=
 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Ci=
ncinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual=
 drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despi=
te not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result. =
 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/16/01 Smith will re=
turn to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with=
 a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's p=
ractice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His r=
eturn bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use ei=
ther back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injur=
y report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game agai=
nst Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a la=
rger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit second=
ary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.   ! Chris Weinke , Q=
B CAR - KMB Express Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke=
 will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. =
However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper ,=
 QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy=
 season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season.=
 He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspecti=
ve, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter =
, WR MIN - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down =
somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. Th=
e veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game=
 against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   =
Randy Moss , WR MIN - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probabl=
e for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's be=
en underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him base=
d on his potential to! p! ost solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB =
NO - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fan=
tasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He=
'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season lo=
ng, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Third World Cou=
ntryman Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last w=
eekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent=
 this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to benc=
h him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jack=
son , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge=
 game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards =
receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable =
to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   =
Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 ! HU! EVOS Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped=
 up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rus=
hing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fan=
tasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is=
 vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his =
last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver tea=
m that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in ve=
ry deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Country=
man Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he ha=
s caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver=
 secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deep=
er leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Baby Blues Update=
d 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching o=
nly three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weeken=
d against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. !   Az-Zahir Hak=
im , WR STL - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent=
 weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup=
 is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, s=
o avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Pumpdo=
g Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but =
he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New =
England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fanta=
sy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR =
STL - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy tota=
ls this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He=
'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still=
 worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , =
RB STL - Baby Blues Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina=
, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a mu=
st-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New E=
ngland.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had =
a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gam=
ble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starti=
ng Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. =
  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Baby Blues ! Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be =
the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surpris=
ed if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Wee=
k 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16=
/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis.=
 He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a =
real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Walls h=
as! b! een held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of t=
he better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Franc=
isco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR =
- KMB Express Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive g=
ame, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some succ=
ess in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting hi=
m is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Fav=
re has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season.=
 He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so =
be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Hillrods Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven tou=
chdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have=
 a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that shoul=
d start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Baby Blues Updated 1=
1/16/01 S! ch! roeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and i=
s expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week =
against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like=
 Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Drough=
ns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this we=
ekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outsi=
de of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren ,=
 RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of =
the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries wit=
h Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fa=
