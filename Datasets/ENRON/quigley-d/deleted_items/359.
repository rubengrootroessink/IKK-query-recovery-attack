layer Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI  =
Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game agai=
nst Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Bri=
an Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BA=
L  Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspende=
d for four games for violating the NFL's drug and alcohol policy. Lewis' fo=
ur-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allow! ed!=
 to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17=
. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee. =
  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sun=
day's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's f=
eature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wych=
eck , TE TEN  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is e=
xpected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a =
risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 11/=
16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincin=
nati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dri=
lls Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite n=
ot being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emm=
itt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 11/16/01 Smith will ret! ur! n to the lineup Su=
nday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right kne=
e. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith wo=
uld "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hamb=
rick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the=
 stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI  Updated 11/16/01 Sand=
ers (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now lis=
ted as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're =
completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' m=
atchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long =
as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 11/16/01 According =
to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's =
game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantas=
y team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace=
 for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's o=
ffense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from =
a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly ba=
sis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down =
somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. Th=
e veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game=
 against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   =
Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday=
's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachi=
eving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his pot=
ential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO  Updated 11/=
16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a g=
ood player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense tha=
t has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.    =
 Aaron Brooks , QB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San F=
rancisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a b=
it inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes i=
t tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.=
 !   Willie Jackson , WR NO  Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game ag=
ainst San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receivin=
g. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the p=
ass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen =
Davis , RB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginn=
ing the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four g=
ames, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the=
 start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scori=
ng games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of =
late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good mat=
chup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air,=
 but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael We=
stbrook , WR WAS  Updated 11/16! /0!  Westbrook has been inconsistent this =
season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He=
'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so sta=
rting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS  U=
pdated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catch=
ing only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this w=
eekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir =
Hakim , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01  Hakim has been inconsistent in recent wee=
ks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is =
right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so av=
oid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL  Updated 11/=
16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only sco=
red only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secon=
dary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based=
 on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL  Updated =
11/16/01! Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's=
 still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and t=
he formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on=
 his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL  Updated 11/16/01=
 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best =
Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post=
 solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL  Up=
dated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fa=
ntasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end aro=
und the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners =
will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR  Updated 11/16/01=
 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but=
 don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting e=
ither back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR  Updated =
11/16/01 Hayes had on! ly! two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St=
. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting h=
im is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR  Updated 11/16/01 Walls has b=
een held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the bett=
er tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in=
 the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Update=
d 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six pa=
sses for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past agai=
nst this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. =
  Brett Favre , QB GB  Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fant=
asy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on S=
unday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week=
.   Bubba Franks , TE GB  Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yarda=
ge numbers, but his seven tou! ch! downs in eight games makes him a valuabl=
e Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is=
 the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroed=
er , WR GB  Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL inj=
ury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a soli=
d play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong p=
assing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commis=
