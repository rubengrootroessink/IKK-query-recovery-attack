As the  creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to eliminate  the inherent advantage that the #1 & #14 teams had by getting back to back  picks every other round, I think the time for mathematical preciseness has  passed.  I'm all for going to a simplified traditional snake system.   Frankly, at this point I think there are as many disadvantages to being 1 or 14  (or 2 - 13) as advantages that it all works itself out.  Hell, if it makes  preparing for the draft any easier (or administering the league), I'm for  it!
 
PS -  I'm for keeping TE's too!

Subject: Franchise Players and the Draft
The following is the list of franchise players  that have been kept:
 
Grant Johnson - Eddie George
Jeff Smith - Peyton Manning
Michael Deluke - Marshall Faulk
Michael Currie - Edgerrian James
Jeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner
 
I know this was brought up last year and we kind  of decided much of nothing...but does anyone object to going to a snake system  for the draft.  1-14, 14-1 for the whole draft?  We will still have  a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise players.  Then  the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of the supplemental round  for round one...thus if you pick first in the supplemental round, you will  pick last (for those that did not keep franchise players) in the first  round.  Then, the teams that kept franchise players will be randomly  selected to pick at the end of the first round.  After the first round,  the draft will snake back the other way with the last pick in the first round  getting the first pick in the second round and the draft will continue in this  snake order until the end of the draft.  Let me know what you think or if  you are confused.
 
See everyone at the draft!!! 
 
Kevin
