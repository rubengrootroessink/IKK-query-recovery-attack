 Hilliard , WR NYG - KMB Express Updated 11/19/01 Hilliard continues to fee=
l some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing him to li=
mp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Min=
nesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   =
Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published =
reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend=
 against Carolina! . ! He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so =
don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Third World C=
ountryman Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunda=
y's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and=
 Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve=
 McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with a=
n injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss =
some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's=
 next game.   Packers , DT GB - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/19/01 Safet=
y LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's gam=
e against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of t=
he season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler'=
s absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/19/01 McNair was a=
ble to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tenne! ss! ean says =
he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able=
 to play in the team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Xtreme Updated=
 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury=
. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne ,=
 WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sun=
day. His current status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods U=
pdated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status fo=
r Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Thi=
rd World Countryman Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the=
 season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered =
a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weeken=
d's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Upd=
ated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's ga=
me against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as=
 day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders=
 had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 y=
ards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is=
 listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updat! ed! 11/=
19/01  Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's rea=
dy to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few=
 more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to eva=
luate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade =
value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Upd=
ated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's deci=
sion not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an =
ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have bee=
n able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantas=
y value might drop greatly. Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/0=
1 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning New=
s is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the ti=
me being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Footba=
ll.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sun=
day's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His sta=
tus for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time.   =
Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a con=
cussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that =
there's a "definite possibility" he would be ready in time for next weekend=
's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to=
 play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.  =
 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Su=
nday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expec=
ted to be in the starting l! in! eup when Dallas faces Denver on Thanksgivi=
ng Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffer=
ed an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is liste=
d as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 How=
ard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not=
 return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's=
 game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR C=
AR - KMB Express Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Su=
nday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atla=
nta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/18/01 Ande=
rson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. ! Ol! and=
is Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is =
no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continu=
e to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third Worl=
d Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards an=
d a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and=
 Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plum=
mer , QB ARI - She Said Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four =
TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare=
 for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman =
, RB ARI - Cali Bound Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pi=
ttman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcomin=
g weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Pumpd=
og Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards a=
t Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consid! er! Sloan, who alwa=
ys gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and cau=
ght 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature =
Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a go=
od Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third W=
orld Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards agains=
t the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count=
 on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. H=
e can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Bab=
y Blues Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the =
Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson =
down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  More Updates [I=
