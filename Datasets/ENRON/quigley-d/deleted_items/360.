 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water B=
oys Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Char=
gers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crocke=
tt may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Water Boy=
s Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to p=
lay half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start =
from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11=
/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cinci=
nnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dr=
ills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite =
not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Em=
mitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to =
the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprai=
ned right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice =
that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bu=
mps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either bac=
k against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison=
 Red Cornholes Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL in=
jury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game a=
gainst Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a=
 larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit sec=
ondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke ,=
 QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weink=
e will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco.=
 However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper =
, QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a =
good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense =
this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fanta=
sy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   =
Cris Carter , WR MIN - Money Shots Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be=
 down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benchi=
ng. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a goo=
d game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday nig=
ht.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Moss is liste=
d as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle inj=
ury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to be=
nch him based on his potential to p! os! t solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky W=
illiams , RB NO - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the be=
tter Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly b=
asis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all s=
eason long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - The Rep=
lacements Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last=
 weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsiste=
nt this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to be=
nch him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Ja=
ckson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up =
a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 =
yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulne=
rable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid opti=
on.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lak! e ! Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16=
/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's a=
veraged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerg=
ing as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a D=
enver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB W=
AS - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, thr=
owing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this=
 weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's=
 only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook ,=
 WR WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent th=
is season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games.=
 He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so =
starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS=
 - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last t=
wo games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable=
 matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good mo=
ve.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Hakim =
has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team=
 is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New E=
ngland secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.=
   Torry Holt , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Holt continue=
s to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touc=
hdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, =
but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential t=
o put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated=
 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's=
 still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and t=
he formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on=
 his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Dallas De! mo! =
n Horde Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving th=
at he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start eve=
ry week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Er=
nie Conwell , TE STL - Barking Spiders Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a f=
ew down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble=
. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting =
Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   R=
ichard Huntley  , RB CAR - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Huntley wil=
l be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be su=
rprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back i=
n Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Updated =
11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. L=
ouis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him =
is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/0=
1 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still on=
e of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San=
 Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , W=
R CAR - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat=
 productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's =
had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, s=
o starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Water Boys Updated=
 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league=
 this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable s=
econdary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The=
 Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, =
but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player=
. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tig=
ht end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - The=
 Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL i=
njury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a so=
lid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong=
 passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit'=
s backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much =
Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble=
.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely=
 start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He'=
s split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last =
resort in larger Fantasy leagues.   More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE] [=
