son , WR TB - Baby Blues Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half o=
f Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right k=
nee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a =
sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI i=
n the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying=
 that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could no=
t have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smi=
th, RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself O=
K despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 vict=
ory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'l=
l be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know =
the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to wa=
lk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week a=
t the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on=
 Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunt=
e Culpepper , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 10/28/01 According to published repo=
rts, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. H=
e is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Pumpd=
og Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New Engla=
nd, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  sta=
tistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB=
 DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14=
 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard! r! un, but th=
e Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denve=
r appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten=
 , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yar=
ds and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as=
 he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - T=
he Hillrods Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD=
 at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will alwa=
ys be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots'=
 schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/28/01 Conw=
ay caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway wa=
s a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying =
healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideo=
ut.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a spr=
ained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards=
. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much=
 of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideou=
ts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Ce=
nters , RB BUF - The Leather Cheerios Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited =
to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally wa=
nt to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't =
expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless ! Pr! ice  , WR BUF =
- Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 ya=
rds and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to=
 have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hassel=
beck , QB SEA - Pumpdog Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a =
pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued=
 to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield=
 on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Leather Cheerios Updat=
ed 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consider=
ing the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked res=
pectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post g=
ood yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overa=
ll output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden cau=
ght only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not pla=
ying well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight=
 , WR MIA - Baby B! lu! es Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes fo=
r 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver =
continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - =
Cali Bound Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carrie=
s by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should=
 not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - The L=
eather Cheerios Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes fo! r ! 109 yard=
s and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no m=
atter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 HUEVOS Updated=
 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out o=
f the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskin=
s continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony=
 Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, tw=
o TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is p=
laying well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI -=
 KMB Express Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was =
held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 =
yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should po=
st better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buck=
halter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back =
is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Ga=
rner , RB OAK - Baby Blues Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 y=
ards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firm=
ly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sid=
elined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 Gannon=
 passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's =
game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' seconda=
ry, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Do! n=
o! van McNabb  , QB PHI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for ju=
st 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get in=
tercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against t=
he Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bi=
t of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fanta=
sy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB AR=
I - Cali Bound Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards S=
unday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, =
and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the =
remainder of the year. David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods Updated 10/28/0=
1 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While=
 Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspecti=
ve, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in =
the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  =
Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 ya=
rds, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, furthe=
r exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherw=
ise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboy=
s , DT DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Card=
inals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions =
in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspe=
ctive based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into be=
lieving that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.=
  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed =
9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushin=
g for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona=
. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a=
 weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based=
 on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28=
/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter wit=
h a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He=
 will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Cali Bound Updated 10/2=
8/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee =
injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was bri=
efly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.  More Updates  View Tran=
