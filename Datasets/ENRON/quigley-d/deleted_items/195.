layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford s=
tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Replacements Updated 1=
0/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his recept=
ions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six=
 games this year and has become a m! aj! or scoring threat even though he i=
s not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - =
CYSWC Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards r=
eceiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most=
 part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough =
to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 Gree=
n threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green =
has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starti=
ng nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - The Replacements Updated 10/2=
1/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His num=
bers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has bee=
n so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett c=
annot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Blue =
Star Boys Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posti=
ng seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the =
best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Mic=
hael Pittman , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had =
a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total of=
fense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regula=
rity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graha=
m , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego o=
n Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver=
. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's cert=
ainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Barking Spiders =
Updated 10/21/! 01!  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this se=
ason by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on t=
he day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desm=
ond Clark , TE DEN - CYSWC Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday,=
 catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been =
reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to=
 start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Blue Star Boys Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) start! ed! Sunday's game against San Diego, =
but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two in=
terceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Blue Star Bo=
ys Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicag=
o. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he =
does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - CYSWC Updated 1=
0/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the ve=
teran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  Da=
vid Terrell , WR CHI - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seve=
n passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Ter=
rell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anth=
ony Thomas , RB CHI - Team T-Bone Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 ya=
rds and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's =
top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.=
  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven=
 passes for 100 yards and a T! D ! at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings u=
ntil this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Tita=
ns lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted=
 once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two cons=
ecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inco=
nsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/21/01 McNair thr=
ew for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed o=
nly 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly ind=
icating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!   Eddie George , =
RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26=
 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has c=
ertainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Ar=
yan Brother Inc. Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yard=
s and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inc=
onsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumple=
r , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78=
 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick=
 tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against At=
lanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Will=
ie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/21/01 Jackson fi=
nished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the ! Fa! lcons=
. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson=
 is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Wa=
rd , WR PIT - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards =
on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions fo=
r the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's i=
nability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-B=
one Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered hi=
m during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physic=
al Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Dallas Demon Horde Update=
d 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches fo=
r 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but=
 his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position =
lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Money Shots Updated 1=
0/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has d=
eveloped a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wid=
eout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jero=
me Bettis , RB PIT - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed f=
or 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-y=
ard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against=
 any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 C=
anidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of tot=
al offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short=
-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod=
 Gardner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on =
Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He =
seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in =
Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.   More U=
