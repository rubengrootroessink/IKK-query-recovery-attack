, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - She=
 Said Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday tha=
t indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months a=
nd possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Uni=
on. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need mo=
re time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain in=
 his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Tay=
lor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably h=
old onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep en=
ough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Updated 11/21/01 Smith's spr=
ained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there=
 is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered=
 the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should pro=
bably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your =
expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't=
 the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexand=
er , RB SEA - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expe=
cted to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal po=
int of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. H=
e should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady=
 , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady f=
or now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any =
changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy sta=
rter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if yo=
u can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may hav=
e to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's=
 status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The W=
ounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed=
 enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to =
return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continu=
e to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into=
 view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Update! d ! 11/20/01 Mike Riley =
told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Fluti=
e and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "Y=
ou can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this b=
uilding. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win =
the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most F=
antasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener=
 will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His los=
s may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely=
 regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley =
, RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he =
is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.=
  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may pla=
y this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practic=
e early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather Cheerios Updated 1=
1/20/01Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a ri=
sky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/20/01 Th=
e Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's prac=
tice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss=
 any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Update=
d 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to sta=
rt against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 11/20/01 Min=
nis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have =
to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01=
 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game agai=
nst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome P=
athon , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 11! /2! 0/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the =
season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurt=
ing, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting=
 lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Dave W=
annstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Field=
er and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Ja=
y is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away=
 and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Upda=
ted 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be s=
ufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll g=
et a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the De=
nver Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situ=
ation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, =
then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE =
- Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis w=
on't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get =
him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Locket=
t , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury=
 last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphi=
a. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this=
 point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any set=
backs, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suff=
ered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after ef=
fects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Gr=
een , WR TB - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to r=
eturn to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent thi=
s season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens ,=
 WR SF - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained lef=
t knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against=
 Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is ex=
pected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin =
, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury d=
uring Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but =
is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has n=
o real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley. =
   Giants , DT NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 According to the =
New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee beg=
an giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsur=
e that he'd be! a! ble to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday =
night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you sh=
ould consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season=
.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 The Baltim=
ore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team=
's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most F=
antasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver i=
s still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's gam=
e against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy playe=
r at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end=
 Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee sur=
gery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defens=
e and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowb=
oys , DT DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakl=
ey, who was ! ex! pected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will lik=
ely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help=
 keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give=
 Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - =
Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's =
game against Denver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my =
job," Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fant=
asy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if a=
t all possible.     More Updates   Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]=
