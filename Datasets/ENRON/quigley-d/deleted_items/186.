Dutch, I need the bid/offer spread as well.  For each transaction, I need the prevailing bid/offer spread. Could you get that quickly?  I will wait for that right now. I am out tomorrow and would like to work on this on the weekend.

Thanks,

This guy is working on an EOL project for me right now.  Can you send him a file with our EOL trades for today or yesterday with product, price, buy/sell, and timestamp but counterparty names deleted
