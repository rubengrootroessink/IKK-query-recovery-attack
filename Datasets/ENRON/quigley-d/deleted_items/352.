  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Update=
d 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, =
expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver =
has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS =
- Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will star=
t Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last=
 weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effect! s ! of the injur=
y and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Bark=
ing Spiders Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to pract=
ice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and =
is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Water=
 Boys Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during=
 the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries=
 aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the sta=
rting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game aga=
inst Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in =
this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fanta=
sy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - The Replacements Updated 11/2=
0/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-r=
epaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fa=
ct, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cri=
s Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on =
a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the=
 rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - South Park Cows Updated 11/20=
/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replac=
ed as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to st=
art for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/=
20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss =
Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a=
 Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Addison Red Cornholes U=
pdated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the sea=
son after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack o=
utput of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passin=
g yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/20/01=
 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a spr=
ained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just =
one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect =
his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmi=
tt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start=
 on Thursday's game against Denver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy e=
nough to do my job," Smith told the Dallas Morning Star . He'll struggle to=
 post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench hi=
m this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Upda=
ted 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San F=
rancisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to pl=
ay this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst =
in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   T=
erry Hardy , TE ARI - South Park Cows Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expect! e! =
d to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder=
 injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   =
Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thur=
sday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an un=
reliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues. =
  James Stewart , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/20/01 Stewart (ankle)=
 is hopeful that he can play returned to practice and may start Thursday's =
game against Green Bay. He will work his ankle extensively in practice prio=
r to Thursday, and is optimistic that he'll be ready to play. If Stewart is=
 able to go, he's worth starting in if you need a running back for Week 11.=
     Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/20/01 Taylor has =
been told by a medical specialist that he should not return to action this =
weekend against Pittsburgh. In fact, Taylor could be out for an even longer=
 period of time than what was originally diagnosed. Taylor tore the groin m=
uscle completely off the bone back in Week Two, which is an injury that nor=
mally takes about three months to heal. "It's going to be very unfair for !=
 an! yone to assume he will play any time in the immediate future," said Ta=
ylor's agent, Drew Rosenhaus. "He's just not healthy yet. He can't run full=
 speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good job in wo=
rking him but he's still in pain." Expect Stacey Mack and Elvis Joseph to c=
ontinue splitting carries in Taylor's absence.    Bert Emanuel , WR DET - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/20/01 Emanuel is out for Thursday's game against Green=
 Bay due to a sprained ankle. In fact, the injury is so bad that Emanuel ma=
y miss the remiander of the season, but no definitive word on his condition=
 has been made by the team.  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Dallas Demon Horde =
Updated 11/20/01 According to published reports, Muhammad's shoulder injury=
 will likely keep him out of Sunday's game against Atlanta. That could mean=
 big things for Donald Hayes and Issac Bryd, who'll start against a questio=
nable Falcons secondary.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Team T-Bone Updated 1=
1/20/01 Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'l=
l likely be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last =
week against Indianpolis.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/=
20/01 According to the Dallas Morning News, Carter expects to start on Dec.=
 2 against Washington. Carter, who has been out since October with a hamstr=
ing injury, will serve as the No. 3 quarterback on Thursday vs. Denver.   I=
ke Hilliard , WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/19/01 Hilliard continu=
es to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing =
him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday's game ag=
ainst Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his i=
njury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to p=
ublished reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action thi=
s weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however=
, so don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - CYSWC Up=
dated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win=
 over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is ex=
pected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB=
 TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury =
to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some prac=
tice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next gam=
e.   Packers , DT GB - South Park Cows Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler=
 suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atla=
nta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chr=
is Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence.   S=
teve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play=
 with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probabl=
y miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the=
 team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 1=
1/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. =
X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , W=
R IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunda=
y. His current status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Aryan Brother In=
c. Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His statu=
s for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL -=
 High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of th=
e season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered=
 a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weeke=
nd's contest at Carolina.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commission=
