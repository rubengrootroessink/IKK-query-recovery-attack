will teams be aware of all players dropped????
if you guys (commissioners) are privy to all transactions but we
are not (ie. kiske's infamous mcnair pickup last year) then that
gives y'all an unfair advantage.  i want to know on/by Friday who all
has been released.  does the site offer that?

Please do all transaction requests via the web site.  If you want more then one player, then let me know via email and I will add the second player to your list if the first one is not available.  All owners have until Friday, at 9am to enter transaction requests.  The requests will be given to owners with the worst record first then the worst point total second.  After Friday at 9am, you can still enter a request on a first come first served basis.
