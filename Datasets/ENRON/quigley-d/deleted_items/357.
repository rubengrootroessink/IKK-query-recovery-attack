 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Team T-=
Bone Updated 11/18/01 Cleeland (ankle) has been declared inactive for Sunda=
y's game against Indianapolis. Boo Williams and Lamont Hall will split time=
 at tight end in his absence.   Dez White , WR CHI - Team T-Bone Updated 11=
/18/01 White (ankle) will start Sunday's game. He still may not do much aga=
inst the Tampa Bay defense.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated =
11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White starte=
d against the Ravens.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/18/0=
1 McNair will start Sunday's game against Cincinnati as long after taking p=
re-game snaps without any problems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb inj=
ury, isn't worth starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper leagues.  =
 Jacquez Green , WR TB - Barking Spiders Updated 11/18/0!  Green (abdominal=
 strain) is out for Sunday's game. Reidel Anthony will start in his absence=
.  James Stewart , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/18/01 Stewart (ankle=
) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. However, coach Marty Mornhinweg=
 stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting closer to returning=
 to action.   Marco Battaglia , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Battag=
lia (appendectomy) has been placed on injured reserve and is out for the re=
mainder of the 2001 season. The ! bi! g tight end has no real value as a Fa=
ntasy player.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/18/0=
1 Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be fa=
cing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so Fant=
asy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB=
 JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin) practiced without=
 incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clearance before he can pla=
y in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is able to play, however,=
 he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack will get the start in an=
y event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is not a wise move.   Jerom=
e Pathon , WR IND - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (foot) is ou=
t for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indianapolis Star=
. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James Jackson , R=
B CLE - Money Shots Updated! 1! 1/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a ga=
metime decison on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unabl=
e to play, Jamel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay =
getting some looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI =
- Water Boys Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weeken=
d's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of =
the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal =
Lewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01!  According to published repor=
ts, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension we=
nt into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabili=
tate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will wo=
rk toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB O=
AK - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game w=
ith the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back.=
 Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN=
 - Water Bo! ys! Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck i=
s expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him=
 a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money S=
hots Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's gam=
e against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball durin=
g individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely t=
o play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week a=
s a result.  Emmitt Smith  , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Smith=
 will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two ga=
mes with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Fr=
iday's practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game=
." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend yo=
u use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , =
WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was add=
ed to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for=
 Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate fo=
r a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' ! ma! tchup against a vu=
lnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to pla=
y.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to publ=
ished reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game ag=
ainst San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.=
   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Culpeppe=
r is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in =
Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the=
 league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup o=
n a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Money Shots Updated 11/16/01 Car=
ter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to =
ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, a=
nd should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' sec=
ondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 11=
/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants=
 due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's alm=
ost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy nu=
mbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Williams =
is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to u=
se on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been unde=
rachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks  =
, QB NO - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against S=
an Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be=
 a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers mak=
es it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defe=
nse.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16/0=
1 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11=
 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis sq=
uad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this wee=
k is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets =
Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season s=
lowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is onc=
e again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 1=
0 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony=
 Banks , QB WAS - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well=
 of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good=
 matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the =
air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michae=
l Westbrook , WR WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been in=
consistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his las=
t four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable=
 at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gar=
dner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check =
in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does hav=
e a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him=
 is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11=
/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your=
 Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against =
a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of de=
eper leagues.   More Updates   Schedule, Breakdown  [IMAGE] CYSWC Player Po=
