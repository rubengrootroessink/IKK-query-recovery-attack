i got a call from jody's alleged partner last night...he's out and feels
guilty so since he is a manager at sherlock's....free 1st round when we
decide to visit....cheap bastard!

so am i jody's partner and do we have a 14th team????

i'm not sure who's more pathetic....me giving up a hawaiian vacation
2 years ago so i could partake....or grant taking time from work and
flying in from alaska to be part of the houston ffl?

gamblers rule!  now if we could only entice jody to bring aboard his
wife....all would be right.

That idea is the best I've heard so far.  And this thing about not voting
this year is crap because if enough people have issues about something it
should be voted on for this year.  It's not like it would be a major problem
to implement such a system for this year as you've already said we'll come
with two systems on Saturday.  This is what email is for - why can't we have
a vote on email between today and tomorrow and have a decision before
Saturday.
