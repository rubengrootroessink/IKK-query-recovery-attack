t NFL Player News   Giants , DT NYG  Updated 10/17/01 Defensive tackle Keit=
h Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during Sunday's game against St. L=
ouis, but he is expected to play on Monday night against Philadelphia. Line=
backer Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should be able to play in the gam=
e as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen has a sprained ankle, and =
his status against the Eagles is questionable at this point.   Ryan Leaf , =
QB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dal! la! s Morning News , Leaf wi=
ll get his chance to win the starting QB job in the next few weeks. "If we'=
re going to get an evaluation on him, this is the open window," coach Dave =
Campo said. "At this point, I don't know if he's going to be any more than =
the third quarterback, but this is the window of opportunity." In any event=
, Leaf's value as a Fantasy player will be very minimal.   Joey Galloway , =
WR DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off=
 from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Mo=
nday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be=
 determined.   Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Swinton (hamstring=
) will not practice this week in order to rest his injury. He will be re-ev=
aluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against =
Arizona will be determined.   Robert Thomas , RB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Thom=
as had an MRI performed on his sprained left ankle Monday, and is expected =
to miss at least one game. Thomas has no real Fantasy value at this point. =
  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA  Updated 10/16/01 Hasselbeck is scheduled to sta=
rt the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Miami due to a ! gr! oin inju=
ry suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. "Matt has had a couple of weeks to w=
atch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove," Head Coa=
ch Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Ha=
sselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' d=
efense in Week Seven.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA  Updated 10/16/01 Dilfer suffe=
red a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expec=
ted to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle P=
ost-Intelligencer. "There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll=
 just leave it at that," Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. "He=
's injured, and he won't practice this week." Dilfer is probably the better=
 Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your te=
am for the next two weeks.  Tony Richardson  , RB KC  Updated 10/16/01 Chie=
fs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could p=
lay Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is bat=
tling a shoulder injury.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 10/16/01 Wheatl=
ey had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he susta=
ined to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected ba=
ck Tuesday.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA  Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a ! wa! lk=
ing boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the =
Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when =
the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN  Updated 10/1=
6/01 The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game =
in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning =
on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previ=
ous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as =
well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the star=
t.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF  Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as proba=
ble for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't be=
en a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believ=
e that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Jamal Anderson , RB ATL  =
Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn A=
CL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured re=
serve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season.   Marshall Faulk , R=
B STL  Updated 10/16/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday'! s ! game a=
gainst the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. "He really could pos=
sibly play this week," coach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the =
possibility of him playing completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, howev=
er, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it=
's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, =
so monitor the situation throughout the week.   Justin McCareins , WR TEN  =
Updated 10/16/01 McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after break=
ing his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery o=
n the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback=
 for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards.=
   Eddie Berlin , WR TEN  Updated 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver used m=
ostly on special teams,  will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered=
 a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sunday.!   Dennis =
Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach Butch Davis told Th=
e Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this wee=
k against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he i=
s a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week.   Peter Warrick ,=
 WR CIN  Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game a=
gainst the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Marco Bat=
taglia , TE CIN  Updated 10/16/01  Battaglia is listed as probable for Sund=
ay's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder.=

ng a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's receive=
d in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was =
slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltim=
ore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback =
stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was =
pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared him=
self fit enough to play. "I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking =
me up! e! very few hours to see if I was alive," he said, "but I'm feeling =
OK and I'll be ready."      Redskins , DT WAS  Updated 10/16/01 Washington =

ainst Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is current=
ly listed as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS  Updated 10/16/01 Ale=

gton. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-d=
ay.   Duce Staley , RB PHI  Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach And=
y Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.=
Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckha=
lter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius ,=
 WR NYG  Updated 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's =
game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so e=

a.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB  Updated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed He=
ad Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against =

against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real=
 value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL  Updated=

aches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss=
 six weeks of action due to the procedure.    Raghib Ismail , WR DAL  Updat=
