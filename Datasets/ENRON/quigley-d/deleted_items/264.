th or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. =
"I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was=
 our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played=

you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on yo=

at this point.Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated =
10/23/01Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's =
game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replace=

tasy perspective, so don't use him this week.Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - South =
Park Cows Updated 10/23/01The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for =
next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine=
 the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.Dedric Wa=

 a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.Lamar Smith, RB MIA - =
Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle=
 injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid=
 to use him this week.Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01Ch=
iefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of C=
hris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you=
 use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly i=

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01Davis is=
 still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game fro=
m arthroscopic knee s! ur! gery, but the Broncos have not decided whether t=
hey will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos h=
ope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use=
 Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's sta=
rting running back and is 100 percent healthy. Warrick Dunn, RB TB - Team T=
-Bone Updated 10/23/01According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't h=
ave a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice unt=
il late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against =
Minnesota. Duce Staley, RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01Staley started =
Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carr=
ied the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the gam=
e by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on ! 11! carries late i=
n the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consisten=
t Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a so=
lid replacement. Joe Nedney, K TEN - CYSWC Updated 10/23/01Nedney suffered =
a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. Erron Kin=
ney, TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01Kinney will be listed on the injur=
y report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this =

eceiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consis=
t of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime s=

y. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.=
 Fred Taylor, RB JAC - High! S! hrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Taylor has be=
en ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next wee=
k's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they in=
crease his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told=
 The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to =
play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can =
make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor=
 has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis N=
orthcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Northcutt left Sunday's game =
because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to a=
ction next week. Todd Heap, TE BAL - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01Heap did n=

timistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inact=
ive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. Terry Allen, RB BA=
L - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01Allen, who left after the fifth play o=

ac, QB BAL! -! South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01Coach Brian Billick expects =
Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterba=
ck wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest ar=
ea," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the cartila=
ge. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait=
 and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  =
 Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Hakim suffere=

s. Trung Canidate, RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/23/01 According to t=
he St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marsh=
all Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to =
be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent be=
fore I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, =
then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last=
 Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective=
 again this week.   J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/2=
3/01Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is c=
lose to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. I=
t was a blessing f! or! me because I was able to get treatment every day," =
Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't sa=
y I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, =
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to =
be more reliable. Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/0=
1Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' st=
arting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Mond=
ay night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired=
 foot is almost completely healed. Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/23/01Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due=
 to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. Marshall Faulk, RB=
 STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01According to Head Coach Mike Mart=
z, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just t=
aking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not ex=
pect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent b=
efore I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate wou=
