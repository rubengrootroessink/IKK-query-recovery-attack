layer News   Redskins , DT WAS - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/17/01 Corner=
back Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but=
 he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger o=
f missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would repl=
ace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Dallas Demon Horde U=
pdated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game a=
gainst Kansas City. He hasn't been ful! l ! speed at practice, however, so =
don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice toda=
y and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffe=
rs is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR=
 CAR - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore =
after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach Ge=
orge Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless hi=
s status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consid=
er be! nc! hing Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Lake=
 Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday=
 due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rook=
ie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarter=
back this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense=
.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (h=
and) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday a=
gainst New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a F=
antasy! p! erspective.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Upda=
ted 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expec=
ted to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's to=
o unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated=
 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesd=
ay. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest=
 his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job =
in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick ,=
 RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for th=
e year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's show=
n flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is stil=
l minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - High Shrivel Factor U=
pdated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Gre=
en Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, w=
ith Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week. Ran=
dy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as ques=
tionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. Whi=
le we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wou=
ldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  S=
hane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Ma=
tthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth addi=
ng to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mul=
let! s ! Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis would like =
to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee i=
njury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November=
 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development a=
lso makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.  Stacey=
 Mack , RB JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of=
 carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gaine=
d 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , W=
R JAC - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled in his first fe=
w games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game=
. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    S=
ean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a toug=
h time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won=
't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - High Shrivel F=
actor Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and=
 is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw ! fo! r over 200 ya=
rds and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brad=
y is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is list=
ed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has =
five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - The Replacements Updated=
 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch=
 several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  ! He! rman Moore , =
WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the s=
eason after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. =
"We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head C=
oach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI s=
howed a significant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fanta=
sy team. Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wh=
eatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 10/17/01 According to published report=
s, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The vet=
eran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hur=
t.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Co=
sta Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as th=
e team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was repor=
ted to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry , RB BUF =
- Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans =
to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis =
in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.  Jay R=
iemersma , TE BUF - South Park Cows Updated 1! 0/! 17/01 The Buffalo News s=
ays the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that t=
ackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being =
asked to block more often early in the year, but he will now become more in=
volved in the passing game.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - High Shrivel Factor U=
pdated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this =
week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reg=
gie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.  Dedric Wa=
rd , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Herald says Ward had hi=
s foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. Th=
e Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue S=
tar Boys Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Star, Smith could=
 end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head=
 Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each other very well, a=
nd that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day.  =
 Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/17/01 Alexa! nd! er =
underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high s=
prain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injur=
y, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Michael Pittm=
an , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered =
a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tu=
esday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionab=
le, but he is expected to play.   Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/17/01 Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surg=
ery on his right hamstring three weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark tol=
d the Contra Costa Times. "I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of tha=
! t ! before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). Th=
e most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in compar=
ison." Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy en=
ough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their=
 Oct. 28 game against Chicago.    More Updates  Player News Teams  [IMAGE] =
 CYSWC Player News  Derrick Alexander , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Alexande=
r overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held to just=
 one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements have re=
ndered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.  Darnay Scott , Activ=
e WR Updated 10/14/01 Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the=
 Browns, but he scored on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scot=
t in the passing game, even though the final numbers haven't always reflect=
ed it.  Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine pa=
sses for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the A=
FC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy=
 wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.  Antowain Smith , Res=
erve RB Updated 10/14/01 Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win ove=
r San Diego, but he did score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantas=
y player, however, and is no better than a reserve used only when the match=
up is right.   Derrick Mason , Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01 Mason (ankle and=
 shoulder) has been declared inactive for Week Six. Justin McCareins or Chr=
is Sanders should start in his place.  Maurice Smith , Active RB Updated 10=
/14/01 Smith rushed for 50 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Smith's yardag=
e numbers won't be overwhelming the rest of the year, but he should continu=
e to be a consistent TD threat.  Desmond Clark , Active TE Updated 10/12/01=
 Consider Clark as a starter this week. The Seahawks are soft over the midd=
le and in the red zone, where Clark can be effective.  Jeff Garcia , Active=
 QB Updated 10/12/01 Garcia (elbow) is listed as probable for Sunday's game=
 against Atlanta. He'll post solid numbers against an inconsistent Falcons'=
 secondary, so be sure to start him this week.   Corey Dillon , Active RB U=
pdated 10/12/01 Look for Dillon to have mixed success this week. The Browns=
 defense will make it difficult to run but his effort as a receiver will be=
 enough to give him a productive week.   J.R. Redmond , Reserve RB Updated =
10/12/01 Redmond is questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego due to=
 an ankle injury. He probably will miss this game due to the injury, which =
makes him virtually worthless Fantasy-wise.   Drew Bledsoe , Reserve QB Upd=
ated 10/02/01 According to the Boston Globe, there has been no upgrade in B=
ledsoe's timetable to return. He is still expected to miss the next two wee=
ks, so keep Bledsoe on reserve until he is healthy enough to play again.   =
Raiders , Reserve DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstr=
ong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday=
's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the =
injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman=
 is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining =
a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after a=
ggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Bills , Active DT Updated 09/=
30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game against Pittsburgh in th=
e third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walked off the field and =
into the locker room to be examined, and his return is questionable.   Chad=
 Lewis , Reserve TE Updated 09/28/01 Lewis will have a good shot at produci=
ng some solid Fantasy numbers this week against Dallas. He's one of the lea=
gue's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basi=
s.   Ricky Proehl , Reserve WR Updated 08/19/01 Proehl has been dealing wit=
h a slight hamstring injury in recent days, according to the St. Louis Post=
-Dispatch. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Proehl is expe=
cted to be ready for the start of the regular season.   Joe Nedney , Active=
 K Updated 03/07/01 The Tennessee Titans on Tuesday reached a contract agre=
ement with Nedney, an unrestricted free agent who played most of the 2000 s=
eason with the Carolina Panthers. The five-year veteran will replace longti=
me Titans kicker Al Del Greco, who was cut last week after a poor postseaso=
n performance and for salary cap reasons. Nedney converted 26 of 28 field-g=
oals attempts and all 20 of his extra-point tries for 98 points last season=
.   Adam Vinatieri , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00 Vinatieri has been one of t=
he league's most accurate placekickers in recent weeks, converting on 18 of=
 his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his chances against the Bil=
ls this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggles like it did on Mond=
ay night. Unless you have one of the league's elite kickers on your roster,=
 giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commi=
