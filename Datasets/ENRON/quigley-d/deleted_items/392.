, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards aga=
inst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent wee=
ks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents cont=
inue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtreme Updated 11/25/=
01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards=
 against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy ri! sk=
! because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - She Said Updated =
11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his=
 quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any =
Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in th=
e AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Brooki=
ns rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble.=
 The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most=
 teams right no! w.!   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Cali Bound Updated 11/25/01 Day=
ne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on=
 him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB=
 NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and=
 a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played w=
ell recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a mo=
re consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11=
/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day agains=
t Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, includi=
ng 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hi=
llrods Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and=
 two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the=
 matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She ! Sa! id Update=
d 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a t=
ouchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a re=
serve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods U=
pdated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes fo=
r 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliabl=
e Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.=
   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/25/01 Jackson=
 had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards =
and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he=
 is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Leather Chee=
rios Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes f=
or 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in re=
cent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB O=
AK - Xtreme Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley car=
ried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in=
 short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting f=
or any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he m=
ay not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smi=
th , RB NE - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense=
 and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has beco=
me a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE -=
 Baby Blues Updated 1! 1/! 25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orle=
ans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty re=
liable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on=
 the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea=
 Circus Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no inter=
ceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continu=
ed to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , =
WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01Sanders left Sunday's game against San=
 Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay J=
enkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - 2700 HUEVOS=
 Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching s=
ix passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, a=
nd Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointme=
nt for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing o=
f the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agen=
t! Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards,=
 three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy con=
sideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gads=
den , WR MIA - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 11=
8 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. =
Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these importan=
t final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01Fi=
edler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His p=
erformance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still =
too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - =
2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards a=
nd 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia =
QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI=
 - Pumpdog Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo! ur! passes for 32 yards again=
st Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy tea=
ms as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Baby Blues Updated 11=
/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie h=
as slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a ris=
k during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis playe=
d through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good ba=
ckup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known =
to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/0=
1 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted=
 decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 =
yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - KMB =
Express Updated 11/25/01 Muhamm! ad! missed Sunday's game against Atlanta d=
ue to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orl=
eans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Update=
d 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a ri=
b injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy=
 disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Wounded=
 Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for =
only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with =
their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers=
.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught =
two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open of=
ten, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays =
healthy.  More Updates  Transactions, View! &n! bsp; [IMAGE]     [IMAGE] Ma=
