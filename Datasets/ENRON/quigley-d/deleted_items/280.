ony Wright  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wright didn't practice=
 Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicat=
ed Wright might not play Sunday.   Wright expected to have results of an MR=
I exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the qu=
arterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo sai=
d Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to pl=
ay Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the =
Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to=
 merit a starting spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Lake Austin Mi=
ghty Mullets Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee s=
urgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday whe=
n told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and =
could be lost for the season.   "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to =
play this Sunday," Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains=
 sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two w=
eeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questi=
onable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - Team T-Bo=
ne Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be bench=
ed in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toom=
er is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eag=
les and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fas=
sel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne Chr=
ebet  , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunda=
y's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chr=
ebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra ca=
utious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and=
 scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-ol=
d rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past ye=
ar. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catc=
h for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Update=
d 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-ev=
aluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert E=
manuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Det=
roit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help=
 fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanue=
l won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    Hin=
es Ward  , WR PIT - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day wi=
th an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tenn=
essee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Team T-Bone Updated 10/24/01   The De=
troit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patell=
a tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is stil=
l a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The =
earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB -=
 Water Boys Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to gene=
ral soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully r=
ecovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Team T-Bone Up=
dated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to th=
e starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still wor=
king with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which pl=
ayer will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - =
Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster =
is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. =
Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leag=
ues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robi=
nson  , WR CHI - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson=
 on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effect=
ively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Ne=
il Rackers  , K CIN - South Park Cows Updated 10/24/01   According to the C=
incinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign=
 one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk becaus=
e of his erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - The Replacements Update=
d 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunda=
y's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR N=
YG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sp=
rained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week=
.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/24/01   Ike H=
illiard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the =
role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's abs=
ence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance =
that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer ha=
s been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few=
 times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swi=
nton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a =
hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He=
 [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he d=
idn't do enough to say for sure he will be available," said head coach Dave=
 Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in h=
is absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/24/=
01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Ca=
rdinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is=
 recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice to=
morrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will =
depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach Dave=
 Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   C=
hiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game agai=
nst the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ism=
ail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a spr=
ained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable=
 for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - The Replacements Updat=
ed 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mi=
ke Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as=
 he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that br=
idge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't =
insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt.=
 Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that wh=
en Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would=
 be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if W=
atters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilfer =
 , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice on =
Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasse=
lbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Hasse=
lbeck  , QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck =
will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami,=
 according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, wh=
o stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn=
't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so d=
on't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Update=
d 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's=
 game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent o=
f the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR =
MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a =
foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a u=
seful Fantasy player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA =
- Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an =
ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be a=
fraid to use him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated=
 10/23/01   Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might st=
art ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't=
 recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' seconda=
ry is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter th=
is week.    Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01 =
  Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to =
a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR I=
ND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday'=
s game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in=
 a Fantasy league this week.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]=
   CYSWC Player News    Joe Nedney  , Active K Updated 10/23/01  Nedney suf=
fered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.    =
Chris Chandler  , Reserve QB Updated 10/22/01  Chandler had another solid g=
ame Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also completed =
14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter for t=
he rest of the season.    Darnay Scott  , Active WR Updated 10/22/01  Scott=
 suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next w=
eek's game against Detroit.    J.R. Redmond  , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 =
 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry =
for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.   =
 Maurice Smith  , Active RB Updated 10/22/01  Smith suffered a sprained kne=
e Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a b=
ye this week and doesn't play again until November 4.    Derrick Alexander =
 , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99=
 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for =
the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes i=
t tough to bench him.    Desmond Clark  , Reserve TE Updated 10/21/01  Clar=
k had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score ag=
ainst San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy =
perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.    Corey Dillon  ,=
 Active RB Updated 10/21/01  The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 c=
arries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performa=
nce very quickly.    Derrick Mason  , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Mason (an=
kle) is expected to start on Sunday against Detroit. With the Lions' second=
ary in shambles, starting Mason is a good decision for Fantasy owners with =
a thin group of receivers.    Jeff Garcia  , Active QB Updated 10/18/01  Ac=
cording to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a f=
ootball until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealin=
g with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and brui=
ses. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. =
28 against Chicago.    Antowain Smith  , Reserve RB Updated 10/18/01  Smith=
 rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this yea=
r. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second=
 meeting with Indianapolis.    Chad Lewis  , Active TE Updated 10/18/01  Le=
wis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday=
 against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and shoul=
d be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.    Antonio Freeman  , Reser=
ve WR Updated 10/14/01  Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD aga=
inst Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear =
signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet s=
tart prior to this week.    Raiders  , Active DT Updated 10/02/01  The Raid=
ers have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore h=
is Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery th=
is week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In ot=
her news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dal=
las Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is qu=
estionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   =
 Bills  , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01  Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunda=
y's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist inj=
ury. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and h=
is return is questionable.    Ricky Proehl  , Reserve WR Updated 08/19/01  =
Proehl has been dealing with a slight hamstring injury in recent days, acco=
rding to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . The injury isn't considered serious,=
 however, and Proehl is expected to be ready for the start of the regular s=
eason.    Adam Vinatieri  , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00  Vinatieri has been =
one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent weeks, converting =
on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his chances against=
 the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggles like it did=
 on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's elite kickers on your=
 roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=
