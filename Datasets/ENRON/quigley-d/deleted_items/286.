atest NFL Player News    Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN  Updated 10/25/01   Batt=
aglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but =
is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN=
  Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a brok=
en clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined =
for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in hi=
s absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN  Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has resp=
onded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashvi=
lle Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-orie=
nted team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Whe=
atley  , RB OAK  Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday bec=
ause of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contr=
a Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for =
Sunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB  Updated 10=
/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wedn=
esday, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Johnson is recovering from h=
ip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday.     Jacquez Green  , =
WR TB  Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game=
 against Minnesota. He is recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will=
 replace Green at receiver if he is unable to play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB =
TB  Updated 10/25/01   Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and di=
d not have any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury, according to The=
 St. Petersburg Times . Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as questionable =
for this week's game against Minnesota.     Ike Hilliard  , WR NYG  Updated=
 10/25/01   Hillard is suffering from soreness in his surgically-repaired f=
oot, according to the New York Newsday . The foot was sore following the Gi=
ants game against St. Louis in Week Five but it is even more sore now. Keep=
 an eye on this situation. This condition might force Hilliard to the sidel=
ines if it intensifies.     Damon Jones  , TE JAC  Updated 10/25/01   Jones=
' status for this week's game is questionable, according to The Florida Tim=
es-Union . He missed practice on Wednesday because of a shoulder injury. Ky=
le Brady will get most of the looks at tight end if Jones is unable to play=
.     Elvis Joseph  , RB JAC  Updated 10/25/01   Joseph took a lot of snaps=
 in practice Wednesday and will be incorporated in as the third-down back, =
according to The Florida Times-Union . Joseph won't have much value in this=
 job but he will take carries away from starter Stacey Mack.     Tyrone Dav=
is  , TE GB  Updated 10/25/01   Davis could return from his hamstring injur=
y sooner than what was originally expected, according to published reports.=
 He might begin practicing next week and will almost certainly be activated=
 before his target date of Thanksgiving. Davis has been sidelined since Aug=
ust because of hamstring surgery. Nevertheless, he will be the No. 2 tight =
end when he returns.     Elvis Grbac  , QB BAL  Updated 10/25/01   Grbac wi=
ll likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to The Balti=
more Sun . He threw very little in practice and is still suffering from a s=
ore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is unable to play.      R=
andy Moss  , WR MIN  Updated 10/25/01   Moss is suffering from tendonitis i=
n his left Achilles tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed pr=
actice Wednesday but is expected to play on Sunday.     Tony Martin  , WR A=
TL  Updated 10/25/01   Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resum=
e their season on November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games=
 because of a broken collarbone but the Atlanta Journal-constitution report=
s that he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes.     Wane McGarity=
  , WR DAL  Updated 10/25/01   The Saints have signed McGarity, who was rel=
eased by the Cowboys earlier this season. McGarity will be used mostly on r=
eturns, but he might eventually work his way into the Saints' regular rotat=
ion of receivers.     Matt Stover  , K BAL  Updated 10/25/01   Stover has a=
 minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be abl=
e to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't con=
sidered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holm=
es as candidates to handle kickoffs.     Eric Metcalf  , WR OAK  Updated 10=
/25/01   The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be us=
ed mostly as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value.      Tim Biakabutuka=
  , RB CAR  Updated 10/25/01   Biakabutuka will be out until at least train=
ing camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. "He=
's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football relat=
ed until next summer," coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "Basically, it =
just separated," Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. "The l=
igaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together." R=
ichard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visite=
d his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far wor=
se than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.       =
 James Stewart  , RB DET  Updated 10/25/01   Stewart will probably play on =
Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle i=
njury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain.     Wayne C=
hrebet  , WR NYJ  Updated 10/25/01   Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiv=
er, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in t=
he helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and lef=
t the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week tha=
t a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over=
 Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebe=
t's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cauti=
ous with the injury.  Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and sca=
ns he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. =
Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup.       Terrell Davis =
 , RB DEN  Updated 10/25/01   Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stre=
ss fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. "At this point in =
time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said. Davis, who has miss=
ed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee rem=
ains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past t=
wo weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared f=
or this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as q=
uestionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abi=
lities will be limited if he does play Sunday.        Clint Stoerner  , QB =
DAL  Updated 10/25/01   Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice=
 Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. H=
ead coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wrigh=
t isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a ri=
sky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started i=
n the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for =
44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season.       Antho=
ny Wright  , QB DAL  Updated 10/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday be=
cause of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright mig=
ht not play Sunday.   Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursd=
ay, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's p=
laying status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoer=
ner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Ca=
mpo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Su=
nday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a star=
ting spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN  Updated 10/24/01   Davis is =
sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is givin=
g him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays r=
evealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbb=
ing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able t=
o play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Toomer  , W=
R NYG  Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be b=
enched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if =
Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the=
 Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim=
 Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne=
 Chrebet  , WR NYJ  Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at C=
arolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailmen=
t as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with t=
he injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was=
 given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who =
played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has no=
w been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yard=
s in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN  Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will=
 not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving a=
n injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE  Updated =
10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Li=
ons are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-en=
ding injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the jo=
b. Don't bother picking him up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT  Updated 10/24/01  =
 Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Mond=
ay's game against Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET  Updated 10/24/01=
   The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a to=
rn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    More Updates =
