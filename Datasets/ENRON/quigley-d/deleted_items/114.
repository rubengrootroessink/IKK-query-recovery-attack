Hi Denise, Kay, and Dutch, 
i thought i'd say hi before i logged off - 12:42 am.  Amanda has been home sick the past two days and i have been rescheduling appts and putting away christmas decorations. she is doing better and will head to school tomorrow.   
Denise i hope you are taking care of yourself. 
Kay and Dutch - thanks for sending your address, the kids are in the process of writing holiday thank you's.  Any chance you could send or email a picture of the puppy Rex, they would love it and me too. 
Kevin and Jo came for dinner last friday and kevin loaded some cool picture scanning software - hopefully i'll get some photos out this year on the web. 
Life is going good here - i am going to the  annual mardi gras committee meetings and setting boundaries and have NOT volunteered to head a committee. I just answer questions and give details and just talk to people about details.  I am loving IT!! and not overwhelmed. My big decision will be what dress to wear.  Larry is right back into working HARD on these sprint deals after our ski trip.  The kids are asking to go again - even Kyle after altitude sickness- they both want to be in breckenridge!! Larry talked to a friend that has a condo in i think winter park. said we could use it sometime.  any other news:  Kyle was star student last week - made a huge poster with tons of pictures to share with his class.  Amazing to me that he is almost 7 years old.  The art teacher told me that after class last monday he just spontaneously gave her the biggest hug  and it made her day.  He is one special little boy.   
Hugs and love to each of you, 
Michele
