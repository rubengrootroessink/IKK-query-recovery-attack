ad , WR CAR  Updated 10/19/01 Muhammad (ribs) returned to practice on Thurs=
day and is expected to start on Sunday against Washington. Considering the =
state of the Redskins' defense, we'd suggest starting Muhammad despite his =
injury.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 10/19/01 Weinke missed a portion o=
f practice on Thursday due to a thigh bruise. However, Head Coach Geroge Se=
ifert expects his rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington.=
 The matchup ! ag! ainst the 'Skins is a good one for Weinke, who should re=
ceive starting consideration from Fantasy owners.   Rob Moore , WR ARI  Upd=
ated 10/19/01 Moore (hamstring) missed practice on Thursday and has been do=
wngraded for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He'll likely miss yet anoth=
er week of action, so keep him on reserve if he's currently on your roster.=
   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 10/19/01 McNair is listed as questionable=
 (shoulder) for Sunday's game against the Lions but is expected to play. Lo=
ok for him to score a touchdown by either running the ball in or throwing. =
  Eddie George  , RB TEN  Updated 10/19/01 George is listed as questionable=
 on the injury report with an ankle injury but is expected to play Sunday a=
gainst Detroit. Look for George to have a big game against the struggling L=
ions.   Travis Taylor , WR BAL  Updated 10/19/01 Look for Taylor to catch s=
everal passes this week and snag at least one touchdown pass. He has become=
 one of Elvis Grbac's favorite targets inside the red zone.   Qadry Ismail =
, WR BAL  Updated 10/19/01 Ismail will catc! h ! a few passes this week but=
 don't expect him to score any touchdowns. He has just two TD receptions in=
 five games.   Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/19/01 Northcutt has be=
en getting a lot of practice in the No. 2 receiver slot and might fill-in f=
or the injured Quincy Morgan as a starter. Don't expect Northcutt to be too=
 productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout.    Tre=
nt Green , QB KC  Updated 10/18/01 The Chiefs might depend on the run, so G=
reen's numbers may be limited. Expect one TD pass, but his yardage numbers =
will be modest.  Ken Dilger , TE IND  Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a majo=
r factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from h=
im against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard , =
TE IND  Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at =
tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against N=
ew England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND  Updated 10/18/01 James was =
held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this ye=
ar.! E! xpect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wa=
yne , WR IND  Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place of the i=
njured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done mu=
ch yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND =
 Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, an=
d has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good num=
bers against New England.  Pe! yt! on Manning , QB IND  Updated 10/18/01 Ma=
nning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was inte=
rcepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them=
 at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not par=
ticipate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be ab=
le to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off =
deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to =
play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB  Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice W=
edne! sd! ay with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should pla=
y Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this =
week.   Terry Glenn , WR NE  Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good=
 game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn,=
 who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  =
Antowain Smith , RB NE  Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two =
TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the e=
nd zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  =
Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very d=
isappointing so far. He could have a good week if the Jets engage in a shoo=
tout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center=
 its gameplan around Curtis Martin.  Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ  Updated 10/=
18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held=
 down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his=
 downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be =
the focal point ! of! the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to =
control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  =
Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday ag=
ainst Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington'=
s horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so=
 starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Up=
dated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, comp=
leting 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point,=
 Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael =
Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre =
this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had s=
ome success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth sta=
rting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Test=
averde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be op=
portunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first intercept=
ion of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS  Updated 10/18/01! Rasby will likel=
y get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen Alexander is out. Howe=
ver, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner=
 , WR WAS  Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a ques=
tionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter =
Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL  Updated 10=
/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets=
 secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your=
! s! tarting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL  Updated 10/1=
8/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented =
to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the q=
uestionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   More Updates  Transactions NFL Reports  =
