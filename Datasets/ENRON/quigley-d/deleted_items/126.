Payout party will be this weekend.

Who:  Everyone who participated in the league but I'm sure the
winners who live in Houston will really want to be there to collect

What:  Watch the Wild Card game and get the winners to spend their
money on the losers

When:  Sunday, Jan 13 at 12PM

Where:  SRO's at the Northwest Mall at 610 and 290 (across from
Longhorn Saloon)

For those of you who won and don't live in Houston or will not be
able to attend, please email me your address at bwdunlavy@yahoo.com
so I can send your money to you.  Thanks and see everyone on Sunday.
