Hey,  did you ever respond back to Ty message about the expansion team  issue?
 
Looks  like my original counterpart has decided to pass on participating this year  and I don't have enough time/$ to do it on my own.  I've already met  with Ty and we're planning to team together this year because we're both in  the same situation.  
 
However, that means you've now got an open spot.   were you planning to fill it with another team?
 
Jody

Subject: Franchise  Players
The draft is almost here.  I will be sending  out directions either today or sometime tomorrow on how to get there.  It  is this Saturday at 11 am.  If you are keeping a franchise player, I need  a name now.  If we do not hear anything by tomorrow, then we will assume  none will be kept.  So far the list of franchise players  are:
 
Michael Deluke - Marshall Faulk
Jeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner
Michael Currie - Edgerrian James
 
That is it.
 
Let me know.
 
Later,
Kevin
