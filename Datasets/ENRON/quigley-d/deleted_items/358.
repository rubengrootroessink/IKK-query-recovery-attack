layer Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  James Stewart , RB DET  Updat=
ed 11/18/01 Stewart (ankle) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. Howev=
er, coach Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is g=
etting closer to returning to action.   Marco Battaglia , TE CIN  Updated 1=
1/18/01 Battaglia (appendectomy) is out at least a month, and may miss the =
rest of the season. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player=
.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC  Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (quadriceps) will start=
 on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be facing a tough Steelers' secondary =
at less than 100 percent, however, so Fantasy owners may want to consider b=
enching him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC  Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (gr=
oin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clear=
ance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is =
able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack wi=
ll get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is no=
t a wise move. !   Jerome Pathon , WR IND  Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (foot) i=
s out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indianapolis =
Star. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James Jackson=
 , RB CLE  Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decis=
on on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, J=
amel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some=
 looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI  Updated 11/=
17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas.=
 He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell=
 will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL  Updated =
11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four =
games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will n=
ot be allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or =
until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL i=
n Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) i=
s out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again b=
e Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations=
.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports,=
 Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That=
 makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  St! ev! e McNair , QB=
 TEN  Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's ga=
me against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball duri=
ng individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely =
to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week =
as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to =
the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprai=
ned right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice =
that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bu=
mps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either bac=
k against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI  Updated =
11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday a=
nd is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  Howeve=
r, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this wee=
k, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth conside=
ring as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 11/16/=
01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback =
for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting o=
n your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Culpeppe=
r is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in =
Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the=
 league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup o=
n a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers=
 may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider=
 benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should hav=
e a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Mon=
day night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probab=
le for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's b=
een underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him bas=
ed on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO=
  Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the leagu=
e, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapoli=
s defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a mu=
st-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game =
against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. =
He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge nu=
mbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianap=
ol! is! defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO  Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up=
 a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167=
 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vuln=
erable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid opt=
ion.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his pl=
ay after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over =
his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy playe=
r. Give him the start in Week 10 against a De! nv! er defense that is vulne=
rable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Banks =
has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. =
He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beat=
en through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy le=
agues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been in=
consistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his las=
t four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable=
 at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gar=
dner , WR WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last =
two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorabl=
e matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good m=
ove.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsi! st=
! ent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unl=
ess the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary=
 in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , =
WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals=
, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a toug=
h New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your=
 Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce=
 , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals thi=
s season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll fa=
ce CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth=
 starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL=
  Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he =
is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every wee=
k, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Co=
nwell , TE STL  Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had! a! few down weeks, so sta=
rting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of de=
pth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something =
many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB C=
AR  Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend agains=
t San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goin=
gs. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   More Update=
