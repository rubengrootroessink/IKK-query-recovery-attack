Surveyors Comments were Uniform"Creative, innovative and oh-so-noisy" is the consensus on this Contemporary Creole "jewel of the Warehouse District", the flagship of celeb chef Emeril Lagasse, that draws the "hip, young and cool" (plus plenty of tourists) with its "amazing food" and "energy level"; but even some admirers complain that stardom has led to sometimes "haughty service" and that the kitchen "suffers" when the "bam man" is out of town -"Emeril, please phone home."
