Hi Greg and Georganne,
 
Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.
