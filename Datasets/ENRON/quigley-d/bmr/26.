Hello Dutch.

I hope this week hasn't been too stressful for you. I know there is a lot
going on right now. I responded to your last note explaining that you can
send your past assignments to me via e-mail. I wanted to re-iterate this
because I have not yet received them.

Per usual, this week's assignment - Assignment #5 is detailed below.

This Week's Assignment: Write about each of the following areas:
1) Market Valuation (Page 1_4_5_1  in the Futures topic)
2) Option Packages (Page 1_7_6_1 - in the Options topic)

Due Date: Friday, November 9th, 2001

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing
Market Valuation - This is a short explanation. Do you need graphics to
represent this?
?    Short in the futures market: rising prices result in losses and
decreasing prices result in profits
?    Long in the futures market: rising prices result in profits and
decreasing prices result in losses
?    2-3 examples to explain this concept

Option Packages.
Dutch - This discussion should stay at a very high-level with only basic
examples
   Caps
   Floors
   Collars
   Different users and how they would use these option packages
     End user
     Producer
   Examples using caps, puts and/or collars

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project
to stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete this
assignment, please notify me ahead of time and provide an estimated time
for completion.

Thank you.
