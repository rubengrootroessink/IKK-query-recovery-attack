Hello Dutch.

Thanks for meeting with us today - I think we gained a lot of ground. I've
delayed this message for a couple of days in hopes that you catch up with
the last two weeks' assignments that you have not handed in yet.

Again, I've included the high-level outline for each content area that you
should follow when writing this week's assignment. Remember - this
assignment should be placed in the ECW. I've included instructions to
remind you how to use this tool.  Note - If the content you have written
does not fit onto the page, please just send it to us in an email. Thank
you!
