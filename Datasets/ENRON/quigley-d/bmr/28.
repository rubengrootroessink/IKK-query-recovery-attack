Hi Dutch,

I am preparing for the final signoff phase on the graphics and practice
questions and I need your help finalizing the scenarios that we talked
about two weeks ago for Futures and Options.  You were going to provide us
with a total of four scearios with answers to the following questions: (a.)
Are you long or Short? (b.) What is your Risk? (c.) What is your break-even
price? (d) Give the settlement price (e) What is the total P/L on the
option.  Did you get a chance to review that email that I sent you on
10/29/01.

Lastly, I would like for you to review the graphic ideas and practice
exercise and let me know if you are okay with the questions that are being
asked to the learner.  Attached below are the two topics that you are
responsible for in the Knowledge System.
(See attached file: Futures Graphic ideas and practices_2.doc)(See attached
file: Options Graphic ideas and practices_3.doc)

Let me know if you have any questions, I can be reached at 713-345-6687.

Thanks,
Monica L. Brown
