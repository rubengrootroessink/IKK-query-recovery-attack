Hi Dutch --

Thanks again for helping us with the expert stories.  Here is the schedule
for developing these expert stories:

               --Discuss the categories of content we need and where you
can provide stories.
                          --Discuss logistics for video shoot
               --Schedule time for the video shoot

(12/5)
                          --I will send you a document with the questions I
will ask you during the shoot and get feedback from you.

(12/10-12/12)
                          --Video shoot
