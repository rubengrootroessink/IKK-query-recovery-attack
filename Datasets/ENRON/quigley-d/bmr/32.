Good afternoon, everyone.

I have some good news to share with you. There will be no new assignments!
We are hoping you will take the time this week to finish up past
assignments. In addition, we are working on some of your past assignments
and all future assignments by cutting/pasting from the course material that
we have received from Enron HR. We will be asking you to review these
assignments and update them as necessary. You will still be responsible for
reviewing and granting final sign-off the topics.

Assignment Status:
Berney Aucoin:  We are working with Errol McLaughlin from Jeff Gossett's
group to help with the remaining Accounting & Reporting topic assignments.
We still need your last three assignments from the Organization Structure
topic because current courses we have available to us do not cover this
content. They include write-ups about:
     Roles and Responsibilities of Mid-Marketers / Origination
     Roles and Responsibilties of Traders
     Structure of a Trading Organization
Please let us now when you will be able to send these to us. Thanks.

Mark Reese: We have been able to find information for the "Risk Management"
portion of your 10/26 assignment and your future assignment. Eventually, we
will need you to review what we have put together. In addition, we still
need your last four assignments because current courses we have available
to us do not cover this content in detail. They include write-ups about:
     Marking to Market, Pricing Models (10/19), Technical Analysis (10/26),
     Fundamental Analysis (11/2) and VaR (11/9) for the Risk Management
     Inputs topic
     Pricing of Hedging Instruments (11/2) (high-level process and
     discussion about bid/mid/offer) from the Hedging Basics topic

Ed McMichael: Thank you for your handing in most of your assignments on
time! As we discussed, you accidently left out your write-up on "Additional
Types of Risks" (11/2) and are going to send that to us this week. You also
have the "Natural Gas Markets" assignment (11/9) outstanding that the
Research group is working on. Please forward us that assignment when you
recieve it.  The only assignments that are remaining for your topics are
about Crude Oil and Electiricty Markets. We are working on finding course
material/resources to help write these. Let us know if you find any leads
for these assignments. Moving forward, we will be requesting your review
and final sign-off on the topic.

Dutch Quigley: We are going to cut/paste the information for the Futures
and Options topics from BRM. I think that Futures will require little time
for your review, but we will need you to spend some time reviewing the
Options topic and providing examples for both topics. We will be contacting
you in the near future to schedule a couple of meetings to review and
sign-off on this work.

Andy Lewis:  We are going to cut/paste the information for the Forwards and
Options topics from BRM. I think that Forwards will require little time for
your review, but we will need you to spend some time reviewing the Swaps
topic and providing examples for both topics. We will be contacting you in
the near future to schedule a couple of meetings to review and sign-off on
this work.

Thank you and have a good week.
