You probably have Internet Explorer version 5.0 or older. You need version
5.5 or newer. Just go ahead and send me the assignments in an email or Word
document - whichever is easier - I'll take care of the rest.

Thanks for doing the assignments!

   Hello Dutch.

   Hope you are having a good Monday. I've delayed this message in hopes
   that
   you catch up with the last three weeks' assignments that you have not
   handed in yet. As I noted in our discussion last week, it will be
   signficantly helpful to Monica and I to receive any information you've
   gathered to this point, as opposed to receiving it all at the end.

   As usual, I've included the high-level outline for each content area
   that
   you should follow when writing this week's assignment. Remember, this
   assignment should be placed in the ECW. I've included instructions to
   remind you how to use this tool.  Note - If the content you have written
   does not fit onto the page, please just send it to us in an email. Thank
   you!
