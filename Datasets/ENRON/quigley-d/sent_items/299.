Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!
