Dutch,

Can you please tell me the conversion of nat gas price per mmbtu to price per gallon or bbl.  For example, if nat gas is 4.891/mmbtu for May, how does it convert to $/gal or bbl?

Thanks for your help.  I appreciate your time.
Anjali

Sherry, 

Can you please tell me the conversion factor for nat gas price per mmbtu to price per gallon or price per bbl?  Can you please give me a short example because the conversion I see is 5.825 (mmbtu to bbls).

Thanks for your help.
