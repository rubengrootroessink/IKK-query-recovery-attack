I called and spoke with the manager over accounting.  He said that the reason your expense report took so long is that it was being audited.  They do this randomly.  I told him you need a check cut today on the 107.45 and he said the other expense report should be in your account by this Friday.  I can still add the cash expense.  Just tell me how much it was.  You do not need a receipt if it was under $75.  

Let me know.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
