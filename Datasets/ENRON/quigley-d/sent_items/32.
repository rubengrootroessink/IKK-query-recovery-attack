I talked to Kathleen last night and she said you talk to her already
I will assume that you found her number
Hope that you are having a happy New Year

Hope you had a good vacation.   I was looking for Kathleen's new phone number.  She gave it to me but I lost it.  Thanks and we all should get together sometime soon for dinner.
