Just so you don't double up and call Continental - i went ahead and called
to get our new itenerary- we still leave on a nonstop Friday 11/16 departing 9:50pm and get there at 10:55p
On the return- they had us leaving at 6:40 on 11/20 going thru Phoenix and arriving home at 1am
I changed it to leaving Vegas at 4pm nonstop flight to home and arrive here 9pm (this cut 1 hour 20 min off travel time)
hope that is okay
