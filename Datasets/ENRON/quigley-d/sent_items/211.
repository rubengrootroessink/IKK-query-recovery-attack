Checked on CA flights- I know you are busy so just respond when you can and i will take care of this - it needs to be ticketed today
Which option works best for you: LAX was too expensive

1- Leave 8/31 at 5:30pm arrive Orange County 6:55pm
Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm 
Total price $331.50 per person

OR
2- Leave 8/31 at 8:40pm arrive Orange County 9:55pm
Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm
Total Price $243.50 per person

PS
No need to use up miles for this since tickets are not very pricey- would rather
save those 80k miles to go to a more expensive destination
