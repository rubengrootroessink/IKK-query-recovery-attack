suggested draft order:

scenario
5 franchise teams and 7 non-franchise
franchise teams ranked 1 - 5 based on total points of franchise player from previous year

First the supplemental draft

Round one
# 5 franchise team, # 7 supplemental , # 4 franchise , # 6 supplemental and so forth and so on

with a non snake system going from there

ok everyone chew on that and spit back

The snake thing is good and bad.   But I think the first round should be
randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not
keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental
and then also at the top of the first round.   Theoretically the non keeper
teams are getting the 8-14 best players who are arguably also franchise
players.  In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a
lower level franchise player.  So they shouldn't get the an automatic shot
at 15-22 or whatever it might be as well.  So snake or no snake all of round
one should be random order.
