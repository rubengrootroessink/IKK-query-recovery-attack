I would still like to play golf this weekend b/c it is the friendship that is fun
I might even take on Ernesto for the Brock dog challenge

It is truly sick what happened , I was talking to a broker that was in the second world trade tower as it got
hit and he was describing what was going on.  Several people I know made it out of both buildings but many are not 
yet accounted for , so at this time all there is is hope.

May everyone have a peaceful day

Dutch

This show how truly sick and evil people can be, but also show how the good
of everyone can come together in moments of tragedy.  Our thoughts and
prayers are with those that have been personally affected by this event.  I
can't imagine having to explain this to children.
