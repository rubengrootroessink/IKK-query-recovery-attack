I am glad to hear that the move went well. I am sure that you will do great and that you will learn alot.
I do not know if you got a hold of Kori or not but she has been here during the week and gone on the weekends.
I will be in sunny Florida this weekend and will be thinking of all my gator friends : )

Hope everything is going great

Dutch

Hi Dutch--
How are you doing? I am doing good. The move went very smoothly and I have already started at Teco. I am learning a lot !!! I don't have much time to talk right now, but I just wanted to ask you if you have seen Kori. I have tried calling her at work and at home for a few days now, and I haven't gotten in touch with her. I figured you would know if she was on vacation or something. She has my mail key and I needed her to check my mail for me. Thanks!!

Purvi
