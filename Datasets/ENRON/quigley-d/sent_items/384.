As I am just catching up, I am not the one for storage and transportation issues as i do not trade them on a regular basis.

Dutch
How are you today? I hope all is well.
I know you are extremely busy meeting our financial targets for Q4/01. In light of this fact, I have tired not to bother the SME's and provide content for this project via other means. So far so good, but the next step will be for the SME's to review the content for sign-off. Your timely work for review will be invaluable.  

However at today's Status meeting Accenture had the following in their status report:

	Issues for Management Attention
Dutch has not been able to meet with us for the past two weeks, nor has he responded to our e-mail requests for information. This means we are relying on Andy for all the detailed trader content, which includes the two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems. With a maximum of two hours per week with Andy, it has been and will continue to be difficult to get all the help we need. Proposed solution: ask Andy and/or Dutch to give us the name of another trader who can meet with us to answer our detailed questions.


My initial question to you: "Is this statement accurate?"

My next Questions: "What Can I do to assist you?"
			 "Can you name someone to provide the information requested (i.e. two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems.)

Here is what I have provided to Accenture to help complete your assignments and to provide content for your review:
	BRM Text book
	Derivatives I as a resource only
	The slides attached below
	Other course work as a resource only

Do you have any suggestions? Thanks for all your assistance and I know how busy you are & how important your commercial duties are for the company. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk
