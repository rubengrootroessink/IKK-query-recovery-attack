Actually I have thought about and I would prefer to just rent.
I look forward to purchasing a house in future or something substantially bigger.
From an investment perspective- I think we will have other opportunities in future.

Spoke to Linda's assistant today and told her we wanted
to know what rent was running for the other similar townhouses
and also what a purchase price would be- she does not know and said that she gave
Linda my message from last time as well as this time but that she is
not taking any calls....
