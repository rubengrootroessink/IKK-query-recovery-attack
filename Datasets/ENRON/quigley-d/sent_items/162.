Kay,

Thanks for your call the other night.  I was at the hospital.  Jackie is
doing ok so far but today she has a big operation to put a tube in her chest
- a permanent replacement for the IV in her hand that the doctors say kids
like better since they don't see it under their shirts and get used to it
after a week or two.  75% chance to live at this point and if all goes as
planned there will be no need for a bone marrow transplant but she will need
blood transfusions...we don't need to donate at all as HK as a supply of
blood already...no visitors to her room except me, vicky, michelle, and
michelle's boyfriend...mom may have told you by now she has ALL Type B and I
got the info on Type B that you downloaded from the web - thanks - i am
still reading through all of the materials from the doctor - i do have alot
of questions - if you have a friend at MD Anderson i need to find out what
the "German Method" of treatment for leukemia is and whether it's  just as
good as the american method, and i also want to find out whether chinese
people can have the same treatment as westerners...i would think that at md
anderson they would have experience treating both chinese and western
patients so they should know if the treatments are normally the same or
not...i don't know if this hospital has ever had a western leukemia patient
before...thanks again.
Robert
