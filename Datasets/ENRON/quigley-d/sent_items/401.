Subject:	Sammy Happy Hour


OK ladies and gentlemen.  It has been quite a while since we had a Houston area Sammy Happy Hour, but I thought that we should do one again.  If you received this e-mail in error, or don't want to receive this type of e-mail, then just reply and I will take you out of my address book.  It needs updating as I have duplicate e-mails for some of you guys and gals.  I am thinking the 17th, 18th, or 19th.  I will make a tally of which day is best, so please reply.  If you don't reply, then I will assume that any of those days is good for you and make an executive decision.  Also, once we nail down a date, please pass this info along to anyone who might wish to come.  I know some of you guys don't live in town, or even in TX for that matter, but I just wanted to let you know what was going on.  Actives from SFA who might be in town that week are invited as well.  I look forward to hearing from all of you.
 
Howard
