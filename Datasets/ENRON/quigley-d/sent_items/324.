Before I start my day, I have been at home thinking how awful I was last nite.
There are MANY other ways to show my emotions to you. This I have not
done in a long time and I hope you can chalk it up to me having a really tough day.
You did nothing wrong and I can only hope I did not further hurt you.
I also said things I did not mean - so I hope you can still  consider coming tonite
I am so sorry
I love you so very much kq
