Ricardo,

Thanks for the thought the other day.
Kay has been laid off as of this week.
I am still working until a deal can be done to 
sell off the trading arm of the company.
Will know in the next week or two.

Dutch

i have to say this is pretty funny.  won't happen cause
the 'hornys will be down by 35 by the begining of the second half,
and chance mock will be playing while chrissy will be to busy
seeing if he could transfer to austin peay or tarleton state.
