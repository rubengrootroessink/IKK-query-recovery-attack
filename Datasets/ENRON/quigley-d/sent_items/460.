Sarah , 

What I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.
	Prior to moves                After
DEC	-2,003			 1,967
JAN	10,502			-1,588
FEB	 1,338			   552
MAR	-7,013			   188
APR	 5,831			     33

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

Dutch
