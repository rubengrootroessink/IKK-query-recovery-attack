Kevin,

Please change the Descriptor from

US Gas Fin Spd   Nymex NL1 vs PEN      Sep01  USD/MM-L

to

US Gas Fin Spd   Nymex LD vs PEN      Sep01  USD/MM-L

all else looks fine.

Dutch

Please review the proposed description of the Nymex NL1 vs PEN spread in the attached document.  I will schedule a meeting with Mark Taylor (Legal) to discuss this new index as soon as I hear back from you.
