Hi David , 

At this time I do not know of a rotation on the NYMEX desk.
Both Justin and myself are both Associates currently on the desk that will not be rotating
for some time now.

Hi Dutch:

Do you know if your group may be looking as my rotation ends 11/30?

Thanks

Hi,

I enjoyed working with you during my prior assignment at Enron as the primary person managing the Nymex natural gas positions
and serving as a liaison between your Nymex trading activity and numerous brokers.

Additionally, I am currently seeking a new assignment as an analyst as my rotation date is approaching and am interested
in knowing of any positions available in your group. I do know Brian who formerly worked in your group as an analyst.

I am extremely interested in meeting with you to review my background after trading hours.

Thanks,
David
