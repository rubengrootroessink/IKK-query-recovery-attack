Two statues in a city park, one female and one male, had faced each
other for many years. One morning, an angel appeared and told the
statues, "Since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for
years, I'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 30
minutes. In that time you may do whatever you like." And the statues
came to life.

Smiling at each other, they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind
a couple of bushes. The angel smiled as she listened to them giggling
and rustling in the grass. After 15 minutes, the statues emerged from
the bushes, smiling and happy. The angel was puzzled. "You still have 15
minutes. Would you like to continue?"

The male statue looked at the female and asked, "Do you want to do it
again?"
"Oh, yes!" the female statue said. "But this time YOU hold the pigeon
down and I'LL poop on its head!"
