Hello Dutch.

Hope you are having a good Monday. I've delayed this message in hopes that
you catch up with the last three weeks' assignments that you have not
handed in yet. As I noted in our discussion last week, it will be
signficantly helpful to Monica and I to receive any information you've
gathered to this point, as opposed to receiving it all at the end.

As usual, I've included the high-level outline for each content area that
you should follow when writing this week's assignment. Remember, this
assignment should be placed in the ECW. I've included instructions to
remind you how to use this tool.  Note - If the content you have written
does not fit onto the page, please just send it to us in an email. Thank
you!
