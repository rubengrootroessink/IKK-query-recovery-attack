Here are the directions to Enron.  Call Dutch's cell number if you get lost,
confused, or whatever.  Draft starts at 11am.  Please let us know if you
find anyone that wants to join the league!!!  I also need a list of names if
you are bringing a friend that we can leave with the guard, otherwise I will
just leave the names of the various owners.

Dutch's Cell Number:  713-471-9037

Later,

Kevin
