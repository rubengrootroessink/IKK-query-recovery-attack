Hi Dutch,
 
Yes, I would think this is possible because the overall margin excess is $24,296,123.00.  Unfortunately, I don't see any "breakdowns" on the numbers.
 
Hope this helps!

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.
 
Thanks!

Gerri,
 
I assume this is for all commodities at EDF Man, would Frank have the break down in about 1 hour ?
