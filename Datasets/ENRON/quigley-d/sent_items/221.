She is going through her annual Kevin needs to make more money so I can stay
at home feelings.  Other then that, everything is good.

We are leaving Saturday the 17th and returning on the 20th via Continental.
It is still cheap to buy now.  I think we are on flight 1097 going and 579
for the return.  We are staying at the Monte Carlo again.  160 for the first
night, then 89, then 59 or something like that.   www.monte-carlo.com

We are going shopping Sunday for our tent.

Later,

Kevin
