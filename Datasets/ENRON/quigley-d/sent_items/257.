This is an invitation for you to join the best NFL office pool since
well, last year's pool.  During the off-season, a secret vote was
apparently held to designate me as the commissioner for this year's
league.  Well let's do it...

General Q&A about this league to help you realize you should sign up
and play (for those of you who have not played before):

Q1.  How much does this cost me?
A1.  Ah yes, the most important question.  It costs $100 per player.
The money is due to me by Sunday, September 9.  You don't pay...you
don't play!  Get your fee to me in person or mail it to the following
address:

Brian Dunlavy
8073 El Mundo
Houston, TX 77054


Q2.  What is this?
A2.  It's an NFL office pool.  Each week, you will select the winners
of the NFL games straight up and assign a ranking of 15 to 1 for the
games (or 14, 13 if teams are off).  Your 15 game is your most
confident game while your 1 game is the game that you just can't
figure out.  If your team wins, then you get the number of points you
designated to that team.  For example, New York Giants vs. Cleveland
Browns.  You select New York to win and rank them with 15.  They win,
you get 15 points.  They lose, you don't get any points.

Q3.  Why are the rankings for the games important?
A3.  Because that is how you win money!  Each week, the individual
with the highest score wins the weekly money which will be $50.  A
running total of the scores is kept for the season and the rest of
the money will be paid to first through fifth place (possibly sixth
place).

Q4.  How do I enter and play?
A4.  The league name is "H-Town Slaps".  You can access the site at
any time using the web address:

http://football217.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/join?league=slaplist&

NOTE: Once you get to the Join League Page, you will be asked to
enter a password.  The password for this league is:

kingme10

On the Join League page, select your name from the drop-down list. If
you don't see your name, select "New Player" and click Submit.

Read over the rules for the league for further information.  If you
have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Good Luck!  Also, I don't have everyone's email addresses (especially
those who have played in the past) so please forward this email to
your friends who may be interested in playing.

Thanks,
Brian
