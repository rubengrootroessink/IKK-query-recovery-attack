Dear Ernesto , 

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens.
The next step is "the event" that will be the turning point of this bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Dutch

Subject:	Why Kingwood?

Please read the message below (from Mark).  He asked about it, I looked it
up and got us a tee time.  If anybody wants to get a tee time somewhere
else, that is fine with me.  Just let me know so that I can cancel the tee
times in Kingwood.

With Richard playing and the boys from Austin playing, I think that Kingwood
is a happy medium.  We could try Brock park if that's what you guys want.
Who the hell lives by Brock?  I actually think that the drive to Kingwood is
better than the drive into 5th ward or whatever ward it is.

I don't mind making a drive to play in Austin or Beaumont or Katy.  It's
golf!!!!

The DOG!

I heard an add on 610 for Kingwood Cove or something.  Do you have time to
check it out?

No.  They have a tournament on Sunday morning.  Their first available tee
time is 1:15.
Damn, and I was hoping Mark would wear his Hillrod wig.

Sorry, any other suggestions?
