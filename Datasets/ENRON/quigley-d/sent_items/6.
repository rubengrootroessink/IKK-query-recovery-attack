Mr. Quigley,

I am predicting the worst knowing that we could possibly be running late. So
I have two questions. First, what will be the cost per square (minimum
purchase)? And would you like for me to bring some pico de gallo?

Super Bowl XXXVI is Here
So lets all get together and cheer

New England and St Louis are in the Big game
along with the return of the Bud Frogs, so it will not be lame

4 pm is the time to arrive
all need to come to keep things alive

The squares will all be lined in their Row
so call ahead if you will be slow
