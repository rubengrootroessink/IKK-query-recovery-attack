Hi Dutch,

I need to schedule an hour with you this week.  You are on the calendar
this week to meet with Mery, Ann and Laura from 2:00-4:00pm on Thursday,
October 18th.   Can Sheri and I setup a meeting with you for this Tuesday,
October 16th for an hour?

Let me know what your calendar looks like!

Thanks,
Monica L. Brown
