Hi Dutch,

Per our conversation today, I am resending the questions and concerns that
I have on the Futures and Options practice questions/graphic ideas.  It is
very important that we setup some time with you next week or the week after
Thanksgiving.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.

I need final signoffs on the Futures and Options practice
exercises/graphics.  The deadline for this was today.  I need to know if
you are okay with the graphic ideas and practice questions that you've seen
so far for the Futures and Options.

Questions and Concerns: I know you have seen these questions several times,
so I pointed out the areas that I need your help.
(1.) I need help with question #4 in Options.  I need help developing the
graphic for this question.
(2.) I need the answers to the scenario questions that you created and the
explanation for the answers.

Attached below are the two topics that you are responsible for in the
Knowledge System.
(See attached file: Futures Graphic ideas and practices_2.doc)(See attached
file: Options Graphic ideas and practices_3.doc)

Thanks,
Monica L. Brown
