The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new=
 building and are currently parking in the Allen Center garage are being of=
fered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the=
 new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The =
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is cu=
rrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=
oyee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name =
to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be m=
ade as spaces become available.=20

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not b=
e opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street=
 level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is avail=
able. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be us=
ed as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.=20

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Pa=
rking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=
ail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=
 receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the =
new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and=
 Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.=20

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have=
 to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)
