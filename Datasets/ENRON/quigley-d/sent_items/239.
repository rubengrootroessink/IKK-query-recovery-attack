How was the game?  I'll tell how the game was....it was the worst display of Cougar Football I have ever seen.  It doesn't take much to not make the top 10 worst UH football performances, but we did it.  It's not like we got pasted by a good team, Rice sucks too.  It was so bad Richard got in a fight with a die-hard cougar fan that sits in front of us.  Do you know anyone that might want to buy my Texas tickets.  Maybe I'm just ruined after having to put up with 25 years of the Cubs, but I can't take less than mediocrity anymore!

How was the game? I got stuck having to go to a latino gansta'
weeding (was afraid i was going to get shot).  did you guys
tailgate?  did mark start bitching and whinning after the first
play of the game?  i shall be there at the next one.
