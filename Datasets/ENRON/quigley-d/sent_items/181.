okay- had a meeting this morning with a new prospect and then
filled out a complaint at the dry cleaners on a shirt they shrunk of mine
I am going to stop by a going away party for a guy in my group with Kathleen from 6-7
then my friend Steinum's going away  is at 9pm at State Bar
So was wondering if we can catch up around 8 and grab a late dinner
so that we could stop by State bar so I could say goodbye to Steinum
does that sound groovy with you?? or do you want to come with us at 6 too??
love
me
