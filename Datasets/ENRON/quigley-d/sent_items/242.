i love you very much also and sometime i need to let you express your angst and try not to 
get wrapped up in trying to make it all better but understand why you feel the way you do and work
on myself and us as a partnership in life.

ILY

Subject:	RE:

seeing him or not is fine with me...I expressed my angst to you just now
because that is what I felt at that moment. I am working VERY hard
to change some of my behaviors to more productive ones for our relationship
and in light of recent 'irrational' behavior on your part I just hope you devote the
same effort and I KNOW that you are- I just forget the other avenues in which you do this
I love you
