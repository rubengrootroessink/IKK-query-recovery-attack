Dutch,
I just want to follow up on this email that I sent you.
We are getting very close to losing our database access to the EOL database.  I don't have the exact date at this point.  The word we got from EOL is very soon.

If it's very critical for you to continue to run your excel model, you may want to contact someone at the EOL.

Please let us know either way.

Thanks,
Franky

Dutch,

We have created a table in our SQL Server database which is almost similar to the one in the EOL Database. 
This new table is populated at realtime from the Tibco Data Feed.

After evaluating your existing eol_macro.xsl query, we discovered that we can not fully preserve the functionality of your model due to the missing REFERENCE_PERIOD_END_DTM field.  This field is used in your macro for grouping and sorting purposes.  We have requested this field to be added to the Tibco Data Feed but have encountered a road block, EOL is unwilling to add to this field at this time.

The next technology currently being developed by EOL will solve this problem but is not available until November.

As soon as EOL-IT shuts off access to the EOL database, your macro will no longer work.  
We anticipate that this is going to happen in the next month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Franky
