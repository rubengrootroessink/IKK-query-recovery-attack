So what's with all the rhyme
Do you have too much time?
First came the New Home announcement, then the Super Bowl Ditty,
Maybe it's time we all start calling you P. Diddy!
Melissa and I will be there
I may not be wearing underwear
Do we need to bring anything?
Some cokes, some chips or maybe some wings?
