Dutch,

I was wondering if you could have the price curve that is loaded into the system extended out through 2030.  It ends in 2024 right now, but some of the LNG deals that we are looking at are longer than that.  We use it for VERY indicative purposes only and would talk with you and John if any serious numbers were needed.

If this is a problem or if I need to contact someone else, please let me know.

thanks,

Eric
