good morning baby
i am not having a good morning
i have to re-execute my contract from last week
because we (in my rush I emailed it to legal wrong) had the price in it wrong- too many zeros
so it looks like they can buy power for practically nil
no one caught the error before customer signed it
so it really sucks that I have to get him to resign
hope it flies with him
