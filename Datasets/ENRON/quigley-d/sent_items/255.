12 or 14 teams , 5 or 6 franchise players some one will always be complaining of unfair drafts
this is just a suggestion to chew on 
I still agree with the vote and in keeping with the rules of the league

There are 14 teams.
Even with Dutch's version, you will still have someone that kept the 5th
franchise player getting the 15th pick, while someone that did not keep a
franchise player, but had the first pick in the supplemental round getting
the 6th pick and the 28th pick.  I don't think that is fair.  We have always
voted on rules changes for the next year at the current years draft.  I
don't think we should make an exception now to the rule.
