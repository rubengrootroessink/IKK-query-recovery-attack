Dutch,

Update on Andex VPP - They want to try and close on July 9th (Monday), but it will be dependent on pricing.

We have asked for quit a few updates and we appreciate your help.  Going forward, we will probably want to get a quote every other day, or when the market makes a significant movement.

If you would update the quote before you leave that would be great.

Thanks!

Eric
