Dutch,

Pursuant to our conversation.

This is the risk we would like to swap out.
This is from your view......meaning if the position is positive ENRON is
LONG to JARON.  JARON would need to buy from ENRON to flatten out.

Cal 5       655
Cal 6    (1002)
Cal 7      (454)
Cal 8         96

I would prefer to Buy from Enron if you cannot find spreads.

Thanks,
