   Once again, someone thought they could hang with the big DOG and ended
   up
   with Canine Teeth marks on his ass.  Sorry Richard!  Marshall Faulk just
   wasn't enough.  Don't take it personnal it's just the way it is.  Who
   dare
   try to come to my yard next?

   Fear the DOG!

   Is anyone on the Red Division ever going to take control?

   BTW Mark - You got knocked the f**k out!!
