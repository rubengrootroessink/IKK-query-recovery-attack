Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
Was really hoping to hear from you by this morning.  After what we saw on CNN  last night I want to know that you both are okay  - haven't traveled - and all of your friends are okay too!
We're only getting bits and pieces of news and it's  so shocking.
I want to hear from you now even if it's just one  line!
Love MOM
