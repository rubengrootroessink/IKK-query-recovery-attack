Mojo,

that is sweet , pardon the pun
those cakes look great , what is in the casino cake ?
it looks pretty cool

How are things going for you ?
Have you settled into a groove yet ?

This past weekend was great for me.
I spent the entire weekend with Kay , 
we had dinner with my parents on sat. Night
and just hung out the entire weekend.
I have had a very different out look on life lately and
it has been working well for me. I have started to ask
alot more questions instead of always assuming the answer.
It has been working well for me.

Hope all is good with you.

Laters

Here's a few of the cakes that we make at the bakery.  I'm hoping to
document the rest of the cakes, petit fours, breads, and morning
pastries that we do over the next few days.
