Subject:	Meeting: Tuesday October 4

I would like to confirm that we are meeting next Tuesday, the 4th, to
discuss simulation scenarios and exercises. The meeting will be from 1:30 -
2:30 in Room 3269 of the Enron Building. (Ed, I spoke with your assistant
and she said you were available at this time.)

Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing you
Tuesday.
Mery
