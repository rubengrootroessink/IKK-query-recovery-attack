Hi everyone,
I am the Co-Chair for the Muscular Dystrophy Association's Celebrity Waiter=
 Benefit this year.  I know I have spoke to several of you about this event=
, and for everyone else, I thought you might be interested so I decided to =
send an email with the details.  This benefit raises funds to extend resear=
ch and patient services to over 1350 families that are affected by a neurom=
uscular disorder in the Houston Gulf Coast area.

The date is Saturday, October 6, 2001 at the Houston Club downtown (6:30 pm=
 - 12 am; dinner is served at 8 pm).  Local celebrities, such as TV anchors=
, radio DJs, former oilers, local business owners, etc. wait tables to rais=
e money.  There is a silent and live auction, as well as dinner, dancing an=
d a casino.  The cost is $75 per person and a table seats 10.  Black tie op=
tional.  Beer and wine will be included in the ticket price until 10 pm.   =
Silent and live auction items include autographed sports paraphernalia (Joe=
 Torre baseball signed at the 61* HBO premiere), Continental tickets, golf =
packages, autographed CD package, autographed book collection, theater tick=
ets, spa packages, etc.  This my fourth year to help out with this event an=
d it is really a fun, lively benefit.=20

If you are interested, please let me know.  Also, please let me know if you=
 want to put together a table of 10 and the people who will be sitting at t=
hat table.  There are approximately 300 people that attend the event.
Rebecca
