Dutch,

I was forwarded the message you left for Joe Hunter regarding the Chase situation.  I have contacted legal to discuss Enron generating the confirmations for EOL deals.  Was it Greg Crowley at Chase that you spoke with regarding this?  I just need to give Mark Taylor the right name.  

Also, FYI, Joe is longer with the confirms group. Going forward, I can help you with any issues you have regarding financial confirms.  

Thanks,
Diane

When you have some resolution on this Chase deal, please drop me a line and let me know what's up.

Thanks,
Diane

Dutch,

Here's the info for Chase:

Chase trader: Greg Crowley 
          phone: 212 834 4286

TAGG no: VW1398.1 
EOL no: 1707177

15,000 a day (465,000 for month of October)

We signed in error their confirmation showing 450,000 per month, but they legally agreed to 465,000 by clicking on the EOL trade.

Sorry that error slipped through.
Let me know.

Thanks,
Diane Anderson
