Dutch,

Hopefully, you can help me.

PEC is currently short NYMEX NG LD Settlement Swaps with Enron North
America.
(See attached spreadsheet for volumes and prices).

PEC would like to terminate these swaps.
The current Mark-to-Market of these swaps is approximately $5.5 Million (in
favor of PEC).
PEC would like to negotiate the termination of these swaps and a payment
plan.

Thanks for your help,

Brian Marozas
