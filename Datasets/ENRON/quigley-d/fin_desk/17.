Thanks Dutch.  I spoke with John Arnold yesterday and he said that we can assume that the deal verbally confirmed on Friday does not need to be done.  That is CSFB's position and unless you disagree we will leave it at that.

	To All,

	I am the one that was on the phone with the original call on the deal last Friday night and
	in contact with them up until this past Sunday. Let me know what I can do to help on this
	deal.

Today we received a letter from them.  How and when do you want to respond to this?  Has anyone called them?

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get "done" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

Chris:
We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with "Dutch" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?
