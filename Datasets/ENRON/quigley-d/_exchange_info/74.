Hi again!
 
I'm pretty sure that the commissions are included on statements and charge to us daily.  Therefore, the numbers that we are confirming as either excess or margin call, is inclusive of the fees.  I believe Jason Fisher would have the exact amount of the fees.  I know this question has been proposed several times and I've always refered them directly to Jason, and I'm assuming that he was able to help as I never heard back from anyone.
 
I hope I'm leading you in the correct direction.  If not, please let me know so that I too may be aware.
 
Thanks!

Gerri,
 
Do you know who pays the brokers commissions each month ?
I am trying to gather the per transaction costs they we pay on the exchange.

Good Morning!
 
We have excess of $4,498,358.00 with EDF Man.  I called and talked with Paul this morning and he said that he could not confirm the wire for today as of yet.  
 
I'll let you know asap.
 
Thanks!
