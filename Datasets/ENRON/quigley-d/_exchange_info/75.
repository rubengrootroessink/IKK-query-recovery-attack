Hi Dutch,
 
No, all he said was that he hadn't been given instructions as of yet (7:50).  I've just called him again (9:05), and he said that he was told that there would be no money transfered either way???
 
Thanks!

Good Morning!
 
We have excess of $4,498,358.00 with EDF Man.  I called and talked with Paul this morning and he said that he could not confirm the wire for today as of yet.  
 
I'll let you know asap.
 
Thanks!
