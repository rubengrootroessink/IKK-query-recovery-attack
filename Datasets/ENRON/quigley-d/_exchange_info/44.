John,

If you cannot locate your NYMEX access computer terminal its cost will be docked from your cost center.  You need to get it tracked down ASAP!

Tana:
No, I went to 32 and it was gone. 

Clay:
Do you know if anyone from your group picked up a computer from John Arnold's old desk on 32 that was an HP or IBM?

Thanks,

Danielle
