Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.
 
Thanks!

Gerri,
 
I assume this is for all commodities at EDF Man, would Frank have the break down in about 1 hour ?

F.Y.I......
 
Again we have excess on our account today with EDF Man.  When I called to confirm, Paul tells me that no money with be transfered.  Total amount of excess is $24,296,123.00.
