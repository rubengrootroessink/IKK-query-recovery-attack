ly won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a=
 car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor=
 Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the prac=
tice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwig=
ht, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith  , RB NE - C=
YSWC Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchd=

pdated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms a=

1 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's ga=
me. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra =
