d 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Satu=
rday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played wi=

2/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideo=

 help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB C=
AR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fan=

on hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during =
the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez  , TE KC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated=
 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he i=

of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help mo=
st Fantasy teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Team T-Bone Updated 12/21/01 To=
omer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantas=
y numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout d=
uring your playoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets=
 Updated 12/21/01 Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the f=
inal weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though t=
