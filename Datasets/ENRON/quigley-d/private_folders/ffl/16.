1 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best=
 wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Min=

1 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead=
 your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/2=
1/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky sta=

eather Cheerios Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but=
 his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. H=
e should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.  Marvin Harrison , =
WR IND - Third World Countryman Updated 12/21/01 Harrison will be an import=
ant Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have s=
ome good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race.   Duce=

s Thrash , WR PHI - Pumpdog Updated 12/21/01 Thrash was not very consistent=
