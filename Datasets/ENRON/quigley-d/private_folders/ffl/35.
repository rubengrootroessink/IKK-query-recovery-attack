ng him if you have a backup of equal value.   Duce Staley , Active RB Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep=
 him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoff=

on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week.   Ike Hilliard , Active WR =
