  Jeff Graham , WR SD  Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday a=
t Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach M=

ations of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE  Updated 12/23/01 Smit=

one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy=
 glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday =
despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a tou=
chdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Ga=
rcia , QB SF  Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all =
week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a crack=
ed rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his t=
hrows. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he w=
ill still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN  Updated 12/=

easley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of =

g the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL  Updated 12/2=
1/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don'=
t depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR  Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 w=
ideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and w=
on't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , =
QB CAR  Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy pla=
yoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is =
a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL  Updated =
12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playo=
ffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OA=
K  Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He w=
ill be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Ran=
dy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but ha=
s once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him dur=
ing your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC  Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn'=
t done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the rema=
ining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 12/21/=
01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will=
 be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS  Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play=
 in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson ,=
 RB KC  Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat=
 this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE=
 KC  Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year.=
 Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Fa=
vre , QB GB  Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this seaso=
n. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB =
KC  Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. H=
e is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB =

ovement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fant=
asy teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG  Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is having a bit=
 of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him =
worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.=
  Marvin Harrison , WR IND  Updated 12/21/01 Harrison will be an important =
Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some =
good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race.   Duce Sta=
ley , RB PHI  Updated 12/21/01 Staley started to play well late in the seas=
on. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate b=
ack for the playoffs.    Shawn Bryson , RB BUF  Updated 12/21/01 Bryson wil=
l start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a N=
o. 2 RB if you need help at that spot.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=
