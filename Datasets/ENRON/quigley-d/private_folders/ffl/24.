 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Joe Horn , WR NO  Updated 12/21/01=
 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must=
-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , R=
B ATL  Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in=
 recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Ha=
yes , WR CAR  Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this =
week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explos=
ive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.=
    Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup dur=
ing the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average =
numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner=
 , QB STL  Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to succe=
ss during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  =
Rich Gannon , QB OAK  Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy=
 QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should neve=
r be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow=
 this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesita=
te to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC  Updated 12=

asy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gard=
ner , WR WAS  Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this seas=
on. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.  =
  Tony Richardson , RB KC  Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consis=
tent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.  =
 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC  Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as =
expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy p=
layoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB  Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the =
best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.=
  Trent Green , QB KC  Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fant=
asy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill=
 Schroeder , WR GB  Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look=
 for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasse=
lbeck , QB SEA  Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment t=
his year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.   Johnnie Morton , W=

l still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your line=
up.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND  Updated 12/21/01 Wayne is healthy again, and sh=
owing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statisticall=
y to help most Fantasy teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG  Updated 12/21/01 Too=
mer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy=
 numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout du=
ring your playoffs.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND  Updated 12/21/01 Harrison w=
ill be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season=
. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the play=
off race.   Duce Staley , RB PHI  Updated 12/21/01 Staley started to play w=
ell late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He w=
ill be an adequate back for the playoffs.    Shawn Bryson , RB BUF  Updated=
 12/21/01 Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week.=
 Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot.   James Thrash ,=
 WR PHI  Updated 12/21/01 Thrash was not very consistent during the regular=
 season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL =
regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playo=
ffs.   David Patten , WR NE  Updated 12/21/01 Patten's numbers have dropped=
 off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless your team is very thin at wide r=
eceiver.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL  Updated 12/21/01 Galloway has been a dis=
appointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless you're in a deeper leagu=
e, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't recommended.    Troy Brown =
, WR NE  Updated 12/21/01 Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver t=
his year. He may not be a reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs.   Wa=
rrick Dunn , RB TB  Updated 12/21/01 Dunn has been inconsistent this season=
. He will be a No. 2 back at best during your playoffs.   Antowain Smith , =
RB NE  Updated 12/21/01 Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy pos=
tseason. Even if his yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD thre=
at.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB  Updated 12/21/01 Johnson has caught a lot o=
f passes this season, but has only one TD reception. Nevertheless, he will =
still be a reliable receiver in your playoffs.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ  Upd=
ated 12/21/01 Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year.=
 He may not be very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs.   More Updates [I=
