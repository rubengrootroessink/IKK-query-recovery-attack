 play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car acc=
ident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor =
will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squ=

to complications of ! a ! collapsed lung.   [IMAGE]Antowain Smith, RB NE  U=
pdated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Sa=
turday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry =
your team to Fantasy glory.     [IMAGE]Steve McNair, QB TEN  Updated 12/23/=

a solid No. 1 QB.  [IMAGE]Jeff Garcia, QB SF  Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whos=

B CAR  Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy play=
offs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a=
 good option if you need an emergency QB.   [IMAGE]Kurt Warner, QB STL  Upd=
ated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the =
playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  [IMAGE]Rich Ga=
nnon, QB OAK  Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this=
 year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be ben=

his season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate=
 to start him during your playoff run.  [IMAGE]Marvin Minnis, WR KC  Update=

 as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.=
  [IMAGE]Rod Gardner, WR WAS  Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very incons=

n't advisable.    [IMAGE]Tony Richardson, RB KC  Updated 12/21/01 Richardso=
n hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during t=
