 with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - KMB Express Updated 1=
2/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the dea=
th of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham=
 doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will b=
e signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No.=
 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowa=
in Smith  , RB NE - She Said Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-hig=
h 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners i=
n the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair =
, QB TEN - She Said Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite sufferi=
ng from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in =
the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - =

2/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. D=
on't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - F=
ree Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week=
 as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive,=
 however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    =
Chris Weinke , QB CAR - KMB Express Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a b=
ackup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than=

 Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him=
 the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 1=
2/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key=
 player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR=
 MIN - Cali Bound Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but ha=
s once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him dur=
ing your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 12/21/01 =
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him dur=

hird World Countryman Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this=
 season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your pl=
ayoffs.  Rod Gardner  , WR WAS - Baby Blues Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has be=
en very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, start=
ing Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Update=

n't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Xtreme U=
pdated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still=
