- South Park Cows Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early =
in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the fir=
st quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Team T=
-Bone Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He i=
s not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Beer Gut =
Boys Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with l=
abored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN =
- High Shrivel Factor Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's ga=
me, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Sp=
ergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls  , TE CAR - Blue Star Boys Updated 12/23/01 Wall=
s was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left th=
e game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , =
K TB - High Shrivel Factor Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring=
 in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gra=
matica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - High S=
hrivel Factor Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday'=
s game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play wit=
h some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 12/23/=
01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of=
 his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham does=
n't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be sig=
ned off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 re=
ceiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Sm=
ith  , RB NE - CYSWC Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 ya=
rds and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AF=
C and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN=
 - Money Shots Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering fr=
om back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the s=
econd half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - CYSWC=
 Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played =
in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He pl=
ayed with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia=
 might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be =
a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated=
 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle =
injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned =
to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 12/23/01=
 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a =
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB=
 SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will pro=
bably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO -=
 Addison Red Cornholes Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like =
an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks=
 of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - CYSWC Updated 12/21/01 A ban=
ged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend o=
n him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Upd=
ated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1=
 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and=
 won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke =
, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during t=
he Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbe=
rs, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB=
 STL - Team T-Bone Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams =
to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of th=
e way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 12/21/01 Gannon h=
as been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many =
title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Repla=
cements Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once aga=
in been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your p=
layoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 12/21/01 Minnis ha=
sn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the r=
emaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Beer Gut B=
oys Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fanta=
sy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardn=
er  , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsiste=
nt this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't =
advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - South Park Cows Updated 12/21/01 Ri=
chardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him d=
uring the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Aryan Brother Inc. Up=
dated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still,=
 he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , Q=
B GB - Water Boys Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this =
season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green =
, QB KC - Barking Spiders Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent F=
antasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   B=
ill Schroeder , WR GB - The Replacements Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had=
 a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your po=
stseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbec=
k has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy=
 postseason.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc a=
