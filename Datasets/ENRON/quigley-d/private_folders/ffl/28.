   [IMAGE]Ahman Green, RB GB  Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in =
the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens=
.   [IMAGE]Todd Bouman, QB MIN  Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start S=
unday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was repl=
aced by Spergon Wynn.   [IMAGE]Wesley Walls, TE CAR  Updated 12/23/01 Walls=
 was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the=
 game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   [IMAGE]Martin Gramat=
ica, K TB  Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth q=
uarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expect=
ed to play on December 29.    [IMAGE]Todd Bouman, QB MIN  Updated 12/23/01 =
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to st=

AGE]Jeff Graham, WR SD  Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday =
at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach =
Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in=
 his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Charg=
ers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complicati=
ons of a collapsed lung.   [IMAGE]Antowain Smith, RB NE  Updated 12/23/01 S=
mith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has be=
en one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fant=
asy glory.     [IMAGE]Steve McNair, QB TEN  Updated 12/23/01 McNair played =
Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throw=
ing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.=
  [IMAGE]Jeff Garcia, QB SF  Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time w=
as limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that=
 he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't great=
ly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining=
 weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   [IMAGE]Eddie George=
, RB TEN  Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite sufferi=
ng from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck inj=
ury but returned to the game.  [IMAGE]Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA  Updated 12/23=
/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of=
 a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  [IMAGE]Fred Be=
asley, RB SF  Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probab=
ly be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   [IMAGE]Joe Horn, WR N=
O  Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy rec=
eiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. =
  [IMAGE]Maurice Smith, RB ATL  Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't d=
one much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fant=
asy playoffs.   [IMAGE]Donald Hayes, WR CAR  Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may ste=
p back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin=
 Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams m=
uch during Weeks 15 through 17.    [IMAGE]Chris Weinke, QB CAR  Updated 12/=
21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the=
 weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if yo=
u need an emergency QB.   [IMAGE]Kurt Warner, QB STL  Updated 12/21/01 Warn=
er should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect f=
ine numbers from him the rest of the way.  [IMAGE]Rich Gannon, QB OAK  Upda=
ted 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be =
a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   [IMAGE]Ran=
dy Moss, WR MIN  Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has=
 once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him duri=
ng your playoff run.  [IMAGE]Marvin Minnis, WR KC  Updated 12/21/01 Minnis =
hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the=
 remaining weeks of the NFL season.   [IMAGE]Michael Westbrook, WR WAS  Upd=
ated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy play=
er. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  [IMAGE]Rod Gardn=
er, WR WAS  Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season=
. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    =
[IMAGE]Tony Richardson, RB KC  Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a co=
nsistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoff=
s.   [IMAGE]Tony Gonzalez, TE KC  Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played a=
s well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the=
 Fantasy playoffs.   [IMAGE]Brett Favre, QB GB  Updated 12/21/01 Favre has =
been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team t=
o Fantasy glory.  [IMAGE]Trent Green, QB KC  Updated 12/21/01 Green has bee=
n an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest=
 of the season.   [IMAGE]Bill Schroeder, WR GB  Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder =
has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during =
