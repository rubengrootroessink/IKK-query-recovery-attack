tes  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has=
 not been a reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy.   Priest Holmes=
 , RB KC - Pumpdog Updated 12/21/01 Holmes returned to practice on Thursday=
. He should assume his regular workload this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB -=
 The Hillrods Updated 12/21/01 Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He =
is expected to play on Sunday.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updated=
 12/21/01 Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers =
may start over him this week.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - KMB Express Upda=
ted 12/21/01 Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the=
 game against Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad c=
an't play.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Cali Bound Updated 12/21/01 Walls (ank=
le) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against Buffalo.   Peer=
less Price , WR BUF - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 12/21/01 Price (ankle) re=
turned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this week.   Frank W=
ycheck , TE TEN - The Leather Cheerios Updated 12/21/01 Wycheck started off=
 slow this season but has been productive in recent weeks. Expect him to co=
ntribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy playoffs.   Bob Christi=
an , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Christian missed practice with ti=
ghtness in his calf on Thursday. His current status is day to day.   Eddie =
George  , RB TEN - The Wounded Ducks Updated 12/21/01 George is listed as q=
uestionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle injury, but is expected=
 to play. Look for him to be productive this week against a weak Raider run=
 defense.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - She Said Updated 12/21/01 Look for Dyson=
 to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason. He might not =
score, but he should catch a few passes.    Derrick Mason , WR TEN - KMB Ex=
press Updated 12/21/01 Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite sufferin=
g from a hip injury. Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout.   Hines =
Ward , WR PIT - She Said Updated 12/21/01 Ward hasn't scored a lot of touch=
downs this season but is among the league leaders in receptions. He should =
be an asset to your team for the rest of the season as a No. 2 wideout.   P=
laxico Burress , WR PIT - The Hillrods Updated 12/21/01 Burress has been mo=
re reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky pick for the Fantasy =
playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at best.   Kyle Brady , TE J=
AC - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 12/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats=
 much this season. Don't expect him to be too productive during the Fantasy=
 playoffs.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtreme Updated 12/21/01 Mack has produc=
ed an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't scored a lot. He sh=
ould be used in larger leagues only for the remaining weeks.   Keenan McCar=
dell , WR JAC - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 12/21/01 McCardell has caught a lot of =
passes this season but he doesn't score too many touchdowns. Look for him t=
o be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy playoffs.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC=
 - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 12/21/01 Smith has been one of the best rece=
ivers in the AFC this season, despite his offseason injury. The veteran is =
a must-start for your Fantasy playoff run.   Tim Couch , QB CLE - Pierres F=
lea Circus Updated 12/21/01 Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is =
far too unreliable to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. =
  Kevin Johnson , WR CLE - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 12/21/01 Johnson has=
 been solid all season. Look for him to be a good receiver during the Fanta=
sy playoffs.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 12/21/01=
 Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an ad=
equate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least 2=
00 yards and a touchdown.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - She Said Updated 12/21/=
01 Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to c=
ontinue throughout the Fantasy playoffs.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - She Said =
Updated 12/21/01 Taylor is not expected to play Sunday. He is still sufferi=
ng from a groin injury that has sidelined him for most of the season.   Cor=
ey Dillon , RB CIN - KMB Express Updated 12/21/01 Dillon missed practice Th=
ursday because of a finger injury but The Cincinnati Post reports that he i=
s expected to play Sunday. Even if healthy, Dillon is a risky start this we=
ek against a tough Baltimore run defense. Consider benching him if you have=
 a backup of equal value.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 12/21/=
01 McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of ba=
ck spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. McNair first ex=
perienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In the first qua=
rter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened up. =
However, he stayed in the game. Even McNair is unsure of his status for Sat=
urday night. "If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it," he=
 said. "I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time the =
spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated." Avoid using McNair this week=
 if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a major r=
isk.     Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL - KMB Express Updated 12/20/01 Sharpe (le=
g) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week.   Drew Brees ,=
 QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01 There still seems to be a chance Brees=
 might play this week or before the season ends, says the San Diego Union-T=
ribune. He has been taking snaps with the first team in practice. "I'm not =
going to say that he will play, (but) could he play? Yes," Mike Riley. "But=
 I'm not going to say he will for sure.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - The Hillro=
ds Updated 12/20/01 Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow =
is not offically the Niners' goal-line back, says the Contra-Costa Times. "=
It's a coincidence," Barlow said. "It was my turn in the rotation to be in =
there." The two backs will continue to split carries.   Terrell Owens , WR =
SF - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 12/20/01 Owens (hip) did not practice on W=
ednesday. He is still expected to play this week.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - T=
he Leather Cheerios Updated 12/20/01 Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to q=
uestionable, but he still expects to play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps =
with the first team on Wednesday.   More Updates  NFL Reports, Transactions=
