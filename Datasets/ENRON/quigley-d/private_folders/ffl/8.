If you want to purchase Lion King tickets, our  company is offering a presale for them.  The prices are 131, 76,66,56,26  depending on the location.  131 is within the first 14 rows and 76 are  located anywhere in rows 15-25.  I need to have payments by next Wed. for  the tickets.  I am limited on the amount of tix I can get, although I can  probably get at least 4 per person.  Let me know if you want any...and get  me some cash.
 
Later,
 
Kevin
