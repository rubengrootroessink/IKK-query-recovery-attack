s  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA  Updated 12/29/01 Fi=
edler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. H=
e is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected =
to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the=
 Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 12/29/01 McNair wa=
s excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as =
questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to star=
t.   Larry Foster , WR DET  Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to =
play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to star=
t at this point in the Fantasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET  Updated 12/=
29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However=
, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   M=
uhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play=
 this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely sta=
rt in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA  Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Spri=
ngs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday ag=
ainst San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time =
will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN  Updated 12/29/01 Bouman wil=
l miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn =
will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN  Updated 12/29/01 Wynn wil=
l start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured=
 Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville,=
 is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season.   Dre=
w Bledsoe , QB NE  Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chi=
cago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly en=
trenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become exp=
endable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passin=
g game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   M=
artin Gramatica , K TB  Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled=
 out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicke=
r Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very ri=
sky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB  Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status=
 is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mil=
e Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   =
Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to d=
ay with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins ,=
 WR ARI  Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with=
 an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's t=
hird receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL  Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is liste=
d as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyron=
e Davis , TE GB  Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tigh=
t end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of p=
laying time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double t=
ight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA  Updated 12/28/01 =
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hams=
tring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 1=
2/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to=
 play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less =
than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC  Updated 12/28/01 Smith (f=
lu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe=
 Horn , WR NO  Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in pr=
actice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CL=
E  Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J=
. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.=
   Jason Brookins , RB BAL  Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to pract=
ice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action unt=
il Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss=
 this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third d=
owns this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash , WR=
 PHI  Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he =
is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR  Updated 12/28/01 Wa=
lls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime de=
cision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL  Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Sm=
ith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has i=
ndicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Ch=
ristian , RB ATL  Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf inju=
ry. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  Updated 12/=
28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this w=
eek.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN  Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thurs=
day but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full strength" criteria=
 for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, =
though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman d=
idn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on =
plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular pract=
ice t! ha! t reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bou=
man. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed p=
ortion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT  Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sid=
elined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the f=
irst time in a month. "Still questionable," coach Bill Cowher said. "He did=
 more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take =
it day to day."   Doug Brien , K TB  Updated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-ye=
ar contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him =
against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strai=
ned his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory o! ve! r the Saints last wee=
k. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against =
Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bo=
