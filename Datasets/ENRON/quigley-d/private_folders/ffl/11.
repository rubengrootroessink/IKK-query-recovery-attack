ws  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 12/20/01 Don't expe=
ct to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick told the =
Baltimore Sun. "He's my quarterback now, he's going to be my quarterback ne=
xt year, hopefully the year after that and the year after that," Billick sa=
id. "The only thing that would change that is if he chooses to retire or Go=
d forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury."   Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The=
 Wounded Ducks Updated 12/20/01 Chandler won't have to look over his should=
er this week. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Michael Vick will not s=

sted as questionable for Sunday's game.   Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Woun=
ded Ducks Updated 12/19/01 Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will n=
ot play again this season. Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle'=
s final three games.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Xtreme Updated 12/19/01 Grie=
se should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week. Jarious J=
ackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB.   Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - 2700 HUEVOS =
Updated 12/19/01 Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on =
Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seat=
tle secondary.   Travis Henry , RB BUF - KMB Express Updated 12/19/01 Henry=
 will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will star=
t in his place.   Tim Dwight , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Dwight (=
fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not produced very =
much this year when healthy.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated=
 12/19/01 Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some pla=
ying time in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help=
 most Fantasy teams.   Derrick Mason , WR TEN - KMB Express Updated 12/19/0=
1 Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current sta=
tus is day to day.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 12/19/01 McNai=
r (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is day to=
 day.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Sanders has re=
turned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to play this week=
.   Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Richardson is day=
 to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on Sunday.   Oronde =
Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updated 12/19/01 Gadsden missed Tuesday's pract=
ice with a strained hamstring. He is expected to play on Saturday.  Bill Gr=
amatica , K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed o=
n injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for =
the final three games of the season.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent U=
pdated 12/19/01 Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a so=
re shoulder.  He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma=
'afala and gained 73 yards Sunday.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - 2700 HUEVOS =
Updated 12/19/01 The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least=
 one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to =
play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtfu=
l with a groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis)! =
w! ill come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful makin=
g sure he's playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this wee=
k. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala w=
ill likely start for Bettis.   Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/=
18/01 Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks=
 more work over the final three games of the season, according to the Nashv=
ille Tennessean. "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going=
 to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? Bu=
t I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will li=
mit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky star=
t.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 12/18/01 McNair will miss Tues=
day's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during=
 Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surge=
ry to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on =
Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe =
start for Week 15.  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Zer=
eoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimo=
re. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's =
only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.  Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - =
Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on inj=
ured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian=
 Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious J=
ackson serving as his backup.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerio=
s Updated 12/18/01 According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer , Jackson could =
miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a relia=
ble weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin =
Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split ti=
me the rest of the way if Jackson is out.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - KMB Expr=
ess Updated 12/18/01 Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should=
 be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against =
Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benchi=
ng him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.  Scott Mitchell , QB CIN -=
 Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Ba=
ltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his th=
rowing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect eithe=
r QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season=
.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Bengals placed Sm=
ith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending h=
is season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his =
hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest =
of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinn! at! i qu=
arterback the rest of the year anyway.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - She Said Up=
dated 12/18/01 The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday aga=
inst Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined f=
or just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of =
the three after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a wor=
thy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.  Doug Flut=
ie , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley sai=
d Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead o=
f rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some p=
laying time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky p=
layer during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility h=
e could sit in favor of Brees at any time.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Pumpdog=
 Updated 12/18/01 Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly =
Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for S=
unday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status=
 before you consider using him this week.  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/18/01 Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup thi=
s week against Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine h=
is true status for the game.   More Updates  Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]KMB=
 Express Player News  Derrick Mason , Active WR Updated 12/19/01 Mason miss=
ed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current status is day t=
o day.  Travis Henry , Reserve RB Updated 12/19/01 Henry will miss Sunday's=
 game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place.   M=
uhsin Muhammad , Reserve WR Updated 12/18/01 Muhammad is dealing with a sli=
ght case of turf toe, which caused him to miss practice on Monday. However,=
 Coach George Seifert expects his veteran wideout to start this weekend aga=
inst St. Louis.   Corey Dillon , Active RB Updated 12/18/01 Dillon's disloc=
ated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed=
 as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based o=
n this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong r=
ush defense.  Peyton Manning , Active QB Updated 12/16/01 Manning got back =
on track with 325 passing yards, three TDs and an interception against the =
Colts. He remains a must-start player in all Fantasy leagues.  Ike Hilliard=
 , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 Expect at least one TD catch from Hilliard th=
is week. The Giants should be able to exploit the holes in Arizona's second=
ary with regular strikes to Hilliard and Amani Toomer.  Shannon Sharpe , Re=
serve TE Updated 12/13/01 Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is exp=
ected to play Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and is listed as probable on t=
he injury report.   Jeff Graham , Reserve WR Updated 12/09/01 Graham caught=
 five passes for 110 yards and two TDs at Philadelphia, but he did not catc=
h a ball in the second half. The veteran wideout has been inconsistent all =
year long, yet he is still capable of having some big games.   J.J. Stokes =
, Active WR Updated 12/09/01 Stokes caught one pass for 15 yards at St. Lou=
is. Don't start Stokes during the Fantasy playoffs. He has been nearly usel=
ess for most of the season.  Duce Staley , Active RB Updated 12/09/01 The C=
hargers held Staley to 21 rushing yards on 15 carries, but he caught five p=
asses for 88 yards and a TD. The Eagles will find many ways to utilize Stal=
ey as the NFL regular season winds down.  Jets , Reserve DT Updated 12/03/0=
1 CB Aaron Glenn may miss up to four weeks with a sprained medial collatera=
l ligament in his right knee. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more=
 often to protect the secondary, but the unit may also allow more passing y=
ards in the next few games.  Chris Weinke , Reserve QB Updated 12/02/01 Wei=
nke had only 161 yards passing, but he did have two rushing touchdowns agai=
nst New Orleans. However, he's still not reliable as a Fantasy player.   Jo=
e Nedney , Active K Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunda=
y's game but is expected to play this week.   J.R. Redmond , Reserve RB Upd=
ated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and h=
ad one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy=
 leaguers.  Raiders , Active DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE T=
race Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendo=
n in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be pla=
ced on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roder=
ick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after =
sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sun=
day after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   John Kasay , Reser=
ve K Updated 08/13/01 Kasay, who is returning from a knee injury, made his =
comeback on Friday night. He converted on a 20-yard field goal, and seemed =
to have all the strength back in his leg. In fact, Kasay attempted a 60-yar=
der at the end of the game which had plenty of distance but sailed wide lef=
t. Now that he seems to be healthy, Kasay is worth considering come Draft D=
ay.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc. =
