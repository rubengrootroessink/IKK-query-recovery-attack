MAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 1=
2/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwin=
g elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is=
 expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's match=
up vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Upd=
ated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family il=
lness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, bu=
t he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/2=
9/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. H=
owever, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season.  =
 Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expe=
cted to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at=
 this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and =
may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place =
again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs,=

t San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will=
 likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - High Shrivel Factor Updated 12=
/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb inju=
ry. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Ag=
ent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Pa=
ckers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last=
 week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep i=
nto the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/0=
1 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acqui=
ring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterb=
ack, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move =
would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely =
be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - High Shri=
vel Factor Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Satu=
rday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien =

tarter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status=
 is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mil=
e Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   =

tus is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   M=
arTay Jenkins , WR ARI - High Shrivel Factor Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may m=
iss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jack=

L - Water Boys Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee =
injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot ove=
r rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time no=
w that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets =
in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 12/=
28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But hi=
s hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Mo=
ney Shots Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He i=
s still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter becau=
se he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - The R=
eplacements Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week=
. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Addison Red Cornholes =

day. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent =
Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. S=
antiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   =

 to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game a=
ction until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 12/28/=
01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expe=
cted to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal work=
load.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Barking Spiders Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (an=
kle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   =
Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Blue Star Boys Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practi=
ce on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.=
   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - CYSWC Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/kn=

odney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , =
RB ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a=
 calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - =
Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to pr=

rivel Factor Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't a=
ppear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full strength" criteria for starting ag=
ainst Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches d=
idn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participat=
e in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fu=
lly suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporte=
rs were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said =
Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. =
   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, =
sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for th=
e first time in a month. "Still questionable," coach Bill Cowher said. "He =
did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll ta=
ke it day to day."   Doug Brien , K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Brien =
signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wh=
o will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. =
Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Sain=
ts last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's ga=
