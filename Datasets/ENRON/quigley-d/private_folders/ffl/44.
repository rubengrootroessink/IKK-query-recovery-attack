MAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updat=
ed 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore thr=
owing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, an=
d is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's m=
atchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Up=
dated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family i=
llness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, b=
ut he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/=
29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. =
However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. =
  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is exp=
ected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start a=
t this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - K=
MB Express Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, an=
d may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his plac=
e again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Sprin=
gs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday aga=
inst San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time w=
ill likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 12/29/01 Bo=
uman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Sperg=
on Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updat=
ed 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in =
place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's l=
oss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the F=
antasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Accordi=
ng to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bled=
soe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it s=
eems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would cer=
tainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made u=
ntil sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - The Leather Cheeri=
os Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's g=
ame, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insur=
ance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. =
  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's sta=
tus is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but =
Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.=
   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman Updated 12/28/01 Wes=
tbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play th=
is week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins ma=
y miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold J=
ackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran  , WR=
 ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a kn=
ee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free =
Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot =
over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time=
 now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end se=
ts in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updated 12/28/01 G=
adsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamst=
ring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said =
Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still ex=
pected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will=
 be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Pierres Flea Ci=
rcus Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is=
 still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Leather Cheerios Updated =
12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He =
is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated =
12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago =
will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Br=
ookins  , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned=
 to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game a=
ction until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 1=
2/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is=
 expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal=
 workload.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Pumpdog Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle=
) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wes=
ley Walls , TE CAR - Cali Bound Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on T=
hursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maur=
ice Smith , RB ATL - Xtreme Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  w=
ill continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney =
Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL=
 - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. =
He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 HUEVOS Up=
dated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to sta=
rt this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took=
 a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full =
strength" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely=
 to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's =
practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, whe=
n players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of=
 the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more =
snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later i=
n the closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - 2700 HUEVOS U=
pdated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practi=
ce field Thursday for the first time in a month. "Still questionable," coac=
h Bill Cowher said. "He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and=
 go from there. We'll take it day to day."   Doug Brien , K TB - Free Agent=
 Updated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the =
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatic=
a can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-=
21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out=
 for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to ha=
ve a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.   More Updates  S=
