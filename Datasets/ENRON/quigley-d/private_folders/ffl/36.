 Parker's season is over. He will undergo surgery on his shoulder and the C=
hiefs are expected to place him on injured reserve.   Jeff Garcia , Active =
QB Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, playe=
d in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He =
played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garc=
ia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still b=
e a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Antowain Smith , Active RB Updated 12/23/01 S=
mith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has be=
en one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fant=
asy glory.   Corey Dillon , Active RB Updated 12/21/01 Dillon missed practi=
ce Thursday because of a finger injury but The Cincinnati Post reports that=
 he is expected to play Sunday. Even if healthy, Dillon is a risky start th=
is week against a tough Baltimore run defense. Consider benching him if you=
 have a backup of equal value.   Derrick Mason , Active WR Updated 12/21/01=
 Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury. L=
ook for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout.   Maurice Smith , Reserve RB U=
pdated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent =
weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Chris Chandler , =
Reserve QB Updated 12/20/01 Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder =
this week. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Michael Vick will not see =
action unless Chandler is injured.   Chad Lewis , Active TE Updated 12/17/0=
1 Lewis injured his groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Der=
rick Alexander , Reserve WR Updated 12/16/01 Alexander had four catches for=
 72 yards and a touchdown against Denver. He's been playing better in recen=
t weeks, but Alexander is still a risky play outside of deeper Fantasy leag=
ues.   Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 12/16/01 The Titans limited Free=
man to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is moving on in the playoffs, =
however, you can expect better numbers from Freeman in the weeks ahead.   D=
esmond Clark , Reserve TE Updated 12/14/01 Clark will continue to be a feat=
ured target for the Broncos during the Fantasy postseason. Denver is still =
coping with injury issues at wide receiver.  Darnay Scott , Active WR Updat=
ed 12/02/01 Scott caught four passes for 30 yards against Tampa Bay. Like a=
ll of the Cincinnati wideouts, he is not worth a Fantasy roster spot right =
now.  Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury =
in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   J.R. Redmond , Reserv=
e RB Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunda=
y, and had one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help=
 Fantasy leaguers.  Raiders , Active DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have l=
ost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achille=
s' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week an=
d be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, =
DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboy=
s after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable=
 for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Bills , Re=
serve DT Updated 09/30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game agai=
nst Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walke=
d off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his return is =
questionable.   Adam Vinatieri , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00 Vinatieri has b=
een one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent weeks, convert=
ing on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his chances aga=
inst the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggles like it=
 did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's elite kickers on =
your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]  Copyrigh=
