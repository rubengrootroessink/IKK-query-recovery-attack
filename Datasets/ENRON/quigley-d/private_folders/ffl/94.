46.0  NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News=
  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, wh=
o has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He did=
n't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zero=
n Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league,=
 dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel F=
actor Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played i=
n Monday night's 24-17 l! os! s to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 y=
ards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Water Boys Updated 11/27/01 Barl=
ow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. "I=
t's throbbing," Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. "I couldn't really slee=
p last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." Barlow is listed as=
 doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on res=
erve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Water Boys Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffere=
d a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle.=
 X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protective boot as a=
 precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he wi=
ll be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff=
 Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hypere=
xtended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Mond=
ay, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight =
end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR! G! B -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straig=
ht weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status =
for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy te=
am in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Davis=
, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out=
 what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his healt=
h, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut h=
im altogehter.   Jam! es! Stewart  , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/27=
/01 Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Gr=
een Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time p=
osting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the la=
ck of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Ch=
arlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit=
 Free Press, Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despi=
te a groin injury. "This is Charlie's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said=
. "He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the inj=
ury) treated...I would expect him close to full spe! ed! Wednesday." He'll =
likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is =
a risky proposition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01=
 Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. T=
he veteran tight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - T=
eam T-Bone Updated 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status =
for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if =
Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until lat=
er in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover=
 (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panther=
s are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans=
.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsi=
stent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke'! s ! job as Carolina's No. 1 quart=
erback is secure. "There've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very s=
uccessful that have gone through times like this," coach George Seifert tol=
d the Charlotte Observer. "Even though there are a number of these plays th=
at haven't turned out and there have been disruptions in his play, I think,=
 ultimately, it will be more beneficial than not." While he may be the star=
ting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fant=
asy leagues.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/27=
/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstr=
ing injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. Ho=
wever, he is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. "I'll be ther=
e," Sanders told the Arizona Republic. "They're just real sore from doing a=
 lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear." In any event, keeping =
Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough Oakland secondar=
y.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was=
 supposed to begin some light running last week, but he ended up doing noth=
ing of the sort. "He hasn't made a lot of progress," coach Dave McGinnis to=
ld the Arizona Republic. "We're going to come to a point where we're going =
to ha! ve! to make a decision." Moore, who has missed the entire season due=
 to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve list this week.   Olandi=
s Gary , RB DEN - Team T-Bone Updated 11/26/01 The Broncos placed Gary on i=
njured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This =
officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Dro=
p him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Upd=
ated 11/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the secon=
d half of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did n=
ot throw a touchdown pass for the first time this season, however, and has =
been very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues =
to struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week =
12.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear who=
 will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Batc=
h is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. M=
ike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go, =
but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears seco=
ndary. We don't recommend an! y ! of the three for Week 12.  Quincy Carter =
, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Ca=
rter will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's=
 game against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for D=
allas, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don'=
t recommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Team =
T-Bone Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota =
with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit.=
 Keep an eye on his progress during practice this week before you make a fi=
nal decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Update=
d 11/26/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hams=
tring problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game aga=
inst San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on =
him for Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 11/26/01 Graham =
suffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is=
 day to day.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/26/0=
1 Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore wi=
ll elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Aya=
nbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Water Boys Updated 11/26/01 Ba=
rlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not =
been determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated 11/26/01=
 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is da=
y to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/26/01 Warrick=
 is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was=
 taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinna=
ti's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , ! QB! CIN - Addison Red Cornh=
oles Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals desp=
ite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ine=
ffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the ga=
me. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now. =
 Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caug=
ht six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the l=
evel of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down=
 the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , =
RB JAC - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and =
two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his=
 good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Q=
adry Ismail , WR BAL - South Park Cows Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Is=
mail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performan=
ce, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of t=
he most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  More Updates  [IMAGE=
