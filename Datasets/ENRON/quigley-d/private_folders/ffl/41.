I'm going to try to do some things tomorrow and hope it loosens up and not =
have as much pain as I had today," McNair said.   "I'm not going to go out =
and try to force the issue. If it's still sore and still tight where I can'=

ut Wednesday's practice, and indicated he might not play in the regular sea=
son's final two games. "You want to take care of the injury first and if th=
at means not playing, that means not playing," Bettis told the Pittsburgh P=
ost-Gazette . "But you want to make sure you're healed up. The team playing=
 as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to get healthy. I'm usi=
ng it very, very wisely."   Martin Gramatica , K TB - The Leather Cheerios =
Updated 12/27/01 Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to t=
est his injured leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wed=
nesday for the Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kic=
k against the Baltimore Ravens this week.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free=
 Agent Updated 12/26/01 Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasse=
lbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play.    Coach =

e's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants las=
t Sunday.   "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emer=
gency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said.    More Updates=
