ws  Terry Allen , RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 12/20/01 Allen is ready=
 to assume a larger workload, says the Baltimore Sun. He may start against =
the Bengals this week. "I expect to see more time but I'm still not 100 per=
cent," Allen said. "My hand is going to bother me but I need to be out ther=
e on the field to help this team."  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - South Park Cows =
Updated 12/20/01 Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime so=
on, Brian Billick told the Baltimore Sun. "He's my quarterback now, he's go=
ing to be my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the y=
ear after that," Billick said. "The only thing that would change that is if=
 he chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury."   Ch=
ris Chandler , QB ATL - CYSWC Updated 12/20/01 Chandler won't have too look=
 over his shoulder this week. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Michael=
 Vick will not see action unless Chandler is injured.   MarTay Jenkins  , W=
R ARI - High Shrivel Factor Updated 12/20/01 Jenkins (ankle) did not practi=
ce on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game.   Ricky Wa=
tters , RB SEA - The Replacements Updated 12/19/01 Watters has placed on in=
jured reserve. He will not play again this season. Shaun Alexander will be =
the starter for Seattle's final three games.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Blue=
 Star Boys Updated 12/19/01 Griese should be able to return from a concussi=
on after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB.   Joe Jur=
evicius , WR NYG - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 12/19/01 Jurevicius (hamstrin=
g) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a dee=
p ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary.   Travis Henry , RB BU=
F - Barking Spiders Updated 12/19/01 Henry will miss Sunday's game with a s=
prained right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place.   Tim Dwight , WR=
 SD - Water Boys Updated 12/19/01 Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to=
 play this week. He has not produced very much this year when healthy.  Tyr=
one Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 12/19/01 Wheatley, who was not u=
sed last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will pro=
bably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams.   Derrick Ma=
son  , WR TEN - CYSWC Updated 12/19/01 Mason missed Tuesday's practice with=
 a hip flexor injury. His current status is day to day.  Steve McNair , QB =
TEN - Money Shots Updated 12/19/01 McNair (back stiffness) missed practice =
on Tuesday. His current status is day to day.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 12/19/01 Sanders has returned to practice from a back inju=
ry. He is not expected to play this week.   Tony Richardson , RB KC - South=
 Park Cows Updated 12/19/01 Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury=
. He is expected to play on Sunday.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demo=
n Horde Updated 12/19/01 Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained =
hamstring. He is expected to play on Saturday.  Bill Gramatica , K ARI - Mo=
ney Shots Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. =
Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three gam=
es of the season.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Zer=
eoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder.  He mi=
ght start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gained 7=
3 yards Sunday.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 1=
2/19/01 The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more=
 week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sund=
ay against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a =
groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come =
back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's =
playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His healt=
h status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely s=
tart for Bettis.  Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Titans =
Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work ov=
er the final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennesse=
an . "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Ski=
p, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also wan=
t to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's=
 production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.  Steve Mc=
Nair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 12/18/01 McNair will miss Tuesday's pra=
ctice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's=
 game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to rep=
air a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday=
. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for=
 Week 15.  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Zereoue re-i=
njured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His s=
tatus for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a ma=
rginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.  Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Free Agen=
t Updated 12/18/01 The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured rese=
rve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese w=
ill probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson se=
rving as his backup.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated 12/18/0=
1 According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remainder=
 of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter=
 during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel Whit=
e, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the=
 way if Jackson is out.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - CYSWC Updated 12/18/01 Dil=
lon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. =
He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve=
 him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Rave=
ns' strong rush defense.  Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/1=
8/01 Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna=
's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mit=
chell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth startin=
g in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.  Akili Smith  , QB CIN=
 - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve =
with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will like=
ly need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. =
Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's h=
ealthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the y=
ear anyway.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 12/18/01 The R=
avens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati afte=
r Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries f=
or 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he r=
ecovered from a ! ha! nd injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a=
 Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Wa=
ter Boys Updated 12/18/01 Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that h=
e plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew B=
rees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in =
the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during th=
e Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in =
favor of Brees at any time.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Lake Austin Mighty Mul=
lets Updated 12/18/01 Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possi=
bly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable f=
or Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his st=
atus before you consider using him this week.  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free=
 Agent Updated 12/18/01 Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup=
 this week against Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determi=
ne his true status for the game.   More Updates  Teams, Player News  [IMAGE=
]CYSWC Player News  Chris Chandler , Reserve QB Updated 12/20/01 Chandler w=
on't have too look over his shoulder this week. The Atlanta Journal-Constit=
ution says Michael Vick will not see action unless Chandler is injured.   D=
errick Mason , Active WR Updated 12/19/01 Mason missed Tuesday's practice w=
ith a hip flexor injury. His current status is day to day.  Corey Dillon , =
Active RB Updated 12/18/01 Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he =
should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game ag=
ainst Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider =
benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.  Jeff Garcia , Activ=
e QB Updated 12/17/01 Garcia has sprained cartilage in his ribcage, but he =
shouldn't miss his next start for the San Francisco 49ers. X-rays revealed =
no broken bones. Monday, coach Steve Mariucci said Garcia might miss some p=
ractice before Saturday's game against Philadelphia, but he expects the qua=
rterback to play.   Chad Lewis , Active TE Updated 12/17/01 Lewis injured h=
is groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Derrick Alexander , =
Reserve WR Updated 12/16/01 Alexander had four catches for 72 yards and a t=
ouchdown against Denver. He's been playing better in recent weeks, but Alex=
ander is still a risky play outside of deeper Fantasy leagues.   Antonio Fr=
eeman , Active WR Updated 12/16/01 The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards o=
n two catches. If your team is moving on in the playoffs, however, you can =
expect better numbers from Freeman in the weeks ahead.   Desmond Clark , Re=
serve TE Updated 12/14/01 Clark will continue to be a featured target for t=
he Broncos during the Fantasy postseason. Denver is still coping with injur=
y issues at wide receiver.  Maurice Smith , Reserve RB Updated 12/14/01 The=
 Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Smith's ailing knee has continued to imp=
rove, but Bob Christian may get the bulk of the team's carries on Sunday.  =
Larry Parker , Reserve WR Updated 12/10/01 Parker suffered a bruised right =
shoulder in Sunday's game against Oakland. His current status is day to day=
.  Antowain Smith , Active RB Updated 12/09/01 Smith rushed for 76 yards an=
d two TDs on 21 carries against Cleveland. He has always been a great red-z=
one runner, so expect a lot of scores from Smith during the Fantasy playoff=
s even if his yardage totals disappoint you at times.  Darnay Scott , Activ=
e WR Updated 12/02/01 Scott caught four passes for 30 yards against Tampa B=
ay. Like all of the Cincinnati wideouts, he is not worth a Fantasy roster s=
pot right now.  Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a ne=
ck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   J.R. Redmon=
d , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injur=
y on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing ti=
me to help Fantasy leaguers.  Raiders , Active DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raid=
ers have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore h=
is Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery th=
is week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In ot=
her news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dal=
las Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is qu=
estionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   =
Bills , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's=
 game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury=
. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his =
return is questionable.   Adam Vinatieri , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00 Vinat=
ieri has been one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent week=
s, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his c=
hances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggl=
es like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's elite k=
ickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]=
