 has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Chris Fu=
amatu-Ma'afala will start in his place.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounde=
d Ducks Updated 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report wi=
th a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game agains=
t Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback=
, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN =
- She Said Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due =
to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against=
 Cleveland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agen=
t Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game agai=
nst Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fan=
tasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel =
(knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too ris=
ky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad=
 , WR CAR - KMB Express Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play =
this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely star=
t in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 12/29/01 C=
B Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start =
on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his p=
laying time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Pumpdog Update=
d 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb =
injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Fre=
e Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Ba=
y Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of =
last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this de=
ep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/=
29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in a=
cquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quar=
terback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The m=
ove would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would lik=
ely be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - The L=
eather Cheerios Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for=
 Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug B=
rien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fant=
asy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 12/28/=
01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play th=
is week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in =
recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman Updated=
 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expect=
ed to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/=
01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this w=
eek. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian F=
inneran  , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as proba=
ble with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , =
TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 ti=
ght end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of=
 playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double=
 tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updat=
ed 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. =
But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TE=
N - She Said Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. H=
e is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter be=
cause he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Pi=
erres Flea Circus Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time thi=
