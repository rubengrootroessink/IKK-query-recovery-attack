29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing =
elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is e=
xpected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup=
 vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updat=
ed 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illn=

he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/=

t Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Pack=

According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiri=
ng Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterbac=
k, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move wo=

 made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - High Shrive=
l Factor Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturd=
ay's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as=
 insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy sta=

n would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran  , WR ATL =
- Water Boys Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee in=
jury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent=
 Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over =
rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now =
that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in=
 the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 12/28=

hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Mone=
