Honey, I have talked to maritza and she will come clean Thursday
Also - if you could follow up on the insurance claim I filed for the tree info is:
Allstate's South TX claim office ph#1-888-250-6605
The claim number is 8202536549 filed 8/31 on our homeowner's policy#216939226
I don't think they assigned an adjustor yet - they said someone from that claims
office would call us..
