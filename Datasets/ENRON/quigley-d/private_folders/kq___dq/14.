Thursday evening
 
Hi Sissy,
 
When do you guys leave for Vegas and who will  babysit Rex? Wish I was there to watch him for you and start cooking for  Thanksgiving. 
Dad flew in this morning and we are busy in the  office here at home. He finally has purchase orders coming in from Mobil - yeh!!  We sent in over 1/2 million in quotations and got purchase orders for over  100.000.00 this morning. Looks like things are finally going to pay off for all  of Dad's hard work. They also leased a big vessel to Texaco yesterday! Horray  for him!
Have a great trip an write when you get back and  tell me all about the money you won!!??!!
Lots of love and hugs - Mom and  Dad
