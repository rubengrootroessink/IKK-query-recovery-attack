Good morning to my sweet honey..
Hope your day goes well...I really hope
that I did not come across as insensitive in our 
discussion to try to get the townhouse back in the
event we get a contract on our lot, I just want what is best
given the levels of stress we deal with day in and day out
So- I would like to talk further about it- because if it makes sense
to try and keep going on that new construction then maybe we should- I guess we would
have "down time" while it was being built... just hope the lead on our
lot comes through.
love you 
k-kay
