Kay,

Thank you for the revised contract.  I would like to say that it was a
pleasure meeting you, and I have enjoyed our discussions on the telphone.

I would like to take this opportunity to be upfront with you.  Kelsey's
corporate philosophy is to adopt a customer-driven focus.  So when Kelsey is
a customer, our strong preference is to deal with companies that demonstrate
a customer-driven focus in negotiations -- our experience has been that
companies that demonstrate this focus in negotiations also demonstrate this
focus in service.

However, we have strong reservations that Enron does not take concerns of
potential customers seriously.  This concern manifested itself at our
meeting and, given the paucity of approved changes in the contract, has been
heightened.

Thus, we have made the decision that Kelsey should obtain its energy from a
non-Enron source.  I would like to emphasize that the decision is no
reflection on you; in fact, prior to our meeting, you had very nearly
convinced us that Kelsey should use Enron.

Good luck with your other customers.  Having met you, I know that you will
be successful in all of you endeavors.  If you wish to discuss this further,
please do not hesitate to call.

Nicholas Ro
Vice President &
Chief Compliance Officer
