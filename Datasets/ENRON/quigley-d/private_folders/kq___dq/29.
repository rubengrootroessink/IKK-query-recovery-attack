Wednesday morning
 
Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
Sounds like you had a great time in New Orleans.  I'm glad that you are both spending lots of time together. The package was late  because of all the security at the airports and sounds like you got a taste of  that!
Why is Enron still on a downhill slide? I thought  that when Ken took over again you would see an improvement immediately. What is  the forcast for this last quarter? I know all of you are sick about the stock  prices.
You can call me on Friday - just e-mail me the time  and I will be sure to be at the office. The number is 053-256-098. Remember we  are 7 hours ahead now.
Lots of love and hugs - Mom and  Dad
