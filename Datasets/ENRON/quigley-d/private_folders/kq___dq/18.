Tuesday evening
 
Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
Congratulations on your new puppy "Rex"!!!
It is always fun to come home to someone who is 
sooooooooooo happy to see you. I have really enjoyed 
having Molly since Dad is traveling so much. In fact he left today to fly  to Port Harcourt and won't return until Friday afternoon. 
I am so glad to know that you sound so happy and things are finally getting  back to normal all around. What will happen to your stock now or do you know  yet?
Any news of Laura - please tell her I am thinking alot about her!
Have a super, super time in Vegas and put a quarter in a slot for me!
Lots of love and hugs - Mom and Dad
