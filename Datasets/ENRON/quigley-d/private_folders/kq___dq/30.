Hey Family!

This year I am going to do something I have never done before...start
shopping early.  In order to do that, I need to know what everyone would
like for Christmas.  Please do not reply back and tell me you don't need
anything, because I know there is something out there that you would like.
Please e-mail or give me a call soon so I can get started!

                                Love, Heather

P.S. Also let me know what your spouses would like too.
