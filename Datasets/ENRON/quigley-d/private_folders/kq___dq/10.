Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
 
Hope you had a great trip to Vegas and have a 
really Happy Turkey Week.
I envy all of you being together at A.Mattie's. 
Please tell brother to drop me an email. It's been weeks and weeks since  I've heard from them.
Give Dina a hug from us for Thanksgiving!
Lots of love and hugs - Mom and Dad
