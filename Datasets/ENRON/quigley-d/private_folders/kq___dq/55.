Kay,

Thanks a ton for the card, smell-good pencils, and book for Jackie - she's
at Michelle's tonight but I'll see her over the weekend.  She's in much
better spirits these days but her blood counts are still very low - keeping
her un-infected and out of the hospital is our main goal at this point -
she's still not allowed to go out in public or see non-family memebers.  A
key date occurs in about 1 month - they'll check her bone marrow again and
actually it's an extremely critical date - if no cancer then we can have a
small celebration - but she's still got a good 2 years to go before we can
breath easier.

Robert
