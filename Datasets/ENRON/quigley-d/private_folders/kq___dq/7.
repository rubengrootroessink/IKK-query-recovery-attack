Hola Amigos!
Just a reminder that Thursday night is the night to
come by the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft's
Young Friends' kick off party! I am attaching the
invitation with all the details. RSVP's are great, but
if you don't, you can definitely still come as there
will be plenty of food and wine!
See you there!
Liz
