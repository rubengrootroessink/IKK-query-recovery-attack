The gas message board should be up and runnig already per Fundies.  Only UBS people are on it now. 

Also Jason McNair is suppose to come and speak with you about the Win Zip of your files on O drive.  If he hasn't come by the time you have left, then email him and it will go directly to his pager.

Thanks!
Ina
