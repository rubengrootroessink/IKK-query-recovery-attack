long live ernie! long live ernie! ernie for mayor!  i agree with
everything except the fact that i think we would bury you earlier
on, probably at the turn at hole number 10 (especially if there
isn't any brock-dog-like sausages available at the course).  i
think it will be great, and don't forget that no one ever had any
problems driving to willis to play golf at texas national before.
quit your whinning and play golf, in my case i'll just hack at
golf balls.
