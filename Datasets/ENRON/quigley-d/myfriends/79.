ST. MARTINVILLE, La. -- Former Dallas Cowboys star Nate Newton was
arrested when police confiscated 213 pounds of marijuana from a
van on a highway.

Newton and two others were charged Sunday with possession with
intent to distribute marijuana, Trooper Willie Williams said
Tuesday. A fourth person, arrested in a separate vehicle with
$18,000, was charged with conspiracy to possess narcotics.

All four were in the St. Martin Parish Jail on Tuesday with bail
set at $200,000 each.

Newton is a six-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman who helped Dallas
win three Super Bowls. He spent 14 seasons in the NFL, 13 with
Dallas. He retired last year after a season with Carolina.

Williams said a state police patrol pulled over a van for a
traffic violation on Sunday about 6 a.m. east of Lafayette.

"The driver seemed nervous and gave consent to search the van,"
Williams said. He did not say who was driving.

Cardboard boxes filled with 213 pounds of marijuana were in the
van, Williams said.

Newton, who lives in East Ellijay, Ga., was arrested along with
Faye Cleveland, 46, and Marva Johnson Waye, 49, both of
Jacksonville, Fla. All three were charged with possession with
intent to distribute marijuana.

The driver of a pickup truck, Ricky Glenn Williams, 46, of
Quinlan, Texas, was charged with conspiracy to possess narcotics,
police said. The $18,000 that was in the truck with him was
seized, the trooper said.
