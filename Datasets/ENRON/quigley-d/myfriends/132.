>I'm glad someone else is starting to see what I've had to put up
with all of these years.  You should have heard his response as to
why he couldn't pay the rent or the phone bill or go grocery
shopping for the month.  Oh wait a minute that was Rob, not
Jerry.  I always get the two mixed up.  Once again I will
ask.....Jerry are you going to go golfing manana?
