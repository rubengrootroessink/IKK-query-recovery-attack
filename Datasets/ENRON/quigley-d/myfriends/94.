Who picked up seven players already?  Their team must really suck!!!  Has anyone looked at the power rankings lately?  I will save you the time...The Hillrods are #1.

This man's managing skills are about as good as his knowledge of the so called 'baseball etiquette'.  I think he should start Kim Saturday & Sunday.

Remember that you have a limited number of transactions (Add/Drops) for the year to make.  This does not include trades.  There is not a limit to the amount of trades you can make.  Since I managed to screw this up already, the limit will be increased from 7 to 8.  Use them wisely...
