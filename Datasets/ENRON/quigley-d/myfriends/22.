OK folks, 
Here's the scoop on Drallion Tickets. 
- In order to give the momma to be enough time to recover (she is due on the 11th), I began my search for shows beginning on Jan 13th.  2 days should be enough time right?  I'm kidding, I actually began searching for shows on Jan 25th (Friday) 
- Searching for tix on line it appears that Friday and Saturday tix would be hard to get for a big group.  I have contacted group sales to see if they have anything available. 
- There are weekday shows that we may want to consider.  There are still plenty of good seats for some of the weekday shows (even for a large group).  Unfortunately, the maximum number of tix I can get through direct online is 12.  I may ask the group sales rep about possibly getting more. 
- Showtimes that are convenient for us (it would be pretty hard to get us all downtown at 5:00 on a weekday): 
Tuesday and Wednesdays - 8:00pm 
Thursday and Friday - 9:00 pm 
Saturday - 4:00 or 8:00pm 
A Thursday show may be best in that we can meet for dinner before the show. 
- Now here is the fun part.... Good seats are $60.  These are tix located directly in front of the stage.  The cheapest seats (limited view) are $40. 
Please let me know if you are still in and if you have any preference on seat location ($) and date (day). 
Please reply ASAP so that I can order these tix.
