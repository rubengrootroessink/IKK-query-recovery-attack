I received the following information from Have a Nice Day Cafe about
the free Happy Hour on Friday.  Feel free to forward this info or
invite your friends.  Let me know if you and anyone else plan on
attending by Thursday so I can let them know how many to expect from
my party.  If you plan on attending, just remember to say my name at
the front door to get in.
Thanks,
Brian
