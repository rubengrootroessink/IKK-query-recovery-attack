those power rankings are as reliable as the college bcs system.
unlike the bcs system we have a playoff system,  of which you will
most likely not be part of.  but hey, you're the highest scoring
team in the league or something.  remember kids, we will be having
our own little indian visitor sometime in the next two weeks.
that is if they actually let jit in the country.  he also
mentioned some time ago that he's become a scratch golfer.

>Remember that you have a limited number of transactions
(Add/Drops) for the year to make.  This does not include trades.
There is not a limit to the amount of trades you can make.  Since
I managed to screw this up already, the limit will be increased
from 7 to 8.  Use them wisely...
