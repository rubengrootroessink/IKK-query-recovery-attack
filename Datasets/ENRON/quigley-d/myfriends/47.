Whether you spend it with family, or with friends, or with the hookers on
Hillcroft, here's hoping that each one of you have a safe and happy
Thanksgiving.  If your Thanksgiving plans have you traveling (damn, I wish I
was going to Vegas!!!!), have a pleasant trip and stay away from those Vegas
"massage" parlors.  I'm also going to go out on a limb here and predict that
Ryan Leaf will NOT be getting any of John Maddens' 6 turkey legs.
