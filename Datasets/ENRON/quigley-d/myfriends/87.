Yo papa,

The casino cake is basically a rasberry lovers cake...the decorative rings
are a thin layer of biscuit (cake) with raspberry jam on it..then it is
rolled up and sliced thin to get those little circular designs.  You line a
pan with those rings, then fill the pan partially with bavarian creme
(vanilla flavored cream), a layer of rasperry, then more cream, then a layer
of sponge cake....it is interesting...my top pic is our chocolate  pistachio
and the cheesecake which needs to be added to the album.

I am glad to hear that you had a nice weekend.  I'm starting to realize that
its not enough to want things to work out a certain way.  Intentions are
good but actions are critical.  Things just don't happen magically on their
own.

Heard natty puked today, hope you were on the right side of that.  I'll talk
to you later.
Mo
