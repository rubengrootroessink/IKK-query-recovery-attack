...get yourself signed up for the H-Town Slaps office pool.

All right folks, this is the last note I'm sending about this stuff.
The word is out...the league is active with people joining every day.
 Week 1 is finally here so get your picks in after you sign up.  You
can make adjustments to your picks until one hour before the first
game.  If you misplaced the first email I sent (shame on you!), here
is the link that you need to get started....

http://football217.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/join?league=slaplist&

Once you get to the Join League Page, you will be asked to
enter a password.  The password for this league is:  kingme10

On the Join League page, select your name from the drop-down list.
If you don't see your name, select "New Player" and click Submit.

Thanks to all the good folks who have already signed up (and paid the
entry fee! ($100)).  If you know people who may be interested in
joining, please let them know.  If you are not interested in playing,
ignore this message and have a nice day.

Questions?  Send me an email...

OUT.
