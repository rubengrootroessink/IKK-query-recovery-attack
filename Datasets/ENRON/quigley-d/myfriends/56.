How many players do we have for Sunday?  I have  
Mark "I score a lot but never win" 
Joe "Expansion Team" 
Richard "I have the cutest baby" 
Dutch "I will soon be working for Dynegy" 
Ricardo "I'll name my UHFFFFL Team after all my sexual conquests........ how about 2700 Huevos?" 
Kevin "How can you tell when Kevin is bitching?  Answer:  His mouth is open" 
and Me 
Did I forget someone?  If I didn't, then we have 7.  Is Jerry going to play?  How about John?  I think I might be able to beat John now that he is still in rehab.  Scratch that, who am I kidding? 
Who will be number eight?
