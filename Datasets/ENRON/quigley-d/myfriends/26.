Many people are concerned with the state of Chris Simms confidence going in=
to next season now that he has been benched for the bowl game.  There is no=
 reason for panic as the scenario shall play out like this.  The Longhorns =
and Huskies will be tied at 28 late in the fourth quarter of the Holiday Bo=
wl.  Applewhite will lead the Horns on a miraculous 50-yd drive down to the=
 Washington 30-yd line with only 10 sec left on the clock.  Between plays A=
pplewhite will look over at the Golden Boy standing on the sideline and rec=
ognize that the time is now for Simms to fulfill his Destiny.  As the Star =
Wars music plays in the background, Applewhite will lead the Horns up to th=
e line of scrimmage.  In Obi-Wan Kenobi-to-Darth Vader fashion, Major will =
look across the line at the Huskies defense and say,"Strike me down and I s=
hall become more powerful than you could ever imagine."  As the ball is sna=
pped, Major drops back in the pocket and then stands motionless, allowing t=
he Huskies linebackers to pummel him.  Simms screams, "NO!!!" as Major lies=
 motionless on the field.  Major is carted off the field with numerous brok=
en bones while the Golden Boy takes his warm-up tosses on the sideline.  Th=
e clock sits at 4 seconds remaining as Simms trots onto the field.  Only en=
ough time for one try at the endzone.  Simms walks to the line, takes the s=
nap and begins to look over the field.  As Simms prepares to unload a blazi=
ng bullet pass right into the hands of a Washington safety, he hears Major'=
s voice in his mind, "Use the force Chris, read the field".  The Golden Boy=
 brings his throwing arm down, the Star Wars music plays once again, and Ch=
ris looks over the entire field for the first time since playing the School=
 for the Blind back in Jersey.  Simms spots Roy Williams wide open, closes =
his eyes, and fires a 30 yd touchdown pass for the victory.  And hence the =
legend of the Golden Boy is alive and well.

Stay tuned for the next episode as Chris learns that his father is not ex-p=
layer/broadcaster Phil Simms, but is actually broadcaster Dennis Miller
