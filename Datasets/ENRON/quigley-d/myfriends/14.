This crap is worse than the frickin BSC.  It's nice to see that Ernie represented our division in the first round of the playoffs.  Way to go jackass!  I of course would have lost in the first round also, but at least I would have scored a legit amount of points.  Once again the flee circus is winning with smoke and mirrors.  His last three week's scores don't even add up to 100 and he won all three.  He must be cheating.  I would also like to congratulate the Lions, I mean Extreme for its one win season.

This is a perfect example of why we cant change the rule about wild cards. I
 f Mark were to have his way he would have gotten the wild card even thoughs
 omeone had a better record.  So I say screw any changes and obviously thes
 ystem works.

P.S.  Mark that really sucks to score the most points and not make the
playoffs.
