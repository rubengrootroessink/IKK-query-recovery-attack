Don't know what Mr. Hillrod is smoking, but last I checked (yesterday),
Richard had already won.

How bad is Richard Blues that he can't score two damn points last night to
beat Cheerio Man?  Thanks for nothing jerk.  On a lighter note...John won,
John won, John won.  Kevin, thank you for taking out the 2700 club, while I
returned the favor by bitch slapping the KMB Express.
