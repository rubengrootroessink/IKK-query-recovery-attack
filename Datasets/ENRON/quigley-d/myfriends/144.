Hey guys,

I pulled these email addresses of my contact list and have no idea if any of
them are still valid.  I just wanted to let you all know I have a new email
address (david_r_peterson@yahoo.com).

Hope everything's going well.  I have to keep this short, since I have
another 50 emails to write.  Give me a call if you're ever up Dallas way
(214) 403-7229.

Dave.
