vodka for kevin and myself.  what about the ladies?  kay mentioned
some carribean punch stuff.  does anyone know how to make it?

>Revised tailgating for Texas game.  Our grass spot is by Cougar
Den/Place (whatever the hell it is called).  If you are walking
toward the side of the stadium by our seats, you can't miss it.
We will have a red canopy.  Plan on getting there around 4pm.
Call if you have any questions.
