Being that our commish is off in Vegas gambling off our league fees and I do not know whether he is going to view any transaction requests this weekend, I am letting you guys (and gal) know that I have put in a request to pick up Olandis Gary and Drop Tony Richardson from my lineup.  If the transaction goes through, I wish to start Gary and Hambrick and RB this week.  If the transaction does not go through, then my lineup remains as posted on the league website (Hambrick and James Stewart).  I'm hurting at RB this week.  Anyone interested in a trade (I need a RB)?
