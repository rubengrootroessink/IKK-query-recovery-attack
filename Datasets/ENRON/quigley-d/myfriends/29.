Doing alright.  Kendal is working downtown for a Management Consulting firm.
I'm still working for the same marketing, where I am head of the IT
division.

We bought a house in Memorial last year, and are still in the process of
renovating it.  It didn't need a lot, but we are taking our time getting the
way we want it. When I say "we" I mean Kendal.  I learned that my opinion
didn't matter after a few weeks of buying the place. :)

I saw Dave Peterson a while back.  We talked about having a Sammy get
together this spring.  Maybe a long weekend at Padre or Cancun.  I get great
Travel benefits and can get condos at resorts for $200/ wk.  I might also be
able to get enough free airline tickets to take care of you and Howard (the
three musketeers).  Let me know if you would be interested.

Let me know you have some free time after the holidays and we can hook up.

Hey Bro,

My wife worked here also and has been let go.
I work for the Natural Gas Trading group that they are trying to sell.
Should know by the end of the week about my job.
I was just talking to Kevin Crawford about you 2 weeks ago when we were in
Vegas.
Good to know that you are still out there.
How are you doing these days ?

Dutch

   I thought about you when I heard about Enron.  Were you affected? Give
   me a
   call and we can meet up sometime.
