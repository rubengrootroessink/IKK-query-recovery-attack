well, sunday is good for me.  and i think that is probably
everyone's best day.  i really have no preference as to where.
kevin, i owe you a round of golf for all your whinning, plus i
need to take care of my little whore and show her some love (that
be you crawford).  i would not mind a different course other than
brock.
