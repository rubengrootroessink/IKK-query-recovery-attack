I looked up 'pansy ass bitch' in Webster's and I was surprised to see a reference to Ricky Mihali.  We had people play last night that could barely run, yet you can't show up or even try to get yourself a sub because of a little 'pussy elbow'.  Maybe if you saw how Ernie's entire hamstring turned purple after he severely strained it last week you would feel bad about not playing.  He showed up and hobbled around the field for us.  I can't walk without pain in my knee, but I showed up.  I had to catch and bat left handed cuz I couldn't put any weight on it, but I showed up. Hell, John probably would have tried to play if he thought it would help the team.  I'm not going to talk to you for a few days...maybe three.  You are lucky we dragged dutch out of retirement last night.  Thanks again for playing last night Dutch.  Nice 3 wood shots!!!!!!!
