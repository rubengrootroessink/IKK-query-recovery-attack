Hook us up Ernie.  I would say that we should cap it at around $40, but  obviously $33 would be better.  I agree that $33 would not be a good price to walk.

Are you sure?  I just called.  Rate for Sunday morning is $33.  However, Id
 id not ask if that was riding or not.  I always assume it means riding butt
 hat's because I can't believe anyone would actually want to walk.
They do have tee times available in the morning.

Who is going to be playing?  Is there a max $ amount that we want to spend?
How many tee times do I need to get?  Is there a certain area in Houston that
we want to target?  The reason I ask is that I am on the CityGuide (AOL) golf
site which has about 90 golf locations listed (including Celebration
Station).  Shall I look around?
