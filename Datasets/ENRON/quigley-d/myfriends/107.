hey culo. well, i looked up "fag" on websters and it had a picture
of you sucking jerry's balls you homo.  i informed you guys that i
needed to rest my elbow and would not be able to play softball
last week.  that was plenty of time, it wasn't like i bailed out
at the last minute you pillow biter.  if i cannot even hold a
pencil when my tendinitis acts up then i really do not want to
take a chance with it, so deal with it.  even so, i called kevin
after i heard your message (but inadvertently erased it) and told
him i would play if the games were late and you really needed me.
never mind the fact that i had a ton of work to do and i was up
until 3:00 am doing that work; yet i still said that i would go
out there. i applaud you for batting left-handed, since it
couldn't have been any worse than you batting right-handed. as far
as not speaking to me for three days why not make it more?  it
really doesn't bother me.  if you're going to insult me at least
know how to spell my name mr moolknar it's spelled m-i-h-a-l-y.

sincerely (except for maurc mohhlknaur),

ricardo

>I looked up 'pansy ass bitch' in Webster's and I was surprised to
see a reference to Ricky Mihali.  We had people play last night
that could barely run, yet you can't show up or even try to get
yourself a sub because of a little 'pussy elbow'.  Maybe if you
saw how Ernie's entire hamstring turned purple after he severely
strained it last week you would feel bad about not playing.  He
showed up and hobbled around the field for us.  I can't walk
without pain in my knee, but I showed up.  I had to catch and bat
left handed cuz I couldn't put any weight on it, but I showed up.
Hell, John probably would have tried to play if he thought it
would help the team.  I'm not going to talk to you for a few
days...maybe three.  You are lucky we dragged dutch out of
retirement last night.  Thanks again for playing last night
Dutch.  Nice 3 wood shots!!!!!!!
