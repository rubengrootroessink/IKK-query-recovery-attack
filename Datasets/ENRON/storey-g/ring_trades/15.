Sounds like you have been cleaning up aeco credit between Reliant and Sempra.....  If you are in charge of reducing our credit exposure this is being proposed by Morgan and J. Aron....  Can you let me know what is happening......

Chris and Mark, 
As we discussed, I've itemized below a series of AECO basis trades that will help us to flatten out exposures. 
I'll get a conference call going after the close.    Let me know if there are any problems with this. 
Thanks, 
Peter 
  
  
All these trades are CGPR USD AECO vs Last Day Nymex basis.
