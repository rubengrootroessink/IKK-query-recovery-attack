Here is the credit ring we would like to do:

ENA buys from Sempra Cal02 Nymex swap @ ATM + $2
ENA sells to NY Bank Cal02 Nymex swap @ ATM + $2
NY Bank sells to Sempra Cal02 Nymex swap @ ATM + $2

We can then do an opposite ring of ATM trades to keep counterparty position=
s flat.
ENA release margin to Sempra. Sempra posts margin to NY bank based on their=
 ISDA contractual rights. NY Bank's Enron credit exposure is replaced with =
Sempra.

All the trades would fall within our existing ISDAs. Our lawyers have added=
 some language for the confirms that would tie the first ring of trades tog=
ether. That language is included below. If you have any legal questions fee=
l free to call our lawyer Mark Taylor at 713-853-7459.

If you have any questions feel free to call me at 713-853-7058.
