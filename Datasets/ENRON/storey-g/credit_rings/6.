Jerry,

Here would be the prosed trade:


For example:

Counterparty buys from Enron=09jan02-dec02 nymex swap 350 contracts/mo @ cu=
rrent market + $2
Enron buys from TXU  =09=09jan02-dec02 nymex swap 350contracts/mo @ current=
 market + $2
TXU buys from Counterparty  =09jan02-dec02 nymex swap 350 contracts/mo @ cu=
rrent market + $2

There will be no net position change for anyone. It lowers TXU's and the Co=
unterparty's open positions and VAR with Enron. It will also replace the Co=
unterparty's Enron credit exposure with TXU.

Enron releases TXU margin and TXU posts margin with the Counterparty based =
on their contractual obligations.

All the trades would fall within our existing ISDAs. Our lawyers have added=
 some language for the confirms that would tie the trades together. That la=
nguage is included below. If you have any legal questions feel free to call=
 our lawyer Mark Taylor at 713-853-7459.

If you have any questions feel free to call me at 713-853-7058. I'll ring y=
ou latter this afternoon to go over the details and talk about possible cou=
nterparties.

Thanks for your time.
