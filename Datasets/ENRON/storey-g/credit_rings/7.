Randy,

What we wanted to look at on the gas side would be a three way ring trade t=
hat is out-of-the-money on one side and in-the-money on the other.=20

For example:

Counterparty A sells to Enron a jan02-dec02 nymex swap at current market + =
$2
Enron sells to Williams a jan02-dec02 nymex swap at current market + $2
Williams sells to Counterparty A a jan02-dec02 nymex swap at current market=
 + $2

There will be no net position change for each counterparty, but if will rep=
lace Counterparty A's Enron credit exposure with Williams.

All the trades would fall within our existing ISDAs. Our lawyers have added=
 some language for the confirms that would tie the trades together. That la=
nguage is included below. If you have any legal questions feel free to call=
 our lawyer Mark Taylor at 713-853-7459.

If you have any questions feel free to call me at 713-853-7058. I'll ring y=
ou latter this afternoon to go over the details and talk about possible cou=
nterparties.

Thanks for your time.


Geof Storey
