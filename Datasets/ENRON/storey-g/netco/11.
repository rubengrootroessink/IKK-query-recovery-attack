Tim/Chris:

I spoke to Geoff to try to clarify what needs to be "moved or copied" to NE=
TCO.  Bottom line, my view of it is that the key items that need to be iden=
tified today are models and systems such as EnPower, CAPS, the structuring =
models, etc.  Tim has already identified these things to Geoff in a separat=
e e-mail.  There are thousands of other items such as contracts, customer e=
xcel and word files, address lists, etc. that we might ultimately want to u=
tilize at NETCO, but I do not think that these need to be identified at thi=
s time.  Although Geoff has indicated that we need to identify all items th=
at we would need at NETCO, my view is that we should not attempt to identif=
y all of these files at this time because:

=09-  =09we likely could reproduce most of these files or obtain them from =
customers if we had to
=09-  =09transfer of such items might ultimately be permitted
=09-  =09identification of such items by close of business cannot be done i=
n an organized fashion and throwing thousands of such files into the mix wo=
uld =09=09=09undoubtedly overwhelm the legal folks who are trying to identi=
fy the key items that need to be transferred.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Chris

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all=
 systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identif=
ied the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to=
 identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This wo=
uld include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close=
 of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some =
data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specif=
ic or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

Louise
