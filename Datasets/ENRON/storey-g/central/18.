Our crack marketing team (cary & tony) are at the norther border shipper 
meeting.  I will get them to start looking for more harper or Northern  
Border - manhatten gas when they return.  Attached is a spreadsheet showing 
tony's deals done to date.  I believe that we left harper at Vent +.06 and 
NB-manhatten at chicago + .04.
