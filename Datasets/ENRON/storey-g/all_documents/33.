? The Sitara deal Id will show for non EOL deals entered into Sitara

TDS Position Manager
? Groups of groups are supported when defining curve groupings.
? New filters have been added to the Position Manager to allow viewing the 
positions associated with "Changed" & "New & Changed" Positions. When looking 
at the positions with the changed filter set, the net change in the position 
from the official PortCalc is reported.
? When viewing "New" or "All" deals in the Position Manager right-clicking 
the mouse over a position for a specific period provides a menu option to 
view the deals behind that position.  This feature is not available when 
viewing a roll-up desk (i.e. ALL-WEST, ALL-EAST, etc.)
