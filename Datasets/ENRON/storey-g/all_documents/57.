Geof,

Please review the meeting notes for the requirements of GTV II phase 2 in the 
attached file. Please let me know any discrepancy and changes you want me to 
make.

The volatility skew data is stored in one of ERMS' database table. The skew 
data is currently maintained by John Griffith. We have a user interface built 
in Excel for down-loading and up-loading skew data. I think John has not 
started using the interface yet.

The testing for the volatility skew implementation has been done by john by 
calling IT for running the portcalc against production database. We will put 
the changes out in the test environment so that Chuck can also check it out. 
I will let Chuck know once it is available for him, hopefully, sometime today.

Thanks

Zhiyong
