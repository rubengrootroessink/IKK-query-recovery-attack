Hi Geoff,

We have prepared an estimate of your taxes owing in the US April 16th given
the information you have provided to us and recommend that you make a
$20,000 payment to the IRS on or before that date.

I will fax an extension form to you along with instructions as to where you
should file it.  The extension, if filed timely, gives us until August 15th
to submit your tax return to the IRS but we would like to have it completed
by April 30th, the Canadian filing deadline, as we are also filing a
Canadian tax return for you (I believe we discussed this previously).
Please confirm that your fax number is 713-646-3390 and if you have any
special instructions before I send the fax.

Thanks and kind regards,

Judy Wood
PricewaterhouseCoopers Calgary, IAS Dept.
