Hi, Geoff,

I am preparing your U.S. return and have a few questions for you:

Could you please tell me if you paid property taxes or made charitable
donations during 2000, and, if so, please provide me with the details and
amounts.

Also, you sold shares in Tibco Software Inc. (07/18/2000 - $2,905.09) and
Nasdaq 100 shares (10/12/2000 - $7,459.75).  I will need the cost
basis/purchase price that was paid for acquiring those shares, so that I
may calculate a gain or loss on disposition.

Thanks so much,

Vicki Meszaros
