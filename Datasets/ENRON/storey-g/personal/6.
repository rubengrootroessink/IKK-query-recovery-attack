I have private insurance - we have Cigna - with a group - IEEE - institute of electrical engineers.  You can get it through groups (maybe a finance society or something from Vicki's major).  We did have to qualify for it, and I think we had an exclusion for a year on preexisting conditions.  However, if you have an exclusion, you can still take Enron insurance/cobra despite having the insurance until the exclusion is waived.  

Other options, talk to an independent insurance guy - the one I like is Brady Knight -

If you need any help on the transition rules - I know most of them. I'll be glad to help you with it.
