Hello,

I am putting your tax package together.  Could you please provide me with
the phone number for your 2022 Windsor address (for the courier company).

Your tax equalization will be prepared in Houston, so I cannot provide you
with the Enron figures, however, your Canadian return is nil (no refund nor
balance owing) and your U.S. return shows a $538 refund.

Regards,

Vicki

   Hi, Geoff,

   Could you please confirm that your Windsor address is to be used on your
   tax returns.  Also, would you like your completed tax package sent to
   this
   address?  We will be sending out your returns as soon as possible.

   Thanks,
