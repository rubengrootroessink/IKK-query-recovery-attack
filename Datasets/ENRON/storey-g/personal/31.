Geoff,
     Did you make it back ok?  The front desk had no idea where the tux
was, in fact they didn't even have you checked out!!!  So we waited around
until noon and had them go up to your room and check.  Anyway, they finally
called and said they found it about 4pm and I went back and got it.  Thanks
again for coming up, hope you had a good time.  LAter
