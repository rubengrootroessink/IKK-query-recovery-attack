All,
I've recently learned that I'm not receiving a lot of emails  sent to this address, and AT&T can't seem to solve the problem.  I  apologize if you've sent something to me and I've not replied.  I'm going  to phase this out over the next couple of weeks.  
 
Therefore, please update your address books to the  following:
 jmiles777@yahoo.com 
 
Thanks,
Jason
