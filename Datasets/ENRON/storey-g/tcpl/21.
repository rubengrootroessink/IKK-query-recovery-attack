Geoff, here is a revision of the sheet I had sent you before regarding the 
floor bid for IT tolls, this is the proposal that TCPL is trying to push 
through the committee!  They have changed the % in the marginal fuel calc 
from 15.5 to 14% which has reduced the floor pricing to approx. 102% firm 
through the winter 2001!
