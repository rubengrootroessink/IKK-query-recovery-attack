The NEB has advised that because of the substantial opposition to the Settlement, it can not treat it as a "Negotiated Settlement".  This means the board will not be obligated to approve or deny the application as a whole and could cherry pick what components get approved.  The board has asked TCPL to confirm whether to they wish to proceed with the application or file something new before the board establishes a process to consider the tolls.  Interesting to see if any of the signatories walk away from the deal in light of this.
