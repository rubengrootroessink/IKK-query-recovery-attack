TDS Stage is now pointing to ermtst8i. This is an Oracle 8 version of the TAGG/ERMS database, current as of last Friday. Only the FT-West, GD-West, and FT-Denver desks are active. So far, everything seems to be working (nothing's blown up). As far as I know, no curves have been loaded into the curve cache.  The current plan is to migrate to Oracle 8i in 2 weeks, so now's the time to find problems.
