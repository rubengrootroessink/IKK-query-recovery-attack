ecision making - How to juggle your options [IMAGE] You may have heard of t=
he 3 C's of  marketing. This month we propose the 3 C's of deciding on a bu=
siness school: Curriculum,  Culture and Cost - consider all three when maki=
ng your final decision about where you  will matriculate next fall.  Curric=
ulum: Do the school's objectives meet yours as a student? Are the school's =
 professors teaching in such a way that complements your learning style? Ar=
e the  certificates or majors that are offered in sync with your career goa=
ls? Are you free to  take electives to get what you want out of business sc=
hool? Hit the schools' websites  here  to read up on the  differences.  Cul=
ture: The best way to understand a school's culture is to visit. Not an opt=
ion?  Try connecting with current students to learn first hand what it's li=
ke to be a student.  Ask about clubs, student involvement in decision-makin=
g, classroom dynamics, and even  what people do on Friday nights. These ans=
wers will be clues for understanding the culture.  Cost: Your first exercis=
e as an admitted student: perform a cost-benefit  analysis to determine if =
the benefits you gain from business school outweigh the price  tag of atten=
ding. Don't forget to include the opportunity cost of not working in your  =
calculation. Public vs. private, international vs. domestic, cost of living=

maybe things didn't work out  quite as you had hoped. Applications are up t=
his year and you may be among the many who  didn't get into your first choi=
ce school. If you were admitted to a program but it's not  the program of y=
our choice, consider deferring your admission. Then, put in the time over  =
the next few months to really improve your application:   Contact the admis=
sions office and set up an appointment to review your application  over the=
 summer. Many schools offer this service and will give you feedback on beco=
ming a  better applicant.  Learn whether or not there is a special applicat=
ion for students who are reapplying.  It may be simpler the second time aro=
und.  Retake your GMAT.  Free practice tests   are available through Embark=
.   Make a difference. Improve your application by showing a promotion at w=
