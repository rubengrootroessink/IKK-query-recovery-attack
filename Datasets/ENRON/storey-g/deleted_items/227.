I would think we need the dates from the trigger, otherwise those killed deals will remain in their Cash Position amounts.

Subject:	Problem with killed CPR deals & Deal Ticker


  When a deal is killed in CPR, the detail record gets deleted. Consequently, when CPRReader picks up the change, it has no idea what the start and end dates for the record are, and doesn't publish anything for those values. When Deal Ticker gets the deal, it uses the "0" date, Dec 30, 1899 for the start and end dates.

Possible fixes would include having Deal Ticker just not display dates when they're not known, or having the CPR triggers put the start and end dates in the TDS table when a deal is killed.
