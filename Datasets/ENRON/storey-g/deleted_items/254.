I am free in the morning until 11:00 am.  I think that Todd Busby should sit in on the meeting, since he is been so involved in the discussions with Sithe.

I'm in Houston this week and am available Thursday morning.  I would appreciate the opportunity to get together to discuss the intentions for disposition of the Sithe TCPL position.  I had figured that Geoff would value the pipe, take it in at a discounted position (paid for by Sithe with project equity), and then we would try to market it away at a higher value.  However, I have heard all kinds of different scenarios from within the company and would like to clarify this.
Please let me know if I can catch some time with you Thursday (June 7th) morning to review this.  Thanks.
