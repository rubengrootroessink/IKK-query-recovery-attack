IN THE NEWS...
Many Adults Have Obesity Syndrome
A recent study from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 47 million Americans - more than one in five - have the cluster of health problems known as metabolic syndrome.  This condition, thought to be caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, such as overeating and lack of exercise, includes heaviness around the waist, high blood pressure, poor cholesterol readings and elevated blood sugar.  Metabolic syndrome greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

One Step Closer to a Cure
In Type 1 diabetes, which occurs in nearly one million Americans, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, stopping insulin production and wreaking havoc on blood sugar levels.  For this reason, people with Type 1 diabetes must administer insulin to themselves on a carefully controlled basis. Researchers at Harvard Medical School recently found that in mice, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas can regenerate themselves, giving hope that this new method of fighting the disease could draw science closer to a cure.

Aspirin Therapy for Hearts Defended
Aspirin has long been the basis of blood thinning treatment for people with cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke.  It is not, however, usually prescribed for those that have conditions that put them at risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels and chest pain.  Recent research could change this.  A report from Oxford University in England shows that small doses of aspirin (75-100 milligrams per day) significantly lower the risk of heart attack or stroke for those at high risk due to related conditions.
