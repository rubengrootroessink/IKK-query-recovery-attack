Our third party hosting facility changed a router configuration setting that caused us to lose connectivity to all of our traders today at 12:50 pm. The change to the router was unauthorized and we are meeting with the hosting facility today to insure that something like this does not happen again during trading hours. All traders were logged out and all orders pulled from the market during the outage. We are in the process of bringing the system back online and we expect the system to be back online by 2:15 ET.
