RESEARCH:

IU RESEARCHERS RELEASE CENSUS STUDY - Indiana's population is aging, with
the state's median age at 35.2 in 2000, up from 32.8 in 1990 and 29.2 in
1980, according to data released May 17 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Half of
the population are older than the median age and half are younger. An
analysis of the data was released by Joan P. Morand, research director
with the Indiana Business Research Center in IU's Kelley School of
Business. IBRC serves as the state's official liaison with the U.S. Bureau
of the Census and regularly analyzes state population trends.

ZERO EVIDENCE FOR ZERO TOLERANCE IN SCHOOLS - Can the use of zero
tolerance in school discipline improve student behavior or lead to safer
schools? Probably not, concludes a report released May 15 by the Indiana
Education Policy Center at the IU School of Education in Bloomington. The
report finds that although the use of suspension and expulsion for
non-dangerous behavior places an increasing number of students at risk for
being removed from school, those risks are in no way justified by the
results of the policy.
