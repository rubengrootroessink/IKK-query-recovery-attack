Hi Geoff,

Chris Gaskill said you might be able to help me out. 

 I am working on an eCommerce report for EOL and I am trying to determine who the players are for trading nat gas online.  (Of course, all of the companies I have researched say they are leading the market)...Any way, I was wondering what online trading plaforms you use for trading nat gas besides EOL.  If you could help me out that would be great. 

Thanks,
Angela Saenz
