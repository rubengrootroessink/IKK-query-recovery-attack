ATHLETICS:

MEN'S SOCCER TEAM TAKES NINTH BIG TEN CROWN - With a scoreless tie at the
end of the first half, Hoosier fans were a little worried about just how
many minutes of soccer were going to be played to determine a Big Ten
champion last Sunday (Nov. 11) in Madison. With 32:02 remaining in the
game, the Indiana men's soccer team put all fears to rest, scoring the
game-winner against Michigan State. The Hoosiers won their ninth
conference championship 2-0 over the Spartans. They now look ahead to the
NCAA tourney and seek a sixth national championship.
