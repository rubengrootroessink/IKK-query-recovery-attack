NEWS...
Lifestyle Remains Key Diabetes Risk
A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine reevaluated the
landmark 1980-1996 Nurses Health Study, in which nearly 85,000 female
nurses aged 30 to 55 were regularly monitored for dietary intake,
smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  Diabetes was
newly identified in 3,300 subjects in the study.  Lack of exercise, a
poor diet and current smoking were all associated with a significantly
increased risk of diabetes.

Childhood Obesity Becoming Global Problem
Childhood obesity in the United States has grown to epidemic levels, say
public health officials.  Now, a recent study led by researchers at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill finds that growing numbers
of young people in China and Russia are also overweight and obese.

An Inspiring Story from America's WALK for Diabetes
11-year-old Tyler Smith, of Chesterfield, MO, was diagnosed with
diabetes at the age of 14 months.  The now sixth-grader has been testing
his own blood sugar since he was 2 ? years old.  Described as an
inspiring, "seasoned fund-raiser," Tyler raised over $6,000 for last
week's American Diabetes Association's America's WALK for Diabetes held
in St. Louis.  Remarkably, since 1995 alone, he has raised at least
$20,000 for the Association and diabetes research.

Native American Conference Suggests Traditional Lifestyles
According to the U.S. Indian Health Service, there were very few, if
any, known cases of diabetes among Native Americans before 1936.
However, today Native Americans have the highest incidence of any ethnic
group for type 2 diabetes. Earlier this week in Tulsa, OK delegates from
40 Native American tribes, representatives from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and various
health professionals attended the "Return to Your Roots" conference to
examine ways to combat this troubling public health program.  Much of
the conference focused on adopting traditional Native American lifestyle
habits as a means to improve their health.

TYPE 1 DIABETES...
Parents Quick Guide for Kids With Diabetes
Raising a child, with or without diabetes, is never easy. While diabetes
doesn't change the basics of parenting, it does however, add new
challenges at every stage, from birth to the teenage years.

TYPE 2 DIABETES...
Is Controlling your Blood Sugar Challenging? 
Keeping your blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible can be
a lifesaver. Tight control can prevent or slow the progress of many
complications of diabetes, giving you extra years of healthy, active
life. However, tight control is not for everyone.
