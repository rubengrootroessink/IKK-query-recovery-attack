1. A Simple Step To Prevent Diabetes, High Blood Pressure and Heart
Disease

In a recent study in Washington State, researchers with Premera Blue
Cross found that thousands of patients with high blood pressure,
diabetes, or past heart attacks may be missing the life-enhancing
benefits of the right blood pressure medications. Comparing prescription
guidelines with the drugs actually used by people to control their blood
pressure, the study found that far too many diabetes patients were not
taking the most effective medications or taking no blood pressure
medicine at all. Click here for the full story:

4. Review of DiabetesOneStop.com

Medical writer and Internet journalist Rick Mendosa investigates the
services and people of the diabetes-focused Web site
DiabetesOneStop.com. The site targets four primary audiences: health
care professionals, people working for the pharmaceutical industry,
scientists, and those living with diabetes. Praised by Mendosa for its
diverse content and usability, the site offers educational materials,
clinical and scientific articles, as well as conference abstracts and
reports.
