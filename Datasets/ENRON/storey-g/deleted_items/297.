The TDS IT group needs your approval to start work on some enhancements to the TDS Deal Ticker.

TDS currently is not valuing physical changed deals correctly.  

                          Change deal valuation is based on current value vs the value from the previous night port calc.   However since CPR numbers can change
                          when the deal is revised, it does not have a exact previous valuation to compare to. Resulting in full deal value displaying as the change.
                          Bill has a concept to base Change Deal Value on the whole Sitara deal rather than the individual CPR tickets.

TDS does not value correctly deals priced to the desk at Mid

                          Current valuation does not take physical premium into effect.  Not a large value effect unless the physical premium is large,
                          such as IF-NGPL/Harper, that has a premium of $.22.
                          The CPR reader can be changed to include the Mid Market Flag that CPR has.  Valuation can then include premium into the calc.
