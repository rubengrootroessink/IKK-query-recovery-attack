1. Nutrition Program Unveiled for Hispanics and Latinos

The National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP), sponsored by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes
of Health, recently launched a nutrition campaign targeting Hispanics
and Latinos who have diabetes or are at high risk of developing the
disease, and their families. Called "It's more than food, it's life,"
the campaign focuses on educating Hispanics and Latinos about ways they
can continue to eat their favorite, traditional foods even if they have
diabetes, if they reduce portion sizes and alter preparation methods.

2. Many Diabetes Patients Unaware of Cardiovascular Risks

Insulin resistance, a major factor in type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes, is
a condition in which the body cannot use the insulin it produces
effectively. One effect of insulin resistance is heightened levels of
artery-clogging LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In a recent survey of
type 2 diabetes patients sponsored by Partners Against Insulin
Resistance (PAIR), only 52 percent recognized the term insulin
resistance, and just over 50 percent recognized the association between
insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (CVD). For more
information on this story, click on the following link:

3. Study Finds That Diabetes Doubles Risk for Depression

Diabetes patients are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those
who do not have diabetes, according to a new study to be published in
the June issue of Diabetes Care. Conducted jointly by researchers at the
Washington University School of Medicine and the Department of Veterans'
Affairs Medical Center in St. Louis, Missouri, the study is the first to
provide a firm estimate of how likely patients are to suffer from both
depression and diabetes. For more information on this story, click on

4. ADA Helps Lead Cardiovascular Program in Atlanta

The Cardiovascular Learning Partnership (CLP), an organization made up
of the American Diabetes Association and four other national
non-profits, is using a $750,000 grant by the Guidant Foundation to fund
an education and outreach program for Atlanta African Americans with
diabetes and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The program,
consisting of an awareness campaign and a multi-site clinical project,
aims to empower African American diabetes patients to secure proper CVD
interventions, and to give health professionals better tools to provide
the highest quality of care. For more information on this story, click

5. The Art of Empowerment: Stories and Strategies for Diabetes Educators

with your patients. A partnership that allows you to blend what you know

make you think, reflect, consider your role as a diabetes professional.
