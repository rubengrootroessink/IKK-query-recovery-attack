I have talked with them about phys rings. But the primary counterparty i was going to use was Dynegy. The trading wanted to make some money to do the deal, but i'm not sure where we stand with the other Dynegy stuff going on. So i'm on a holding pattern with Mirant unless you have any suggestions. geof
