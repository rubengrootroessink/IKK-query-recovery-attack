All,

I have found that most of Research models listed in the attached file have been included in the current migration plan. Those models are located in the following directories:
Power (Basic Swap/Option) Model - M:\power2\pricing\Pwr_strc97.xls 
Other Power Models - M:\user_pub\todd\models 
All Gas Models - O:\Gas Structuring\Requested Files 

Regards

Zhiyong

Angela, is there any way to identify the directory paths for the data contained in the attached document?  Is the data contained on the O:\ M:\ drive?  What is the full directory path....O:\directoryname\directoryname\etc.....?  This information will assist us in determining exactly what needs migrated. I am available to meet anytime and assist in anyway possible.  Thanks in advance.

Mike Croucher

Dave,
       Here is a list of models I can come up with.  There are probably more, but lets try to get these as a start.
       The spreadsheets and the relevant source code (in C) is needed.
