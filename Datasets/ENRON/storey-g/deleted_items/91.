The Best to You in 2002
  <http://img.ipost.com/client/t/tdwaterhouse/011102/baby.gif>By almost any measure, 2001 has been - at best - a very challenging year. Between the markets and the economy, the 
tragic events of September, and the current uncertainty in foreign affairs, it's been quite a bumpy ride. Even so, there are promising signs that 2002 will see a return to more normal times. With that thought in mind, TD Waterhouse wants to wish you and your family a happy, healthy, and prosperous new year.

We thank you for your past business and look forward to continuing to help you manage your money successfully.
