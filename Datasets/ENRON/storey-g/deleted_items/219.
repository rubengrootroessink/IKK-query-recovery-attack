IUPUI STUDENTS GIVE PBS VIEWERS A PEEK INTO THE FUTURE OF ROBOTS - When a
PBS show about robots premiered this month, millions of viewers across
America saw the high-tech 3D special effects work of three IUPUI students.
In a concluding segment of the hour-long show, "Beyond Human: Living
Machines," viewers were treated to a scene where people and robots pass
each other on a downtown street. The people and buildings are real, but
the robots are animations created by two graduate students and an
undergraduate student studying in the School of Informatics' New Media
program at IUPUI.
