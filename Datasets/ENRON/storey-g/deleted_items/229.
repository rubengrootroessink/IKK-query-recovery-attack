We appreciate the input many provided concerning IU's gateway Web site.
The information will help us to deliver relevant information every time
you visit the site. Congratulations to Taryn Hulslander, an IU Bloomington
freshman from Elkhart, Ind., who was the winner of our drawing for a $250
online shopping spree at the IU Bookstore. We join you in looking forward
to new features and changes in the site later this year.

FORMER EDUCATION DEAN PAYS TRIBUTE TO INSPIRATIONAL TEACHER - In an
article for Education Week, Donald Warren, dean of the IU School of
Education from 1990 to 2000, reflects on the life of one of his former
