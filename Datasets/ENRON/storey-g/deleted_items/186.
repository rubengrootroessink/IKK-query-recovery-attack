I am currently involved in attempting to construct and launch a web-based portal for use by targeted central gas Enron clients.  I am enclosing a brief (1 page) description of the project.  Laura Luce has suggested that I meet with you in order to discuss key aspects of the project as described in the enclosed document.  If you could schedule a brief (no more than 30 min.) meeting with me at your convenience today or in the near future, I would greatly appreciate your assitance and input.  Thank you very much for your time and assitance in this project.
