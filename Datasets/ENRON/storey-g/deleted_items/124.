7. New Guidelines Call for More Aggressive Cholesterol Treatment

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), some 53 million
Americans have high cholesterol and the U.S. death toll from heart
disease is about 500,000 a year. To try and reduce these numbers and
prolong lives, the NIH has formed new guidelines for physicians treating
people at risk for heart disease. The new, more aggressive guidelines,
released Tuesday, May 15, add diabetes and metabolic syndrome to the
conditions indicating an increased risk for heart disease, recommend
different tests to screen for high cholesterol, and offer modified
standards for good and bad cholesterol. The NIH expects the numbers of
Americans using prescribed cholesterol drugs and following prescribed,
cholesterol-lowering diets to grow sharply  For more information on this
