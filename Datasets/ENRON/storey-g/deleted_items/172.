facing alumni relations. Conference sessions covered everything from

"Web MBAs Make the Grade"


You're a senior analyst with a utility company, the father of three, you
devote lots of time to coaching their sports teams, and you want to get an
MBA. If you're Rick Hensley, with Cinergy Corp. near Indianapolis, you
enroll in the online MBA program at the Kelley School. "I didn't want to
miss two or three years of my children's lives," he says. "My options were
either to find something online or wait five or six years." Now he reads
his professors' weekly lectures and completes the assignments when it
suits his schedule, and he'll get his degree this year. John Shade, chief
engineer of Rolls?Royce's 501k?engine program in Indianapolis, says, "I
thought that if I was going to invest the effort to get an MBA, I would do
it only through a high?caliber program." Shade made his move when IU began
offering its two?year program online.

FINANCIAL TIMES

"Few Countries Enforcing Insider Trading Laws"

Finance Professor Utpal Bhattacharya is extensively quoted in Alison
Beard's article on his study (in cooperation with Kelley doctoral student
Hazem Daouk) of the world's 103 stock markets. The study, soon to be
published in the "Journal of Finance," contends that nearly 85 percent of
the world's stock markets have laws against insider trading but only
one?third have enforced them. And in countries where no insiders have been
prosecuted, companies pay an average of 5 percent extra to raise capital.
"That is the price of honesty," he says. Bhattacharya argues that
"controlling large shareholders could easily be tempted by management to
make profits from stock tips rather than... from hard?to?do monitoring.
Knowing this, [other] shareholders would demand a higher return on
equity."

LOS ANGELES TIMES

"Companies' Downsizing Efforts May Not Boost Earnings But Just Lower
Morale"

The strategy you employ to rescue your company from the brink might just
shove it over the cliff. So said researchers at IU's Kelley School of
Business who studied the downsizing efforts of eight large U.S.
corporations in the 1990s. "Only half of the downsizings... we studied
actually resulted in increased profits," said Vince Mabert, professor of
operations and decision technologies.

THE NEW YORK TIMES

"Wall Street Falls Into Bear Territory"

Investors typically seek safe havens in bonds and money market funds when
the stock market tanks. Chuck Trzcinka, the Cozad Chair in Finance, says
it's difficult to determine when to get out of those more stable
investments and put the money back into the stock market. That' why some
market players like to put their money into companies they know will
produce profits whether the economy is good or bad. "They're not the high
flyers, but they're certainly stable and they're going to be with us," he
says. "Just because the stock market is down, it doesn't mean you don't
need houses to live in and food to eat and clothing to wear." He adds,
"There are no surefire rules to make money in a bear market, but the bears
eventually hibernate." The Associated Press article also appeared in Fox
Market Wire, "Salt Lake Tribune," "Everett (WA) Herald," "Allentown
Morning Call," "Charleston (SC) Net," "Oklahoma City Oklahoman," "Chicago
Sun?Times," "Denver Rocky Mountain News," and "Modesto Bee."

WESTWOOD ONE RADIO NETWORK
March 12?13


The radio network conducted a pair of interviews with Chuck Trzcinka, the
Cozad Chair in Finance, about the volatile stock market. The interviews
