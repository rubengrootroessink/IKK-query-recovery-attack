Geoff--

	If I could get just a few moments of your time today or tommorow, at your convenience, in order to discuss the web-based portal project I emailed you about yesterday, it would be of great assistance to me.  All I need to do is briefly interview you regarding what you would like to see on a page like the one which has been proposed.  I have once again enclosed a brief summary of the principles underlying this project.  Thank you very much for your assistance.
