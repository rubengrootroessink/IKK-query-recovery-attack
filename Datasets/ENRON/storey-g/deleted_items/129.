1. Western Diet Linked to Diabetes in Native Americans

For the Pima Indians of Arizona, diabetes has reached epidemic
proportions. About 50% of Pima adults between the ages of 30 and 64 have
diabetes, giving this community the highest rate of type 2 diabetes in
the world.  A recent study published in the May issue of Diabetes Care
shows that Pima Indians who have adopted a Western diet high in simple
carbohydrates and low in vegetable protein and fiber are three times
more likely to develop diabetes over six years than their counterparts
who eat a more traditional diet rich in fresh produce and whole grains.

2. Team Diabetes Runner Sets Inspiring Example

A 54-year-old endocrinologist and nephrologist, who admits to being far
from a world-class athlete, has turned his passion for helping people
with diabetes into a drive to compete in marathons and raise money for
the American Diabetes Association.  For more information on this story,

3. Diabetes School Care Act Nears Passage in Oklahoma

Children with diabetes must meet the daily challenge of managing healthy
blood sugar levels while attending school.  Unfortunately, many schools
lack personnel who are trained to recognize the warning signs of low and
high blood sugar levels and to help when children with diabetes
experience problems. The Diabetes School Care Act provides for proper
training of school personnel to increase their awareness of diabetes and
its symptoms, and calls for specific actions personnel should take in
during diabetes-related emergencies.  The bill has passed both houses
and currently awaits final committee edits before the legislature will
send it to the governor's desk.  For more information on this story,

4. New Guidelines Call for More Aggressive Cholesterol Treatment

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), some 53 million
Americans have high cholesterol and the U.S. death toll from heart
disease is about 500,000 a year. To try and reduce these numbers and
prolong lives, the NIH has formed new guidelines for physicians treating
people at risk for heart disease.  The new, more aggressive guidelines,
released Tuesday, May 15, add diabetes and metabolic syndrome to the
conditions indicating an increased risk for heart disease, recommend
different tests to screen for high cholesterol, and offer modified
standards for good and bad cholesterol. The NIH expects the numbers of
Americans using prescribed cholesterol drugs and following prescribed,
cholesterol-lowering diets to grow sharply.  For more information on
this story, click on the following link:
