I have been told by a few people that the Hyatt has no more rooms available
for Saturday, June 2nd. According to the Hyatt, there are still several
rooms available, and more can be reserved if needed. Please call prior to
May 18th to reserve your room. The reservation number is 1-800-233-1234 and
refer to the Luebbering/Childers wedding. The Fairfield Inn also had rooms
available. Their reservation number is 630-577-1820.

Sorry for any inconvenience. Please forward this to anyone who was having
trouble reserving a room. Thank you.
