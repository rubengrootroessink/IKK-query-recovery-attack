Hi Geoff,

How are you? How's Vicki doing? Is she and the baby already at home?

Vladi probably told you about the reorg in EES. Currently I am looking for a position in Commodity Structuring (Gas or Power). 
Do you by chance know anybody who I can talk to about a position in these groups?

Natalie
