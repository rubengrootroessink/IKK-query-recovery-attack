Mary Jo:
Per our conversation below, could you take a quick look at the data below and see if Varn International is a company we can work with?

Thanks.


Believe it or not, I am currently working in the Northwest side of Houston  
with Varn International.  Our parent company, Day International,  has  
facilities located in Michigan and North Carolina.   Would you be so kind and  
point me in the right direction as to who might handle the Carolina Power and  
Light account in Ashville, NC as well as the American Electric Power account  
in Three Rivers Michigan.  Our Day plants have been using brokers but I  
thought we might could work with Enron, if they are in that market area, and  
possibly negotiate some long term agreement for all our facilities.  Once  
they found out I had natural gas experience, they put me on this project.   
Otherwise I'm responsible for purchasing and logistics for North America and  
eventually worldwide.
