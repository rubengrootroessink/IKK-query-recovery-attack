Hey guys,

Less than two weeks now...

Just wanted to find out when everyone would be arriving.

they want us to pick up the tuxes and pay for everything on Thursday
evening.  I know some of you won't be in until Friday, so we'll work around
that.  The shop is also in the city, so we may have to try and move to one
of the shops in the burbs if you all are headed out there.  Let me know when
you'll be available and I'll figure it out for the group.

Later,

Jason
