Geoff,
	I am e-mailing you about your h:\ drive.  You are currently using almost 2.1gb of disk space on your h:\ drive.  Can you please go through this and try and clean up as much as possible.  We really don't have the space available to store that amount of data per user on the h:\ drives.  

If there are data files that are being stored on your h:\ drive, for projects or other Enron related businesses, these can be stored on o:\ drive.


Please contact me if you have any questions at x56389

Thanks
