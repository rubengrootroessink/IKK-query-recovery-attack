Hey fellas,

A couple days left....

If you guys get this today (Thursday) and if you get a chance, could you
call the tux shop and go ahead and pay for your tuxes.  I am going to pick
up all of the tuxes this afternoon and bring them out to the rehearsal
tomorrow.  IF you are in town, you can just go to the shop on Clybourn and
pay for and pick up your tux, otherwise, if you could call and pay with a
credit card, it would make things a lot easier.  I will be going over there
at 1:30 or 2:00 this afternoon.  If you could either call and pay for you
tux or at least let me know that you are planning to pick it up tonight
before 2:00 (Cellular: 773-294-6114), I'd really appreciate it.

Modern Tuxedo
1850 North Clybourn
Chicago
773-388-0800
Hours: 12:00 - 8:00PM



Thanks, guys.

Safe travels.

Jas
