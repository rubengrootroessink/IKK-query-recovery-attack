The attached file will help anyone interested in which books make up a roll up, and which desk is not allowing the
total position to aggregate due to inconsistent dates.

The file contains a new utility that shows the desks that are included in the roll ups, with the official 
trade dates for all the desks.   

Please save the file to your local directory.
