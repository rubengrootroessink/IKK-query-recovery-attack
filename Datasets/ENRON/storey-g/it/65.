Geoff,

Listing of current issues

Resaving and publishing of April 30th IM curves to show June values.  The portcalc's were bombing out because there was no prior June value in the curves.  So as of May 1, they started bombing.  I have to find a way to re-post prior day curves out into ERMS.  

All the GDI curve manager files that are pulling the physical index curves should be ready by tonight.  I'm doing Texas as I write.  I think we should leave the issue of who and how these curves are set up to the individual desks.  For the central desk, we can use the term traders files to publish.  But, we could also set aside a separate file to merely listen to the phys idx curves and publish them that way.  I'm going to release the files to the desks for them to review and get back to me for changes and revisions.  

The changes made into TDS deal evaluation are being revised today.  I guess there were some problems this morning and are now being fixed.

As for the position manager, there is an issue as to how we would like the New/ Changed/ New & Changed filter placed onto the position manager.  The issue there is that with the FX column in the positions tab, what should that positions tab look to as a filter if we place that function on the positions and cash tab.  Dave has suggested putting the filter in the menu area where you can manipulate it and then tab between columns.  I agreed that that was the best solution but I figure you should probably let me know ASAP whether you agree.

Other than that I don't know what else is new or important to add.  After I'm done calcing tonight I'll go ahead and publish the GDI curves myself.  Tomorrow morning I'll talk with the Risk leads and ask them if they can review and load the curves from here on out.  I'll also start modifying the curve files to include an additional month so we wont run into that problem again.  That should be done for EOD tomorrow.  Give me a call if you have any questions and/or problems.

Chuck
