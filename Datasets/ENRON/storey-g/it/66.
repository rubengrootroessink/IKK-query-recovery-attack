Geoff,

=09The weekly status meeting with the IT guys took place as scheduled on Mo=
nday afternoon.  The main issues are as follows:

Dave would like to sit down and discuss the requirements for the customizab=
le time periods on the pos manager.
Reaffirmation of taking all the components in Phase I into production by th=
e middle of the month.
Roll up aggregation for curve shift as well as position
FX Price column in the positions as well as group of groups requirements,

The issues that they are currently facing is the FX Price column in the pos=
itions as well as group of groups requirements.  I think they would like to=
 sit down with you and discuss on Monday to get a better sense of the exact=
 requirements.  I'm not entirely sure as to what the question is on the FX =
column, but they said they'd like to speak with you on Monday either way. =
=20

As far as my own work is concerned, I loaded the GDI curves for the Central=
 and West desks on Monday.  However, I still need to create a process where=
by that is done directly.  Ahmad is working on developing the capabilities =
in the current sheets for you, Andy and Martin.  In the meantime, we can ju=
st listen to the current index curves being published and just use those to=
 load into ERMS.  I still do not have access in ERMS test environment but I=
 hope to have that by tomorrow.  It seems like they finally got around to f=
ixing the TDS ticker in parallel.  I do have a few questions for you, howev=
er.  First, is there any need to see deals done for the current day in the =
deal ticker?  I assume you should as a way to see your daily physical trade=
s and the effect on the inherent position for that day and beyond.  Also, t=
here is some issue with the deal valuation in the position manager.  I'm tr=
ying to figure out exactly what Nayan is pulling out to value the physical =
positions.  The question is moot, however, once we have the live feeds in p=
lace for the physicals and gas daily's.  The IM positions have been moved o=
ut of the positions tab in the manager.  Mike has made some changes to valu=
e options in the deal ticker which was rolled out late this afternoon.  Thi=
s has not yet been tested.  I have to get access to all the books in parall=
el, but will get it in the morning.  We are having problems with calc'ing c=
urrent+prompt for the physical positions into TDS.  I'll be contacting Jere=
my Wong in the morning and ask him about the port calc errors.  We also sti=
ll have to test the GDI calcs in ERMS test.  Russ is still testing the TDS =
tradeblotter in test.  I will also continue in reconciling the physical sit=
ara positions with the TDS load.  As you can see, theres plenty of work to =
go around.  I apologize for the rambling nature of this email, but it is cu=
rrently approaching 11 pm and we are still working to correctly pull positi=
ons into the morning packet.  I'll send a much more coherent and concise re=
sponse tomorrow.  Talk to you soon.  Hope the wife and baby are doing well.

Chuck
