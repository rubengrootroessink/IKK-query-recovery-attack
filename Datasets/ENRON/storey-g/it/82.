Geoff,

 Attached is yesterdays NG curves that goes out more than
14 years. Is the curve that you talked to me about yesterday?
If it is, this curve was entered by Dutch Quigley using curveload.


Francis



NOTES ONLY:
the curves were generated using the query below:

 select ref_period_dt,curve_amt
 from egs_curves
 where effective_dt = '26-mar-01'
 and curve_cd = 'NG'
 and curve_type_cd = 'PR'
 order by ref_period_dt
