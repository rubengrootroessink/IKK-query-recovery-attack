Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

Subject: GTV II

I understand we have now finalized 90% requirements on the GTV II.

Please could we pull together the format inception document this week for 
signature on your meeting next week with Geof and Colleen.

Document to include all requirements, dependencies and timelines.

I would suggest whoever is writing this spend some time with Geof this week.

Please circulate to draft all listed above including me.

Thanks,

Louise
