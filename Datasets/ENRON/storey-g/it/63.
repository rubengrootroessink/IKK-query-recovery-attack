Louise,

I have just sent you the revised Inception Document including three additional items: Single deal entry revisions, Options reports, and Transport valuation in ERMS. After discussing with Geof, we decided not to include the EOL reporting tools this time. Hopefully, you are OK with that. Please let us know if the EOL reporting tools have to be discussed in the document.

Regards.

Zhiyong

I'm a bit confused - I think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small.  I would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following.

Single Deal entry revisions
Options reports
Transport Valuation in ERMS
EOL reporting tools (possible)

I would like to see Phase II include the items above and an Inception document re-issued this week.

Thanks

Louise

o	Changes for Position Manager are in progress (Please see the attached project timeline.)
?	Single point of deal entry for term deals:
o	Single point of deal entry is now ready for user acceptance testing.
?	Gas Daily deals:
o	Changes to ERMS PortCalc application for the Gas Daily deals are complete and ready for testing.
o	Changes to TDS deal valuation are in progress and on schedule (please see the attached project timeline.)
o	A new task has been added to flag fixed-price positions (please see the attached project timeline.)

Plans for the week ending 4/20/01:
?	Continue IT development of Phase I items.
?	Obtain sign-off for GTV-II, Phase 2 issues and timeline.
?	Commence IT development of Phase 2 issues.

Issues:
Incompatibility of TIBCO version 5.x and 6.x. The single point of deal entry is done using TIBCO 6.x. Some users are still using TIBCO 5.x. Upgrading to either TIBCO 6.x or Windows 2000 is needed.
