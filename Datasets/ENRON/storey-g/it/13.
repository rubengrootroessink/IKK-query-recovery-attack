Geof,

Per our conversation, would you please provide us with the followings?

Criteria to filter deals. In other words, individual field names that are used to filter deals and features with those fields.
Do you want to see daily position beyond the next day?
How do we handle Gas Daily deals?

Thanks

Zhiyong
