o	A new task has been added due to the requirement of loading prior-day curves into Position Manager (Please see the attached project timeline.)
o	Changes for Position Manager are in progress (Please see the attached project timeline.)
?	Single point of deal entry for term deals:
o	Single point of deal entry is now ready for user acceptance testing.
?	Gas Daily deals:
o	Changes to ERMS PortCalc application for the Gas Daily deals are complete and ready for testing.
o	Changes to TDS deal valuation are in progress and on schedule (please see the attached project timeline.)
o	A new task has been added to flag fixed-price positions (please see the attached project timeline.)
?	Live feeds for Gas Daily/intra-month curves:

Plans for the week ending 4/20/01:
?	Continue IT development of Phase I items.
?	Obtain sign-off for GTV-II, Phase 2 issues and timeline.
?	Commence IT development of Phase 2 issues.

Issues:
Incompatibility of TIBCO version 5.x and 6.x. The single point of deal entry is done using TIBCO 6.x. Some users are still using TIBCO 5.x. Upgrading to either TIBCO 6.x or Windows 2000 is needed.

 
Thanks

Zhiyong
