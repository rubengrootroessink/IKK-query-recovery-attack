I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the 
analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the 
IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any 
divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - 
I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit 
down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

Louise
