Geof,

The information about Industry type may not exist in global counterparties. However, we are working on creating one. Please let me know if you want us to do otherwise.

Thanks

Zhiyong

	Also Hunter wants to be able to classify the counterparties according to Industry type (i.e. producers, utility, pulp/paper, auto)
	Does that information exist in global counterparties database, SIC codes maybe?

	I want a document by wednesday next week.

Geof,

Per our conversation, would you please provide us with the followings?

Criteria to filter deals. In other words, individual field names that are used to filter deals and features with those fields.
Do you want to see daily position beyond the next day?
How do we handle Gas Daily deals?

Thanks

Zhiyong
