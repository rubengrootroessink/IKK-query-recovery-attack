I had called but you were out.

Zhiyong had ask me to look into the GTV Live feed projects (see below).
I have seen the Curve manager spreadsheet.  I would like you to point me
in the right direction by:
	- telling me who are the traders who are requesting this changes.
	- can I get a copy of spreadsheets that they want the live feed on?
	- how many spreadsheets are we changing?
	- etc...

Issue 4:  Live feeds for Gas Daily/intra-month curves

?	Develop live feed capability for intra-month curves just like we have for basis, etc.
Once this capability is complete, traders will have to set new curves.  We expect the curves to be set as follows:  The Henry Hub intra-month curve will be tied to the NYMEX feed.  Most (if not all) other curves will be tied to the Henry Hub intra-month curve in some way.  Traders will have to set differentials.

Developing the live feed capability for intra-month curves is feasible, and the development timeline from the IT group is 3 weeks (see project timeline).
