I have to pay $25 because I forgot what my score was? 

I'm not asking for an official copy to be sent to a school.
I don't need some fancy transcipt that I can hand to someone.
I was just curious what my scores were.

I paid for the test once and I'm not paying again. 

Great customer service.

Thank you for contacting GMAT.

Official score reports contain the three most recent score results achieved
in the last 5 years.  However, score reports for scores achieved 5 to 20
years ago are still available for reporting.

Although GMAT score records are retained for 20 years, many institutions
will not accept scores which are more than five years old because they
present special interpretation problems.  We suggest that you contact the
institution(s) to which you are applying to determine whether they will
accept older scores.

The fee is US$25 for each score report requested.  Additional score report
requests will be processed for mailing to you and the designated
institutions within one week after being received at ETS-GMAT.  NOTE:
Recipients indicated on an Additional Score Report Request Form cannot be
changed or deleted.

Unfortunately, we do not accept additional score report requests via e-mail
or internet.  To obtain a copy of your GMAT score report or to send copies
of your report to recipients, you will need to request an additional score
report by one of the following methods:

-Complete the Additional Score Report Request Form you receive with your
score report and mail it with the fee to the address on the form.  If you do
not enclose the fee, your request will be returned to you.  Checks and money
orders should be payable to GMAT-ETS.

-You may fax (609)883-4349 or telephone (609)771-7330 your request if paying
by Visa, MasterCard, or American Express.  Please include credit card number
and expiration date.

-Mail a letter requesting additional score reporting to ETS at one of the
following addresses:
