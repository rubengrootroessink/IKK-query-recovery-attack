?	The user acceptance test for Cash Position in TDS has been held up by the PortCalc changes.
?	For phase 1 Single Point of Deal Entry for Term Deals, the user acceptance test uncovered some additional work needed. The team has been working closely with Geof, Chuck, Russ and George to provide the needed functionalities.
?	The user has been testing the changes for Gas Daily Options (Phase 2) for the last few weeks. IT development was completed a few weeks ago. No new changes have been requested.
