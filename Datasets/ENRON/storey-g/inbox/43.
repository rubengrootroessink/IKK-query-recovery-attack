  I'm looking at the GDP-HEHUB curve shift details, and it has a current price of 0, and prior price of 4.151 for August. Position manager's getting this from the deal aggregator, which grabs it from ERMS. It appears to be using the mid price off of deals. So if we look at post ID 1159936, deal Q29897.2, we have GDP-HEHUB for the pub code, and 4.151 as the mid price for August. My question for you fine gentlemen is, where should it be pulling the prior day curve value? Should I just hit egs_curves, and insert the value from there?
