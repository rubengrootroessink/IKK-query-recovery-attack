Sorry Craig, I keep misspelling Geoff's last name and sending stuff to you inadvertently.

Russell, 
I agree with all of Jeff's comments on both the GPA and the PMA.  I primarily have questions about the GPA, because I do not understand the Kalkaska issue they are trying to address.  It seems that they are wanting to limit us, while at the same time not limit us.  As for the PMA, the problems that Jeff notes are problematic.  Please let me know when we can meet to discuss and please give me the courtesy of seeing the next draft before it goes to MGU.
Regards,
Ed
