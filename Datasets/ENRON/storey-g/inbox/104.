Louise and Geoff,

Please review the attached Statement Of Work of the new gas system project and provide me with your comments by next Friday, 10/12/01. I would like to request your signature after your review of the document. By the way, Beth Perlman, Steve Stock and Richard Burchfield have read the Statement Of Work.

Thanks
