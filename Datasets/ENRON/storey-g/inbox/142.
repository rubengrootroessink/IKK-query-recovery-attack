1. IU News Roundup
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* IU's overall retention rate is up nearly 1 percent. The retention rate is
the percentage of first-year students who come back for their second year of
study. On IU's eight campuses, 69.8 percent of first-year students in 2000
returned for the 2001 fall semester. That compares to 69 percent of the 1999
class returning in 2000. On the individual campuses, retention was up at
IUPUI, IPFW, IU Northwest, and IU South Bend. It declined at IU Bloomington,
IU East, IU Kokomo, and IU Southeast. The full retention report is available
at http://www.indiana.edu/~rrlilly/

* IU's Business Outlook Panel toured the state in November, including stops
at various IU campuses. The business experts said the country is in a
recession, but they expect the economic situation to begin a slow recovery in
the spring after a slow holiday shopping season. See
http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/ocm/releases/forecast02.htm

* The holiday weekend was a big one for IU sports. With a 13-7 victory over
Purdue in the rain on Nov. 24, IU won the Old Oaken Bucket for the first time
since 1996. IU's soccer Hoosiers advanced to the third round of the NCAA
tournament with a 1-0 victory over Michigan State on Nov. 25. And the men's
basketball team won two of three games in the Great Alaska Shootout. For
details, see the IU athletics Web site at http://www.iuhoosiers.com

* The 11th annual IU Dance Marathon in October raised $405,412.17 for Riley
Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. A total of 550 participants danced
during 36 hours for the project. Over the 11 years of the Dance Marathon, IU
students have raised more than $2 million. For more details, see
