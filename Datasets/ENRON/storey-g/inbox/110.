Hi Geoff,

I'm really sorry to hear about your father.  I hope that everything is
getting better now after all that terrible thing.  I'll pray for him too.

I'm glad to hear that you already have a daughter.  My youngest son is
slightly older than your daughter.  He is eight-month old.

I'm still doing commodity trading like before, rice, tapioca and yellow
maize.  Now we are also investing on Corn Oil project.

Well, just keep in touch Geoff,  write to me when you have time.

Harry

have been difficult. He had funeral services for him on Saturday. Sorry
to drop such terrible news on you.

Storey. Things were going great before Tuesday. i am woring at Enron as
a natural gas trader and love my job.

Hi Geoff,

How are you doing?  I's been awhile since the last time I wrote.  I'm
just
worried about all my friends in the States after the attack of WTC.  I
just
want to make sure that you are find.

The last time you wrote to me you're engaged already.  Are you married
now,
or maybe you have kids already.

Write me back, ok.

Best regards,
Hariyono
