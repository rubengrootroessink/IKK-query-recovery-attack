Jeff,

	I spoke with Jay briefly about the potential of archiving all physical deals every night into a separate database instead
of deleting them.  We currently are capturing that information in our database, but the feed Jay has is more extensive and reliable.
We'd then be able to build some historical queries and facilitate some of the requests we have for this data, I don't anticipate it
would take much time to do this.

You have any objections?

Thanks,

Dave
