This is who both Wanda and Meredith Eggleston used to help them set up their trust.  He is suppose to specialize in Estate and Trust preparation.  I told Mom this morning that I was not confident that Larry has the detail knowledge that we need to get this all set up properly.  She agreed and she said she did not have a problem if we got a second opinion on everything.
