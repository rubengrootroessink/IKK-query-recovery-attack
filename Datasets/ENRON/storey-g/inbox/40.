I'm in Houston this week and am available Thursday morning.  I would appreciate the opportunity to get together to discuss the intentions for disposition of the Sithe TCPL position.  I had figured that Geoff would value the pipe, take it in at a discounted position (paid for by Sithe with project equity), and then we would try to market it away at a higher value.  However, I have heard all kinds of different scenarios from within the company and would like to clarify this.
Please let me know if I can catch some time with you Thursday (June 7th) morning to review this.  Thanks.
