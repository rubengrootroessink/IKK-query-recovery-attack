Hello to all:

I am raising money for Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and I would like to reach a goal of $1000.00 and would greatly appreciate if anybody in our group would like to donate to this cause.  It doesn't matter how much $1.00, $5, $10 or $20 the amount doesn't matter.  The kids who have this disease would greatly appreciate any kind of help.  I have attached a letter to help explain more about Juvenile Diabetes.  This is the second year that I have joined Enron to help raise money and last year we were the biggest company who donated the most.  Thank you and May God Bless You.

 

I will be collecting money until Oct. 26.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me @ 713-345-4411.

Thank you,

Virginia Cavazos
