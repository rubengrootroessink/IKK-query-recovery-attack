Hello,

In case that you sent any message to me in the last week, please re-send
it, because the company that gives me Internet service put some filters in
their system (to avoid viruses) and I did not get most of my messages.

Please erase the phrase "Hi, how are you" in case that it is in your
message (this was the main filter).

Thanks,

Veronica Tapia
