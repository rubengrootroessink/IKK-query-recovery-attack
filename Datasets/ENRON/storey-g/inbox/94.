Goss,
I am out next week so I thought I would give you an update on Basis options reports.  Francis sent me the first 3 today.  They were absolute crap the numbers weren't even close.  I met with him and another guy and we went over the reports and I told them how to arrive at the numbers.  I also gave them my report with numbers for them to tie out to.
Errol has the numbers to get in touch with me if you need anything.
