Geoff,
 
To confirm the deal we did today, you bought the physical x1h2 Dawn Parkway spread at $0.065 US/MMBtu from Lambie.  We used NX1+0.20 for Dawn and NX1+0.265 for Parkway.  To clarify, you bought Parkway at +0.265 and sold Dawn at +0.20.  Calgary is entering the trade.  Thanks.
 
Steve Burnham
