Management

This important message will appear in the upcoming Operations Update.

MMC is committed to assisting the families of our colleagues through=20
this most difficult time.  We want to make sure that they are aware of=20
all the programs and services the Company is providing and that they=20
fully understand the benefits to which they are entitled, as well as=20
other benefits that may be available through outside agencies.  In=20
reviewing the most effective way to continue serving the families=20
affected by the September 11th disaster, we have made the decision to=20
move to a family relationship management approach.  Our priority in=20
moving forward is to ensure that we provide the families with the best=20
one-on-one assistance and the best information possible.

Family Relationship Management
To that end, we have engaged Right Management Associates (Right) to=20
work with us as our Family Relationship Managers.  Reginald McQuay, a=20
Marsh Senior Vice President, will manage this program as the main=20
interface between Marsh and Right=01,s counselors to guide this important=
=20
process.  All of the Family Relationship Managers have substantial=20
experience in Human Resources, and we feel they will represent us well=20
as we help the families move forward.  Additionally, Right has worked=20
with Marsh over the last several years and, therefore, knows our=20
organization well.

We are already moving quickly to transition to this process.  The=20
Family Relationship Managers have participated in detailed orientation=20
and training sessions, acquainting themselves with MMC=01,s benefits,=20
legal, communication and policy issues.  Each of the families will be=20
contacted within the next week by the Family Relationship Managers =20
representing Marsh; in this way the transition will be as transparent=20
as possible to the families.  In addition, a letter will be sent to=20
each family's primary contact this week, providing them with the name=20
and phone number of their Relationship Manager.

One important point that you need to be aware of concerns the =01&primary=
=20
contact=018 for each family.  We have been working with the MMC Benefits=20
and Legal Departments to determine whom the appropriate family contact=20
for all matters should be as we move forward.  Please keep in mind that=20
this individual may not always be the person with whom you have had=20
contact.  We are trying to ensure that the detailed financial and=20
benefit information is only provided to the family members who should=20
have it.=20

Additional Counseling
We will also be offering Survivor Support Financial Counseling to the=20
primary contact through the Ayco Company.  Ayco counselors will provide=20
detailed information on survivor benefits and will also be arranging to=20
meet personally with each of the families.  This will follow issuance=20
of the benefit summary statement, which is scheduled to be distributed=20
during the week of October 15.  Ayco counselors will be coordinating=20
their efforts with the Family Relationship Managers as well.

In addition, we have expanded the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for=20
one year for the families.  This will provide access to counselors who=20
are skilled in grief and trauma situations.

Your Role As A Manager
We recognize that in many instances Marsh managers have had long=20
relationships with the various families.  Although it is important to=20
maintain those contacts and continue to provide emotional support, it=20
is equally important that you begin to transfer the responsibility for=20
information dissemination and management to the Family Relationship=20
Managers.  To this end, we are asking that you allow the Family=20
Relationship Managers to facilitate the contact with all Marsh services=20
and that you do not provide direct referrals to services, promise any=20
additional services or become the intermediary in resolving the=20
families=01, issues.=20

Please keep us informed of your contact with any of the families since=20
this information can be  helpful to Family Relationship Managers.  To=20
help facilitate this, we have attached a call log to capture important=20
information from both past conversations and any particulars that may=20
arise in the future.  Please forward these logs to Reg McQuay at 1166=20
Ave. of the Americas, 43rd floor (reginald.a.mcquay@marsh.com).=20

This Family Relationship Management Program will provide the best=20
possible support for our colleagues=01, families as they move forward=20
during this difficult time.  If you have any further questions please=20
call me or your HR manager, and help us by distributing this memo to=20
other managers who need to know this information.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sally Bott
