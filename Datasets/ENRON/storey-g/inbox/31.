Congratulations!  This email is to confirm that your child/children will be
enrolled in the inaugural class of Enron Kids' Center September 1, 2001!  We
are excited to welcome your family to our state-of-the-art program and
facility!  The operator of the Enron Kids' Center, Knowledge Beginnings,
will send written notification to you of acceptance of enrollment on April
30, 2001.

In order to hold your child/children's space in the Enron Kids' Center, you
must send a non-refundable registration payment to Knowledge Beginnings.
You will have 15 calendar days to pay the enrollment fee of either $75 per
family if one child is enrolled or $125 per family if more than one child is
enrolled.  If payment of the enrollment fee has not been received by
Knowledge Beginnings by the close of the business day on May 15, 2001, your
space(s) will be forfeited.  Forfeited spaces are treated as new openings
and will be filled from the waiting list.  After payment of your enrollment
fee but prior to the opening of the Enron Kids' Center, should you decide
not to enroll your child in the center for reasons other than relocation,
termination of employment with Enron, or extenuating circumstances, the
enrollment fee will also be forfeited.

Please send your check to:

Knowledge Beginnings/Enron Kids' Center
4340 Redwood Highway Building B
San Rafael, CA  94903

If you have any questions, please call the Knowledge Beginnings customer
service center at 1-877-CHILDHOOD.

We look forward to welcoming you to the Enron Kids' Center this fall!
