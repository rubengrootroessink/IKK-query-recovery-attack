Hi Geoff:
 
I'm sorry I did not get back to you yesterday.  I was out of the office.
 
I received your request regarding the contingent beneficiary for your father's life insurance, SIP, SAPP and Voluntary Cash Deferral Plan.  Unfortunately, Ayco does not have access to this information. For all of these types of requests, Marsh has asked that the requesting party send a letter to Marsh & McLennan to the special UP.OF. Box that has been set up:
 
Benefits Processing - WATCH
UP.OF. Box 2002
New York, NY  10108-2002
 
If we can be of any further assistance, please let us know.
 
 
Kay B. Cairns
The Ayco Company, I.UP.
