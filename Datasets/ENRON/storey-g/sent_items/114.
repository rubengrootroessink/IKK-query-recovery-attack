Subject:	Nipsco Power Transition to EnergyUSA-TPC Corp.

As you are aware, NiSource has been planning for some time now to move the
forward/options book of physical power business to its energy marketing and
trading subsidiary, EnergyUSA-TPC Corp.  You should have received a letter
this week detailing the deals that will be moved with this transition.
EnergyUSA-TPC Corp will begin trading physical power tomorrow, November 1,
2001.

I have set filters on ICE for your company and would like for you to do the
same.  I know that our traders actively trade together on this platform.

If you have any concerns or issues you would like to discuss, please call
me.
