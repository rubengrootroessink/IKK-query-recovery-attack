No this is definitely not the final document.. Issues 1-3 are correct and complete, but 4 & 5 are not. 
I imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone. 

While we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type 
for basis options.

I take it this is not your final document?
