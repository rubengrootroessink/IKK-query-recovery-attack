Oops, another outstanding item...

Could you please provide me with the date of purchase of your Tibco and
Nasdaq 100 shares.  You gave me the cost per our phonecall, but I forgot to
get the acquisition dates from you.

Thanks,

Vicki

Hi, Geoff,

I have not received your list of charitable donations.  Please send (fax)

Thanks so much,
