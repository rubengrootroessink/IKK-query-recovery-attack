Larry,

Sorry I haven't contacted you in awhile with regard to the probate list of assets. We will be disclaiming various Life Insurance and JROS accounts. Harvey Cohen reffered a Trust lawyer to us by the name of Theresa Frierson (713-621-7007). We are going to have her do the legal work on the disclaiming and trust setup.

When the disclaiming process is done, she can coordinate with you the final list of probate assets so you can finish the court work.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,

Geof
