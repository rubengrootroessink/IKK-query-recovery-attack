All is well. Vicki left the hospital the first week in Feb. She's been in bed at home since. 
We're now at 31 weeks and the doctor said she wants to induce around 36/37 weeks. 
So we may only have 5 weeks left !!! 

We got all excited this weekend cause we bought a car seat and stroller. 
I push the stroller around the house with a teddy bear in it, pretending to be a daddy.

Chow,


Geof
