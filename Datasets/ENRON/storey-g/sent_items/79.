Chris	

I need a 10 and 5 year service out of Dec 2003. 

Enron has the right to to receive firm Consumer's CDA in exchange for firm Dawn. Enron will notify Enbridge by nomination deadlines the day before gas flow.  

Enron will pay a demand charge on 10,000/day of  ________us$/mm.

Volumes is 0-10,000 mmbtu.

Term is March-November or April - October. We could also do it where it is January - December with Enbridge having the right to recall the service 10 or 20 days each year. 

Let me knwo.
