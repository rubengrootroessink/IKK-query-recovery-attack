This document contains information for our IT Budget review meeting scheduled for this Wed. at 1:00.  Most people will be calling in via a conf. call (see meeting notice for details); otherwise it is in ECN 1835.

Objectives - review part of the 2002 IT costs & allocations for ENA, answer any questions, and obtain your approval to proceed with these projects.

The attached spreadsheet contains all the IT projects being allocated to ENA.  We will only review the projects in blue.  The list contains the name of the project (column C), Project Description (column D), Allocation Basis (column N), EA Allocation % (column O), and Costs being allocated to EA (column P).

Thanks.  Joe.
