I want my harper gas! come on Tony!

I would rather pay 3 to  3.5cents for the vent harper transport, but if 4 cents is the closer i'd pay that for 2 years

Tony hasn't returned from Vegas yet.  As of Friday, he thought that he could still get some harper gas. 

 Sorry for the delay.  I don't really understand why takes so long, but I suspect it's the people TC deals with.  He is pretty diligent, but they don't always give him a straight answer

It looks like we are going to release most of NBPL capacity that we have (55,000 of the 100,000).  Mirant & BP want the Haper to Chicago capacity for $.08 and Dynergy wants Vent to Chicago for $.12.  PGL wants to exchange their manhattan to North Hayden for the remaining Vent to harper, so there may an opportunity to have PGL buy Vent and sell you Harper, but dealing with PGL is even slower that dealing with Tony.

I'll talk to Tony as soon as I see him

Nothing done yet, but TC is coming in tomorrow for a special Friday workplace appearance to try to close something.  Actually, his tee-time is canceled due to weather
