Steve,

As per your discussions with Bill Bradford I am working on reducing your physical risk to Enron.

I am talking with several counterparties on ringing out your positions. Can you give me your phone number so we can discuss this or give me a call at 713-853-7058.

Thanks,

Geof Storey
Director Trading
