The confirms look good. Send them with Exhibit A and have them return signed copies that include Exhibit B, which will be a copy of the confirm b/w BMO and Reliant.

Call me if you have any questions.

Geoff - 

Attached for your approval are four confirmations for the Ring Trades done among Enron,
Reliant, and Bank of Montreal:

 << File: Ring - BOM YH2563.1.doc >>  << File: Ring Trade - Reliant YH2564.1.doc >>  << File: Ring Trade BOM - YH2566.1.doc >>  << File: Ring Trade - Reliant YH2567.1.doc >> 

You will note that an Exhibit A is attached to each confirm - but  can you tell me from
whom at both counterparties I can obtain the Exhibit B (transaction b/t Reliant and BOM)
in order to attach that as well.  

Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Diane
