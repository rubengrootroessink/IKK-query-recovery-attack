Darla,
Attached is the final reconciliation for Citizens.  This reconciliation is to repay Citizens for volumes we already recouped from LGS Natural Gas Company.  We have included in this calculation the premium, transport costs, fuel and the capacity release credit of $.06 which amounts $241,204.73 due Citizens. 

Citizens would like to receive payment as soon as possible.

In future invoices, we will also see an adjustment for LGS (now Woodward Marketing) volumes to prevent these overpayments from happening.

Please let me know when Citizens can expect payment and call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa
