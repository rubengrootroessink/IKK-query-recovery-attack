Jay,
Good speaking with you this morning.  I appreciate your referrals for the
positions we spoke about.  Please send me your details if you've updated
your career history so that I can let you know what we have come up in
Houston or Dallas for the new year.  If you send me your home address I can
mail you some information about our company and the areas we focus on as
well.
Regards,
Rosanna
