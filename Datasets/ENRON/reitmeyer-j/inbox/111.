Hi, Just thought I would let you know that Mom and Dad are not coming here for a visit as Mom is Having problems with her back and can't travel. I tried anyway. We are still planning on coming on the 12th and will go spend the day with them on the 13th. Meg bought a new car Saturday ( silver-blue VW Pissat ). Guess who will be buying her old car? Dad wants a smaller car to run to the store etc. so he couldn't turn it down. He still makes remarks about having to give up the Acclaim so I hope this pacifies him. Hope everything is OK down there. The weather has been Picture-Perfect here. Lyn is now telling people about the pregnancy but we haven't told anyone in Hitchcock yet . Thought we would do that when we go unless she tells them first. Love, Mom
