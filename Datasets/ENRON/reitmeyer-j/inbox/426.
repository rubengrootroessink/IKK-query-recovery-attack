Hey Jay,

Just wanted to let you know that I resigned from Enron yesterday and took my job back at Wilkens Weather.   No, just kidding -with Energy USA over in the Galleria area.  They are a smaller, less sexier and more conservative company than Enron but then we all know what can happen to a "sexy" company. 

Anyway, I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Keep in touch -you can use this address for now until I know my new address at work.  You never know if one may have to return a favor sometime in the future.  

See ya,

JR
