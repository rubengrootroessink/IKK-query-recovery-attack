Hi All, 

All reports have been generated and the Analysts PC's that participate in the production run verified able 
to run reports and access the Report Settings database on the new server. 

Although, at this moment an exact cause is not known.  We'll be looking into the report log and a number of 
other places to determine the cause of the problem and will communicate this to you with a plan to ensure 
Reporting is safe and sound tomorrow morning. 

If you need me please call or stop by.

Thanks
Kim
