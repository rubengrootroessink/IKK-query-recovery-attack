Hi Jay -
 
Sorry - 1 mistake.
The link should read 
<http://www.berean-houston.org//Judge_House/form_results.htm>
 
not ***.txt
 
My bad - sorry.
 
Bruno <><

Hi Jay,
 
I'm running a test on the first page.
 
You should have received an E-mail. I filled out the first form and submitted it, just like someone registering would do. The system should have sent you an E-mail in the background.
 
In addition, you can check accumulative results at this Web Page:
<http://www.berean-houston.org//Judge_House/form_results.txt>
 
To test the page youself, go to the Judgement House link on our Web Site. Click on the link, and go to the page on Judgement House. Scroll to the very bottom of the page. You will see an asterix below the last line "It does make a difference..." Click on the asterix - that will take you to the test page.
 
Let me know what you think, and if you would like to see any changes.
 
Once we agree on that page, I'll build the second page for groups and we'll test it. Once that's done, then we'll create the links on the Judgement House Page.
 
In Him,
Bruno <><

Hi Bruno,
 
I looked at the web-site and it looks great.  We probably just need to add the following sentence to the end of your text block after the phone number.  It should contain hyperlinks to 2 separate forms.  Both forms can be e-mailed to this address... jennsreit@houston.rr.com <mailto:jennsreit@houston.rr.com>
 
 
"Or please fill out the on-line registration form for groups of 10 or more or individual families."
 
 
The form can be in any format easy for you to design and should include the following information for groups:
 
Group Name
Contact Name
Number in Group
Desired Presentation Date
Desired Presentation Time
Contact Phone Number
*Contact Address
*Contact E-mail Address
*Additional Comments
 
*optional 
 
 
and for individual families:
 
Name

Number in Group
Desired Presentation Date
Desired Presentation Time
Phone Number
*Address
*E-mail Address
*Additional Comments
 
*optional
 
 
If you think that 1 form is enough and easier for you to create then we can use the one for groups.  I just want to make it as simple as possible for people to register and to not make it look like we are only accepting groups.  Use your judgement on that one, it does not really matter to me.
 
Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thank you for your help.
 
Always for Him
 
Jay
 
p.s.  We also might want to add the word "strongly" before recommended.  We want to place as many people in time slots prior to the event.
