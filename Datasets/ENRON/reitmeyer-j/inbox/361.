Dear Kelly,

My name is Carole Frank and I am in West Risk Management for natural gas.  

I spoke with Russ about a request I had and he referred me to you.  My trader needs a rate server handle set up for the Gas Daily Published point "PSCo citygate".  My trader entered a deal with this point and someone in confirmations informed me that SITARA said it was an invalid index.  Please help!  

Carole C, Frank
