Jay,
 The billing contact is Beth Holland 406-497-4288.  I checked with Beth to
see if the account is current.  It looks like October has not been paid yet.
Payment terms are 14 days after the date of the bill, November is dated the
14th which makes the due date the 28th.
  For any transport questions regarding storage activity call Jim Griffin
406-497-2806 or myself at 406-497-2649.  I also e-mail a daily statement to
Jackie Adams if you need to check on month to date activity.

Thanks, Connie
