This was sent to me and I thought you might be interested in voting
yourself.

Dear voter,

The host of ABC's "Politically Incorrect," Bill Maher, is under fire for

calling recent U.S. military actions in the Middle East "cowardly."  On
Wednesday, White House Press Secretary called Maher's comments "a
terrible
thing to say" and said, "This is not a time for remarks like that; there

never is."

While Maher says his criticisms were directed at politicians - not our
servicemen and women - many have called for the show to be cancelled.

Log on to  http://www.vote.com  to tell ABC whether or not "Politically
Incorrect" should be taken off the air. When you vote, your opinion will
be
automatically sent to the network.

Be sure to forward this message to friends and family so they can vote
too!

Thank you.
