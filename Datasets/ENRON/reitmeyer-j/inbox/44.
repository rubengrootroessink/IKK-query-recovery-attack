We've identified the cause of the reporting failures on the analysts PCs this morning 
to be Cube Security related.  During the migration we'd checked the Cube Admin
console to ensure all users were migrated successfully.

Although all users were displayed, we found this morning that  only IT accounts  still had 
access to the cube.  We've since refreshed and update the cube user list and the analyst
accounts are now again able to run reports without incident. 

To be sure check the status tonight and come in prior to 7am if there are any problems.

thanks, 
Kim
