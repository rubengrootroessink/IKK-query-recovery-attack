I need to take a few hours off Tuesday afternoon after lunch.  I have some family business to attend to.  I should only be gone 2 hours or so.  Susan will be here to handle EOL.  Let me know if you have a problem with this.  I know I need to be here, but this is something I have to take care of and this was the only time I could schedule it.

Thanks,

Jay
