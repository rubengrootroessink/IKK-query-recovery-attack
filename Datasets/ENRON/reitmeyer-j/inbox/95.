FYI

Lisa Finley just called me to let me know that Devon Operators need to take Beaver Creek down tomorrow for 8 hours.  They apologize for the short notice, but said if they don't fix the cooler now it will bring the whole system down soon.  

We will be short by about 6,500 on the 005 contract for Gas Day 4 and I guess we'll have to work at paying it back.


That's all I have to say .....about that.
