Here is some more bullshit from CIG.  I wish they could get these tie-ins going!  I'll be out of the office Wednesday returning Friday late morning.  I'll be calling you but if you need me call me on my cell (303) 810-5708.  Tell Matt "Broncos all the way!"

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

Based on your concerns and requests for additional notice prior to
commissioning each additional segment, we are adopting the following
procedure for placing segments in service:

We will notify you when we have filed each segment with FERC for approval.
Based on our experience with the tie-ins to date, we are now anticipating 4
days for approval.  Upon receiving FERC approval, we will notify you of the
contract in service date for that segment of capacity. The contract will
start at the later of the following dates:  1) two days following the date
of FERC approval; 2) 4 days following filing with FERC; or 3) at least one
week following the last in service date.

For example, we officially filed for the second segment approval (61
Mdth/day) September 25 (today) and anticipate filing the next segment (79
Mdth/day) on October 1.  If we receive FERC approval tomorrow, we will
notify you, but the contract will not become effective until Sept 29.
However, you would have additional capacity available a couple days early at
$.1434.

Hopefully, the above procedure will help you to plan for your nominations by
providing more flexability and notice for each additional commissioning.
Please call me to discuss or with any questions.

Laine Lobban
