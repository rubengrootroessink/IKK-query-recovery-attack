We have made a commitment to each other and to God.  We have brought three
children into this world who deserve more than just THIS Christmas.  I don't
understand your feeling and maybe you don't either, but as far as I am
concerned we are in it together.  You might not let me in, but I will keep
trying until it gets better.  We have to get some help to deal with this and
help us get through this, but giving up on this family just isn't an option.
We can change it through compromise, but ending it will hurt our children
the most. Is that what you want?
