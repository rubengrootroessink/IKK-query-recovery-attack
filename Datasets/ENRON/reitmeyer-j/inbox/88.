I was reading an interview with O'reilly and a widow from cantor.  A
reporter said that The CEO took over the company when Mr. Cantor was on his
deathbed!  The CEO was barred from attending the funeral.  This guy sounds
like such a jerk.  This widow has an infant and 4 yr. old-girls.  She has a
big mortage and lives paycheck to paycheck.  She hasn't received any money
from anywhere but family and friends.  The red cross called her the day of
the interview about paying for funeral expenses.  How many stories are there
like this?
