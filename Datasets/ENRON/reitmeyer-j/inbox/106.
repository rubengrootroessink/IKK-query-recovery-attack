Subject:=09Competitive Analysis Update #26- US Response to Terrorism
Importance:=09High


See below for update on situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus=
 plans in Congress.

RJ

1. =09The War on the Ground

For the most part, the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the s=
pecial forces "inserted" into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden. The special =
forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use th=
e collected intelligence from various sources to "snatch" bin Laden and oth=
ers, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircr=
aft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikel=
y to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.

Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu=
rrently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the g=
round and some special operation forces "in-country."  Also,  British Speci=
al Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de =
Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Adv=
ance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a we=
ek ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just wes=
t of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to =
Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored A=
C-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases=
 near Tashkent in Uzbekistan.=20

The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower,=
 ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-=
14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups t=
he US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS =
Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In additio=
n the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron aro=
und the HMS Invincible.

Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide =
air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alli=
ance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban. =20

Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pak=
istan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and t=
he actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a mini=
mum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their in=
telligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.

2.=09Fiscal Stimulus Outlook
By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m=
easures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the =
$55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed.=
=20
Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preferen=
ce over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to an=
esthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves=
 are beginning to go raw over corporate "bailouts" that have not yet includ=
ed anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of=
 the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec=
ts:
?=09Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item =
to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are pro=
bably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directl=
y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it =
can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big num=
ber if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes in=
to Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be c=
areful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both=
 the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is li=
kely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn.=20
?=09Accelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the rig=
ht medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you hav=
e already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the bud=
get flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those wh=
o pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, b=
ut not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear t=
hat they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than "t=
he rich." Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in.=
=20
?=09Capital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It=
 is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities fo=
r anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off you=
r list.=20
?=09Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining=
 programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is symp=
athetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There=
 are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but t=
he totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and heal=
th care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into s=
hock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promis=
ed them support for some serious version of these programs in return for ba=
iling out the airlines without clogging the debate with "airline worker ass=
istance" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still=
 try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-hous=
e rebellion.=20
?=09Cut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be v=
irtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut i=
s something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to=
 achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, bu=
t if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worke=
r assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an =
early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that =
seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been runni=
ng into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal co=
rporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay o=
n something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative =
Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is th=
at companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse=
ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calcula=
ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened =
companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirer=
s depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses tha=
t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and =
the value of those deductions would obviously drop.=20
?=09Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vas=
t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t=
he same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to=
 delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that=
 all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed=
, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and o=
n which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no w=
ay to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the acce=
lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done=
 for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC=
. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, ther=
e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is=
 likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't=
 exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies.=20
?=09Specific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaura=
nt and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in =
mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handi=
cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p=
ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to=
 make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 =
billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail=
, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit =
sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make=
 the cut others will not, but they can add up fast.=20
?=09Fast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional lead=
ers that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the Preside=
nt would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade d=
eals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democr=
ats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. I=
f he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has =
some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn'=
t cost anything.

We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week s=
ince the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in=
 the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time t=
o waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact.
