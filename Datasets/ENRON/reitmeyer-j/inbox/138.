Hi, You were right. A different, older man came today and wired the VCR separately. We now use four remotes to run the system. Each one has a different function depending on if we need the VCR for something. The original TV remote is only good for the source(toggles between the two different inputs). We have it figured out but anybody else would be stumped. We can't record HBO but that is not a priority. Hope we have no more problems. Give the kids a kiss for us. Love, Mom
