Hi, Guess you are back safe and sound. Hope you enjoyed the trip. We are full of allergies again.  Robert Thornton works for the NBC affiliate in TYLER . It is KETK but for some reason I can't access them on the computer. He is the morning weatherman. Dark hair, thin and glasses and appears to be about the right age. Lyn is still having problems and is miserable. More later. Mom
