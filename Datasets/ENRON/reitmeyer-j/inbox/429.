Jay,

Thanks for getting back to me.  I know that you are really busy and may not
have time to answer this but, any ideas on Christmas gifts for the girls?
Since we are driving to Indiana before going to Tyler and the car will be
pretty full, I would like to buy the gifts for the girls now and send them
back with Mom and Dad.  If clothing is a good option -- what sizes?  Also,
does Reagan wear any jewelry and if so, does she have a little jewelry box
or anything like that.  I thought about buying something that could be for a
'big girl' instead of toys.  However, I am open to any and all ideas -- I
want to get them something they will enjoy.  If you don't have time to
respond, please forward this to Jennifer.

As for my situation, my morning sickness seems to be getting a little
better.  I still have slight nausea in the morning but haven't lost my
breakfast since a week ago Monday.  I hope that this means I have turned
some sort of corner because it was really hard being sick every other
morning and fighting intense nausea every day.  Also, in the last week I
have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre.

Take care,
Lyn
