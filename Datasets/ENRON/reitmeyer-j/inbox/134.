Who says the power of prayer doesn't work? I am happy to report that my
dad's hip doesn't seem to be broken after all. The x-rays, and CAT scan show
no signs of a fracture, even though all symptoms indicated such a break. His
pain is gone and this morning he was able to "stand up" in the hospital
room. Later today they are going to do an MRI and a Bone Scan on him to see
what might have caused the pain and lack of movement in his leg. Please
continue to keep Gordon Martin in your prayers, and, Praise God that his hip
is not broken!

Promises 
by Dr. Bill Bright 
September 26, 2001
His Word Remains Forever 
Scripture: Matthew 24:36-42
<http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Matth
ew+24:36-42> 
35 "Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words remain forever" 
42 "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will
come."

Commentary: In a day of change and turmoil, the promise is made that the
word of God will stand forever. The significance of that guarantee is
monumental, incredible. It is not just that a book shall remain in print;
rather, it is that the multitudinous truths contained in that book likewise
will remain in effect steadfast and true. 
Long after heaven and earth have passed away God's holy Word will continue
to endure. 
That should mean much to you and me in our daily walk. God's promise, "All
things work together for good," to the believer is just as true today as it
was when it was written centuries ago. 
In fact, every one of the promises in the Word of God - including the 365
referred to in this daily devotional - is bona fide, guaranteed by the God
of the universe, the Creator of all things. That alone should strengthen our
faith to know that we can trust him supremely with our lives and everything
concerned with them. 
When all else fails, when hope is almost gone, we can come back to the Word
of God, which is "quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword." It
will have the answer for every problem, every burden, every need we face.
Prayer: The hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth. O God, the author of peace, to know
You is eternal life and to serve You is perfect freedom: Defend us, Your
humble servants, in all assaults of our enemies; that we, trusting in Your
defense, may not fear the power of any adversaries; through the might of
Jesus Christ our Lord. We celebrate our creation, preservation, and all the
blessings of this life; but above all for Your immeasurable love in the
redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace,
and for the hope of glory. And, we pray, give us such an awareness of Your
mercies, that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth Your praise, not
only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our selves to Your
service, and by walking before You in holiness and righteousness all our
days; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with You and the Holy Spirit,
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen. 

TODAY'S ACTION POINT: I will place my complete confidence in God's
unchanging Word and will rest upon His faithful promises to all believers
for supernatural living. 
Praise Report and Prayer Requests:
I want to express my gratitude to everyone for their prayers for Jack. He
did have his surgery last Tuesday. He made it through but is still in
intensive care and it was confirmed that the cancer has spread to his liver.
His chemo will be postponed till he is well enough to get into a room then
to his home. His recovery is slow but he did come off the ventilator Sunday
and actually took a drink of Sprite today--huge progress, praise God. I'd
like to put Wayne Owens on the prayer list also. As you know Wayne had renal
cancer about 5 or 6 years ago. He has been having muscular pain in his legs
and throughout his body--the pain was so severe he had to stop all athletic
activity. The doctors do not think it is cancer. Thank you sweet John. I
will keep you updated on both of these wonderful people. Brenda 

Hi John: An update on Dave... is back in intensive care after brain
surgery.. leak of brain fluid, had to be drained and now has
infection...must clear up infection, then they will put in a shunt to keep
fluid off the brain...we ask the Lord to continue to bless Dave with courage
to endure the pain and headaches and faith that that he will be allowed to
complete his mission here on earth.... The Lord never said this journey on
earth would be easy: he just said it would be worth it. 

I want to share a cute story that a friend passed on to me. He teaches
seminary each day to our youth.. A Sunday school teacher asked each student
if they knew another word for happiness. The word he was looking for was
Joy. Then he told the students to take each letter.. J is for Jesus, O is
for others, and Y is for yourself. The secret for having happiness in your
life is to put Jesus first, others next, and yourself last. Thought you
might want to pass this on to all our friends. Have a great day! Love, MJ 

Good Morning, Please keep my father, Gordon Martin, in your prayers today.
Yesterday was his 81st birthday, and to celebrate...he broke his hip! He was
sitting in his chair and tried to "get up" and hurt his hip area. He was
able to walk around yesterday and last night with a cane, but during the
night his right leg stiffened and was unable to move it this morning. His
doctor (Warren Longmire, who still makes house calls) came by this morning
and was almost 100% sure he had broken his hip. Dad is now at Clear Lake
Area Hospital with my Mom and a couple of my sisters. -bert-

Prayer Of Healing (by Max Lucado Sent In By Joe Collins)
This prayer was prayed by Max Lucado on Moody radio. He had prayed it in
his church worship service on Sunday.

Dear Lord, We're still hoping we'll wake up. We're still hoping we'll open
a sleepy eye and think, "What a horrible dream." But we won't, will we,
Father? What we saw was not a dream. Planes did gouge towers. Flames did
consume our fortress. People did perish. It was no dream and, dear Father,
we are sad.

There is a ballet dancer who will no longer dance and a doctor who will no
longer heal. A church has lost her priest, a classroom is minus a teacher.
Cora ran a food pantry. Paige was a counselor and Dana, dearest Father,
Dana was only three years old. (Who held her in those final moments?) We
are sad, Father. For as the innocent are buried, our innocence is buried as
well. We thought we were safe. Perhaps we should have known better. But we
didn't.

And so we come to you. We don't ask you for help; we beg you for it. We
don't request it; we implore it. We know what you can do. We've read the
accounts. We've pondered the stories and now we plead, "Do it again, Lord.
Do it again."

Remember Joseph? You rescued him from the pit. You can do the same for us.
Do it again, Lord.
Remember the Hebrews in Egypt? You protected their children from the angel
of death. We have children, too, Lord. Do it again.
And Sarah? Remember her prayers? You heard them. Joshua? Remember his
fears? You inspired him. The women at the tomb? You resurrected their hope.
The doubts of Thomas? You took them away. Do it again, Lord. Do it again.
You changed Daniel from a captive into a king's counselor. You took Peter
the fisherman and made him Peter an apostle. Because of you, David went
from leading sheep to leading armies. Do it again, Lord, for we need
counselors today, Lord. We need apostles. We need leaders. Do it again,
dear Lord.

Most of all, do again what you did at Calvary. What we saw here last
Tuesday, you saw there that Friday. Innocence slaughtered. Goodness
murdered. Mothers weeping. Evil dancing. Just as the smoke eclipsed our
morning, so the darkness fell on your Son. Just as our towers were
shattered, the very Tower of Eternity was pierced. And by dusk, heaven's
sweetest song was silent, buried behind a rock. But you did not waver, O
Lord. You did not waver. After three days in a dark hole, you rolled the
rock and rumbled the earth and turned the darkest Friday into the brightest
Sunday. Do it again, Lord. Grant us a September Easter.

We thank you, dear Father, for these hours of unity. Christians are praying
with Jews. Republicans are standing with Democrats. Skin colors have been
covered by the ash of burning buildings. We thank you for these hours of
unity. And we thank you for these hours of prayer. The Enemy sought to
bring us to our knees and succeeded. He had no idea, however, that we would
kneel before you. And he has no idea what you can do.

Let your mercy be upon our President, Vice President, and their families.
Grant to those who lead us wisdom beyond their years and experience. Have
mercy upon the souls who have departed and the wounded who remain. Give us
grace that we might forgive and faith that we might believe. And look
kindly upon your church. For two thousand years you've used her to heal a
hurting world. Do it again, Lord. Do it again.
Through Christ,
Amen.
