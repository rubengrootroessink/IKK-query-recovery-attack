Jackie, Shelly,
 
Would you call Adele and see if and/or how much our Medicine Bow capacity will be affected for the 30th?
We will have to make sure and sell the difference at Glenrock into KN.

Thanks.
Theresa

One unit at the Douglas Station on WIC will be out of service October 30, 2001 for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput for this period will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMcf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMCf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocation methods.
