Howdy!

We need your help!  Earlier this week, a letter was sent to you asking you to renew your support for The Association of Former Students in 2001.  Because of the time sensitivity of this request, we wanted to make sure you received this message via e-mail as well.

This year is almost over and The Association is just below our goal of raising six million dollars for Texas A&M in 2001.  We need your help to allow us to provide critical unrestricted funds to the University that directly support the students and former students of Texas A&M.

To learn more about how The Association supports Aggies everywhere and to donate on-line by December 31st, please visit www.AggieNetwork.com.

With your support, The Association has always met Texas A&M's financial needs.  Your continued support in 2001 and beyond will ensure the traditions and spirit that make Texas A&M so special to us all remain in tact.

Thank you and Gig 'em,

Matt Jennings '95
Director of Annual Giving
