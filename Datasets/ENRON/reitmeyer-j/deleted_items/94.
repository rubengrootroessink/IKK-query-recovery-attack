Just a note to thank you for playing CBS SportsLine.com 
Fantasy Baseball. We hope you enjoyed a successful season.

Your Fantasy league's web site will be accessible during the
offseason. However, sometime during the week of November 26, 
we must take your league off-line so we can prepare it for 
the offseason. 

After that week, your league will be accessible again, and
your most important data will remain available. This data 
includes final 2001 standings, rosters, schedule and results 
(in head-to-head leagues), the league transaction report, 
message board posts and league news articles.

If there are any other reports you'd like to keep, please 
visit your site this week and save them. You can do this by 
clicking the "sheet" icon above a report to open the report 
in a spreadsheet, and then saving the spreadsheet on your 
hard drive.

Thank you again for playing CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy 
Baseball. Have a great offseason, and please join us for 
Opening Day 2002!
 
CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy Staff
