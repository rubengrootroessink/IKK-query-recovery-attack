Bill here's the list of action items from our meeting today.

Network Segment -- Perhaps NAHOU-SQGN02P and NAHOU-SQFND01P were on different network segments and experiencing different traffic loads -- Bill will check into this.
Maintenance Schedule -- Performance might be related to disk backups -- Bill will check into this.
Resource Utilization -- Other processes might be gobbling up resources causing contention -- Bill will check into this.

Thanks for visiting with us today.
Kim
