After I, along with most of the western world, declared the Broncos the fav=
orites in the AFC West this fall, they've now been beaten to the kind of Ge=
rry Cooney pulp that makes their top-flight status quite shaky. They're the=
 third-highest scoring team in their own division, for crying out loud. (Sa=
n Diego 132, Oakland 131, Denver 123.) And quarterback Brian Griese has a b=
um throwing shoulder; he has far less zip on the ball. Trouble, with a capi=
tal T, especially now that he has to play without Ed McCaffrey. Even though=
 the Chargers have lost two straight weeks on the road to beatable Clevelan=
d and New England, you have to like their chances to win at a fever-pitched=
 Qualcomm. I like Doug Flutie to play big in a big game. Flutie and new off=
ensive coordinator Norv Turner have made some beautiful music together in t=
he first third of the season, which is pretty remarkable considering this i=
s about the 64th offense Flutie's had to learn since leaving Boston College=
. "It's tou! gh! when you have to keep learning new offenses,'' Flutie tell=
s me, "but you have to wipe the slate clean and start fresh. A lot of guys =
carry some baggage when they go from one place to another. You say, We used=
 to to do it this way, or call it such and such, and you think of it in tho=
se terms. But you have to erase that. I've been pretty good at doing that. =
And the bottom line here is, I believe in Norv Turner, and I will try to do=
 it his way. It's worked well so far."

mpa with the latest football news Sunday at 10 a.m. on NFL Preview.

What You Need to Know by SI's Peter King
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/black1x1.gif>


1. Butch Davis believes just what his old boss in Dallas, Jimmy Johnson, be=
lieves when it comes to draft choices. In jettisoning a player they were no=
t using prominently, defensive lineman Stalin Colinet, to Minnesota, the Br=
owns upgraded a seventh-round draft pick to a fifth-rounder. Now Cleveland =
has the most picks in the 2002 draft, 10, of any team in the league but exp=
ansion Houston.

2. With the No. 1 pick in next April's draft, Houston likely will not reach=
 for either of the two top-tier quarterbacks available, Oregon's Joey Harri=
ngton and Fresno State's David Carr. My sleeper picks for the Texans' Openi=
ng Day QB: Shane Matthews or that kid with the Texas name and California 't=
ude, Cade McNown.

3. Good for Mike Holmgren. He's not wavering on putting Matt Hasselbeck bac=
k in the lineup next week at Miami. Here's the thing with the Seahawks' QB =
situation: You'll never find the upside of Hasselbeck unless you play him. =
Remember, it was late in Brett Favre's second year as a starter when assist=
ant coaches on the Green Bay staff urged Holmgren to yank him. Hasselbeck n=
eeds time, even with the pennant race on the line.

4. Underrated Defensive Player of the Year so far: Pittsburgh rookie lineba=
cker Kendrell Bell, a force as an inside and outside player. He has 20 tack=
les and three sacks in his last three games. And doesn't that make the Cowb=
oys sick. This was the player Jerry Jones bypassed to select Quincy Carter,=
 trumping the Dallas draft board.

Unsung Heroes
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/black1x1.gif>
by CNNSI.com's Pat Kirwan =09

Wide receiver Hines Ward was supposed to watch two first-round draft picks =
take over starting roles at his position in Pittsburgh. But Plaxico Burress=
 and Troy Edwards haven't developed the way Ward has. In the past two weeks=
 he has caught 12 balls for 106 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, backup ru=
nning back Amos Zereoue has been giving the Steelers a change of pace when =
Jerome Bettis has needed a break. In the last two games, Zereoue has rushed=
 16 times for 102 yards. In my book, that makes him a productive player beh=
ind the scenes and a guy a number of teams would start if they had him on t=
heir roster.

of the Week
by CNNSI.com's James Quintong=20

It looks like it's safe to play Terry Glenn after he had a huge game agains=
t the Chargers on Sunday. He could be in for another big effort as the Patr=
iots take on the Colts. The Indianapolis defense is still very spotty, allo=
wing New England to put up 44 points in Week 3. Glenn's return could help t=
he value of Tom Brady, who you might want to pick up if you're desperate fo=
r quarterback help.

Tim Biakabutuka hasn't had much of a season so far, but this could be the w=
eek to play him as the Panthers take on the Redskins, who have the worst ru=
n defense in the NFL. In fact, until proven otherwise, any decent running b=
ack playing Washington that week will be a recommended play.=20
