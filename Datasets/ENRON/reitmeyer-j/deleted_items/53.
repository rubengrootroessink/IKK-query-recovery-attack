Howdy Ags!  Here are a few announcements and some information we thought you might find useful as the holidays get close.

Aggie Yell Practice and a Pre-Yell Party will be held at the Sam Houston Race Park on Thursday, December 27, 2001.  The pre-yell party includes a concert performance by Roger Creager '93.  For more information, click here: http://www.aggienetwork.com/whats_new/agreception.html

Franklin Covey has introduced a new line of Aggie planners!  They include great photos from Aggieland, and lots of fun Aggie trivia.  For information or to order, click here: http://www.franklincovey.com/texasam/

Send a special holiday message to our men and women in the military, many of them Texas Aggies, defending American freedom worldwide.  Concerns about mail delivery have prompted the military to suspend this year's letter-writing campaign. However, the United States military is providing this private and secure online resource that will allow you to share your special holiday message. We thought Aggies might enjoy participating.  To send your message, click here: http://anyservicemember.navy.mil/

The Association of Former Students wishes you a happy and safe holiday season, and lots of good bull in 2002.
