Good question.  I would like the 2 games but this is not about me.  Jr. Monopoly may be a little too much for her still.  She would probably enjoy the Dr. Barbie or the computer game the most.  But she will want to play the game on the computer right then so Mom better be prepared for that.

Hope y'all are having fun.

Love,

Jay

Mom asked that I send you the following questions:

Does Reagan have (or would like) any of the following:

	Jr. Monopoly
	Jr. Clue
	Cinderella's Doll House (Computer Game)
	A 'Dr.' Barbie doll

The mall is really close by so Mom and Dad are spending time shopping for
Christmas.  They bought a couple of things for the girls yesterday, but had
a question on the items listed above.

Thanks,
Lyn

You can get them whatever you want, but think back to when we were kids
and how much you hated "big kid" gifts.  Meg does that enough.  In my
opinion they are kids and the one thing they really want are toys and
games...fun things.  It is no fun going to Grandma's house for Christmas
and get nothing but clothes.  You want to get some toys to play with and
have fun with.  That is just my opinion, but you should get what you
want for them.

Love,
Jay

Jay,

Thanks for getting back to me.  I know that you are really busy and may
not
have time to answer this but, any ideas on Christmas gifts for the
girls?
Since we are driving to Indiana before going to Tyler and the car will
be
pretty full, I would like to buy the gifts for the girls now and send
them
back with Mom and Dad.  If clothing is a good option -- what sizes?
Also,
does Reagan wear any jewelry and if so, does she have a little jewelry
box
or anything like that.  I thought about buying something that could be
for a
'big girl' instead of toys.  However, I am open to any and all ideas --
I
want to get them something they will enjoy.  If you don't have time to
respond, please forward this to Jennifer.

As for my situation, my morning sickness seems to be getting a little
better.  I still have slight nausea in the morning but haven't lost my
breakfast since a week ago Monday.  I hope that this means I have turned
some sort of corner because it was really hard being sick every other
morning and fighting intense nausea every day.  Also, in the last week I
have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre.

Take care,
Lyn
