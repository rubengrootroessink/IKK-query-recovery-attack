Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning we received FERC approval for the fourth tie-in segment (to
gate #7) contracted  for  92 Mdth/day.  This brings the firm capacity of the
Medicine Bow system to 472 Mdth/day.  The contract effective date will be
October 19, but you will be able to utilize this capacity as soon as we have
it set up in the system today.  

Please call me if you have any questions.     

Laine Lobban
