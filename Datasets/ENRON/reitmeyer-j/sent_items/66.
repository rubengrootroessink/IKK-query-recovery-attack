Carole told me yesterday afternoon that you left.  I saw you right after lunch with a couple other people looking for a conference room.  I guess I know now what that was about.  That news shocked me because I didn't see it coming, but at the same time I am not surprised that you left.  With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.
 
Good luck with the new job and let me know what exactly you will be doing at the new company.
 
Jay

Hey Jay,
 
Just wanted to let you know that I resigned from Enron yesterday and took my job back at Wilkens Weather.   No, just kidding -with Energy USA over in the Galleria area.  They are a smaller, less sexier and more conservative company than Enron but then we all know what can happen to a "sexy" company. 
 
Anyway, I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Keep in touch -you can use this address for now until I know my new address at work.  You never know if one may have to return a favor sometime in the future.  
 
See ya,
 
JR
