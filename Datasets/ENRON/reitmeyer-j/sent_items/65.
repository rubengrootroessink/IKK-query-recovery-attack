I would guess that Paul will lose his job within the next few weeks...but that should not leave the walls of your house.  I think I am ok if I want to stay.  It is really a scary situation and this is what I get for corporate lifestyle I guess.  We probably won't know the full effects for several more months, but I think that a lot of people will get laid off before Christmas.

Gald to hear that Mom and Dad made it ok.  Hope y'all are having fun together.  

How are you feeling?  I have not talked to you since your wonderful phone call.  I heard you were going through some pretty bad morning sickness but that things were better now.  I am praying that from here on out you have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  Really try to enjoy it.  Let me know how you are doing and what you need or need for the baby.  However, I am not available to go pick up ice cream and a pickle at 2am, that is W.R.'s job.  I have already done that.

Take care and I will try to keep you posted.

Love,
Jay

Jay,

Just a quick note to let you know that Mom and Dad arrived around 10am on
Sunday morning.  I took the day off yesterday and we did a few things around
the house and a little shopping.  Uncle Bob arrived around 11:00am from
Phoenix and we went to lunch.  He was back on the road for Houston around
1:00pm.  There is a new subdivision going up down the street from us so we
walked down there yesterday afternoon and wandered through some of the
houses.  Dad seemed to enjoy it -- walking off the sq footage, inspecting
the construction, etc.

WR and I have been really watching the situation with Enron and have our
fingers crossed that things will work out for you now that the deal with
Dynergy has been announced.  Uncle Bob seemed to think that Paul is in a
pretty precarious situation with his job.

Take care and tell the girls 'Aunt Lyn says hi.'

Lyn
