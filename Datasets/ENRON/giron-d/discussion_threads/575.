I would like to get a copy of the supporting reports for both the IM-Denver 
and FT-Denver books on a daily basis.  Please include relevant curveshifts, 
new deal reports, change deal reports for the firm book, and curveshift, new 
deal reports, change deal reports, revenue and expense comparisons, and top 
page (desk level summary).  Also I would like a breakdown of the demand, 
commodity and other expense figures and any revenue, reimbursement that will 
go in for the first of the month.

Also, I would like an explanation as to how the IM-Denver book lost nearly 
$400,000 over the last two days.  

Thank you,

Jay
