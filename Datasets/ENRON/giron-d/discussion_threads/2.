Darron,

I met this man's wife, Nadia Rodriquez, in orientation.  Here is what she 
said about her husband's work experience.

"My husband just finished his MBA and his company's moving to Atlanta.  He 
has been offered two positions there but we would rather stay here.  His 
background has been in the securities industry, most recently in compliance 
where he ensures that brokers follow NASD and SEC regulations in all aspects 
(e.g. trading, marketing, etc.).  Prior to the compliance role, he was a 
broker with PaineWebber.  Also, he has extensive computer skills and is used 
to dealing with all levels of personnel."

She should be sending me his resume soon.
