Schroeder, you are pretty harsh.  It's actually "When 2+ a possible 2 in
the distant future definitely equal 4 in this fiscal year"  Let me know
what you set up for lunch, I should be in.

How about getting together for lunch next week or the week after.  I'm
trying to arrange for Mr. Randy Kruger to be our guest speaker.  The
topic?
"When 2+2 doesn't equal 4 ... Accounting the Andersen Way".  Let me know
what works for you guys.

Schroeder
