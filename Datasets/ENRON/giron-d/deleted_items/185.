Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon works
best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place in 2
Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.
