tEXas tailgatES talk

I hope everyone is doing okay, and you and your loved ones are safe.
The general feeling and attitude is a return to normalcy, so that's
what we are going to do here.

Off week

Texas was off last week, so there will be no mad scramble to
reschedule a game or any of the other chaos going on in the college
football world.

@ Houston - 8 pm - ESPN 2

Houston was on the way to Georgia to play the Bulldogs
prior to the cancellations.
The Cougars lost their opener to Rice, 21-14, back on September 1, and
have been off since. They gave up 354 yards rushing to the Owls, and
gained only 7 of their own. You might wonder, is Rice good? Well, they
had to stop a two point conversion and a pick off a pass in the last
minute to hold off Duke, 15-13, last week. Duke. At home.

News and Notes:
?Last week I said look for Ivan Williams to become the starter at
tailback, and so it is true. The I-Train is averaging 5.7
per carry, so he's easily the best back out there right now.
?The Texas vs. Texas Tech game time has been set for 6:00 p.m. on 9/29,
and Fox Sports Network will carry it. It is as I thought it would be,
since every Texas/Tech game has been at night since 1995.
?Texas picked up it's 13th commitment of the season when Chase Pittman
pledged to Texas. The brother of Cole said, "My brother and I didn't
agree on everything, although we were best friends? We both wanted to
play for the best coach in the country." Chase said he knew at his
brother's dedication ceremony in Austin vs. UNC he was coming to Texas,
"Texas is home to me," he stated. Welcome home.

Around the Conference:
?Oklahoma starting defensive end Dan Cody has quit the team. Cody
suffers from a severe case of clinical depression, and has left to
take care of himself. Good luck, Dan.
?Former Longhorn recruit and Tennessee Volunteer Lynn McGruder has
found a new home. The Sophomore from Las Vegas was kicked off of the
ther UT football team for a felony charge of possession and intent to
deliver and sell marijuana. Kicked off of the team and facing jail
time, what new school did McGruder find to welcome him in?. That's
right, Oklahoma. Coach Stoops says he hasn't announced whether or not
McGruder will participate in football, but it seems inevitable. I smell
gunfire over c.d.'s and snowball fights that end in teargas and riot
police. Just like the 80's all over again. Welcome back, Sooner.

Talk to you next week. See you in Houston.
