Greetings Darron,

Simple format - simple wishes - important hopes for you and yours.

Happy New Year to you from your friends at Audio Concepts Inc. (ACI)!

Darron Giron, you should have received the latest issue of the
ACI Confidential E-Newsletter early in December.
If you didn't receive it, please let us know by
emailing me at:   confidential@audioc.com

It's official, Audio Concepts, Inc. is 25 years young! We're proud to say
that ACI is thriving. Not only has our entire product line been completely
revised within the last 12 months, we're adding four brand new and very
exciting speaker systems. Many of you have already taken the opportunity to
pre-order these leading-edge systems. For the latest news on the Veritas,
Talisman, Jaguar LE and LFM go to:
http://www.audioc.com/speakers/prelim.htm


We're in the process of a complete 25th Anniversary website revision. There
may be some short/temporary down times. Check out the clean new look at
http://www.audioc.com


January through May is traditionally our busiest time. Why? Smart people
like you decide to invest their after-Christmas funds in quality
home-entertainment. Many people also take advantage of tax refunds to
improve their stereos and home-theater systems. There is no better audio
investment than handcrafted speaker systems from ACI, excellence beyond
expectation.

The base price on the award winning Titan II LE powered subwoofer will go up
by $50 effective Jan. 20. The new base price will be $1150. Pocket that $50
by ordering this legendary sub before January 20.

Looking for absolutely incredible bargains? Don't forget to frequently check
our Demos and Specials page. These systems are sold with full warranty.

We sincerely hope that 2002 will prove to be a wonderful year for you and
all those you care about.

Our normal Confidential Newsletter has bright colors and attachments.
But 25 years ago, like this particular simple plain EMail,  ACI was simple and plain.
We hoped and desired for our 1st customer - now 25 years later our customer
numbers are in the 30,000s and aiming to 40,000 .  Like a newborn
business or person, we learned.   Our capabilities and capacities have grown
from those lowly beginnings.  But like any 25 year old - we still
have much growing and learning for the future.  We hope you'll continue
to grow and learn with us in 2002.  We're hoping it will be a great year for our
country, for our world, allies, and freedoms, for you and for us.

Darron from all of us at ACI, may your next year be more pleasant,
safe, and fruitful than the last.

Cordially,


Alex
ACI Confidential Newsletter and Mailing Coordinator
