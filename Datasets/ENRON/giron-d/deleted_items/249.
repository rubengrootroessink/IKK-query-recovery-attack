tEXas tailgatES talk

We welcomed the passing game to the 2001 season Saturday night
at the erector set they call Robertson Stadium. As I watched
the game from the stands, I heard some complaints from the Texas
fans around me. I do not, and will not, ever understand how a
team you support can be 3-0, winning those 3 games by an average
score of 46-15, be ranked in the top 5 in both major polls,
and be in contention for a national title, yet still have
fans unhappy. Do I think the team played perfect Saturday night?
No. Do I think they have things to work on? Yes. Was I ecstatic
that Texas put half of a hundred on the scoreboard against an
opponent on the road? You bet. Do I think this team is improving
every week? Absolutely.

53-26

This game was like just about every game played this weekend- sloppy.
Penalties and missed opportunities were present for both teams early.
The superior talent and depth proved to be the difference in this game.
The Longhorns simply are a better team than UH is right now, and that
showed. Whatever you might think of the Athletic Department and
Administration of UH (I'm right there with you), their football team is
well coached and plays tough. Chris Simms looked like the man-child
everyone was expecting from day 1. He finished the night a cool 20-35
for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was picked off once, put UH got
nothing out of it. Some passes were dropped and another touchdown pass
to Tony Jeffrey was ruled incomplete, but replays later showed it was
a catch. He looked off receivers well, once on the 92-yard t.d. pass
to B.J. Johnson, scrambled when he had to, and really only made 1 or 2
bad decisions. The passing game has arrived. It is widely known that
the most improvement in a team is from game 1 to game 2. That was game
1 for the passing game. The I-Train was a wrecking ball. Williams had
103 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 carries, and did not see the field in
the 4th quarter. He gave way to Benson, who racked up 74 yards and a
score on 14 carries. That's almost 5 ? yards per carry for the game.
Most impressive was the 3rd and short yardage situations, where Texas
fans have cringed in the past. Each time it was 2nd or 3rd and short,
the 'horns lined up in their 2 tight end set, and everyone in the
stadium knew what the play was and where it was going. It still worked.
5 ? yards per carry. Statistically, the defense has had better days.
They gave up 432 yards and 26 points. Some points of concern are the
lack of a consistent pass rush and some sloppy tackling, but the rest
must be laid at the feet of UH.  The Cougars had an excellent game plan
for Texas, and had 2 weeks to implement it. This was their OU game. They
had 2 games of film on Texas, who had only one (with no relevance, since
it was of Rice and their wishbone atack, that Texas hasn't used in 30 years).
Houston played lights out in the 1st half.  Two things coaches must do
are get their team prepared for the game and adjust to the opponent at
the half. Texas led 20-14 at the half. At the end of the 3rd quarter it
was 33-14. The Texas coaches fixed the immediate problem and stopped Houston
when it had to.  Like I said earlier, the biggest improvement for a team
is from game 1 to game 2. This was game 1 for defending the wide-open
offense.

Texas Tech
6:00 pm   Fox Sports

This should be a fun one, folks. Tech has a chip on their shoulder
because they think they let one get away last year in Lubbock when
Texas walked out of their with a win, 29-17. Texas Tech comes in
2-0 after beating that bully North Texas, who they had previously
split the last 4 meetings with. This is about as one sided a rivalry
as it gets, with Texas leading the 50 games played 37-13. The Red
Raiders have a solid quarterback in Kliff Kingsbury, and a great
playmaker in safety Kevin Curtis. If they could block someone
offensively and stop the run on defense, they could be pretty good.
It's not happening here. Eat a big lunch, because the way these
teams throw the ball, and the way Tech's offensive line blocks,
expect a lot of incompletions and holding penalties. It's going
to be a long night.

INFORMATION FOR TICKET HOLDERS: Expect long lines and delays at
stadium gates, which will open two (2) hours prior to kickoff in
order to accommodate sellout crowds. Police officers are scheduled
to patrol the stadium block the day and night prior to the games.
An increased number of security officers are scheduled to man each
gate. For more information about the new restrictions click here:

Don't forget, the worlds largest Tailgate Party starts at 3:00 PM
at the Alumni Center.

News and Notes:
* Kickoff has been set for the OU game. 2:30 pm on ABC.

* Chris Simms' 92 yd touchdown pass to B.J. Johnson was the longest
of Simms career. The previous best was a 70 yarder to Johnson last
year (A&M).

* Texas is 26-0 under Mack Brown when they out rush their opponent.

* D.D. Lewis recovered the 9th fumble of his career in the 4th quarter
against UH, tying him for the all-time lead with Tim Campbell (1975-79)
and Oscar Giles (1987-90).

* Look for Derrick Johnson to be starting soon. Bam Bam came off of
the bench in the 3rd quarter and had an immediate impact, with 6
tackles/4 solo. He finished 3rd on the team in tackles for the game.

* Texas is 3-0 for the 1st time since 1994.

Around the Conference:
* The Aggies pulled off the Red/White/Blue decks for the game against
O.S.U. on Saturday.  It was quite a site, and very impressive. They
beat Oklahoma State 21-7, and host Notre Dame this weekend.

* OU will end its 3-week layoff as they host Kansas State this weekend.
The Sooners were off on September 22nd, and postponed their Sept. 15th
game with Tulsa to Nov. 24th. It will be interesting to see how they
come out. K-State seems to be hitting on all cylinders as they
annihilated New Mexico State 65-0. They led 50-0 at the half.

* Baylor is off to its best start since 1996. The Bears beat New Mexico
in OT 16-13 on Saturday. They are 2-0.

* Iowa State is also 2-0. The Cyclones beat Ohio 31-28 on Ennis
Haywood's 219 yards rushing. They host Baylor this weekend.

* The Big XII went 8-2 this weekend; with 2 teams idle (OU, Mizzou).
The only 2 losses came in conference play, OSU to A&M, and Kansas to
Colorado. The rest of the league went 6-0 in out of conference play.

Take Care. See you all this weekend.
