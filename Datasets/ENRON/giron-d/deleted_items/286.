You have been slated for the next Excel/macro class.  Attendees will (most likely) be:
 
    Derek Bailey
    Darron Giron
    Brad Jones
    Kam Keiser
    Errol McLaughlin
    Scott Palmer
 
I anticipate starting the class the first week of October.  This is a little late in the year, with the holidays, to finish by the year end, so we may need January to finish up.  The meeting times will most likely be Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:30am to 1pm.
 
The focus of the class will be learning basic programming/algorithm techniques, using Excel and VBA as a platform, with enough real world experiences and examples to keep your interest.  
 
I would encourage you to talk with Phillip Love and Anne Bike to get their feedback on the progress of the class so far (they are about 3 weeks into the class - although the first 2 or 3 sessions are pretty dry) and the time requirements.  There are bi-weekly reading assignments and exercises to complete.  In addition, I will assign a few projects along the way.  The time required should be very manageable unless something out of the ordinary comes up.
 
Consider your availability.  We are all busy, but I believe if you invest the time in the class it will be beneficial to you.  Let me know if something in your schedule will prevent you from devoting the required time so that I can find a replacement for your slot.  
 
I haven't decided whether to purchase your textbooks myself or make everyone responsible for obtaining their own.  I'll let you know when October is getting closer.
 
Let me know if you have questions.  I look forward to going through the class material with you.
 
Greg
