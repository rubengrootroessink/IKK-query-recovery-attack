Since Todd was the only one of you guys to use the reply to all, and thus
try to make my job easier, we will go with his choice of where to eat,
which is Beck's Prime.  Todd makes a good point that it tends to get
crowded around noon, so let's meet at 11:45 so that we may get a table.  If
I'm not there go ahead without me. I've got a meeting that may last til
noon.  I'll catch up with you after that.  Also, Giron will be in lovely
Oklahoma (no doubt some punishment for his role in the $1.0BN in write-offs
they took) and won't be joining us.

See you tomorrow.

Schroeder
