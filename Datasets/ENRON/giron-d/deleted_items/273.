Alright guys, the 3rd Thursday is upon us.  We will have our first Thursday night poker game next Thursday Sept.20th at my house.  Let's put a tentative start time of 7:30.  Please let me know if you will be able to attend so that I can get replacements if they are needed.  Here are directions to my house:
1. Take I-45 South towards Galveston
2.  Take exit #29 - Clear Lake City Blvd.
3.  Go through 3 lights(not including the freeway overpass) and 2 stop signs(about 4 miles)
4.  Take a left on Noble Pine(across the street from Children's World Daycare)
5.  When Noble Pine dead ends, take a right on Towering Oak
6.  Take an immediate left on Cherry Oak
7.  This street dead ends into Sterling Wood Way, take a left
8.  I am the third house on the right 4435.
