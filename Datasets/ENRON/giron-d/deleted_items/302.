>Little Mary led off: "I sold girl scout cookies and I made $30," she said
>proudly, "My sales approach was to appeal to the customer's civil spirit
>and
>I credit that approach for my obvious success."
>"Very good," said the teacher.
>Little Sally was next: "I sold magazines," she said, "I made $45 and I
>explained to everyone that magazines would keep them abreast of current
>events."
>"Very good, Sally," said the teacher.
>Eventually, it was Little Johnny's turn. The teacher held her breath.
>Little Johnny walked to the front of the classroom and dumped a box full of
>cash on the teacher's desk. "$2,467," he said.
>"$2,467!" cried the teacher, "What in the world were you selling?"
>"Tooth brushes," said Little Johnny.
>"Tooth brushes," echoed the teacher, "How could you possibly sell enough
>tooth brushes to make that much money?"
>"I found the busiest corner in town," said Little Johnny, "I set up a Dip &
>Chip stand.  I gave everybody who walked by a sample. They all said the
>same
>thing.  Hey, this tastes like shit!  Then I would say, It is shit. Wanna
>buy
>a toothbrush?"
