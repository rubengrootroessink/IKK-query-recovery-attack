Thanks for the info.  Our wills and Larry's  trust were prepared by an
estate attorney; there is a by-pass trust set up for me that involves the
"in excess of taxable amount"..reason I wanted the info.  With market the
way it is now and the amount going up each year, I don't think I will plan
on much from that.  MOM
