Importance:	High

	
	I am pleased to announce that we will be having a shower for expectant mom Dawn K. Wilson on Tuesday, September 11th here 
	at Enron in ECN27C2 at 3:30.  Dawn has requested your presence at this special event to enjoy presents, cake, coos, and awe's.  
	Mom to be is registered at "Baby's R Us" and at "Doodles in the Village". 

	If you would like to do gifts on your own please let me know.  I will also be taking a collection to purchase a gift card and some 
	"baby necessities" for mom if you would like to participate.  The deadline for collections is this Friday by 4:00pm.  You can see me 	direct, just under the plasma screen on the northeast side of the building, or send your contribution in secured interoffice envelope 	to ECN2782E. 


Thanks,

JLR
