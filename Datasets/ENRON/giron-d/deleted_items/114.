FYI:
Barry had an abnormal stress test result  and was referred to a cardiologist.   He called me tonite to let me  know that the new   scan came out normal. Although he is very  careful about his food, his triglcs and chlosterol are  still  high...those Mayers genes again. 
 
Sara also had an appt with a cardiologist  today.  She has been having arryrhyimia ( sp?)...abornal heart beat.   She is now wearing a heart monitor for the next month, having blood work done,  etc.  Sounds like perhaps  a valve problem.  Serious enough for  sure, but sounds like she is in good hands and this is not something that would  cause a heart attack ( dr's words) .  I have not had time to look it up on  the net nor call Jessie, but plan to do both.  Will keep you posted.   Needless to say, she is pretty scared at the moment.
