My apologies for canceling today's class.  I am at home sick.  Today's class was only to last 15 mintues or so and provide a brief introduction.
 
If you don't already have your book, please get it today from the box on the floor by my desk.  Read chapter one and do the exercises for Wednesday.
 
The first part of the book is fairly slow reading, but lays some important groundwork.  Also, my recommendation is that for the first couple of chapters, you do both the Excel and Word examples.  The extra practice with Word will help you discover more about VBA that will be useful to you in future Excel work.  After the first couple chapters, the author shifts largely towards Excel.
 
If you set aside a dedicated time to work on the class material, it shouldn't take you that long to complete.  Also, my suggestion for you, to get the most out of the class, is to do your "homework" BEFORE the morning of the class.  This gives you time to think about the concepts and go back and review if necessary.  Also, I would encourage you to try and do each of the exercises at the end of the chapters.
 
Let me know if you have questions.
 
Sorry again for missing the class.  This won't be a common practice, I promise!
