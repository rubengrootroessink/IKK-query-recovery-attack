We reconciled both lists. Attached are the counterparties who have terminated their Financial Agreements or transactions, as approved by legal, per the Master Letter Log. I did not include Sempra as they do not appear on the list & I have no further details at this time of their status. I've left a voice mail message for Dave Forster requesting additional information.

Cyndie:

Could you please forward me at your earliest convenience an updated list of the counterparties that will be included in the live book. Should you have any questions please don't hesitate to call me at X 3-4305.

Thanks,
Elena
