Subject:	The lone person from Congress that voted against US show of force 

I just wanted to pass on some information regarding the only person in Congress to vote against the US showing force regarding the terrorist attacks is NY and DC.  Barbara Lee a representative from California's 9th district(Oakland, Berkeley) voted against the resolution.  The final vote was 424-1.  The senate voted 98-0(2 members unable to get to Washington).  Barbara Lee has a history of doing this, she was also the only one who voted in '99 not to respond to the bombing of the US embassies in Africa.  She also was involved in trying to disrupt the confirmation process of President Bush(Al Gore had to tell her to refrain from speaking several times while certifying the electoral college votes).

If you would like to write her or call her to let her know your feelings, the phone number in DC is 202-225-2661 and in Oakland is 510-763-0370.  Her fax numbers are (DC) 202-225-9817 and 510-763-6538(Oakland).  I tried by phone, but every person in her offices' voice mailbox was full(probably full of outraged citizens).  So I faxed her a letter.  I urge you IF you are also offended by her vote, a slap in the face to all Americans and anyone who knew someone who lost their life in this tragedy, to call or fax a letter.  Representative Lee needs to know that she represents all Americans, not just the ones in her district.  Her email address is barbara.lee@mail.house.gov.

I also urge you if you were offended to watch the news, she will be up for reelection in 2004 and look for her opponents, Democrat and Republican.  

Whether you agree or not, you should make your voice heard.
