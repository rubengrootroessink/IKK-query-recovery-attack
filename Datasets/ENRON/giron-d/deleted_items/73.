Last night's winning lottery ticket was sold in Deer Park!   27 mil..  no,
i did not have it.........................

Also - saw Al and talked on the phone to Nita - Nita is at Enron till the
end of the month.  Glad Darron has found work elsewhere.  He will be ok.
He is a bright guy!  How is he taking all this?  This kind of stuff lets us
all know how very fragile and uncertain life really is...  and how much of
our success is based on how we see it...   or is how we see how we see it
an illusion too...  who knows????  I am just glad he is ok.
