Just got off the phone with Dave Forster.

Currently we are in dispute with Sempra over the terms & interpretations of the verbal & written agreement with Sempra regarding their transactions. They have terminated all agreements & all transactions. The only open 'issue' is the settlement of those transactions.

So, please add CP# 57508, Sempra Energy Trading Corp. to the list previously submitted.

Thank you,
Cyndie

We reconciled both lists. Attached are the counterparties who have terminated their Financial Agreements or transactions, as approved by legal, per the Master Letter Log. I did not include Sempra as they do not appear on the list & I have no further details at this time of their status. I've left a voice mail message for Dave Forster requesting additional information.
