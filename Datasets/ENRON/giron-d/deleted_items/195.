I have to manually redraft for this to pull through, and unfortunately I do need the deal number. Hope it's not too much trouble.

Thanks!

Bryant split the deal so that Aug is under Georgia-Pacific and Sep is under Domtar.  So you should see it if you draft for Domtar for Sep.  If not, please let me know.  Unfortunately, I don't think Bryant wrote the deal number down.  But we can find it if necessary.

Hi Darron,

I noticed that you changed the term date on this deal. However, I didn't see it come through on the Domtar Industries side. Is this supposed to be charged to them again for September???
