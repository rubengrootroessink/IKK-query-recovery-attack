Hi Darren,

Heartland has been calling the trading desk looking for the confirmation on the above referenced deal. We haven't
sent it out because it was flagged as Pending you on Monday's credit report.  Can you please let us know as soon as possible 
about the credit status of this trade so we can get the confirm out?  

Thanks,
Diane
