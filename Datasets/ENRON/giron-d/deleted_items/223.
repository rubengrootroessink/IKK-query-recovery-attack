Darron:
I saw your name in the audit as changing a price on Cross Timbers deal 434968 for Jan 01.  The note in the terms tab says that the deal was triggered at 8.65, so you changed it from NWPL.Rockies + 0.025 to a fixed 8.65.  I spoke to Cross Timbers and they said they did not trigger this deal.  They said the price should remain at index + 0.025.  Can you confirm this price for me?  I'm showing a $40k adjustment that Cross Timbers does not.

Thanks,
Megan
