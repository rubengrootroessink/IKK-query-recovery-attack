OK, so buy me at least one Enron  tricket,,,OK?  Maybe outlay of $10?  I am serious..no plastic.   May as well go along with the crowd.  Should we stop wearing the Enron  shirt you gave us??????  Would not want any more wear and wear on  it!!   Was great to hear your voice and best of luck with new company.
