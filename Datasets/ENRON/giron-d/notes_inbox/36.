Last month we briefly discussed a $306,900 variance between the general=20
ledger and the DPR for the management west book.=01; I took an action item =

provide documentation of where I was seeing the value taken in the DPR back=

in January 2001.=01; Accordingly, the liquidation detail for post id 102621=
0 is=20
in the attached file titled "MGMTWST_JAN_LIQ".=01; The issue is that it=01;=
appears=20
Deal QO9203.1 erroneously liquidated in the month of January at a value of=

$306,900 when the deal has a March term date and valued correctly in the=20
liquidations for that month (creating a duplicate liquidation for the same=
=20
deal).=01; Please review the detail and let me know if you agree that the=

expense was taken in error by the management west book in Jan, or if I have=

picked up the incorrect post id, or if there is some other issue that I hav=

The only other remaining variances for the management west book relate to=

Mirant Americas Energy Marketing.=01; I have been working with the financia=

Essentially, the liquidated value for 3 deals did not pick up the fixed pri=

The net effect, if you agree that the adjustments need to be made to the DP=
