I will be interviewing applicants and cannot pick up C and C for the next  
three weeks. There may be some Tuesdays between now and the end of school  
that I will still be able to watch them....it will be a week by week thing. ? 
If you want to get someone on a permanent basis or if you want to know about  
me week by week....let me know. Do whatever is easier on you and the kids. ? 
Hope the weekend was fun. ?MOM
