Vivien

Can you tell me if the gas expense for Harbor Cogen is being booked to 
company 553?  Can you tell me what is happening with this?

Thanks
Tracy

I don't have any of the TAGG specifics, but the trader here says it is 
approximately $(5M).   Supposedly, the individual in Gas Settlements that has 
been making the manual entries each month is Vivien Pham....we (Power)  just 
aren't seeing it flow through to us to record to our dpr.  Maybe she has some 
info that would help us all?!

I'm looking into it.  I tie out each month with the gas desks on our 
liquidations. So whatever has liquidated out of TAGG is what gets booked.  I 
haven't noticed the West desk being off in there liquidations.  Do you which 
gas desk/book this should be with?  Do you have amounts or deals numbers?

Tracy,

The West Power desk has been involved in a deal since last July whereby we 
(Power Desk) run a generator for a third party (Harbor Cogen) with gas we 
purchased from the Houston gas desk.  Here is my question....have you ever 
seen an entry booked by the gas desk charging West Power for the gas cost 
because West Power has never recorded this gas cost?!  The gas book name for 
West Power is EPMI West Coast if that helps.

Thanks.
Casey
