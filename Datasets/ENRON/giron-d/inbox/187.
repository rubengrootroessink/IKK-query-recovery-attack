How goes it?  I hope good.  I just found out that Enron is making Sprint
Broadband Direct available to us at a discounted rate.  Isn't this the
group you are working for now?  They will install the equipment for free
and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance).  Do
you have this?  If so, how do you like it?  Did you hear about Jessie?
Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this.  I have dial-up now and it
really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs.
Take Care.

DG
