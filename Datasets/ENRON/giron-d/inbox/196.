Well, I did read the note and will make one more comment, I NEVER said to
any one that "my daughter in law does not keep me informed".  If Karen said
that, it is a lie.  Sorry if I come across pissed off,  it is not that way.
Don't know what more I could possibly do to make Kris feel better; guess we
will leave it at that. It is obvious that things will remain just the same
as the past 15 years.  I appreciate your comments and blieve what you have
written.
