Dear Origination Team,

The time has come to start building the front page of the origination web site. I am meeting next Monday with the web designer and she needs the profiles of the origination team to post them online.  Also I will be taking pictures of you soon to have them online as well.

I'd really appreciate that you take a few minutes of your time and write one or two paragraphs with your professional development (with some personal touch) by Friday this week.


Thank you in advance,

Jose  


Take a look at some samples from the weather group:

Jose Marquez

I am originally from Puerto Rico. In terms of free time, I enjoy travel, hiking, reading history books and play racquetball, where I am always looking for people to play. Being from the Caribbean and experience the fury of hurricanes help me to develop a strong curiosity to know more about these monsters of nature. So, at very young age I decided to become a meteorologist.
My education experience starts with a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Sciences, minor in Geology, from University of Puerto Rico. After graduation, I joined the US Navy as a meteorologist/oceanographer serving for five years aboard the USS Blue Ridge (homeport Tokyo, Japan) and Misawa Air Force Base in northern Japan. Additionally, my participation in Desert Shield and Desert Storm as meteorological officer for the Seventh Fleet opened my eyes of the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences importance in everybody's lives.
I obtained my MS at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, specializing in Atmospheric Chemistry/Dynamics. Afterwards, I joined the Weather Channel as Latin America Meteorology Manager. The Weather Channel experience was great and a fun place to work at. However, at Enron I see unlimited potential for continuing growth and a very well prepared team where everybody's experiences and knowledge become a resourceful learning experience. It is a pleasure to be at Enron and be part of a winning team.
