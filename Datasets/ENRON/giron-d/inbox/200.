That was probably the sweetest note you have ever given me.  What is wrong with you?  Are you feeling O.K.?
I am going to go to Karate.  During that time I will try to get the school supplies.  Dinner will be on the stove.  We  (kids and me) will not eat until we get home, but it will be ready when you get home.
See you then, I love you-

Kristi

I hope you are having a great day.  I'm can't tell you how sorry I am
about your brother.  But during this you have demonstrated just what
type of individual you are.  You have handled this whole situation like
a pro.  You're parents and brothers are truly lucky to have you as a
daughter and sister.  As I am lucky to have you for a wife.  I just
wanted to let you know how proud I am of you and ask about how long it
will be before I can quit working?  I am anxiously awaiting.  I love
you.
