Hi, 
Good to hear from you.  I have been taking some time off recently while making phone calls to NYC.  The job market is not good up there, of course.  I want to try something new in finance, like venture capital, hedge funds, or public finance.  So, I continue to make calls. I don't suppose you have any contacts in NYC?  I plan to move to NYC in late February with or w/o a job to start really pounding the pavement. 
I heard that you moved back to Risk.  How is it treating you?  I also heard that Kam got a kind of promotion.  Interesting.  Are you guys excited about UBS?  Started trading yet?   
Well, I hope that you and your family are doing well.  Say hi to everyone for me.   
Talk later.

I just wanted to drop you a note and ask what's going on and what you plan 
on doing.  I hope all is well and that you had a good Holiday under the 
circumstances.  Take care.
