You know your company has "made it" when:
You hear the christian radio station in town asking for prayer
They start relating how many shares it would take to buy a hotdog at the stadium
Your friends won't let you pay for dinner
You can judge how good of a day it will be by the number of news trucks in front of the building
You start eying the parmasan cheese contianer, how long it will sustain you and if the resturaunt would miss it
The waiter immediatly offers you a glass of wine when he finds out who you work(ed) for
You spend more time trying to convince vendors you are still in business (pipelines) than actually doing business
The CNN news truck takes up residence in front of the building
You toy with the idea of grabbing a box and walking out the front door, so you can give the poor news guys something to do
The number of police officers increases in the building
You take the remaining cents/dollar from your 401k and invest in beer stocks
Wondering if anyone would notice you leaving with a comfy mesh chair under your arm
People's party planning skills are greatly enhanced due to the over use during the day
The waiter asks if you would like a refill on water you inquire if it is free 
You look at the change in your pocket and wonder if you should go in for a couple more shares


 
10.  Learn to make your own clothes, cut hair for family and friends, and other old-fashioned ways to reduce costs.

9.  Rent a mini-bus to give tours of River Oaks, pointing out the homes of Fast Andy Fastow, Uncle Ben Glisan, Little Jeffy Skilling, etc. in case anyone wants to return on their own to give personal notes of thanks for freeing up all this time to be with family over the holidays.

8.  Audition for next Survivor show.

7.  Harness your chi.

6.  Start therapy to unlearn key Enron phrases "world's leading (fill in the blank)", etc.

5.  Take advantage of the proximity of the world-class Texas Medical Center to participate in some of those extended drug studies - they often provide food and housing during some of the psychotropic trials.

4.  Familiarize yourself with Ebay so that you may unload some of your Enron logo wear, or other small electronic items which may have accidentally ended up at your home when Price Waterhouse seized the building.  (And remember: looting is a crime.)

3.  If necessary, make amends with your parents or in-laws - they're old enough that their houses are probably paid for, and likely won't let your kids starve or become homeless.

2.  Remind yourself that, unless you are a child, no one is ultimately responsible for your health, wealth or happiness except you.

1.  Keep your perspective:  if you have love, religion, health, then you're as rich as you've always been, only slightly less encumbered by material wealth.
