robin thinks it would be easier if I forwarded the attachment.  Seems a little too easy for me.

Attached is a spreadsheet with the potential write offs in 12/01 general ledger.  In addition, I think Phyllis talked to you about other changed - i.e. we will not be booking UA4 or FTA in 12/01 general ledger.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I am not sure of the process on our end, I have submitted this information to Greg Whiting who is going to submit it to his boss, etc.  I will let you know when I hear something back from them and please let me know if there is a problem on your end.

thanks
Lisa
