Holiday Bowl Tickets

For those of you interested, there are still tickets to the
bowl game available. If you have not been out to San Diego
before, it is a great town to bump around, and the football
stadium is excellent.  So, what are waiting for? Sunny weather,
cool nights, ocean views and Tijuana. What else do you need?
How 'bout this- chance for 11 wins and to finish in the top
10 for the 1st time since '83, chance to win the 1st bowl
game outside of Texas since 1964 (Sounds worse than it is,
we have only played outside the state 4 times in that span).
One more thing: Major is starting. Some of you have been
chanting his name every week, others have said you don't like
how he was treated, and some of you have even said you would
boycott the bowl if Applewhite didn't play. Well, he is, so
show him how much he means to you by coming to San Diego and
watching him start his final college game.  Is it Pasadena?
No. We aren't playing for the national title, and I know some
of you are having a harder time dealing with that than others,
but I say don't look back, it's not healthy. What's done is
done. A coach will tell his team to put the previous game away
when they get to practice on Monday. You can't hold your head
and feel sorry for yourself and you can't sprain your elbow
patting yourself on the back, because your next opponent could
care less about what you did last week.

The tEXas tailgate is still being worked out. It will be in a
bar or restaurant starting early afternoon. Expect another email
soon about it, along with a breakdown of the game.

Hope to see you all in San Diego.
