Yes, it would be built in Plainview, Nebraska.

Thank you for forwarding. It appears to me that this facility is going to be built in Nebraska. Is that correct?

Brian,
This is an excerpt from an article (attached) that I used to estimate the energy requirements for the new ethanol plants.  I thought you might be interested.  If you are interested, I can provide you with a complete list of all the plants under construction and a list of planned constructions as well.

Natural Gas . We anticipate that our plant will require a natural gas supply of at least 0.75 billion cubic feet per year at a minimum rate of 100 MCF per hour and at a minimum of 200 psig at the plant site. To access sufficient supplies of natural gas to operate the plant, a connection to a distribution pipeline located underground at our site will be required. We have no current agreement with any third party to construct such a connection.
