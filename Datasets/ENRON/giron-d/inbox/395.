Jim @ Kaztex bought 20/d NBPL @ Harper on our behalf from Tenaska.  Jim sold it to us at his cost, he said--$1.84.  Said yesterday's deal was at 2 cents over his cost, but that you had done him a favor and that he also owed us one related to something Patrice had done for him, so that 'we're even' now.  
Shelly @ MRT called to say that she wouldn't be needing the second package of 5000 for the weekend.  As you know, this set in motion quite the adventure.  
Reliant informed us that Domtar was not taking gas, and we had to get an additional 10/d for the weekend off their system.  Here's how we got rid of the 5 not taken by MRT and the 10 not taken by Domtar:
Sinha @ Aquila bought 3126 of North at 1.65.  Deal ticket #1182363.
Sylvia took the remaing 6874 of North, plus 5172 combined Flex & South and moved them to Laquiba (sp?) for sale to OG&E, incurring fuel of 1.3% plus $0.02 transport charge.  Sylvia sold the delivered volume of 11718 to OG&E for $1.85, deal ticket # 1182441.  Later in the day Reliant told us that we had been cut at Laquiba--only 2/d of flow there for the weekend, so we had to find another home for the remaining 9718/d.  Ended up taking the remainder to Enogex @ Chandler.  Souad handled the nominations; Bonnie was also involved in the gas control issues as well.
Spoke with Bonnie about the Domtar buyback ticket (Tammy was sick today).  Bonnie knew nothing about it.  Bonnie said that we needed to wait until she could see all of the deal tickets in Sitara.  Given Bonnie's and our lack of familarity with the Domtar provisions, we decided to wait until Monday to enter the Domtar side of the deal with your assistance.
Melinda @ MidAm called to get our offer on 50 contracts of the Dec-Aug NYMEX swap.  Dutch quoted at $0.35, with $2.82 on the front.  Melinda held off.  Spoke wiht her later and she said that she'd gotten done elsewhere 'at a different price'.
Cheryl @ Terra bought our remaining 3193 of OGT at $1.59.  Deal ticket #1182379.  Sinha, ever the bottom-feeder, had earlier bid us $1.59 when our offer was $1.69.  Denver was showing the OGT at $1.60 when Cheryl called, but he was eager to get rid of it, so he jumped at the $1.59.  No unpleasant calls from Credit as of 2:30pm.
Greg Hayes @ Farmland called for an offer of 2000/d of Demarc for the weekend.  He could see Denver's 10/d offered on EOL, but explained that he was calling because he only wanted 2/d.  Asked Denver if he would do 2/d, and Denver suggested that I remind Greg that he could adjust his buy quantity on EOL.  Denver verbally quoted $1.72.  Went back to the phone and communicated our offer of $1.72 to Greg.  Greg asked if he could have it at $1.70, as that was the price that was showing on EOL at the beginning of our conversation, he claimed.  Ran this past Denver, but Denver stood fast at $1.72.  Greg did not sound happy and asked for my name and number.  Haven't heard anything further.
Sinha called again at about 9:50 and asked if we had 1800 PEPL to sell him.  Denver was done for the day, so no deal.  


Please don't hesitate to ask me if you need some further clarification on any of this.  I'll be reachable by cell over the holiday weekend at 713-213-7644.  

Hope you and your family are having a nice Thanksgiving.  Sorry that we had to pull you away for such an extended period this morning.


Patrick
