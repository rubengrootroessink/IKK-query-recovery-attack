Darron, 

Here's the detail we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions.  The tabs labeled NSS1 Deals Killed and NSS2 Deals Killed are the PGL deals that were killed.  The sitara deals to book the 12 Bcf were 1194383, 1194384, 1194385, and 1194386.

Let me know if you have any questions.  

Robin
