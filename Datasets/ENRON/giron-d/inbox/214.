I talked with all of you about having a monthly poker/cards game.  Please let me know if you are not interested anymore.  We discussed, a Thursday night once a month.  I was thinking from roughly 7:30 - 10 p.m.  How does the third Thursday of the month sound to everyone?  This should always keep us out of bidweek/first of the month scenarios.  Right now we have 8 guys, so we can go two tables.  We were also talking about rotating the location each month to someone else's house.  I will volunteer my house for the first week.  Do we want to start in September?  The third Thursday would be September 20th.  We also talked about this being a small time game, like .25 ante, $1.00 maximum.  Please let me know what you guys think if we can do this and if we should change some of the suggestions listed above.  Thanks.
