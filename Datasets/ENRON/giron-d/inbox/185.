a few who request us to drop them from the newletter listing.  If you desire to no longer receive
future newsletter issues - simply reply to this email with the word

then by all means contact me directly and we will try to remedy the situation for you.
Don't feel you are the only one - we had about 45 we helped last time - 1/10 of 1% of the total sent.
Typically the problems were taken care of easily and they had no further difficulties.

concerns please email  sales@audioc.com  for all your answers.

Also, we love to hear your comments on our newsletter - let me know what you think.
