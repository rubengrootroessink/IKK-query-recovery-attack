As we discussed, I never received a confirmation of the May, June and July
forward gas purchase (1,000 per day at Ventura at $2.895/mmBtu).  This
purchase was made through Brian Frihart.  I need to know if Enron plans to
stand behind this purchase.  Without confirmation, I will assume that the
deal is no longer valid.
