Did you go to the game this weekend?    UT looked strong after the first
20min.  Hopefully Neb. and Tech can beat OU.  The A&M game looks like it
could be more of a challenge than I had originally thought.    What's going
on at Enron?  I saw where the SEC will be investigating an Enron
partership.  What's your take on the situation there?

Let's go to lunch soon.
