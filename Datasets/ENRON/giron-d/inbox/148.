This week is not good.  I have too large a pile of documents to shred.
Next week is better. I suggest Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.

OK you slackers (excluding Shaw), I'll give you another chance to respond.
Lunch this week or next, let me know what's good.  If meeting after work is
better for you, let me know.  Certainly all of you can stop shredding
documents for 5 minutes to respond.
