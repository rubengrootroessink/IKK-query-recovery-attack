Hi,

=09My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading=
 desk. =20

=09I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, deriv=
atives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For examp=
le, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, g=
as, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building bloc=
ks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attac=
hed document.

 =09We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's =
internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet wi=
th the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the d=
evelopment of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used =
to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
=09
=09Thank you in advance for your assistance.
   =20
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk
