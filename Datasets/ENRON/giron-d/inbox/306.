Subject: Up early for Christmas?
That was a very nice Christmas Eve, the calender was a really neat  idea..The turducken was featured in yesterdays Picayune, yes Virginia, we  finally have a real paper available in Gonzales, in several locations...We got  to freezing, so was busy freeze protecting the households, trailer, camp,  Norma's and peggys.  Forgot to go to the bonfires, but has visited during  Clarks speedy trip, featured was a destroyer, the USS Kickazz. Found a tape of  Jambalaya Cajun Band, found out what that Discovery show was about, the  Festivale De Acadiane?  Still have my pack of turkey wings/sausage for my  gumbo and four trash piles for bonfires.....Look up  www.noradsanta.org  and see the stops he  made...my favorite is the Persian Gulf....Merry rest of the  day...Ralph
