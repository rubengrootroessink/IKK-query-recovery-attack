The CODE (rules for men): 

1. Thou shall not rent 'Chocolat'. 

2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella. 

3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and
eaten by his fellow partygoers. 

4. When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, father,
priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should
not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts. You are

permitted to deny his very existence. 
 
5. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a
friend out of jail within 12 hours. 

6. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without
recrimination; beyond that, anyone within 
earshot is allowed to call bullshit. (Exception:  When trying to pick up a
girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent) 

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits
forever. 

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who's running
late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every
point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale. 

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's refrigerator is
forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable. 

10. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man. (In
fact, even remembering a friend's birthday is strictly optional.) 

11. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying
to hook up with is your legal duty.  Should you get carried away with your
good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to
speak of it, even at your bachelor party. 

12. Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission; and
he, in return, is required to grant it. 

13. Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated as spies
until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a
buffalo wing clean. 

14. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem  - you didn't see nothin'.


15. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer. 

16. A man must never own a cat or like his girlfriend's cat.  

17. You girlfriend must bond with your buddy's girlfriends within 30 minutes
of meeting them. You are not required to make nice with her gal pals'
significant dick-heads --- low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.


18. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always
ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing. 

19. When your girlfriend / wife expresses a desire to fix her whiney friend
with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn
your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood. 

20. (Gas Warfare Act) you may flatuate in front of a woman only after you've
brought her to climax. But, if you trap her head under the covers for the
purpose of flatuent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend. 

21. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when you're
sunning on a tropical beach...And it's delivered by a topless
supermodel...and it's free. 

22. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked. 
 
23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain
sober enough to fight. 
 
24. If a buddy is outnumbered, outmanned, or too drunk to fight, you must
jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have
caused you to think, "What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin," you may
sit back and enjoy. 

25. Friends don't let friends wear Speedo's. Ever.  Issue closed. 

26. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight lifting:
"Yeah, baby, push it!" "C'mon, give me one more! Harder!"  "Another set and
we can hit the showers." "Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?" 

27. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza,
but not both.  That's just plain mean. 

28. If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his
beer. 

29. Never join your girlfriend / wife in dissings a buddy, except when she's
withholding sex pending your response. 

30. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing: Both
urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, a nod is all the
conversation you need. 
 
31. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not
join him  ...too gay. 

32. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt
one intervention. If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye, and
deliver a "F@CK OFF!" You are absolved of your of responsibility. 

33. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a friend" have
carnal, drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is
no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big
mistake it was. 

34. In Black Jack, always split aces and eight's.  No arguments.
