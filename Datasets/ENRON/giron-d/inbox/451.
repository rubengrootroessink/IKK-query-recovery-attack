Excellent.  Kai will work hard to get you the right deal.  That is the advantage of using him instead of a bank.  He has multiple lenders available to chose from.

Have a good day.

Thanks.  I wanted to see what refinancing to a 15 year would look like.  I just talked to him.  Things are wierd and I know it must be even worse moving to a new group.  I'm glad you like it over there.  I guess it's just wait and see.

Darron: 

I got your message, but I must have missed you.  Try calling Debbie Delgado @ x39183.  She is the ADMIN who sits next to me.

If you want to just call Kai directly about mortgages, his vital signs are below (just kidding).  The best place to reach him is at 713-816-1300.

See you soon.

How are things in your world ?

Pretty strange to be starting in a new group at such an uncertain time.

I like my group.

Thanks
