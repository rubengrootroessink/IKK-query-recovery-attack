Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my records
of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my restoration
back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them with
seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you paid
me?

When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season and OU
or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats than your
season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix with
their season tix.

I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

We'll get it worked out

I just got the tickets.  Thanks for sending them.  I paid for 4 OU tickets,
could you only get me 2?  Let me know.  I also wanted to ask you about the
possibility of getting 2 additional tickets for next season.  I know you
get quite a few each year, but don't know if you have extras available.
Thanks again.

DG

   OU tix are in!

   We'll work out leaving the tix for you under the mat, unless you'd like
   me
   to fedex them to you.  Let me know

   It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll probably
   just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of
   the
   NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this with
   you
   next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word on
   OU?

   Thanks
   DG

      I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get the
      tickets.
      If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later date.
      Thanks.

         Darin - The season tickets are in; OU tickets will be mailed
   later.
      How
         do
         you want to pick them up?  Any plans to be in Austin, soon?

         Regards
