Hi Darron,
Sorry I didn't respond yesterday... things have been very crazy around
here lately.  I'm checking air fare today and will let you know tomorrow
what our plans are.

How do you like Broadband Direct?

Are you still planning to come down?  I need to get a head count because
tickets are sometimes tough to come by.  Let me know.
