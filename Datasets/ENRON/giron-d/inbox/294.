tEXas tailgatES talk

The Longhorns have accepted a bid to the Holiday Bowl
to play the Washington Huskies. We are off to San Diego.
Expect the information on the tailgate, travel packages
from the Flying Longhorns and other activities in the
next day or so. I will send along the regular email in
a day or so as well.
