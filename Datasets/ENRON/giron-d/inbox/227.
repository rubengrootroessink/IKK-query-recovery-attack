Great Game on Saturday.  Our next Game is Tuesday @ 6 p.m. on Queenston # 7.
Attached is the revised information for the entire team.  I know I just sent
this out.

I also have the picture forms.  We will hand these out on Tuesday.  If you
have not printed the snack schedule (attached), I will have a couple of extra
copies at the game.

Additionally,  I have 5 green belts for the uniforms.  Let me know if you
need one.  I will bring them on Tuesday.  With so much going on on Saturday,
I did not have time to pass them out to new players on the team.

Tell your players that I was extremely please with how they played. They were
great sports.

See you on Tuesday.

John Snook
