>The Audubon Zoo in New Orleans had acquired a
>  very rare species of gorilla named Priscilla.
>  Within a few weeks, she became very horny,
>  and difficult to handle. Upon examination,
>  the park veterinarian determined the problem.
>  The gorilla was in heat. To make matters worse,
>  there were no male gorillas of the species available.
>
>  While reflecting on their problem, the park
>  administrators noticed their best employee, Trosclair,
>  working near her cage.  Trosclair, like most cajuns,
>  often bragged about how he could satisfy any female
>  of ANY species. So, the park administrators thought
>  they might have a solution.
>
>  Trosclair was approached with a proposition. Would he be
>  willing to have sex with the gorilla for $500?  Trosclair
>  scratched his head, looked at Priscilla and said he would
>  have to think about it.  The following day, Trosclair
>  said that he would accept their offer, but only under
>  three conditions.
>
>  "Firse," he said, "I don't not want to haf to kiss er."
>
>  "Second...you must not never tol'  no one 'bout dis."
>
>  The park administration quickly agreed to these
>  conditions, so they asked what was his third
>  condition.
>
>  "Well, da tird ting," said Trosclair, "you gotta give
>  me another week to come up with the $500."
