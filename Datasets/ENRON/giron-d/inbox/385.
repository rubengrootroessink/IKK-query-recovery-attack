Yes i was aware of the talks. but after reading the
latest report of the Wall Street I wasn't too sure
that the deal was on. Mergers always affect some
people negatively, and others positively. i'm sure
that all will be fine with you. Your credentials, work
ethic, and results will speak loudly. Take good care
of your family. best time of the night to call me is
around 10:00 PM. We're on the same time zone. Dad
