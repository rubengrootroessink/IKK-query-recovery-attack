Darron and Brian	

I pushed a few test deals for Canadian products through and need you to review these deals in Tagg and Sitara to verify that they are booking correctly for valuation purposes.  Please let me know if you see any problems (indexes, books, pricing, etc.)  Don't worry about the deal highlighted in pink..I am working on getting this to bridge.

Please reply by e-mail!!!

Dawn
