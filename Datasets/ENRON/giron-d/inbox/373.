Sorry to be talking business, but nonetheless find attacted a copy of the Master customer list developed in the East.  I would like each of you to forward your "working" customer list to Lindsay.  Lindsay will then begin to build a list like that attached for the Central group.  This will be a work in Progress so don't worry about everything being perfect.

thanks

Frank
