How does Thursday the 18th sound to everybody?  I think it works for
everybody except Todd, who I didn't hear from, which may mean he's out of
town.  I'm flexible on time & place, but Giron's on the south side, Todd's
by the Park shops (I think) and the rest are up north, so a central
location would probably be best.  Let me know what you think and I'll
coordinate or just reply to all and we'll work it out amongst ourselves.

PS - Bear had a baby girl last Friday named Reagan.  Mother and daughter
are doing fine.
