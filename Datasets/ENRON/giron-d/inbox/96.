Darron - if it's not too much trouble - could we get the supply deal valued as of 1/16/01.  That's the date the other deals were valued from.

If not - can I see the Nymex curve and just estimate the value differential from the 16th to yesterday.

Thanks -

His list does not include any of the transport positions.  It also includes some deals with the Chicago office that should not be included in the deal value.
