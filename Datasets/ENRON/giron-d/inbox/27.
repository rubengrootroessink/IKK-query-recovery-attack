I agree.  Everything looks right

we booked basedload summer sell of 95,000.  ENA calls of 50,000 and ENA puts of 30,000 for PGL

we booked summer puts of 5,000 for NS

we booked winter calls of 45,000 for PGL

This all ties to the contract.

Thanks for your help

The GD Options (both calls and puts) are booked year round.  They are all in N17872.9, N17872.A, N17872.B, N18064.6, and N18254.4.  I will begin looking at the unwind problem.
