I was at the doctor's when you called today.  Doesn't  look like we will have a Christmas baby.  And probably not a tax-deduction  either according to her.  I have been so congested and coughing  terribly. I either pulled a chest wall muscle or broke a rib coughing  several nights ago.  Lots of pain to get around but otherwise I'm doing  fine.  
 
The "12 days of Christmas" was cute.
 
Do you have tickets to the Sugar Bowl yet?  That is  definately a hot ticket here.  
 
Visited with Uncle Clark Tues. night.  He looks  good.  Connor got an Ants in the Pants game from him and he went  wild.  Of course, it doesn't take much to tip him over the edge  lately.  Cammie is calm and content as usual.  
 
I will see you shortly.  
 
Jessie
