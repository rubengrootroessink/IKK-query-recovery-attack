There are a growing number of things for us to discuss relative to gas
supply for Pleasant Valley Station.  I would like to suggest the following
dates to meet in Houston.

Choice #1:	November 13, a morning meeting

Choice #2:	Novemer 6, a morning meeting

Please let me know (and reply all in your response) if one or both dates
work.

I will put together an agenda of the items for discussion.
