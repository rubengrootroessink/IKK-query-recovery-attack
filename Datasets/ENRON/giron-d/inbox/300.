The Tailgate

We have something set up. This is not a traditional tailgate party,
there will be no reserved section at this place, or banners or flags
or anything. This is simply a place to gather and eat before the game,
and hang out watch the early bowls games that day. Some others will be
doing some more traditional things around San Diego that day, but all
will start later, so come have some lunch with us and then head over to
the stadium for the other festivities (look for the blimp, or the
cowboy hats and big white truck, whatever camp you may fall into).

Here is where we will be:
Trophy's
7510 Hazard Center Drive
San Diego, CA 92108
Trolley Exit: Hazard Center
619/296-9600

If you have a large group, say 10 or more, you might want to call
ahead and make reservations.

This place is literally right on the Trolley Line, and can be clearly
seen from the Trolley. It also has plenty of parking for those of you
driving, and it has a HUGE menu. They have everything from sandwiches
to gourmet pizzas, enchiladas to bbq ribs, and everything in between.

Be careful when you get there to look for the name. There will not be
any Texas paraphanalia out anywhere. The place is nervous we might run
off the Husky fans if we bring our gear (what a shame that would be),
so we won't. You won't have any trouble finding it, though.

We will be there from 12:30 pm on, so come out and see me.
Let me know if you have any questions.
