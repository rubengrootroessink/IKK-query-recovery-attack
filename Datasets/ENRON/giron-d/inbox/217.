I think the D is very fast, but having said that, I still think we are a
half-step slower than OU (OU has one of the fastest D's I have ever seen
including the Miami hay-days).  My understanding is Mack held back much of
the playbook in order to run the ball.  DD Lewis still overpursues.   We
may be vulnerable up the middle.  You're right about the punting, OU
specializes in blocking punts and/or returning them.  I am glad Mack forced
the running game, we will need this part of the game to stand a chance
against OU.  Benson was the bright spot - great acceleration through the
hole, an uncanny ability to make people miss and the ability to change
speeds while looking for the next hole to dart through.   He reminds me
most of Marcus Allen.  Allen never looked fast but was always accelerating
past tacklers and waiting for the next block to be set up.

I know I shouldn't jinx this team, but I am very optimistic.  We will need
Benson's running to actually make this a special season.   Simm's is not
good enough to carry the team through the air only.   OU will have their
DBs and backers facing him while he is in the pocket.   It appears he still
locks on to the primary receiver.  I'm telling you now - a good running
game will cure all our ills.

Let me know what you think.  Let's try to go to lunch this week.  I am free
any day.

Did you watch the game?  What did you think?  The OL was either rusty,
or just plain average.  The D looked fast, but still prone to
overpursuit.  We will have at least one punt blocked this year.  I'm
still not sure the best game QB is starting.  MB is a hell of a
recruiter,  you can tell (especially on D) how fast the team is.
