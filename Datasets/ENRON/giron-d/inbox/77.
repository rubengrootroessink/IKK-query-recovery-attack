Darron:

The NG-PRICE file contains the information that we need. When you will be creating a new book with live financial in-the-money deals by counterparty, could you please refine it a bit further and exclude all Internal Enron entities and NYMEX. 

Should you have any questions please don't hesitate to give me a call at X3-4305.

Thanks,
Elena

The file was too big to email.  It contains all financial deals (P,B,I,GD) in the active NG-PRICE book.  It does not contain any option deals.  I will set up the new books so that we can move the net positive deals by counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions.  It is saved in O:/_Dropbox.
