FYI - I have done the west and I have resaved this file out there.  I highlighted the rows to be changed in yellow.  If we all do this, we should be able to use the same list.  I added a column to the file and put IM S/B, LT S/B and Daily S/B.

The sitara mapping table is saved in the Netco file named CurveMappings.xls

Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.


Thanks
