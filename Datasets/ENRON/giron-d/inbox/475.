This is not the regular email, that will come in a day or so,
and it will have all of the regular info, and the tailgate
information for the BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME!!!!!

Tickets
Let's talk about the game for a second. I'm sure you can imagine
the demand for tickets. The Big XII allots 16,500 tickets to be
divided among both schools, or 8,250 each. Cut 10% out of that
for the student draw, and it's down to 7,425. That's 7,425 tickets
for around 70,000 people looking to be in Dallas this weekend.
The 7,425 should raise some when Colorado doesn't sell all of
theirs (they usually don't), so that should push it up to 11,000
or so. That's 11,000 seats for around 40,000 people. These tickets
will be prioritized and dealt out as usual.You should know if you
are one of those who get select tickets or if you do not. If you
do, you should contact the Longhorn Foundation (ticket reservations
started on at 10:00 am on Sunday, November 25 and it ends at 7:00 pm
on Monday, November 26). If you are not one of these people, there
are options: School message boards, ticket vendors/outlets, want ads
in Norman and Lincoln, and most isp's have some sort of on-line
shopping sites where people sell any and everything. Believe me, I
have looked, tickets are EVERYWHERE on the Internet. Start with the
Longhorn links and work your way to the OU and NU sites, the ticket
outlets and on to the buy/sell sites and you will find them.

The Game
This is it folks. It may not have happened exactly like it was
supposed to, but what ever does? It's right there in front of
the Longhorns, and now they need to reach out and grab it. They
need your help. COME TO DALLAS. From the players, the coaches,
the Athletic Department- COME TO DALLAS. When CU came to town in
October, the game was close until the shovel pass. After that,
the crowd took over. Life was unbearable for the Buffalos after
that: they couldn't audible, they had false starts, delay of
games, etc... and they got blown out. That was the crowd. Dallas
is our town, this our state, Texas Stadium is OUR house. The Buffs
are the visitors in OUR HOUSE. Let's make it a Burnt Orange Dallas.
An endless sea of Texas shirts and hook'em horns, and a thundering
stream of noise to let the Buffalos know we mean business down
here in Austin. Let's turn Texas Stadium into the DKR-North.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. Who knows, by the time the game kicks off,
Florida or Miami may have lost, and you could be watching the
Longhorns celebrate Mack Brown's 1st Big XII Championship as the
players carry roses around and the crowd goes crazy in anticipation
of the National Championship game in Pasadena. Get yourself to
Dallas. It's right there.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. DKR-NORTH. OUR HOUSE.
