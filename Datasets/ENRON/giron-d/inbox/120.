The HB was pretty wild.  We went to the Big XII CG.  Good game, bummer
outcome.

I think I would like to start the 529 plan for each kid.  Can I transfer
either the custodial or Ed IRA $$??  I just tried to call, but no one
answered.  With all the craziness here, I'm not sitting by my phone.  If
you call, ask the person to messenger me.

DG

   Darron,

   Sorry, things have been hectic lately... How did you like that Horns
   game???

   As for the Ed IRA.. they have raised the limits to $2K

   You should however consider the Section 529 plans that I believe we have
   discussed previously.  Call me to discuss further.

   > I hope you had a good Holiday Season.  Hopefully 2002 will be better
   than
   2001!  I believe that this year the limit has been raised on the
   Education
   IRA's.  Is this true?  If so, I would like to contribute more than the
   $500
   that it has been.  Please let me know.  Thanks.
