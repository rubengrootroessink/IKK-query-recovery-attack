There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips.  O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.  

There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files. 

We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that. 

I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.
