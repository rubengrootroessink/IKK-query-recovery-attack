    I notice that there is another message from  you. Just to let you know that I have chosen not to read it. Though you  hopefully did not mean to, my feeling were very hurt by your last one and I just  cannot deal with that again right now.  
 
We had a great time at the museum as usual.  Christopher  knows it by heart and could be a tour guide.  I bought him an arrowhead and  another goede called an ocos??  Carley only wanted a butterfly pin ($ .92),  do you can just imagine the beauty of it, right? As usual, they were as good as  gold.  We stopped by to see Kirk and Sue and I had them give Jerry a call  on the phone.
