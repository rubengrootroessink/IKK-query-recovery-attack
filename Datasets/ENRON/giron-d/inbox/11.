Make sure on the TDS Curve Manager not to hit the    button on the publish sheet.  This button normally
brings in the latest version of code, however the latest version does not include information for the 'Y' curve.
This will be fixed after the code freeze that is now in place is released.

Any questions or problems, give me a call.

Russ
