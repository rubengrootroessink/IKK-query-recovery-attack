Group:

I know you are all being forwarded the messages on the blood drive and the contribution matching by Enron (2 for 1) to charitable organizations in NY.  I know we ask a lot of our employees and sometimes all these "contributions" seem overwhelming.  I personally ask each of you to take time this week in your own personal way to give thanks.  We have group members who were close to harms way and the Central Region has family members potentially lost in this tragedy.  

The best way I know to encourage an official "time-out"  is to ensure you all start your weekends with your families starting at noon today.  Officially Central Origination/enovate are closed this afternoon.

Sincerely,

Laura

Wow!  Enron employees and other Houstonians are showing such generosity!  

The response to the blood drive has been outstanding.  Employees from Continental Airlines and other surrounding corporations have come to our blood donation site to give.  Blood Center personnel have informed us that because of the overwhelming response donations are now being taken on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Blood Center is attempting to keep appointments on schedule.  However, we ask for your patience and understanding if there is a delay. 

It is indeed gratifying to witness your continued generosity to the community and beyond.
