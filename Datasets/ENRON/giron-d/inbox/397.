   George W. Bush and Bill Clinton somehow ended up at the same barbershop.
 As they sat there, each being worked on by a different barber, not a word
 was spoken. The barbers were both afraid to start a conversation, for fear
 it would turn  to politics.

    As the barbers finished their shaves, the one who had Clinton in his
 chair reached for the aftershave. Clinton was quick to stop him saying, "No
 thanks, my wife Hillary will smell that and think I've been in a
 whorehouse."

 The second barber turned to Bush and said, "How about you?" Bush replied,
 "Go ahead. My wife Laura doesn't know what the inside of a whorehouse
 smells like."
