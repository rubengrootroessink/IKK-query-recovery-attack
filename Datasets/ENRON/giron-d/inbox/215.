I got my files restored and indeed had you down for four OU tix.  So sorry.
Let's try to hook up Saturday.

I wouldn't mind help with the Foundation contribution, but the downside all
belongs to you.  I could practically guarantee that if you were to split
away and create your own foundation giving you'd get knocked out of your
seats unless you jumped in at the $2500 level/yr or higher.  Any money
given to me would not be qualified for a tax credit for you.  And if you
decide in the future to start anyway, you lose all the prior years
cumulative giving where you didn't start.  Any any money you gave me
wouldn't mean we'd be guaranteed better OU tix (or season tix) because I
would lower my personal contribution by the same amount.  I don't want to
be on the hook for the extra contribution should you decide in the future
to stop helping.  That said, that may not be important for you and you
won't mind sending me dollars.

I know I wouldn't be getting OU tix at all if it wasn't for my contribution
to the Foundation.  Not all Foundation members are getting OU tix any more,
so I continue to consider myself lucky to continue getting tickets at all.

Your choice!

I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are
Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I
guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know
the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4
season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6
years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.
I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the
Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

DG

   Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my
   records
   of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my restoration
   back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them with
   seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

   I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you
   paid
   me?

   When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season and
   OU
   or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats than
   your
   season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix
   with
   their season tix.

   I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

   We'll get it worked out

   I just got the tickets.  Thanks for sending them.  I paid for 4 OU
   tickets,
   could you only get me 2?  Let me know.  I also wanted to ask you about
   the
   possibility of getting 2 additional tickets for next season.  I know you
   get quite a few each year, but don't know if you have extras available.
   Thanks again.

      OU tix are in!

      We'll work out leaving the tix for you under the mat, unless you'd
   like
      me
      to fedex them to you.  Let me know

      It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll
   probably
      just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day
   of
      the
      NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this
   with
      you
      next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word
   on
      OU?

      Thanks
      DG

         I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get the
         tickets.
         If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later
   date.
         Thanks.

            Darin - The season tickets are in; OU tickets will be mailed
      later.
         How
            do
            you want to pick them up?  Any plans to be in Austin, soon?
