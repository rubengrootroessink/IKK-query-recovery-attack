Greetings Darron ,

I am contacting you, Darron  very briefly today to ask for your assistance.

Audio Concepts (ACI) is going to be reaching a milestone in about 45 days.

We are turning 25 years old in the audio and home theater speaker business.

The printing presses are just finishing this week our brand new full color
brochure which will feature 3 major new product announcements plus the full
restyling of the entire product grouping.  This has been a major effort here at ACI
a full 18 months in the making.

We will be mailing this full color brochure to you Darron .

We've been working very hard to make sure everyone gets one at the same time -
playing no favorites.  But we need to make sure our addresses are fully correct.

Below is the data we have for you, Darron .  If everything looks good - then just
sit back and in about 2 weeks you'll be seeing the new styling and our
exciting new products - all done in this new literature format.

Holiday-time mailing is always busy - and we want to take every possible step
to make it arrives like its supposed to.  If any of the data is wrong or old -
please let us know so we may correct it.

Your name:        Darron Giron

Your Address:    14343 Millstone Estates

City, St & Zip:     Cypress,  TX  77429

Also, if for any reason you do not want to receive this mailing - we'd appreciate knowing.

For any of the items above that need correction - please email  Janis@audioc.com
                                                                                                   ------------------------------

Also, we'll be completing and sending out our next newsletter between the Holidays
to all on the regular newsletter list.   The engineering and design departments have
been busy for many months just to help guarantee every success for customers during
this special 25th year.  We believe our new products and striking new designs will offer
all the quality performance we've been known for and more, plus more product selection.

These major enhancements should help speaker lovers have a great Christmas season
and a pleasant 2002 - our 25th year.   For Sound that Satisfies ...... since 1977.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Darron, you'll be hearing from us very soon - unless we hear differently from you.

In the mean time, good holiday to you this Thanksgiving.  We all have much
to be thankful for.

Cordially,


Alex
Newsletter Coordinator
