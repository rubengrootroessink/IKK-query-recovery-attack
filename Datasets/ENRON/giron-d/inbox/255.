Here's the contact report for the lady at Kansas Muni Gas Authority.  It includes a brief synopsis of the structure we priced out for her at the beginning of the month.  Let me know if you'd like the prepay model as well.

Early 'Oct '01:  Spoke with Chris to price out a ten-year gas prepay for 1.5BCF/yr (flat profile) to be delivered in Williams Field Zone commencing May '02.  Strip quote from Dutch Quigley was $3.56; basis quote from Andy Lewis was $0.06.  Worked w/Kelli Lewis of structuring to price out ten-year prepay.  Delivered pricing equivalent to $2.62/MMBTU at nominal volumes, $3.38/MMBTU at PV volumes (which is how ENA will book it).  Heard back from Chris that KMGA is looking for sub-$2.50 (undiscounted); that's the level that they've gone to their boards and passed ordinances for.  In speaking with her, she seemed to gradually be realizing that this was not reality and that perhaps they may need to revisit the price level with their individual member munis and communities.  Said that she may call me from time to time to revisit pricing.
