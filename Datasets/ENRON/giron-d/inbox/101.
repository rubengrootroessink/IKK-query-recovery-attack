I have to first apologize. I gave the speakers to my shipper at work who
felt
he could ship the items whenever he felt up to it. So I had to FedEx 2nd
day
air the speakers to you. I am truly sorry. Here is the tracking number
816911343059 go to www.fedex.com to see where they are. Thanks for you
patience.
