Good to get a message from you even tho I am pretty far away!!  I will check
calendar when I get home.  I am interviewing that week and some are
scheduled in hotel and some are on my end of town; didn't bring my schedule
for that with me.  We are in meetings from 9-5:30pm so now I see what it
must be like on your business trips!! Did spend an evening with my aunt and
cousins on Sunday and one of my first cousins is taking me around tonite for
a while.  Last nite I went on a twilight tour until 11:30.  The monuments
are so outstanding especially at night. Hope you can take your family
here...Chris would be in so much awe.  Glad you had a good time with Carlos.
I will talk to you this weekend.  Love, MOM

I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We
definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather
was good and the food was great.  How is DC?  Have you seen any of the
sights yet?

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when
we are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let
me know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and
return Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights
and getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the
neighbors.

Thanks.  See you when you get back.
