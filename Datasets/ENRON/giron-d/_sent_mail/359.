I agree.  The honeymoon will be over begining next season.  I am growing 
weary of teams "tricking" us early in games.  Too me, that translates to 
"outcoached".  Maybe I'm being unreasonable, but they should have the talent 
next year.  We'll see.  You had to love OSU kicking the shit out of the 
domers.  Looks like Erickson has brought the thug factor back into college 
football.
