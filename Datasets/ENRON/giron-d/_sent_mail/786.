Subject: Financial Cash Desk Deals

The Sitara group is getting prepared to be converting all cash desk financial 
deals into Sitara.  Could you have someone send me a list of the different 
books used in Tagg to book deals for the Central cash desk.  We are also 
working on an application to display the risks on the physical deals booked in
Sitara.  Could you also have sent to me a list of the different regions that 
your desk wants to have its physical positions broken up into.

If you have any questions, please call me.
