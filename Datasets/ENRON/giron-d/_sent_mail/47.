I asked Keith Holst (trader) again.  His answer was the same.  There were 
more buyers than sellers in the West during March, hence the price was 
stronger.  Thanks.

Darron --

Thanks for your response.  We understand that the west traded higher in 
general during March v. Feb,  as evidenced by the data.  However, we are 
looking for specific reasons as to why this is so.  For example, if the 
market was more volatile at these locations, then why?  What particular 
market conditions sparked large price changes, etc?  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Jennifer,
The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of 
March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and 
NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other 
Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further 
questions.

DG

Darron --

Before I send out the memo for March, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for March.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

NGI-MALIN
NGI-PGE CG
IF-CIG WIC

The shifts in MALIN and PGE CG are pretty clear.  For CIG WIC, please note 
how the front years show a price drop compared to prior months, while marks 
in the mid-years have shifted upward by approximately  $0.10.  Thanks for 
your help, and please let me know if you have any questions.


Jennifer
