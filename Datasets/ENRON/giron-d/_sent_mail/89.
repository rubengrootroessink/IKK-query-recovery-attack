Please find attached a matrix outlining all requests made for the 1st quarter
2001 to date, the Enron contacts for those items, and the status of each
requested item.  If I have erroneously noted the wrong contact, please let
myself and the correct person responsible know at your earliest convenience.
Also, this e-mail is only being sent to the desk leads, so please forward to
