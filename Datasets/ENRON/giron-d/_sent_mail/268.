ok, here is the story...I cannot seem to find the voice thing for your 
auburn  
tiger. ?I tried to find a web site to order the guy another one and can't  
find that either. ?Name is silly slammers.. please order another one for 
him;  
I will repay you..Probably as soon as the new one comes in I will fnd the 
old  
one. ?Sorry about that. MOM ????????? 

That dealership in brooklyn that refurnishes those cars I told you about is  
called Fast Action Car Dealership..couldn't find that site either. 

You and your brother need to think about the sept trip to Estes Park...I 
want  
to make reservations soon. ?I realize that you already have a trip planned 
to  
CO this year, ?and am not sure if your KS cousins will even be there, but we  
need to talk about this. ?Lar and I are going irregardless of who goes...the  
more I look up about this place the more I like it. ?MOM
