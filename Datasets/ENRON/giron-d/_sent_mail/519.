The kids and I are arriving at 9:45am on Thursday.  Because of work 
commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.  The 3 of us will get a rental 
car and make our way to your place.  Are you going to be home then?  Then we 
will go pick up Kristi later.  We have no plans at the moment (other than 
going to the game on Saturday).  We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time, 
though, 6:30am.  They didn't give me many options using reward travel.  We 
are all looking forward to the trip.  See you on Thursday.
