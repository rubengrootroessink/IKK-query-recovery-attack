Have you had a chance to look at this adjustment to $.1134?  Sitara still 
shows .0556. 
I'd like to include this adjustment on the 7/00 invoice I'm sending out 
tomorrow.
Please let me know when updated.
Thanks,
Kevin

After reviewing the pipeline calculations, the pipeline commodity 
reimbursement should be the following:

Commodity $.0594
Fuel  $.054 (Assuming GD Tenn/500 = $2.775 (Mar 15), and Tennessee Fuel % = 
1.91%)
Total  $.1134

The commodity was adjusted to recover the Tennessee pipeline commodity costs 
not Midwestern pipeline commodity ($.0594 vs. $.0016).  Let Kevin or myself 
know if you have any questions.   Please let us know when this has been 
completed.  Thanks.

Darron,
Please update Sitara #127427 for the fuel for 3/15/2000:

Commodity $.0016
Fuel  $.054 (Assuming GD Tenn/500 = $2.775 (Mar 15), and Tennessee Fuel % = 
1.91%)
Total  $.0556

Please let me know when this has been completed so I can redraft.

Thanks a bunch,
ajc
