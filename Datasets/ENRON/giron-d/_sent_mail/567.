We have some new procedures for changing deals that affect other books.  
Please read and let me know if you have any further questions.  You don't 
need to request minibook access individually.  I have, so if needed we can 
run them on my machine.  Thanks.

Subject: Changing Deals

Effective immediately,  if anyone changes any deal for any reason,  they need 
to provide a minibook with a before and after of exactly what they did.  This 
used to be a common courtesy,  but it looks like we need a stated policy in 
place.  You guys will therefore have to get minibook access to calc all books 
on a mini-book level from Jeremy.  Please let me know the timing Jeremy gives 
for getting the appropriate people mini-book access as soon as possible.  It 
is critical that we get this done right away.  I know that this is not a 
one-sided issue.  No group is better or more important than any other group.  
It is therefore important that we do a better job of communicating across 
groups.

Thanks,

Jeff
