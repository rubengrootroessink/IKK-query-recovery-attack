This is a modification of the old file.  If you had the same book and 
portfolio code for more than one book (ex. GG) it will pull in all GG 
post-id's.  
This one requires a comment in all post-id's to pull in only those.

Kam,

See if this works like you want.  If so, pass it along if you think others 
can benefit.

Let me know if you have questions.

Greg
