Darron:

I understand from Chris Abel that the deals contained within this book were 
transferred to a new book.  Would that be the FT-Lonestar book recently 
created?  If so, did you calc and officialize the book one last time to 
insure that the positions are zeroed out for credit purposes?  If you did 
not, can you please do so.  You can make the effective date the 19th as that 
is the day the deals were moved to a new book.  It necessary for you to calc 
and officialize one last time as the Credit system looks back at the last day 
officialized to pick up credit information.  This will insure that duplicate 
datat is not present for credit.


Thanks for you help in this matter.


Regards,


Nancy
