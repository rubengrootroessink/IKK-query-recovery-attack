Subject: 7 Duplicate Sitara deals

I was informed by the Sitara team that there are still sitara deals 
duplicated from yesterday's bridging "issues".  I have them highlighted in 
red in the e-mail below.  
Please kill the duplicate sitara number as soon as possible.  I believe 
atleast one of them is for gas flowing tomorrow!  If you need further 
information or assistance, contact me at 3-9353.

Thanks,
Dawn

Subject: 7 Duplicate Sitara deals

Due to the sitara bridge failing earlier today, it looks as though 7 sitara 
deals got double booked..  Listed in the e-mail below you will find the EOL # 
and the correponding Sitara #'s.  Please review and kill the sitara deal that 
is not "linked" to the EOL #.  

If you need further assistance, call me at 3-9353.

Sorry for any inconvenience.  Happy Bidweek!!!!!
