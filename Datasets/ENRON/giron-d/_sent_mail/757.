Subject: Fourth of July party!

Hey guys - I am going to have a July 4th celebration at my house (but not on 
the 4th - it will be on the 3rd - Monday).  Kids are welcome, although I 
can't promise things will remain under control all day!!!!  

I am going to get a keg of beer for us, but feel free to bring your beverage 
of choice.  I thought we would grill burgers and hot dogs - so just bring 
your own meat, and I will take care of all the sides.  Feel free to bring 
whatever you want for munchies....plan on an all day/night affair!



Call me if you need directions!  Let me know if you can make it so I can make 
sure I have enough food and drinks!

By the way, I do not have any furniture downstairs, so bring lawnchairs!
