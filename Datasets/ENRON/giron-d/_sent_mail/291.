David,
     I am forwarding you my resume regarding a conversation that I had with 
Steve Venturatos.  I would be extremely interested in any position that you 
might have available in your Risk group.  I have been with Enron for the past 
year, working in the regulatory branch of HPL.  I appreciate your time and 
look forward to hearing back from you.
