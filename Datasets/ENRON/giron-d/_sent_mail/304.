-> A mortician was working late one night.  It was his job to

> Schwartz had the longest penis he had ever seen!

> "I'm sorry Mr. Schwartz," said the mortician, "but I can't
> send you off to be cremated with a tremendously huge penis
> like this.  It has to be saved for posterity."  And the
> coroner used his tools to remove the dead man's schlong.

> The coroner stuffed his prize into a briefcase and took it
