I was wondering why you were waiting so long to respond.  I'm glad he is 
staying.  I think it says something about his commitment to the program he 
built.  It also says a little about the Big XII.  How are things in CO?  I'm 
in Chicago now but am heading for LA later this afternoon for Carlos&Y's 
shower.  Take care.
