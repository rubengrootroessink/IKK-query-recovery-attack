Phillip,

I need support for:
Sithe  59,500
Central 1 and GD Central  295708


Darron,

I need support for:
West  8,340,379
Denver 2,441,357

Please let me know when this may be available.  You may save the support to 
ERMS/1Intra/FRED Liquidations/"year"/"month"

I realize some of the may be transport and the detail should be minimal due 
to MGMT books; however, there are usually some Gas Daily deals that remain on 
the desk.

I WILL ALSO NEED SUPPORT FOR THE  DECEMBER AND JANUARY VALUES FOR ALL OF YOUR 
REGIONS IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SAVE THEM OUT TO THE ABOVE DIRECTORY.

Thanks,

Jim
