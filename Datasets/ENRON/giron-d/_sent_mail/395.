Subject: Gas Daily Curves

When Gas Daily curves are created in ERMS, the rate server group has told me 
that the GDP designated curves should be those that are 
actually  published, that they can get an outside feed to pull in the rates.  
Internally created curves used for gas daily purposes should be 
designated as a GDC curve.  If curves created in the future could follow this 
naming convention it would make the curve names more meaningful.

Normal GDP curves need to be set up by the global rate server group, dummy 
internal curves can be set up in global by us.

Any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks
