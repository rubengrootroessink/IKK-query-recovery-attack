Steve,
Attached is a list of the Hub Deals we have currently in the system.  I tried 
to reconcile them to the sheet you sent me but could not.  Please take a look 
at these and give me a call.  Thanks.

Darin, this is a summary of the Park and Loan deals that you should have. I 
will need to talk to you regarding the Exchange deals that are included on 
the summary of expected revenues. The only exchange that should be recorded 
under enovate should be the enron exchange for $5,000. In that exchange PGL 
Hub received molecules in June and returned them in July, ratable. Other than 
that, if you have any questions call me at 312-541-1233.

Thanks-Steve Richman
