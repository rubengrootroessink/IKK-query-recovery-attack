Darron, you recognized 3.975 (thousand) of orig, and I did not see that 
coming out of any book. Could you let me know who granted that. 

I know  0.5  (thousand) were granted by the NG Price, but I could not fine 
anything else. Also, if you could please look into the 468 (dollars) that I 
mentioned on my previous email, I would appreciate it. 

Thanks. 

If you have any questions let me know. 

Gabriel
