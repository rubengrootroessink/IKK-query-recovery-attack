Regarding the attached. . .

Paul-
I made edits to the document, but I have asked Jeff Sorenson to review the 
Confirmations piece, and I asked Darron Giron to review the Settlements 
piece.  Darron will coordinate the return of the document to you.  

Darron,
I made edits, and it is saved in O: Erms\1intra\Central\Transaction Flow 1.  
Please review (especially Settlements), make changes as necessary.  When Jeff 
gets his edits to you, please incorporate his Confirmations changes, and 
forward to Paul.

Jeff,
Once you have reviewed, please forward your changes to Darron Giron.  He will 
incorporate and forward to Paul.

I will be out of the office Mon-Thur next week, and I will return on Friday.  
Paul-please let Jeff and Darron know what sort of timeframe you are looking 
for. . .  If you all have a better way to coordinate, go for it!

Thanks,
Carrie

Brent & Jeff,

Attached is the Draft Transaction Flow Process for MEH.  Could you review and 
comment on any inconsistency between the MEH doc. and the ENA Process.  Also 
Gregg Penman was hoping you could expand on the names associated with the 
responsibilitites, as well as any other comments would be appreciated.

Thanks,
