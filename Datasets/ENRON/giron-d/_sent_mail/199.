This deal is related to the long term transportation that was sold to 
Calpine, but it is correctly booked as a physical forward sale at Malin.

Darron,

This is the deal I phoned you about yesterday which Eric Moon put together  
-  should it be booked as Transportation deal instead of a Forward ?

No I don't.  This deal is a Physical Forward.  Usually when it pertains to a 
transportation the trader usually creates a Transportation Capacity ticket in 
Sitara.  When it hits our portfolio we would then set it up in Global 
Contracts.  

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sylvia,

I'm looking into this deal and after researching it  it seems like there 
should be a separate Transportation Contract for this deal, and should not be 
confirmed by us on the Confirmation desk. Do you know anything about this 
deal or Contract ?

Eric Moon in Gas Structuring is the dealmaker and he asked me to talk to 
Darron Giron who is a book admin.
This deal relates to Tagg # EC3952  -  apparently they pulled loads of 
different transportation deals from our books and sold it on to Calpine. It 
seems to me there must be a Contract out there for this 8 year deal.

Hey folks. Just a note, Calpine Energy Services, LP deal #559974 was 
originally attached to a GTC due to the fact that the contracts group had not 
yet received the master contract. The contract was received & entered into 
Global this week & as a result we moved the above referenced deal to the 
master (Global #96056886). Transaction term information: 5/1/01 - 10/31/08.

Please reconfirm as necessary.

Thanks all!
