Darron,

Per our earlier conversation, the following is a list of new deals that we 
have identified for further testing.  At your earliest convenience, could you 
please provide the applicable deal ticket and forwards details for these two 
deals?  Please let me know if you have any further questions or comments.

Thank You,
