Yes we did.  We had a great time.  I heard Christine is pregnant again.  How 
are you doing?  After a week off, I realize how much work sucks!

Hello,
It sounds like you got hooked up with Sean.  I went to Dallas on Friday
and just got your message.  How was Colorado?

Hey,

How goes it?  I need your brother's phone numbers.  I am staying with
him
tomorrow night, but don't have directions.  We have only been
communicating
via email.  I hope you get this today.  Thanks.

DG
