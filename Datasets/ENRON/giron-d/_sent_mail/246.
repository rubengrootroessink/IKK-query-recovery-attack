Hi guys,

Here's a spreadsheet with the list of Aquila Canada Corp. and Engage Energy 
Canada deals that need to be flipped right away.



The book is listed on the left column.  Please let me know when these are 
finished as I need to get an invoice to the customers within the next couple 
of hours.

Thanks
Stacey
