Everything is OK over here.  I heard about the spring game.  31K is alot of 
people for a game that doesn't count.  Who is buying your company?  If it 
goes south, I'm sure I can get you on over here.  Let me know how it turns 
out.  We need to get together for lunch again.  Can you on Friday?

How's it going.  Did you go to the spring game?  Our company (American
General) is being purchased.  We currently have 2 suitors.  I hope my name
is still good at Enron.  We may all get flushed-out within the year.

Let me know what's going on.
