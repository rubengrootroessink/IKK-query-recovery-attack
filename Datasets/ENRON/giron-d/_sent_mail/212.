Subject: New Bridge Monitor

This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL 
production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this 
application more efficient.  Such as:

1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 
message/second.
2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a 
transaction without having the screen update with new deals.
3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates 
very quickly.
4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by 
selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, 
etc. and it  will filter to that section.

Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or 
concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 
3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while 
testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks,
Dawn
