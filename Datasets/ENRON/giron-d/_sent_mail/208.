We arrive in Denver on Saturday evening (the 10th).  We will stay that night 
and leave sometime on Sunday for Silvercreek.  We will return to Denver on 
Friday the 16th and stay the night.  Our plane back to Houston is early 
Saturday morning.  We are staying at a place in Silvercreek (I had not heard 
of this place before Kristi's friends made the plans) for 5 nights.  I think 
we want to ski there and possibly in Winter Park (it is supposed to be within 
15 miles).  How's the weather in Denver these days?  We look forward to 
seeing the two of you.  Thanks.

DG

Let me know again what the days are.  Also, let me know what you guys what
to do.  I can get lift tickets for about $43 at the grocery store.  Talk to
you later.
