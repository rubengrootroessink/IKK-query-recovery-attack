In addition:  expert clauses - which ones need to be changed, when and why - 
what are reversals and why we use them - how to check physical prompt month 
value for potential errors - how to calculate physical prompt month value - 
checking the OA Flash tab.  I am sure there are some others.

Topics should include:  NX3 roll-off, the curveshift associate with basis NX3 
roll-off and where it will show up on the p&l, what days we will roll in 
index - the percentages, how to adjust percentages for fixed priced prompt 
month positions, when to bring in prompt month value, how to put liquidations 
in the physical P&L, how to roll the physical and financial p&l's, etc.

Any suggestions?

Dave

Our next class will combine EOM bench/NGP&L and P&L procedures.  We will hold 
the class Tuesday @ 9:30 and combine both groups 1&2 for one class.  Jeff 
would like to go over the bench and NGP&L process for 45 minutes or so, and 
the rest of the class will be handled by Dave and Kam.  I will leave it to 
you 2 to decide who will talk about what.  Lets get together on Monday to 
brainstorm.
