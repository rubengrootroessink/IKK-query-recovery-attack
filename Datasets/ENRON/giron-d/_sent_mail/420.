In review of our third quarter file, we have not received the P&L top pages 
or curve shift reports for the following regions:  West Firm, FT Northwest 
and Mgmt. West.  Please provide this information as we would like to close 
out our third quarter file.  Thank you in addition for your help.

Sharon
