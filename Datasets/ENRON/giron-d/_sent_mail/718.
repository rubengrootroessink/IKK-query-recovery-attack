We are definately going skiing this winter.  We have not been for over two 
years.  I also want the kids to start skiing.  Send all of your sisters if 
you have them.  I'll put them in my address book and won't have to keep 
bugging you.  Take care.

Darron,

My dad's email is jcmayers@earthlink.net and which one of my sisters did you
want?

Everything is great here.  You guys really need to come here and enjoy the
scenery.  Maybe we can all go skiing or something.

Good hearing from you and take care.  I have to get to work.

Sean
