Jay,

I have the following transfers in place on a recurring basis beginning 
7/20/00:

$1,065/mo from my checking account into 226-27209
$175/mo from 226-27209 into 226-27210
$150/mo from 226-27209 into 226-27211

I would like to make monthly purchases (with the net amount transferred) of 
the existing mutual funds in each of the three accounts.

Buy $740/mo of APGCX in 226-27209
Buy $175/mo of APGCX in 226-27210
Buy $150/mo of APGCX in 226-27211

Call if you have any questions.
