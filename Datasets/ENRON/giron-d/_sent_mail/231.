Edie, Darren, further to our conversation.  The only reporting that I would 
like to send upstairs is broken down into two categories.  West Gas Trading, 
and West Gas Origination.  All orig ( even Denver ) is coded to 107321. 
Inside of west gas orig we have created a tracking mechanism through Darren, 
that provides a seperate report broken down by individual or group but I am 
the only person who needs this data for right now.

Edie, please ensure that on a go forward basis that the actualized income 
streams have been coded in the proper places and that we do not double count 
again.  

Call if any questions.

BT
