Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that 
there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with 
counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should 
start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these 
deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron 
counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals 
have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when 
they can start invoicing as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter.

Thank you
Stacey
