I forwarded your request to Luchas Johnson.  He runs the G-Daily-Est book.

Hi again Darron

Here are some more deals that need to be flipped out of the G-DAILY-EST book,

QC3611.1
QC4110.1
QC4394.1
QC4496.1
QC4506.1

Can you please also go through this book to see if there are any more deals 
between ECC and another counterparty.  These need to be fixed right away this 
morning as I need to invoice and settle them today.  Please call me if you 
aren't the person who handles this book, and please forward this message on 
to the person who does.

Thanks for your help
Stacey
