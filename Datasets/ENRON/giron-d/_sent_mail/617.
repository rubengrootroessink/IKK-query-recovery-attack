As many of you already know, I have taken a job outside of Oracle and am
now living in Dallas.  I will only have this email until Friday, October
6, 2000.  After that, please use:

scott_crowell@hotmail.com

I will send my new email address as soon as I get hooked up at the new
job.  My address and phone number in Dallas is:

4233 Travis Street, #29
Dallas, Texas 75205

214.521.8878

I will have the same cell phone for at least another couple of weeks,
and I will send that new number at a later date.

Scott
