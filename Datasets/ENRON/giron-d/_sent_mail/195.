This is just a quick reminder for all of you to please go into all of your 
books and flip out all the deals that are supposed to settle with ECC and a 
third counterparty  to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of the day today.  
Nymex closes today, and we need to make sure that all the deals are booked 
correctly for both the Calgary and Houston offices.  This is most important 
for February and March 2001 deals.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey
