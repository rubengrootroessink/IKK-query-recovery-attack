So you are going to play hardball are you?  I understand you situation.  I 
didn't know all of your guys were leaving tomorrow (literally!) Yeah, hold on

Believe me, I understand why you want him in your group.  But I lose Jennifer 
on Jan 24th and Chris on Jan 26th.  You have two months on one guy and six on 
the other.  I have 3 weeks on two people and Jason will be leaving soon 
because he is in the new trading track program.  I don't want to be an 
asshole, but I won't give him up unless I'm forced to.

I want Pat back in this group.  After the sale of this company, they are 
still going to make a go at having a Texas desk.  Denver is rotating in about 
6 months and Jody is rotating in two months.  I will help you find more 
talent.  What do you think?
