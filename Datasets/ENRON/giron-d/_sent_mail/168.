Subject: Q50979.1

Hi guys,

I've come across this deal that needs to be flipped right away.
This deal is in the MGMT-WEST book with Aquila Canada Corp. and
ENA.  It needs to be in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book settling between
ECC and Aquila Canada Corp.  This is causing problems with the 
February Liquidations as I settled this deal with Aquila, but it isn't coming
through the liquidations correctly.  Please let me know when this is done
so I can let Shannon McPearson know that she needs to re-run the 
February Liquidations.

Thanks
Stacey
