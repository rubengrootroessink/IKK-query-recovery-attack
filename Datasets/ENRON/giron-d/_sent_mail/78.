Instead of sending $ in and pulling $ out every month, I am going to stop 
sending $ into the CMA account starting this month.  I actually have already 
done this on the web.  What I need you to do is to stop the monthly purchase 
of APGCX for $340 begining this month.  Also, any idea if I am going to 
receive a 1099 for the recharacterization of the IRAs?  I noticed online 
that  the Roths are now zero.  Thanks.
