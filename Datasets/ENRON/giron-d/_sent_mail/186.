Sean,
I found out that Silver Creek is a very small resort close to the town of 
Granby, CO.  It is acutally 15 miles north of Winter Park and 2 miles south 
of Granby along Hwy 40.  We are staying at a condo there from Sunday night 
(11th) thru Thursday night (15th).  I indicated we would like to go to Winter 
Park because we have been there and it is close.  We want to ski 2 days in 
Silver Creek and 2 days somewhere else.  If you can make it during the week 
to Keystone, then yes we will go there instead of WP.  I would love to go to 
an Avs game, but we will probably need to be on the road by late afternoon on 
Sunday.

Once again, we get in on Saturday (10th) about 9pm.  That's pretty late so we 
may or may not be able to do anything that night.  We will leave on Sunday 
(11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th).  
Then our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.  If you can 
get away during the week to ski, that would be awesome.  Thanks for all your 
hospitality.  See you soon.

DG

Darron,

The weather is great here.  In March, we receive every type of weather.  One
day we could get 12 inches of snow, the next day it could be 80!  I have a
pass to Keystone, Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, and A-Basin.  My pass
does not include Winter Park (although I have a free lift ticket that I
could use and go skiing with you.).  My pass cost $300 and I get unlimited
use (I have been 23 times this year-I think I got my money worth!).  I do
not know where Silvercreek is, but I will look. Do you mean Silverthorne by
chance?  If there is any way to go to Keystone, it would save Tracie and I
some money.  But, I understand that it is your vacation and if you go to
Winter Park, let me know and price is no concern.  This is how I rank the
resorts as far as skiing: 1. Vail  2. Copper  3. Keystone  4. Winter
Park/Mary Jane  5. Breckenridge.

I have not been to Beaver Creek, but I heard that it was awesome.  Even
though I ranked WP fourth, it is still a great resort.  The runs at Keystone
and Vail are long and Vail is the largest resort in USA (5300 acres compared
to 2000 for Keystone!).  As far as atmosphere (night life), Vail is by far
the best.  Winter Park does not have much at the ski resort as far as night
life (that I recall, but I have not been there much.).  You have to go into
town, which is small.  Breckenridge is good for the night as well and so is
Copper, but Vail is the best (I love Vail if you have not noticed!).  Just
let me know as far as plans.  We have a busy March.  On March 17, the day
you leave, we have a wedding.  On Friday night, we might have to go to the
rehearsal dinner, but I do not know yet.  Michelle and the kids are coming
up in March also.  Maybe she can come up at the same time.  We always have a
room available.

I am looking forward to seeing you and Kristi.  Let me know if you guys want
to do anything in Denver.  You can also go snowmobiling and snowshoeing as
well.

If you guys need any ski gear or accessories, let me know and I will check
here for prices.  Plus, you can borrow some of my gear on the days I can't
meet up with you.

You guys are going to love it here.  You also need to come out in the
summertime.  It is so much better.  I think my sisters and dad are coming
out again for the 4th of July.  We went white water rafting last year and
Kim loved it.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Sean
