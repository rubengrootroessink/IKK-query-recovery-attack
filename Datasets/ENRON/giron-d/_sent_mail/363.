Subject: Technical Questions

I also do not have many tech questions.  I look for trainability as well.  

My questions:
-What do you know about the commodities market?
-Do you do any online trading, if so what, and why - looking for trading of 
options,  stocks, futs, etc for more difficult follow-up questions like
    why options, not buy/sell the underlying.  How do you determine what to 
trade and when, how long do you hold it.  Also looking for how often they 
play        on the internet and whether they do it at work.  
-What do you know about the industry?  How many units in a contract?  How do 
you hedge physical gas?  Financial positions?  
-What is V@R?  Not looking for a technical answer, just if they are familiar 
with the concept?  What other trading controls do they expect to be in place?
-How well do you handle ridicule?  (Always looking for a certain central 
trader's new lackey)
-How well versed are you in Excel?  What have you done where you are using 
excel to improve your work product?  How did you learn it?  Have you shared 
it with anyone else?  What other improvements have you made?  Would you give 
me a name of a person I could verify the impact this has had in your current 
organization?  (I don't ever call, I just am looking to see if there answer 
is the truth and what kind of ego they have) 
-Further educational goals?  MBA, CFA,  - looking for goals and motivators.
-Are you easily incited to violence?

Subject: Technical Questions

I do not have very many technical questions but here a the few that I have 
used:

- Do you understand what curveshift is?  If so ... Price today was $10.20 and 
yesterday it was $10.13 ... what was my curveshift?
- What makes up a P&L statement?
- What is MTM accounting?  accrual accounting?
- If they have knowledge of options, what is a delta position?

I guess these are more general analytical questions:

- Give me an example of an problem you've had and how you solved it?
- The "eight ball" question (basic problem solving)
- The "light switch" question (advanced problem solving)

When I interview I am looking for trainability, better than average problem 
solving skills and a desire to work in this environment.  If the candidate 
has these skills then I believe we can teach them what they need to know.  I 
also think it is candidates with these basic attributes that are a better fit 
for us.  They know they don't know everything (about Risk) and work hard to 
get up to speed.
