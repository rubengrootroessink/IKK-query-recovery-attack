Tara and I will be here early in the morning to monitor the bridge and make 
sure the physical deals are bridging correctly.  Please make sure you keep an 
eye on these deals and let us know if something looks "funny".  If, by 
chance, a transaction fails for some reason, please do not bridge manually, 
we will try to fix the problem on our end.  

Thank you for all of your help this transition.
