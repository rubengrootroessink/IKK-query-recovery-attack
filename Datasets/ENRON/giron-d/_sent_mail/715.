Kim,

How are you?  I got your address from Sean and wanted to make sure it 
worked.  I just sent a note to your dad asking if he was going to be in town 
for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on taking the whole group up for 
the KU-UT game.  I hope you will be in town as well.  Let me know.  Take care.
