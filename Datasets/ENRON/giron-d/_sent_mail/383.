Dawn,

The deals look good in both Tagg and Sitara, but the link field in Tagg has 
not been populated with the Sitara number.  When will this be ready?  Thanks.

Darron,

Please take a look at these deals in Tagg Stage and Sitara parallel.  Look at 
the pricing, risk book assignments, and the hedges in sitara (if needed).

Let me know if there is a problem.  If there is not, we want to roll this out 
as soon as possible.
