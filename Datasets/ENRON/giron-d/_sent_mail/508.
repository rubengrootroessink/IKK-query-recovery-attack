Hello Dawn,
I've already received invoice for 9/00 production.  Could you please change 
its price to 4.417791 (S#27239)?
BTW, have you had a chance to look at previous months'? (Please see message 
below)
Thanks so much for your help,
T  3-9852

Hi Dawn,
The rate at some locations has not been changed in Sitara.  Are they supposed 
to be at the same price for all points?
Thanks,
