Will be sending you info about a first cousin's reunion set for next sept
near Denver.  Barry's family had already planned a family vacation there and
I think Sean and Kim convinced them that this would be a good time for all 9
of you to try to get together.
Barry already has reservations at two condos there so will xerox Erva's
letter.  I am willing to foot the bill for the condos.
