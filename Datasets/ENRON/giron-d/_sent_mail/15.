I am setting these up so that they can be listed under US GAS WEST but I have 
a question. Does WEST-KEYSTONE-IDX have any positions? Does it need to be set 
as active?

Thanks.  I also noticed that we have some books that are not listed under US 
GAS WEST but should be.  I cannot change tha Trading Group.  Do you do this 
as well?  The books are:
  WEST-KEYSTONE
  WEST-NW
  WEST-PERM
  WEST-SJ
  WEST-SW
Thanks.
