I didnt' come across any deals with Duke Energy Marketing LP and ECC in your 
books, so I think there may be some being booked still as ENA and DEMLP.  
These all need to be flipped to settle in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS books like the 
rest of these deals.  I've spoken to Jennifer Denny with EOL about getting a 
program set up for Duke deals similar to ones we have with TransCanada Energy 
and Dynegy Canada so they automatically get booked to settle with ECC, but I 
don't think this has happened yet.  Please go through your books to make sure 
that no Duke deals have been missed.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey
