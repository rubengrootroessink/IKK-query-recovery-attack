Please send me the Meta ID.  I don't remember it.  I want to make sure we 
have covered all of the counterparties.  Thanks.

Thanks for the list of existing transactions.  Only one question, it looks 
like the list includes only the different corporate entities of NICOR.  Does 
that mean that there were no existing transactions with the other Corporate 
families, i.e. NIPSCO, CILCO, PGL and NS?

Thanks,

Gregg

Glad the risk management group could be of some assistance.
