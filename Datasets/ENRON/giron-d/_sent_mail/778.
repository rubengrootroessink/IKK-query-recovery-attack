We need to break out our Midcon region into two separate books starting with 
July production.  We did this with the Market region a couple of months ago.  
If possible, I would like to use these two names:

 ENA-IM Mid Central South
 ENA-IM Mid Central North

Please let me know what needs to be done in order to expedite this request.  
Thanks.
