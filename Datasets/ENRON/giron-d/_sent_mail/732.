Jay,

I looked over the info you forwarded but have decided to just buy two mutual 
funds.  Unless you have a better suggestion, buy APGCX and MCGTX.  And I 
really mean it when I say if you have a better suggestion let me know.  It 
looks like the transfers worked properly.  But are the automatic purchases of 
mutual funds in place?  I don't see the activity on the web page.  Lastly, 
and I think this is just administrative stuff, Kristi's Roth IRA does not 
show up on the web or on the statements we receive in the mail.  Thanks.

DG
