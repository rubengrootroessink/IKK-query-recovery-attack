Darron,

I am forwarding to you some info on the NSS transaction.  I don't know if you 
are interested or not but here it is.

Tim,

The document attached directly below this verbage is what I included to our 
risk folks as we discovered
that the way we were booking NSS was not correct.  Below this attachment is 
our risk director's independent
solution to the problem; you will note that it is the same conclusion that we 
(Richard and myself) came up with
(see the e-mail I sent at the very bottom of this e-mail).  

Hopefully this will help.

Kevin

Kevin, your not going to believe me but as soon as I got your revised E-Mail, 
I had the answer for you.

Subject: Proposed Change to correct the flaws regarding the NSS program

Richard, Lee, and myself met this afternoon and reviewed the memo I prepared 
intending to find and propose a solution
to our existing valuation problem.   We think we have the answer.  We would 
appreciate any comments from our risk experts.

The following change to our existing deal is what we think will solve the 
problem.  All that we are doing is changing the fixed
price on Legs 2 and 3 to 0.  If you refer to the example mentioned in my 
earlier memo, you will note that the p/l attributable to 
this deals should be 52,777; by changing these legs to 0 we accomplish this 
end result.  

     

I look forward to any feedback any of you may have to offer.
