Hi Darron,

I'm not sure if this message is to go to you, and if it needs to go to 
someone else could you please forward it to them, but there are several deals 
in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book in 
the morning.

These are all December deals with companies that ECC has master swaps with, 
and I should be settling them all on Friday December 8th.  Could you please 
make sure that there aren't any more deals with ECC and a third counterparty 
in this book as it messes up invoicing and settlement.

Please call me if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for your help
Stacey
