Darron:

I am trying to track an origination for Fred Lagrasta.  Sherry Dawson said 
you would probably be the one to grant this origination.  The deal is HS 
Energy and the Deal number is V58190.  Fred would like to have this granted 
in April, so if I need to give you any additional information please let me 
know.


Thanks

Trey Hardy
