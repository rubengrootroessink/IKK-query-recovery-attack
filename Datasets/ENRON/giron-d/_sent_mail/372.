I just wanted to pass along my thanks for the efforts of your team.  The 
automatic bridge to Sitara and Tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of 
time; especially during bidweek.  I know there are others who deserve thanks 
in addition to Dawn, so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as 
well.  I don't want to seem greedy, but I'll ask anyway.  When do you think 
we will be able to get the Sitara number entered in the Link field in Tagg?  
Also, can we get the Tagg number entered in SCI?  Thanks again.

Dawn:  Thank you so much for all of your hard work in getting these physical 
products to bridge correctly.  You have saved us a tremendous amount of 
work.  I know that there were a ton of little details that went into getting 
these products done correctly.  Everything went smoothly, and the bridge 
worked the first time.  We really appreciate your efforts.  


Thanks
