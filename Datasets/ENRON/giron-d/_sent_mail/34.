Subject: Suggested Improvements for OA

Here is a list by group of suggested improvements for OA.  I will arrange a 
meeting to discuss how we can implement these quickly.  The groups with few 
suggestions are not doing everything correctly,  I  just got fewer to no 
responses out of those groups.  Please thank the people in your groups that 
responded.  I appreciate your help in improving this process.

Thanks,

Jeff
