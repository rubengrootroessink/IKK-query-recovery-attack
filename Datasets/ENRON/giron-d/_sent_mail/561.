I think Sitara deal 286147 is not pulling the correct price in Unify.  The 
reference price is NWPL.RKYMTNS.GDP.DA and the particular month in question 
is 06/00.  When I look in the Tables database under June, there is no price.  
And what was pulled for the invoice back in June I don't think is correct.  
Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks.
