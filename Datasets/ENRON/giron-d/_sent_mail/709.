I have a friend who is looking to change employers.  He is in the IT field.  
I was looking on the intranet and found this posting.  Although, he would be 
interested in any similar job.  I will attach his resume.  What is the best 
way to get his resume in front of the proper people?  I would appreciate your 
opinion.  I don't work in the IT field and really don't know anyone at Enron 
that does.  Thanks in advance for your help.
