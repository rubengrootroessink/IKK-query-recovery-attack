Actually, I also remember that it is composed of the first three letters of 
his mother and father's name. Something I
learned, I think, almost before he could spell it.  Gad,
we're getting old.

Darron,  I saw two or three software manager and an IT
manager positions at the Enron web site.  They look like
something I might be interested in doing if everything
could work out.  Can we talk about Enron when you return?
