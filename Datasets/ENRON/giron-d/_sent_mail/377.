We can now calc at home/on the laptops.  After you dial in,( connect to 
remoteservices.enron.com and log in), select start/programs/trading/xterm off 
of the menu.  Xterm will bring up a window ... type in runm.  After that it 
is calcing as normal.  From what I can tell it works okay.  Let me know if 
you have any problems.

Dave
