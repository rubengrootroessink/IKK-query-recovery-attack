Uncle Clark,

How are things?  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to see if you 
were going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on 
bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.  I can't believe 
it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.  We are doing well 
here in Houston.  Everyone is getting ready for the school year.  In fact, 
Kristi has already started back.  The kids begin on the 9th.  Enron still 
seems to monopolize my time.  But it's a great place to work.  Let me know 
about that weekend.  I hope you will be in town as  I am looking forward to 
seeing you all.

DG
