Darron,

For Oct 2000 I found a Liquidation amount in the Central region for The 
Peoples Gas Light & Coke......$336,234.06
Yet, I show no transactions for them in that region.  I looked in tagg - deal 
capture and for the tagg numbers listed
in the detail OA-liquidation spreadsheet (N17872.1   N17872.2   N18064.1   
N18064.2), I either saw no "comments",
or there was a comment referring to a "North Shore Baseload sale".

Would you please assist me or direct me to the person who would be familiar 
with this.
I am placing copies of the documents referred to above, on your desk.

Thanks for you help.

Doug
