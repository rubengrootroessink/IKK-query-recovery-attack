After looking over the deal, I need to ask Steve Jackson a couple of 
questions.  So I probably will not be able to walk you through the deal today 
because I have some questions myself on a couple of the legs.  I was hoping 
to get this done today.  But for sure by the end of the week.  I want to ask 
you some questions about how Richard wants the books to be changed.  See you 
at 1:00.
