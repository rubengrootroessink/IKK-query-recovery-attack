It's going to be wait and see for me.  I have a few issues this morning.  Let 
me know where you're going to be and I'll try to make it.

Lunch still good for you guys?  Anytime is good for me, but noon or after
would be better, if this meeting runs late.  What time is good for you
guys?  Also, suggestions for where would be good.  It probably needs to be
central downtown since Giron is on the south side.  Let me know.
