It should reference the EOL number.  It looks af if Kevin did not link it 
up.  I'll remind him.

Darron,

When you are manually entering the EMW deals into tagg, are you referencing 
the EOL number?  

I was looking at the tagg deal you gave me last Friday (Q40121) and it does 
not reference it.  Should it?  Or, because it is funky, does it not have to?

Dawn
