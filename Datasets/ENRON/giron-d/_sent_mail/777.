Subject: New ENA - IM Mid Business Units

Darron, do you know which pipes these two new business units will be 
trading?  I need to make sure that all necessary pipes are mapped to these 
business units in order for traders to be able to book deals on them.  Let me 
know if there are specific ones they will be using or if they just need all 
pipes that are currently mapped to the ENA - IM Central business unit also 
mapped to these two new business units.
