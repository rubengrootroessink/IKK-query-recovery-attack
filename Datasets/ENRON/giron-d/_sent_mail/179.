I need to know what counterparties invoiced ENA for Penalties ,or netted them 
in a payment we received for December production. I will need the amount of 
the Penalty , the Counterparty , and the deal that the penalty is related to .


Unfortunately I need this information before you leave today.


Let me know if you any questions
