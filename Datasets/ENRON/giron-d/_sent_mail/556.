You can start asking me about the West desk.  We don't have any new books for 
this month.

Does anybody have any new book codes?  Also, if anyone knows who Kyle Etter's 
replacement is, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: New Book Codes

During the August settlement period, we discovered at least 4 book codes that 
had just recently started containing financial, third-party deals in them.  
We tried to put a procedure into place where we were calling the risk guys to 
find out about new books.  I don't know, however, if we are calling the right 
people because we were not told about the 4 books that we discovered on our 
own.  

From now on, I am going to have Beatrice Reyna from my group call someone 
from Reporting (Frank) and key people in Risk before we run our NYMEX 
invoices at the end of the month.  Will, can you please send me a list of 
people that Bea should contact that would know what we are talking about?  
Even if the book codes are not brand new, but if they have just started 
putting financial deals in them, WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.  

Thanks you so much for your help,
Becky
