The $1.7M is in Jim's book.  He asked me to hold it back because he thought 
the curve for ChiGate was set too high and he was making too much on Friday.  
I think the $ is real, and it will be released before year end.

I don't know about the annuity.  Kevin will return tomorrow and he will have 
to follow up with you.  I'll send the prior day P&L's tonight.

Can you guys confirm that we have $1.7 million top-leveled to allow for the 
NGPL ITS losses that we have not put into the books yets?  We need to put 
these losses in on Thursday or friday.

Also did we reverse the $326000 annuity and subsequent origination out of my 
bookes and the FT-cental books?  We should have a new annuity to PGL for the 
same amount.

Can you send me a copy of the top page for enovate for last Friday and 
Thursday like the one you sent me today for Monday's top page?

Call me if you have any questions at 312.925.8906

Richard
