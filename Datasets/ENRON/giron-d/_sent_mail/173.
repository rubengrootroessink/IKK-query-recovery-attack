Darron,

Could you make sure that these seven deals are changed in Tagg to ENA I would 
really appreciate it.  Thanks for all of your help with these specific 
deals.  Also, if you could let me know when they are corrected, I will let 
Bob Bowen know.  Thanks TARA

Please change to ENA instead of Riskmantra:
QL0460
QM6735
QM3739
QN0626
QN7938
QN7939
QO1412
