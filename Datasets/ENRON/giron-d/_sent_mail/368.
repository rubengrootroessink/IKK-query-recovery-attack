You have 1 employee who fell out in  "Needs Improvement" at the year end 2000 
PRC process. 

I would like to meet with you to address the employee's areas of 
improvement.  Additionally, I will be sitting in on your discussion with the 
employee. My role will be twofold:

assist you in creating a communication and development plan for the employee
to serve as an advocate for the employee and management

As agreed, We will not be sitting in with employees who were placed in "Needs 
Improvement" due to newest in position. Specifically, employees who are 
meeting your learning curve expectations but because of their newest and 
limited contributions they were placed in "Needs Improvement".

You should plan to discuss your development plan with your employee(s) 
between now and January 31, 2001. 

Please contact me prior to meeting with the employee so I can assist with 
your plans. Call if you have any questions, I can be reached on (713) 
345-3662.
