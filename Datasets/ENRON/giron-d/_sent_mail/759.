Stephanie,

We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 
1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid 
Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could 
have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but 
all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders 
involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.

 Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South
 Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this 
request.  Thanks for your help.
