Here is the spreadsheet we discussed in today's meeting.  It should be pretty 
straightforward.  If you have any questions, please ask.  I'll be happy to 
help you out.

I will look at a way to "tie-in" Winzip with this spreadsheet.  I don't know 
if it is possible, but if I can accomplish it, I'll let you know.


Greg

Subject: Excel file to help you out

Here is a spreadsheet I worked up to help you determine what files need to be 
cleaned up.  It is pretty simple and straightforward.  You can enter a 
directory, file extention (if you want all file types, just enter a "*"), a 
minimum file size, and a modified before date.  The spreadsheet will perform 
a search of the directory and all subdirectories and return the files 
matching the criteria you specified.

The information is returned sorted by directory, but you can then sort by 
size, date, or whatever.

This should help you make a quick pass through your files on the "O" drive to 
determine some of the older/bigger ones you can clean up.

I would encourage you not to just enter "O:\" in the directory because the 
program will take forever, and you will run out of rows in excel to store the 
data.  Since it is in Excel, it will take just a while if you run it on a 
directory with a lot of files, so be a little patient.

I don't want to spend a lot of time supporting this thing, so if you 
distribute further, just don't tell them where you got it from (unless you 
want to designate a given person on your desk to perform the work).  

Let me know if you have questions or problems.

Greg
