Scott,

Richard Tomaski wants one more physical book set up under the Enovate name 
while retaining the other books already set up.  This counterparty name 
Enovate is replacing the Midwest Energy Hub.  But wants to be able to 
differentiate deals done as solely Enovate with deals done as Enron Midwest.  
Call me if you have any further questions, or if this presents a problem.  
Thanks.

DG    3-9573
