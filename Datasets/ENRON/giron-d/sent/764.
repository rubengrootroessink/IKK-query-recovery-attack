What to Expect From Gun Control

 these are the facts right out of the history books

 Interesting bit of information.





 "In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to

 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were

 rounded up and exterminated.



 "In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5

 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million

 Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million

 political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000

 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000

 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.



 "Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one

 million 'educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up

and exterminated."



 Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century

 because of gun control: 56 million.



 The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, ask them "Who do

 YOU want to round up and exterminate?" With guns, we are citizens. Without

 them, we are subjects.
