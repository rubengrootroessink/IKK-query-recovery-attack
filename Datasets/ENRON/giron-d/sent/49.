Jennifer,
The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of 
March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and 
NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other 
Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further 
questions.

DG

Darron --

Before I send out the memo for March, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for March.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

NGI-MALIN
NGI-PGE CG
IF-CIG WIC

The shifts in MALIN and PGE CG are pretty clear.  For CIG WIC, please note 
how the front years show a price drop compared to prior months, while marks 
in the mid-years have shifted upward by approximately  $0.10.  Thanks for 
your help, and please let me know if you have any questions.


Jennifer
