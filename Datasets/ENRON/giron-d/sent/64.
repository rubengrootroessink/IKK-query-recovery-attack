Darin - Great talking with you.

Mail the check to 11621 Rydalwater Lane, Austin, TX 78754-5720.

You wanted two season tix at $195 each and 4 OU tix at $55 each for a total
of $610.  I take it you didn't want any other individual game tickets.  (I
forgot to ask).

We'll find out about the OU tix in late August/early September.  If we
don't get them, we'll get a refund.
