No interns.  As long as my group stays intact I won't need anyone in August.  
I think Anne will stay past her 1 year and everyone else is relatively new.  
I do like having analysts though and think we would rather be long than short.

Let me know your needs in this area so I can return this ASAP.  I will assume 
none of you want a Summer intern,  unless I hear otherwise.  I am mainly 
interested in what you think each of your groups will need in August.

Thanks

All- As you are aware the AA Program will be bringing in both summer interns 
and full time hires in the near future.  To better serve your business unit 
needs and properly place both the summer interns and full time hires, we need 
to know the specific needs for each of your business units for Analysts and 
Associates.  Would you please poll your busines unit heads for their AA 
requirements so we can place the incoming hires as soon as possible?  We 
would like to get your best indication by April 17 so we can respond to your 
needs and correspond with the new hires as to their initial rotation.  Also, 
if you have a specific request (by name) please include that in your summary. 

Additionally, we are in the process of planning for next year's recruiting 
needs and we will also need an indication of the business units requirements 
for the 2001-2002 hiring cycle.  A suggested format is outlined below:

Summer Interns:  May 21 -August 27

Business Unit  Supervisor Analyst Needs  Associate Needs


Fall Hires:  August arrival

Business Unit  Supervisor Analyst Needs  Associate Needs


2001-2002 AA Program Hiring Expectations:

Please respond back to Jana Giovannini for ETS and EWS and to Shelly Butler 
for EBS and EES.  Once we have received your data we will distribute a list 
of AA's back to you to assist in your planning and placement.  Thanks for 
your help.  Ted
