Darron,

I have setup the new pipe/zone  Wildhorse Energy Partners with WHEP/WHEP 
which Jackie requested.  I need to know how you would like this mapped.

Pipe  Zone  Mid-Market  Intramonth  Gas Daily
WHEP  WHEP      ???         ???       ???

Please let me know as soon as possible because the pipe is now ready for 
selection in SITARA.  I would like to setup the curve mappings before it is 
put into use.

Chao!

George, we need a new trade zone added for a new pipe (Wildhorse Energy 
Partners, LLC)

Pipe Code:   WHEP
Trade Zone: WHEP

The scheduler is Jaqueline Adams at X33918.  She agrees that the trade zone 
can be the same as the pipe code.

Please let me know as soon as this zone is added, so that I may get started 
on added all the meters.


Thanks,
Faye
