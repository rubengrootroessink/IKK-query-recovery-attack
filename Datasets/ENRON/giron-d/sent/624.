OK, after talking to several people...it ends up that this weekend is not 
good for bunko and some are wishing to reschedule..once again.  We are going 
to set the dates of October 21 or 28th in stone.  Please take a look at your 
calendar and let me know what works for you guys and I will e-mail out the 
new date!

Sorry for the inconvenience.  I know your guys have been anxiously awaiting 
this bunko weekend.

Please let me know!

Dawn
