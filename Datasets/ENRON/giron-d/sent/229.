I just looked at their sight.  They seem like a reputable company.  It's a 
store in Manhattan, NY.  The only thing to be concerned about when ordering 
by phone or online is when there is a problem with the unit.  It is more of a 
pain in the ass to mail it back than to just take it to Circuit City or Best 
Buy.  But a Sony DVD is very reliable and you should not have a problem.  I'd 
pull the trigger, that's a great price.

Darron,

I am ready to purchase the Sony C670D DVD Player.  I have gone thru CNET.com
and found a three star (highest rating) certified CNET dealer that sells it
for $340  - Tweeter has it for $449 + tax and Circuit City and Best Buy
don't carry this model.  The name of the Internet company is
moreaudiovideo.com.

Did you order yours off the internet and if so from whom?  I am a little
weary about buying something like this off the internet...
