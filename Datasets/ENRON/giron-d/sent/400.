Pretty nice.  I had never even heard of this vehicle.

Found this on a web site.


The Gelaendewagen or "G-wagen" is something of a Land Rover on steroids with 
German engineering. 
Think of a cross between an S500 sedan and the Hummer. At $135,000 a copy and 
with only a handful being 
imported into the US, those lucky enough to get their hands on a G-Wagen are 
assured exclusivity and an 
all-terrain vehicle that means business.
