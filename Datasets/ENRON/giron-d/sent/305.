Mike,
DVD time huh?  I like my player, but there is a substantial premium for it.  
And actually, Sony has come out with the next evolution of the mega DVD 
changer.  I think it lists for $900, but can probably be had for $600-$700 
range.  It is also huge.  I'm not trying to talk you out of it, just let you 
know of the downside.  Both models have identical specs, so quality is not an 
issue.  Let me know if you have anymore questions.

DG

Darron,

What is going on??  Not much here...same old same old.  How is the Mustang
running?  Looks like I will be getting rid of the TA within the next month
or two.  I have been looking pretty hard at Tahoe's and finally have a firm
price to work with.  Anyway, it is about time to get my DVD player and I was
wondering if you are happy with your 200 disc DVD Player.  I can get it off
the internet for ~$400 or I can get Scott's for ~$275.  Sony has released
their next generation of DVD  - I think the 'S' series.  There is one that
is designed to match the Wega tv's.  It is a single disc and costs about
$330 on the internet.  I am not exactly sure what the differences between
the new 'S' series and the 'C' series are.  I don't know if I should get the
new one and pay the extra money or just get an older model.
