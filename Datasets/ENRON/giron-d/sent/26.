I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We 
definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather was 
good and the food was great.  How is DC?  Have you seen any of the sights 
yet?  

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when we 
are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let me 
know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and return 
Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights and 
getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the 
neighbors.  

Thanks.  See you when you get back.
