Darron,

Have you had a chance to look at this.  Dave at The New Power Group is 
wanting his money.

Thanks,
Mechelle

Darron,  

Here is the list sent from Dave.  Also he is questioning N99383.  Leg 2 and 3 
net out and he shows this deal should be there. 

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks for your help!

I've attached a list of the 10 deals that I don't recognize.  I grouped them 
in pairs because each pair has the same volume (one positive and the other 
negative) but they have different prices.

Let me know what you find out.

David
