Each manufacturer has their own schedule for repairs.  We usually only find
out that a product has been repaired when it arrives back in our warehouse.
Repaired units are usually shipped back to the customer the day we receive
them.

I sent a MB Quart speaker back on 2/19 because it was making a buzzing
sound.  It was recieved on 2/26.  Do you have any idea how long it will be
before I get a replacement?  Thanks.
