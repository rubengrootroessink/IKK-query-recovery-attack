Gregg,
I used the following counterparties in the query:

Central Illinois Public Service Company

Thanks for the list of existing transactions.  Only one question, it looks 
like the list includes only the different corporate entities of NICOR.  Does 
that mean that there were no existing transactions with the other Corporate 
families, i.e. NIPSCO, CILCO, PGL and NS?

Thanks,

Gregg
