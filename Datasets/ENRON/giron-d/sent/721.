Can you let me know when you finish correcting this EOL deal and the correct 
Sitara numbers?

Thanks, Karie (36759)

Elizabeth:

Darin Giron called me about the EOL park and loan deal from Friday. These 
deals will cause differences with your EOL-Sitara reconciliation. The EOL 
deal will error out in Spreadsheet - Natural Gas, therefore you won't see it 
erroring out under Sitara. The EOL Park and Loan deal should be booked as 
four deals in Sitara. These Park and Loan deals should be booked as two 
exchange deals (one receipt and one delivery) between ENA and the third 
party. And then two desk to desk deals between ENA and EMW. The EOL deal 
number should be referenced on both of the exchange deals. Darin booked EOL 
deal 330098 as two physical forwards (348347 and 348364) and two desk to 
desks (348362 and 348375). He is going to create the two exchange deals and 
kill the two physical forwards and reference the EOL deals numbers on the 
exchange deals. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
