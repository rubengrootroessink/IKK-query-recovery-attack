FYI.  Pay special  attention to what Ramesh says about the 
Intra-Northeast-PHY book.  Call if any questions.

Burton,
The following spreadsheets were still loaded from the ng_directory. Rock did 
call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through 
the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked 
him to run it again and it seemed to be OK.

With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve 
code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken 
care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original 
problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and 
the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.

I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in 
a row in quick succcession.

I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the 
day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been 
able to load these into the test data bases.

The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any 
time to convert these spreadsheets over.

The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng 
directory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT based 
directory will give much better response.

The surprises are the rll and the plastics text files. I thought these were 
the first to go the new spreadsheet format.

Brian Gillis was able to load his spreadsheets successfully through terminal 
server from Calgary yesterday.

Regards,
Ramesh
