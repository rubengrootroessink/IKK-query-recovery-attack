Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

Thanks,
Dawn
