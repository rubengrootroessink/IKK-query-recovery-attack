Scott,

These places carry the Onkyo receiver.  I don't think they carry Polk, but 
ask them who you should call for Polk speakers.  The place I got mine from a 
couple of years ago no longer carries them.  I'm still looking.  Lee's Audio 
& Video have the Onkyo listed at $629.  Their sight is at leesvideo.com
