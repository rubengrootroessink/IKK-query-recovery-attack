Kristi said you called on Saturday.  I was golfing.  What did you think about 
the draft?  I thought LD was a good college player, but not great.  Everyone 
seems to think he will be an All-Pro type player before he's done.  As long 
as he works hard, I think SR would make the best Pro.  But what do I know?
