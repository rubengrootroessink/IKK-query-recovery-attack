David, Will and myself have come up with a great team-building idea. We will 
pit all the risk groups against each other in a game of paintball as there 
are a number of people who would enjoy shooting each other with paint guns. I 
have narrowed it down to two possible weekends and need your help in 
identifying which would be the best for your respective groups.  

Option one: October 21 or 22
Option two:  November 18-19

Please report back to me as soon as possible so that I may reserve the 
facility. Thanks

Pat Ryder
