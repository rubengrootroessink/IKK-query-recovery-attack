This is a fun diversion.

Take this test for yourself...and send it to your friends, including me, and
let them know who you are. My score is in the subject box... Don't peek but
begin the test as you scroll down and answer.

Answers are for who you are now...not who you were in the past.   Have pen
or pencil and paper ready.   This is a real test given by the Human
Relations Dept at many of  the major corporations today. It helps them get a
better insight concerning their employees and potential employees.

It's only 10 simple questions, so...  Grab a pencil and paper, keeping track
of your letter answers.   Make sure you change the subject of the e-mail to

Now add up the total number of points.
OVER 60 POINTS:
Others see you as someone they should "handle with
care." You're  seen
as
vain, self-centered, and who is extremely dominant.
Others may admire
you,
wishing they could be more like you, but don't always
trust you,
hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.




 51 TO 60 POINTS:
Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather
impulsive
personality; a natural leader, who's quick to take
decisions,  though not
always the  right ones. They see you as bold and
adventuresome, someone
who will try anything once; someone who takes chances
and enjoys an
adventure.  They enjoy being in your company because
of the excitement you
radiate.

41 TO 50 POINTS:
Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing,
practical, and
always interesting; someone who's constantly in the
center of attention,
but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to
their head. They also
see you as kind, considerate, and understanding;
someone who'll always
cheer  them up and help them out.

31 TO 40 POINTS:
Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful &
practical. They see you
as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest... Not a
person who makes
friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's
extremely loyal to
friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in
return. Those who
really get to  know you realize it takes a lot to
shake your trust in your
friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to
get over it if
that trust is ever broken.

21 TO 30 POINTS:
Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They
see you as very
cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady
plodder. It'd really
surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or
on the spur of the
moment,  expecting you to examine everything carefully
from every angle
and then, usually decide against it. They think this
reaction is caused
partly by your careful nature.

UNDER 21 POINTS:
People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive,
someone who needs
looking after, who always wants someone else to make
the decisions & who
doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything.
They see you as a
worrier who always sees problems that don't exist.
Some people think
you're boring. Only those who know you well know that
you aren't.

Now forward this on to everyone you know, making sure
to put YOUR score
in the subject box.
