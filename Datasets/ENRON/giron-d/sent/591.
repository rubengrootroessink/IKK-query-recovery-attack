Kevin,

Please remember to link up all deals.  By this, I mean Tagg numbers in 
Sitara, Sitara numbers in Tagg, Tagg numbers in SCI, and especially EOL 
numbers in Tagg.  I just got a call about the park & loan on Friday.  You 
need to put EOL as the system of origin and the EOL number.  Thanks.

DG
