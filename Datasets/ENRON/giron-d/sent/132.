Jennifer,

NGI-PGE/TOPOCK is an internal curve used to value transport and is equal to 
NGI-SOCAL.  This curve will probably show up every month because the West 
Coast is very volitile.  The change is due to a change in the market.

IF-TW/PERMIAN is a production area curve.  The change is also due to  market 
changes that drove up the curve.

Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

DG    3-9573
