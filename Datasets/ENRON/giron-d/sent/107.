>     These things I wish for each of you.....
>     We tried so hard to make things better for our kids
>     that we made them worse.
>
>     For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like for them
>     to know about hand-me down clothes and homemade ice
>     cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I really would.
>
>     I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you
>     learn honesty by being cheated.
>
>     I hope you learn to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash
>     the car. And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car
>     when you are sixteen.
>
>     It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born
>     and your old dog put to sleep.  I hope you get a black eye
>     fighting for something you believe in.
>
>     I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother.
>     And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of
>     the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with
>     you because he's scared, I hope you let him.  When you want
>     to see a movie and your little sister wants to tag along, I hope
>     you'll let her.
>
>     I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and
>     that you live in a town where you can do it safely. On rainy
>     days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your
>     'driver' to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding
>     with someone as uncool as your Mom.
>
>     If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to
>     make one instead of buying one.
>
>     I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books. When you
>     learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and
>     subtract in your head.
>
>     I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your
>     first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your mother
>     that you learn what Ivory soap tastes like.
>
>     May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand
>     on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't
>     care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if
>     a friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not
>     your friend.
>
>     I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your
>     Grandma and go fishing with your Uncle.
>
>     May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.
>
>     I hope your Mother punishes you when you throw a baseball
>     through a neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses
>     you at Christmas time when you give her a mold of your hand.
>     These things I wish for you:  tough times and disappointment,
>     hard work and happiness.
>
>     To me, it's the only way to appreciate life.
>
>     "We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them."
>
>     Paul Harvey - "Good Day"!
