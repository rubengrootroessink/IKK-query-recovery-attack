MEMO FROM GOD:
To:  YOU
Date: TODAY
From:    THE BOSS
Subject: YOURSELF
Reference: LIFE
I am God.  Today I will be handling all of your problems.  Please
remember that I do not need your help.
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do
not=  attempt to resolve it.  Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for
God to do=
) box.  It will be addressed in My time, not yours.  Once the
matter is placed into the box, do not hold onto it.
If you find yourself stuck in traffic; Don't despair.
There are people in this world for whom driving is an unheard of
privilege.
Should you have a bad day at work; Think of the man who has been out of
work=
 for years.
Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who
has=
 never known what it's like to love and be loved in return.
Should you grieve the passing of another weekend; Think of the woman in
dire=
 straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her
children=
.
Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance;
Think of=
 the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; Think of the cancer
patient=
 in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine.
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about,
ask=
ing what is my purpose?  Be thankful. There are those who didn't live
long e=
nough to get the opportunity.
Should you find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness,
ignorance,=
 smallness or insecurities;=20
Remember, things could be worse.  You could be them!!!!
Should you decide to send this to a friend; You might brighten someone's
day=
!

You have been Tagged!!!  Which means you are a great friend!!

You will Have Good Luck For Two Years if you send this
to 8 people or more and if this is sent back to you then you know that
you a=
re a true friend......

You must send it in 5 minutes or your good luck will
be broken!!! If this is sent to you it means you are a
good friend!!!!!
Good Luck!
You can't direct the wind,
but you can adjust the sails.
