Glad you had a good time.  Next time we will have both SeaDo's working and 
hopefully the lake will be a little higher.  We have your sandals.  At least 
I think they are yours.  I am in Chicago right now.  We will try and get them 
to you soon.  Use dgiron@enron.com for my email address.

Hey Darron,

What's going on??  Just wanted to say thanks for inviting me to go out on
the boat last weekend.  Hope I was not rude when we were leaving, but I
really started to feel like crap.  When we got back to Scott's I almost
puked a couple times and was stuck on the crapper for some time.  I ended up
not going to work on Monday and half of Tuesday because of the hebee jebees.
Anyway, if you ever need anyone to help you with the boat when you go out
(uh, yeah), give me a call and I would be glad to 'help' out.

Mike
