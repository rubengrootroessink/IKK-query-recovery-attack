  Little  Johnny  walked  into  his  dad's bedroom one day and found him
  sitting  on  the side of his bed sliding a condom onto his dick. In an
  attempt  to hide his full erection, Johnny's father bent over as if to
  look under the bed.


  Little Johnny asked curiously, "What ya doin', Dad?"


  His  father  quickly replied, "I thought I saw a rat go underneath the
  bed."


  Johnny replied, "What ya gonna do, fuck him?"
