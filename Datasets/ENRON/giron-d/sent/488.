I was going to last night, but it didn't sound like you wanted to talk.  We 
had a great time.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.  It was cold but 
the game was fun.  It was good to see the kids getting along as well as they 
did.  We will try and make it a regular trip.  We also spoke about maybe 
getting together in Dallas sometime next year.  I need to go, but will talk 
to you later.

I had rather hoped you would share a few words about the Kansas trip with me.
