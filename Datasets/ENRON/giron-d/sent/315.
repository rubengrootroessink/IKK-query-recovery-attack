I just spoke with Toni.  She should call you soon.  Let me know if you don't 
hear from her today.  Thanks.

Hi Darron,

    This is Kristen Clause.  I have been trying to get in touch with Toni 
Graham all day and have not had any luck.  Is there someone else I can 
contact in Human Resources or should I just wait for her to call me?  I am 
very anxious, can you tell???

Thanks,
Kristen Clause
