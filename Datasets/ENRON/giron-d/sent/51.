Well, I win the award for ass of the week and probably the year.  I really 
can't begin to apologize enough for Tuesday.  I won't offer an excuse.  Guys 
on the Central desk asked me a question as soon as I hung up with you, and 
before I knew it, it was around 2:30pm.  But the worst part is, I didn't 
realize what I had done until later the next day.  It was disrespectful and I 
sincerely apologize.  I do have a conflict tomorrow.  And I will understand 
if you want to stop the sessions.  Thanks.
