Hey bunko gang...Unfortunately, Gary and I will be out of town that weekend.  
We are going on Gary's company's trip so we need to reschedule.  What do you 
guys think about September 30th?  Let me know who all can make it or suggest 
other dates that are more agreeable to your schedule!

Thanks,

Dawn
