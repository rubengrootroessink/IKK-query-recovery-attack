I have been in Chigago for the last two weeks.  The CD is in my desk in 
Houston.  What is your location?  I can have it sent via intercompany mail.  
Sorry about this.

Hi Darron -

Re: the Office 97 CD checked out to you on 5-19-00.

We have a very, limited supply of that particular CD, and would need you to 
return the CD as soon as
possible, in order to allow other users the opportunity to use the disk as 
well.

Could you please provide me with a possible date, you for see returning CD?   
Your consideration would be 
greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact 
me.

Thanks,
