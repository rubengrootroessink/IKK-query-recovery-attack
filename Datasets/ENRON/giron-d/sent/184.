No, we will go to Keystone instead of WP.  We are paying either way, and so 
it doesn't matter to me.  Also, I have never been to Keystone and would like 
to go.  And I will have a rental car.  We are looking forward to seeing you.

Darron,

If you guys want to go to WP, that is fine with me.  I will be able to go a
few days.  Do you need a ride from the airport?  Let me know.  See you in a
few weeks.

Sean

P.S.  Attached is our new yellow lab that Tracie gave me for my birthday.
