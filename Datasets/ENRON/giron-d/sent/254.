Prior to her trip to Texas, Buffy (a New Yorker) confided to her
sorority sisters she had three goals for her trip to the Lone Star
State.
She wanted to taste some real Texas Bar B Que, take in a bona fide
rodeo and
have sex with a cowboy.  Upon her return, her sorority sisters
were
curious as to how she fared.

Let me tell you, they have a tree down there called mesquite and
when  they slow cook that brisket over that mesquite, oh so
good!!!!
The taste is unbelievable!!!  I went to a real rodeo. Talk about
athletes,
these guys wrestle  real full-grown bulls- like in Spain.  Except
they
ride a horse out at full gallop, then jump off the horses and
literally
grab the bulls by the horns  and throw them to the ground.  It is
incredible!
They then asked, " Well tell us, did you have sex with a cowboy?"
Are you kidding?  Once I saw the outline of the condom they carry
around
in the back pocket of their jeans, I changed my mind!!!!
