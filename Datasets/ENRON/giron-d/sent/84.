We granted a total of $320K ($220K to you and $100K to credit reserve) by 
mistake.  We will take the extra $100K in orig from you tonight.  I 
appologize for the error.

Barry Tycholiz advised me that you granted $220,00 to me.  $100,000 needs to 
go to credit to cover exposure per memo below.

Please advise if I am mistaken.

thanks!
