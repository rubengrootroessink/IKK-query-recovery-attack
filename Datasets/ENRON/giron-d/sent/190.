I can't believe that I said what I did this morning.  It was selfish and I 
sincerely appologize.  I don't know what I was thinking or why.  Well,  I 
just listened to your message and I deserve all of it.  Even though you may 
not believe it.  I do love you, but many times cannot justify my actions.  I 
love you very much, and will call you later.
