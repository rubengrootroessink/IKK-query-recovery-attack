Trying to wrap up as much as I can before my last day on Friday.  Have you 
had a chance to look into this?

This is the detail for the invoice I mentioned in my voice mail to you.  I 
need to get the Sitara number if this has been set up so I can pay Peoples.

Thanks,
Kevin

Kevin,

Doing some more month end clean up.  

I received an invoice from Peoples Gas to ENA for $5,000.  The description is:

For Summer-Winter Exchange Agreement between Peoples and ENA from June 1,2000 
through July 31,200 for 1Bcf.

1 Bcf Program Original Hedge:  1,000,000 MMBtu x .005 = $5,000

I cannot find a Sitara deal for this amount.  Will you please look into 
this?  They told me the deal maker is Richard Tomaski.

If you send me your fax number I'll send you a copy of the invoice.

Thanks,
Kevin
