Happy Holidays!  It looks like we will be going skiing in Colorado from March 
11-16.  I wanted to see if you were going to be in town during that time and 
see if we could come by and see you.  It would most likely be on the 10th and 
then the 16th.  We are staying at a place from that Sunday night thru 
Thursday night.  Let me know.  I hope Santa was good to you all.
