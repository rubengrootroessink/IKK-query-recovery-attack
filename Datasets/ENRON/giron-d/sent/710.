Kevin,

I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already 
most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.

Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field
Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in 
Tagg
Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg
Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal
Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for 
every EOL deal
Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, 
just let me know and I'll follow up.

Thanks.

DG
