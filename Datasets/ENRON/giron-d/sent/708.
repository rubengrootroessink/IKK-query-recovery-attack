I didn't get a good response from the one person I know in IT.  So I am 
sending your resume out for some IT jobs I see posted on our intranet and 
have asked for help from the HR dept.  I didn't think this would take so 
long.  I appologize, but I am still trying.

Just a quick follow up.  Any word? What would you say the prospects
are for visiting with someone about employment?

Our plans are set for Sept.  We have airline and hotel reservations.
