Subject: TDS Security

As you know I am moving to Global Products Risk Management soon.  As part of 
my delegation of duties I will be passing the TDS security on to the Enron 
Security group and your groups.

Currently I get all SRRS requests to approve     - This is what I need 
someone from your group to do.
Then I setup the user in TDS with the correct Book access  - This is what 
security will do.

I would like a primary & secondary individual to be set up for approving SRRS 
request from each desk.  If you do not provide me with 2 names - you will be 
listed as the primary.
 
My initial meeting with Security is tomorrow morning.
