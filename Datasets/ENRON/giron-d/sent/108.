Subject: Aquila Canada Corp. deals in Houston books

Hi guys,

I've just come across a few deals that are in TAGG as settling between
ENA and Aquila Canada Corp.  These deals would not have shown up when
you looked for deals to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as they aren't in
TAGG as ECC deals.  I have a feeling that there are lots of deals like this in
TAGG, but I just don't know where. We are having problems printing TAGG 
tickets 
up here, so I'm not able to see which books these deals are in right now.  
What I'm 
requesting is that you go through all your books and look for all deals with 
Aquila
Canada Corp. that are to settle for March and April 2001, and after, and flip 
these
deals into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  As it stands, 
I'm missing at least 10 deals from the April 2001 Nymex invoice, and I want to
make sure that these deals don't get invoiced by someone in Houston 
settlements.
Nymex settled yesterday for April, so invoicing for these deals is taking 
place
today.  

I understand that you are all very busy right now, but it would really be 
appreciated
if this was dealt with as soon as possible today.  The settlements group and 
I need
to get our invoices sent out today, so we need these deals to be fixed right 
away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter, and let me know 
if I 
can assist you in any way.

Thanks so much for your help
Stacey-
