Goss said you may have a calc set up to identify these deals.  Any chance I 
could copy it?

Hi,

Just a friendly reminder for you to please go through all your books to make 
sure
there aren't any deals between ECC and a third counterparty.  If there are, 
please
flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book right away.  Especially those deals that
are Nymex vs. a fixed price for January 2001, these need to be invoiced 
tomorrow.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter.

Thanks for your help
Stacey
