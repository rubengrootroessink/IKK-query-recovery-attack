My apologies to you left-wingers who may receive this e-mail...

While Al Gore  has a habit of exaggerating his record, these numbers tell
us the real truth  about his record on education, healthcare and taxes:


AL GORE'S  EDUCATION PLANS...

$10,000...? tax deduction that Al Gore says will  be received by "all
students who want to go to college".

$800... tax  deduction is the reality.

0... students working their way through college  getting a tax credit
because they do not pay enough in income  taxes.

30,000,000... low-income households get no benefit on Gore's  education
plan.

0...? families making over $20,000 get a  benefit.

5,000,000... upper income families are ineligible.

0...  deductions or credits for room, board, books, supplies, and travel.

1...  education plan that is almost identical to the one that failed in the
Clinton  White House.


AL GORE'S PROGRAM ON HEALTHCARE:

$600... access  fee per year to obtain prescription drug coverage under the
Gore  plan.

412... new regulatory mandates created by the Gore Medicare  plan.

182... new regulations dealing with prescription drugs  alone.

64.5... the age you are when you have your one and only  opportunity to buy
into a government HMO.

8... year wait for Gore's plan  to be implemented.

2... times the price of Bush's plan to create more  government bureaucrats


THE VICE PRESIDENT ON TAXES:

88...  separate tax increases along with 42 new user fees Gore proposed in
the 2001  budget.

11%... how much the tax burden has increased over the last 8  years.

$500... per child tax credit was never included in previous  Clinton/Gore
budgets.

50,000,000... taxpayers will not get tax relief  under Gore's plan.

$1,400... couples will pay in taxes because Gore  opposed the Marriage
Penalty tax cut.

4.3 cents...? tax increase on  a gallon of gas because of Gore's
tie-breaking vote.


THE MOST  IMPORTANT NUMBERS:

17... days until the election.

PLEASE PASS THIS  ON TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS!

Sincerely,

Jim  Nicholson
Chairman
Republican National Committee
