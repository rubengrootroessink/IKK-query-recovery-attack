Dear all-

I wanted to follow up with you to see if you had started using the Exception 
reporting databases.  I know that initially we had some security problems, 
but I think that we resolved those.  I have not seen any files for the gas 
group, so I wanted to follow up.  Please let me know or if you have any 
problems, please let myself (ext. 31781) or Kelly (ext. 39962) know.  Thanks, 

Christy
