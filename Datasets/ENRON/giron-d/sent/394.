I want to run something by you.  It sounds like we have some sort of budget 
for Friday night.  I would like to offer everyone the opportunity to bring 
someone with them but also explain that we may not be able to pay for it 
all.  I guess the reason is I would like to have Kristi come with me, but am 
willing to pay for her.  I would like to do the same for everyone else, but 
don't want to offend anyone with the possibility that they may have to pay a 
little $$.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
