Subject: Killing physical deals

We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and 
not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial 
impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without 
my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the 
area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require  
the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.
