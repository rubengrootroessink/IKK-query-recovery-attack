I am in the process of getting these deals valued.  I know what we have 
booked in Tagg as of now, but need to reconcile it to what People's has 
booked.  I got something from Steve last time I was up, but it does not have 
deal terms.  Could you ask Steve for a list that has the terms of each deal?  
I don't even know his last name.  Thanks.
