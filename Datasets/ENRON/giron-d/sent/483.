A W4 calculates how much federal tax to withhold from your paycheck each pay 
period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing 
status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married 
and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There 
is really no good or bad answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld 
each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on 
April 15th, then claim more dependents and married and jointly.  If you don't 
want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may 
owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim fewer dependents and married and 
seperately.  I hope that made sense.

Hey Scott T -  I was just up on 19 funny knowing you're right above me.
   They just sent me down a new W4 to fill out - do you know if its better
to
   file married and jointly or married and separately? How do I find out.
You
   know Mr. Scharck doesnt have a clue and Im not really sure either.
   Thanks for the idea about the DVD player - thats what he is getting and
Mike
   told me to get The Patriot, Matrix and Fight Club - Big George is
driving up
   with Drew, Chris Melber, Ross etc on Friday and he is going to take it
for me
   - so you don't have to mess with it.

   Ciao, Lester
