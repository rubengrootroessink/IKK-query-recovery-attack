Jeff,
If we give these reviews in late Jan or Feb of next year, I think I could 
review Chris, Jason, Anne, and Jennifer.  I don't think I should review Dawn, 
Greg, or Kim.  Although, if I were in their shoes, I would want you involved 
in some capacity.  What do you think?

Don't forget to send me the names of the people that you intend on reviewing.

Thanks
