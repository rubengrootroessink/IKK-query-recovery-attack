Uncle Clark,

It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four 
of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially 
great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret 
that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and 
by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel 
as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's 
like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they 
call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look 
forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be.

Darron
