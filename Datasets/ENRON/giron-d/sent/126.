Hi Jeff,

Could you please do me a favor, and make sure that all Canadian deals
that are in Houston books are flipped to the P& book.  I don't have a current 
list of
all the desk leads, so I thought that I'd ask you to forward this message
on to them for me.  I know that the EOL group is still working on a solution
to our problem, but there are still deals that are in Houston books
that need to be flipped.

Please let me know if there is anything I can help with.  Thanks for your
help on this.

Stacey
