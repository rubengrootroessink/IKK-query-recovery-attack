I will be able to interview at either time.  I selected the late time on the 
email, but wanted to respond to make sure you received it.

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  If 
you are currently on the new Outlook program, you may not be able to use the 
buttons below.  In that instance, please contact me at x39233 to volunteer.  

In addition, we have a need within one of Enron's business units for 
accounting majors.  We will be bringing several people in to interview with 
accounting backgrounds.  We will then make sure that the schedule will be set 
so you would interview these specific candidates.  We would greatly 
appreciate your assistance in this effort.  Thanks in advance for your 
cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana
