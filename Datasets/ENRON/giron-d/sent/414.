Dawn,

Jay and Randy are on the list, but I left them blank.  I also populated Paul 
Lucci and the Chicago traders.  Jim Simpson is a Chicago trader not on the 
list.  He would be FT-IM-ENOV for P,B,&I.  Thanks.

Attached is a list of the traders with access to trade physical products.  As 
we discussed yesterday, please provide the correct tagg books for price, 
basis and index corresponding to the appropriate trader.  Is there any way to 
get this back by lunch?  We have a meeting set up with Tagg IT and need this 
information.

Let me know if you need any further information.  Thanks again for all of 
your help.
