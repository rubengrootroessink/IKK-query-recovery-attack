We are flying in on Thursday.  We plan on renting a car and driving to your 
place.  I'll update you on specific times early next week.  Because me and 
the kids are using reward miles for our tickets, right now Kristi is not on 
the same flight that the three of us are on.  We are all looking forward to 
seeing you.
