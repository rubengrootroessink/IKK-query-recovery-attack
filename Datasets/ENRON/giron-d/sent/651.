Mark,

I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have 
booked for the HUB deals.  He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot 
even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.  Richard 
suggested I contact you since Steve is out.  Attached is a list of deals we 
currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.  They need to be verified 
before I can calc them for value and positions.  I will be out tomorrow, 
returning on Monday.  Thanks for your help.  Please call me with any 
questions.
