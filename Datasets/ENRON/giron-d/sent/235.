How are you feeling?  I'm very tired and stiff.  I've been thinking, and I 
know you feel like I make all of the decisions around our house when it comes 
to $.  So I want us to do what you want on the pool and a car when it comes 
to financing.  I will completely agree with whatever you think we should do.  
And I'm not doing this for any other reason except that I want you to know 
that I value your judgement and ideas.  Have a great day.  As always, I love 
you very much.
