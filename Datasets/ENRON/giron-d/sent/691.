Daniel,
Laura Luce would like to send the latest Enovate DPR to the chairman of 
People's Corp.  But the copies we receive have some sort of protection which 
I'm sure you are aware of.  Will you please send her the latest so that she 
can forward it to this guy?  Let me know if that is a problem.  Thanks.

DG

I am in Chicago today.
