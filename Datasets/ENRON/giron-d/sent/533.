Let's make sure we are doing this every night.  I think Jason has been 
running the official post id macro most nights, but we need to have the last 
person finished do it every day.  I sure can crank out the emails when I get 
some uninterrupted time to myself!

Sally -

These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
engine picks up are correct:

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,  
rather than just one check at  a consolidated level.
2. All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night, 
verifying that all books are officialized.
