I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was 
going to be free on Saturday.  My brother-in-law is hosting a tournament on 
Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill.  
In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He 
will have a keg.  There will be prizes for the winners.  It is a four man 
best ball scramble.  Tee time is early:  7:30am.  I sent this to guys I 
either know play or think play.  If you have someone else in mind, feel free 
to forward the message.  I don't have a team at all and wanted to see if 
anyone was interested.  Let me know.
