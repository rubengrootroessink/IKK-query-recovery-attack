Andrea,

If I left anything out, please let me know.  Also, we have an office in 
Chicago and they are looking for an Analyst also.  I have some 
responsibilities for the Chicago region as well as the West region here in 
the Houston office.  Richard Tomaski (312-541-1231) is the lead trader in the 
Chicago office and I told him I would mention this request to you.  Will you 
please call him at your convenience so he can elaborate on the situation.  
Thanks.

Shelly,

I am looking for an Analyst to fill a position in Gas Risk Management.  I am 
the West Desk Controller and report to Jeff Gossett.  I think a Book 
Administrator role is a good position for an Analyst.  We have had success in 
with Analysts in our group.  I think it presents a good opportunity for them 
as well.  Please let me know how I can get on a list to talk with potential 
candidates.  I am ignorant of the process, so if I am presuming something 
incorrect, I would appreciate info on how this is supposed to work.  Thanks 
for your help.
