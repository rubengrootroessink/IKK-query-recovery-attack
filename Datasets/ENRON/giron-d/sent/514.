Me and the kids get in at 10am, Kristi has to stay a little later for work 
and will be in at 3pm.  I was also thinking we could buy tickets at the 
stadium.  Don't worry about not taking time off.  See you Thursday.

I can't believe it either.  I just accepted a new job, so unfortunately
I don't think I can take any time off.  I am going to try and leave
early Friday.  I'm still testing out the waters over here in my new
group.  I am free in the evenings so I will plan on coming over to
dad's.  I would invite you all to stay at my house, but I don't have any
beds in the bedrooms!  I just moved in and am in the process of
furnishing.  What time are you coming in on Thursday?  Dad and I can
come up with some fun things for you all to do during the day.

We haven't purchased tickets for the game on Saturday.  We were thinking
we could just buy them the day of the game.  Shouldn't be a sell out!
I'm sure KU will lose.  Michelle's family is all excited about going to
the game Saturday.

I'm looking forward to seeing you all.  It's going to be a little cold
so be sure to bring warm clothes!

I can't believe it is already time for our trip up to Kansas.  We are
arriving on Thursday morning and returning on Sunday morning.  Other
than
the game on Saturday, we don't have any plans.  See you soon.
