I would like each of your book admins using WeaponX to begin using the 
following procedures at least once/week (if they aren't already).

Open the database while holding down on the shift key.  This will open the 
database, but prevent the main form from opening automatically.  Next, the 
admin should go to Access menu selections and choose Tools/Database 
Utilities/Compact Database.  After the database has completed compacting, you 
can use the database as normal.

Just a quick explanation:

This is standard procedure for Access databases.  WeaponX imports and deletes 
a lot of data on a daily basis.  When data is deleted, the space is not freed 
up that was used by the data.  Therefore, as time goes by, the database size 
grows and grows and needs to be periodically compacted.

The Texas WeaponX file that I compacted reduced from 520 MB to 30 MB and one 
for the west went from 400 MB to 12 MB.  You can see that we will save 
several GB if everyone begins compacting the databases on a regular basis.

Please note:  Even though this is standard Access procedure, I would 
recommend that the book admin save a copy of their existing WeaponX file 
prior to compacting for the first time.  Once the file is compacted and a 
daily run has been successful, they can delete the backup file.  It is not 
necessary for them to save a backup copy each time before compacting.  I am 
only recommending it for the first compact.

I don't anticipate any problems with this procedure.  As a matter of fact, 
Crystal (East desk I believe) already compacts the database on a daily 
basis.  In addition Ann (West desk) ran a test for me with no problems.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Greg
