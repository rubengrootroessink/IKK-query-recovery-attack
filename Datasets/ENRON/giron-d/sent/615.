It looks like we need to be consistent in booking the GD spread deals.  Take 
a look at the example and please remember to book all future deals in a 
similar manner.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Dutch,

I was hoping you could spread the word to the book admins regarding a data 
entry methodology requirement for Gas Daily 4 legged deals. The Confirms 
group is working with Ricky Dang to expand the logic and capabilities of 
their systems to accomodate automated confirms on deals done in the new 
format, but in order for this to work, it is critical that all Gas Daily 4 
legged deals entered manually into TAGG be booked in the same leg order as 
those which bridge automatically. Although the legs can technically be 
entered in any order as far as Risk is concerned, such deviations will cause 
failures from the confirm end. If the Gas Daily book admins can follow the 
same entry order used in deal # Q25289.1, .2, .3, .4 , the Confirms Group 
should be able to work with it from there. Just let me know if this will 
create any problems from your end. Thanks!

Torrey
