This deal was EOL ID 520766 on the 25th.  Neither the Sitara or EOL number is 
in Tagg.  Please update the deal with the EOL and Sitara number.  It is very 
important that you always put this information in Tagg.  In addition, make 
sure you are updating Sitara with the Tagg numbers as well.  Thanks.
