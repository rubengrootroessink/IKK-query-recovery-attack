Susan,

Attached is the completed book request form.  I just want to clarify a few 
things.  The first three books are for Tagg.  The last two are for Sitara.  I 
will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.  Do you do 
this?  Or can you point me in the right direction.  I really need this 
completed by the end of the week.  Let me know if there is something else I 
need to do.  Thanks for your help.
