Make sure your group is looking out for this.  

1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off
2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to 
make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the 
load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of 
seeing this.


Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have 
questions concerning TDS systems call Bill Fortney x39952, or you can talk to 
Russ Severson.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill:

The PortCalc screen has been changed in production to copy the TDS position 
load flag as is,
instead of setting it to 0.

It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.

Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  

Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
flag a higher priority.

Thanks,

Bill

The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
to access this feature.

(The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
screen.)

Thank you,
Jeremy

Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
screen Thursday morning.  

Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
production Thursday night.  

Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.
