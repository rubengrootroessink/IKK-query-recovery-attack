Toni,

The following people will interview the candidates:

Jeff Gossett
Darron Giron
Kam Keiser
Will Kelly

Errol McLaughlin

We will interview them two at a time.  Meaning two of the above referenced 
people will be in the room at the same time interviewing the candidates.  You 
can contact Irena Hogan for scheduling.  If you have any questions, let me 
know.  I will be in Chicago Tues and Wed.  I will be back in the office on 
Thurs.  Thanks.

Who would you like to have interview these people and is there an assistant 
who controls the calendars?

I am having these people phone screened next week and we'll arrange 
interviews as we talk to them . 
Thanks
Toni
