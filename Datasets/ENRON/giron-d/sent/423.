Kathy,

Attached are two files:  a mini-book of EC3952.O run for Nov-08 thru Oct-23 
and a copy of the deal in the transport model.  The file is too large to 
email.  There are two tabs:  the first contains deal terms and the second is 
a copy of the P&L sheet as of 12/4/2000.  Call me with any questions you may 
have.  Thanks for your patience.

DG    3-9573
