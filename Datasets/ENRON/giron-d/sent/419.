This is the last deal that is in the FT-Norhtwest book that needs to be
flipped into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book, to settle between ECC and
Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership.  This needs to be fixed so
liquidations will be correct for Novmeber.

There seems to be some confusion about this deal, so please call me
or Greg Carraway about this deal, and maybe we can answer questions
if there are any.

Thanks
Stacey
