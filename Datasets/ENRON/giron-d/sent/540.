Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.
