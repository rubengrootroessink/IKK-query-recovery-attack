December 2000

Attached is the file containing details for the Financial Liquidations 
relating to Physical Index trades.  Thanks to Troy and Jim, we have 
eliminated the duplication of the intra-month transport liquidations in the 
daily P/L.  The Liquidations for transport that are included below are 
positions that must be rolled out of my intra-month book and into the FT-West 
P/L.  The offsetting liquidations should be coming through Chris Walker's 
Financial Liquidations Process.   We are still unable to provide support out 
of ERMS for the liquidations relating to transport.  I have included the 
values for all of the intra-month December Liquidations below.
