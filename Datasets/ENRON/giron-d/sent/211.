I have 3 new employees and they are working on the first unit.  My 3 existing 
employees are working on their second and third.  So far so good.  I think it 
is good that we have put the responsibility on them to learn the material.  I 
have not heard of any negative response.  I'll keep you posted.

Jeff,
I was curious to find out how everyone was doing with the training 
program.    Frank will be following up at your next meeting.   How are the 
managers and the new hires coming along with the completion of monthly 
modules?
Any feedback from them?
Thanks, 
hgm
