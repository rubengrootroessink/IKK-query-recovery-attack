Regina,

I need two Sitara books set up in a new region.  The region can be called 
Enovate with the books IM Enovate and FT Enovate.  They are part of the other 
Chicago books:  Midwest, Midwest Program 1, and Midwest Program 2.  I have 
attached the book request I sent Susan Trevino.  Let me know if there is 
anything else I need to do.  I want to make sure that the books are not only 
in Sitara, but also in CPR for valuation purposes.  Thanks so much for your 
help.
