Mom,
Are you leaving on Saturday or Sunday?  I thought yesterday you said 
Saturday.  I feel much older today.

It was nice to hear from both of you on Easter Sunday. ?I spent most of the  
afternoon working in the back yard hauling dirt and transplanting stuff. ?I  
went to a wedding earlier in the day near the Med Center. 

Before things get too hectic I wanted to let you know that I will be in  
Washington DC from Sunday, April 29-Friday, May 4. ?Larry has all the  
details...flight, hotel, etc. ?So, Krtisti, I cannot keep the kids on May 1. 

Hope you have a good week. ?MOM
