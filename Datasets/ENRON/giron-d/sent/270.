Just a quick reminder to please go into your books and flip all the ECC deals 
to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of today for both January and February 
start dates.

I've shown Sherry Dawson a quick way of finding deals that might be missed in 
TAGG, so please see her if you have questions on this.

Please let me know when all the January deals have been fixed so I can start 
the invoicing process.  

Thanks for your help.
Stacey
