Subject: Frank Ermis' trades

Darron,

I have two trades from yesterday that have a few problems.  

V83030.1:  shows a term of Nov02-Mar03.  The broker is saying that is should 
be Nov02-Dec02.

V83656.1:  Counterparty name should be BANKAMENAT.

I know that you are covering for Carole, so thank you for your time.
