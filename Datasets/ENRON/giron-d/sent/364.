could you please forward this to your intra-month book admins.
Thanks



The OA group has had many problems in the past with our desk level summaries 
and the break-outs between our books.  Some of the short names get cut off 
and it is hard to tell exactly what books they belong to.  Could you please 
make sure that the values are input on the correct lines, that there is only 
one line per desk and that there are no numbers without a desk assigned to 
them.  Some of the problems they have run into with SAP and the "seller 
rules" is that if both desks do not show the same numbers the seller side is 
assumed to be correct which throws off the other side and gives them an 
adjustment for the desk to take which isn't always correct.   

Here is a list of the desks that are most often misused.

ECT-ENA - IM CE  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MI  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MK  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MA  market east deak
ECT-ENA - IM SI  sithe desk
ECT-EMW - IM MI  enron midwest desk


Please pay special attention to your numbers this month.  Getting this 
corrected up front will take care of a lot of work in the future. 
Please ask me if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Kam
