I don't know.  She just told me this morning and I hadn't heard about it.  I 
told her to get more info.  I don't know if he is a good student or not.

Man, that's news to me.  Is it a grade problem?  Or is he waffling (is OU
out there)?  That's huge.  Let me know what you find out.

Thanks

My wife told me that UT pulled the offer from Robinson.  Do you know about
this?  I couldn't find it on the boards.

Hey Darron, just been working on year-end stuff here.  Too many late
nights.  I have been keeping up with recruiting.  The guy from Jersey
Village is Abe Robinson, a  O-lineman, TE prospect.  He will probably play
offenseive tackle (6'5" -260 - 4.9) and is a top 10-15 prospect in the
state.  Texas will have a top 5 recruiting class but the problem is that OU
will possible have the top 1 or 2 class and have signed the top defensive
player in Texas, Tommie Harris.   A&M is the odd man out in the mix because
of the emergence of OU and LSU.   A&M is going back to pre-Sherrill days.
I would think they will be looking for a new coach next year.

Let's try to get together soon.  Maybe have lunch or something.

Talk to you soon

Hey,
What's going on?  I wanted to get up to date on recruiting.  I also wanted
to ask you something.  I heard some info from my wife regarding a kid that
was recruited and commited to UT from Jersey Village.
