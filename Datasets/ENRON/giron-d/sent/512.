Hello, Young People.....
?
Still planning on the KU/UT game next weekend, I  hope.? If you are flying 
in, you can get?from the airport, about 30-35  miles, without hitting a 
traffic light until the last mile or so.
?
FROM THE AIRPORT:
1.? Exit the airport toward Kansas City on  I-29 South.? When you get to
2.??I-635, go South; probably will be  marked to "Wichita" or maybe Kansas 
City.? When you get to
3.??I-35, go South again.? You will  be somewhere around 50th street.? Street 
numbers increase as you go  south.
4.? After 75th Street stay in the right lane  and take Hiway 69 South.
5.? Stay on Hiway 69; after 119th Street it  will curve left and then right.? 
After the right hand curve, the road  merges with another highway.? Stay in 
the extreme right lane  and
6.? Exit at 135th street.? Exit to the  right and stay in the right lane 
until the first light; (Antioch).? (About  half mile).
7.? Turn right at Antioch (first light) and  get into the left lane.
8.? Short block to the first light; this is  133rd Street; turn left.
9.? Go to the second right; this is  Kessler.? Turn right on Kessler.
10.? Take the immediate left onto 132nd  Place.? Go to second house on right; 
not counting the house on the  corner.? The address is 9210.
?
After you leave the airport, the exits onto I-29  and then onto I-35 come a 
little quickly, so watch for the signs.?  I expect to be home all weekend.? 
But, if I  am out, the garage door keypad combination is "0730".? Make 
yourselves at  home and help yourselves to anything that is not tied or 
nailed down or  hazardous.? My phone number is (913) 402-9210; cell phone is 
(913)  269-6247.? Not necessary to dial the area code once you get into  
Kansas.? From the airport (Missouri) you'll need the area  code.
?
If you're driving, exit I-35 in Olathe at Exit  215.? Turn right and go about 
4.5 miles to Switzer (school on left; park on  right).? Left on Switzer to 
first right (133rd Street).? Right on  133rd to second left (Kessler).? Left 
on Kessler; left on 132nd Place to  house.? Let me know when you expect to 
arrive and then depart and maybe we  can line something up to keep you busy 
while you're here.? Sean and Tracie  will be in San Antonio that weekend, and 
Mike and Christine can't make it, but  Michelle and her gang and Kim are 
anxious to see you again.? See you  soon......Clark.
