Hi guys --

Hopefully these curves are covered between the three of you!  Attached are 
the 10 curves reviewed for the month of February.  Of these 10, the curves in 
question are:

NGI-PGE TOPOCK
IF-HEHUB
IF-VALERO TX
IF-NNG TOK
IF-TW PERMIAN
IF-TRANSCO Z1
IF-TENN Z5

If you could, please identify the factors that are driving their drastic 
changes in shape and seasonality as compared to the prior month.  Please do 
not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Thanks,
Jennifer
