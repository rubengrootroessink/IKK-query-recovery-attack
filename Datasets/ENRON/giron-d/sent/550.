Stacey -

Darron is controller for the west region,  and he should be able to take care 
of this and point you in the right direction for future issues.

Thanks

Hi Jeff,

I'm hoping you're the person who takes care of this book.  If not, could
you please forward this message to the appropriate person.  There are
a few deals in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be moved to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS BOOK.  These are all EnronOnline deals so they
were put into this book automatically.

Q24809.1
Q47957.1
Q50596.1

Could you please tell everyone down there that books deals into Houston
books, to make sure that there aren't any ECC deals with counterparties
in these books.  Nymex closes today, and I'm going to have to start invoicing
on Monday, so I need to have all deals with ECC in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS
book by the end of today.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter.

Thanks for your help
Stacey
