How goes it?  I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for 
March.  I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the 
four of us.  He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying 
with us.  I hope this is OK.  He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out 
one night.  Let me know.  Also,  I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad 
school.  He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.  Talk to you soon.
