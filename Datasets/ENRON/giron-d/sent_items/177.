John,
Enron's NYMEZ offer for the following volume is $3.115:
	
	Contracts
Feb-02	18
Mar-02	29
Apr-02	52
May-02	42

As I stated in our phone conversation, this offer would be contingent on my ability to clear an internal hurdle.  We do not have an ISDA in place and I am waiting for a reply from our credit department on the best course of action to take.  Thanks for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Darron Giron
