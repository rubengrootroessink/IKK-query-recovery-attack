tEXas tailgatES talk

Okay, I have come off of the ledge. I thought about a
lot of things when I was out there: what if the punt
was tipped, what if it was a safety, what in the world
was going through Gary Barnett's mind on that fake punt,
what if the field goal was good, wow, it's really high
up here... Mostly I thought this: no more Dallas. Let's
not play any more games in the DFW area, nothing good
happens. We will meet the Okies in Waco and play'em at
Baylor. Who's going to mind?
Certainly not the Bears (they really don't use the field
much any way) and certainly not me.

39-37

If you were a 3rd party observer, this game was probably
very exciting. Texas goes up early, Colorado roars ahead
at half, and Texas fights back, but falls just short. I
AM NOT a 3rd party observer. The Horns were so close. 2
points away from a Big XII Championship. D'oh! Give the
Buffaloes their credit, they brought that nasty running
game that we all thought was an aberration vs. Nebraska.
Chris Brown looked liked he was 9 feet tall (have you
ever seen a guy run higher than him? He makes Eddie George
look like a hunchback It was like watching Michael Johnson
sprint) and the CU o-line was just evil. 3 or 4 of those
guys will be playing on Sundays next year. On defense, the
'horns lack of size showed. It's hard to stop a power
running game that's clicking with small tackles, or even
big ones- ask Nebraska, and quick defensive ends. To their
credit, the Texas defense did not fold, but fought the
good fight and stemmed the tide, holding CU to 10 points
in the 2nd half. The 1st half was the killer.  The 1st half.
Oh. The Horns looked great to start the game, but things
went wrong. Chris Simms didn't play well, and would be the
1st to tell you that it was his worst game at Texas so far.
3 interceptions and 1 fumble. Ouch. Cedric Benson was
running well, 13 carries for 79 yards and a score, before
he was hurt with a pinched nerve. The 'horns got down 29-10
and it looked like they would be blown out (that's sort of
how the OU game in 2000 started), but they refused to die,
and fought back to near even. Major Applewhite went from
cult hero to certified legend by throwing a 79 yd touchdown
pass on his 2nd play after replacing an injured Simms, and
Texas nearly pulled it out, but was too far back in the
long run.  I want to talk about Simms for a second. It would
be absurd to say that those 4 turnovers weren't the main
reason Texas lost. It was. Chris played badly. Horrible.
There is no other way to say it. He is a big boy, and I am
quite sure he has the mental toughness to hear this
(and I'm sure he has) and learn from it. It was not your
day, Lefty, turn the page and move on. Everybody has them.
Ty Detmer threw 7 picks in 1 game this year. Kurt Warner had
4 v. the Saints. You will no doubt have more of those when
you get to the League in 2003. There is no shame in playing
bad, as long as you learn something from it. You had 2 bad
days in '01, but you also had 10 good ones, and 3 or 4 great
ones. Get that 2 down to 1 next year, and you will hear no
complaints from me; of course I'm not speaking for everyone...

I thought the coaches called a good game. Greg Davis opened
up the playbook with some reverses and deep middle-stuff,
and Carl Reese was working up-hill most of the night and
still held CU to 111 passing and 334 total. The blocked
punt call, in my opinion, was a good call. Texas got one
at A&M, and needed some help at that point. To ask the Horns
to go 80 + yards through the air (there was no Benson, so
no running game) with your big tackle (Mike Williams) out
of the game would have been a tall order. Get the block, and
you set up shop at mid-field or even run it back for 6.
They didn't get the block, obviously. Teams call the punt-block
all of the time, but don't hit the kicker. The kid for Texas
missed the punt by 2 inches, but fell into the CU punter.
1st down. Tough break. Hindsight is 20/20, but I would call
it again.

tEXas tailgate-
is in the works. It will not be the traditional tailgate
like last year, but more of a gathering somewhere (like a
bar, restaurant or hotel) before we all head to the stadium.
Another email will follow as soon as it is set up.

News and Notes:
* Major Applewhite will start the Holiday Bowl.
* Cedric got his 1,000. Benson only played a half, but his
79 yards put him at 1,053 yards for the year. He is the 9th
player to rush for a grand at Texas.
* Major Applewhite's 233 yards passing give him 8,059 career
yards, breaking the all-time record of 8,049
(James Brown, 1994-97).
* The Vapor is good. Nathan Vasher tied a school record with
7 interceptions in a season. He also had 54 yards in punt
returns, giving him 554 for the year, breaking the school
record of 538 (Johnnie Johnson - 1977).
* B.J. Johnson's 79 yard touchdown catch was his 4th reception
of 70 + yards. All have been touchdowns. B.J. had his 1st
2 t.d. game, and his 4th 100-yard game.
* D.D. Lewis started his 50th consecutive game Saturday,
breaking the school record of 49 held by Dan Neil (1993-1996).
* Hats off to Alfio Randall. The Big Cat filled in for an
injured Mike Williams, and did not let his man touch Applewhite.
* The home team is 6-0 in Big XII Championship games. The home team
is the one who travels the farthest, and usually is outnumbered
in the stands.
* Through their first 15 starts, Major Applewhite and Chris Simms
have identical 12-3 records.

Around the Conference:
* Coach Bob lost his offensive coordinator. Mark Mangino
accepted the Head Coaching  job at Kansas. Sorry, Coach Bob.
Mangino should be okay there, if he can recruit.
* 8 bowl teams from the Big XII. That is a conference record.
Here is who they are, where they're going and when they play,
in the order they were picked by the bowls..

COLORADO - BCS v. TBA
NEBRASKA - BCS v. TBA
OKLAHOMA- Cotton Bowl v. SEC team, Jan. 1st
TEXAS- Holiday Bowl v. Washington, Dec. 28th
TEXAS TECH- Alamo Bowl v. Iowa, Dec. 29th
KANSAS STATE- Insight.com Bowl v. Syracuse, Dec. 29th
IOWA STATE- MainStay Independence Bowl v. SEC team, Dec. 27th
TEXAS A&M- Galleryfurniture.com Bowl v. winner of
Southern Mississippi/TCU, Dec. 29th

Next week I will begin breaking down the Holiday Bowl, as
well as the other bowl games (we will know who plays who
next week). Expect another email about
the tailgate coming soon.

See you later, and do not hesitate to let me know what you think!
Most of you already know that...
