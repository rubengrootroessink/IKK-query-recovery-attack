Darron:

I am trying to track an origination for Fred Lagrasta.  Sherry Dawson said you would probably be the one to grant this origination.  The deal is HS Energy and the Deal number is V58190.  Fred would like to have this granted in April, so if I need to give you any additional information please let me know.


Thanks

Trey Hardy
