I'm still checking - I had an NC ticket for you but couldn't get ahold of
you in time.  Give me your work/home numbers again.

Thanks

Thanks for getting the OU tickets to me on Saturday.  Do you have any
extras for the Kansas game?  I have Jayhawk relatives coming for the game.
Let me know.  The D and SP look pretty good.  I hope they are holding
something back on O.  We'll see.  Thanks.

DG
