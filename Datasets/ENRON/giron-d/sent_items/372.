I am in the process of transitioning into Bryant Frihart's area of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.  I also have just begun working in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Kansas.  Largest customers are Minnegasco, MUD, Great River.  Thanks.

Kimberly, please have the staff e-mail you the comments that they made yesterday about the states/areas/accounts they are covering.  I want you to put together a summary for everyone on this matter.  In addition, I want to get a list from everyone of any markets that are no longer willing to transact with ENA due to credit issues.  Need the list today.

Frank
