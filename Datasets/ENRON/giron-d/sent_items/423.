Patrick,
Terry Brownrig and I did a small phys basis deal this afternoon.  It was 988/d ANR/SW we are selling @ NX1 - $.155  He called later saying he may want to also do a Jan02-Mar02 deal also.  This is just giving you a headsup for when he calls.  If so, you would need to get the quote from Andy.  Have a good Thanksgiving.
