Darren,  

Just FYI.   I've had to pass on the Heartland termination to Richard Deming, who handles Physical deals.   I will get the Twister deal out this morning.  I've asked Richard to drop you a line when he send out Heartland.

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.
