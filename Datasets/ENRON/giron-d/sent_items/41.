You have two cows.  You sell three of them to your publically listed company using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank.  

Then, you execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general officer, so you get all four cows back, with a tax-exemption for the fifth cow, of course.

The rights to the estimated future value of the milk cash flow stream of the six cows are monetized and transferred via an intermediary to the Caymen Islands, secretly owned by a majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company, off-balance sheet, of course. 

The annual report says the company owns eight cows and recognizes milk revenue for the 20 year life of the cows.

This is hedged with derivative cow life insurance policy through a Caymen Island bank, and these hedges are arranged through EnronOnline's commodity storefront with an option to buy one more cow, no balance sheet provided.....

The company says it will file all footnotes at a later date.
