tEXas tailgatES talk


We will all need to chip in a few dollars for the ENORMOUS
thank you card going to Stillwater this week. I gave the
Cowboys no chance to win that game, and after seeing the
highlights, reading the paper, etc? I still would give them
no chance. It just goes to show that what I think means
absolutely nothing.

21-7

Wow. This game was eerily similar to the Texas/OU game. Both
defense were stellar, and shutdown the opposition's offense.
Some complaints I have heard center on the lack of offense/offensive
creativity in the A&M game, and Chris Simms' decision making
in the passing game. I disagree. If you were at the game, you
noticed the wind was swirling something fierce, and gusting
upwards of around 30 mph at times. Both punters struggled in
the 1st half, with punts of 15,17,19,17,21 and 24 yards. Aggie
qb Mark Farris threw deep a few times, and was picked off once,
and if not for some superb plays by his wr's, at least twice more.
Texas jumped out early with a t.d off of a blocked punt, and then
went into the play-it-safe mode. Seeing that balls thrown deep
were floating up for grabs and the Aggie offense's inability to
move the ball consistently, the Longhorns played the OU-style
field position game, and kept the crowd out of it (except for
the 39-yard punt return by Mickey Jones in the 3rd quarter, when
Texas te Mike Jones was liquidated on a block) and eventually
wore down the undermanned Aggies with 2 scores late in the 4th.
Could the offense have played better? Sure. They would certainly
be the first to tell you that. Simms, in my opinion, did exactly
what the coaches asked him to do: play it safe, don't go for the
home run, and don't give them anything cheap to fire up the crowd.
He did just that. No turnovers, no silly passes (well, 1). His
touch seemed a little off, throwing behind some receivers on
occasion, but he also looked fantastic in the clutch. He fired a
missile between 2 Aggies to hit Bo Scaife on 3rd & 4 at the Aggie
15 on the games go ahead touchdown drive (Benson scored on the
next play). He took what the defense gave him, and now the 'horns
are in Dallas. Fine with me. A 14-point win at the feared Kyle
Field.  The Texas Defense is ON FIRE. They held the inept Aggie
offense to 165 yards total (117 pass: 48 rush) and 1 touchdown.
A&M Aggie qb Mark Farris was never able to find his receivers,
and twice found Longhorn defenders wide open. Neither offense
looked particularly sharp, but the 'horns found a way to pull
it out. Good teams win. Period.

THE BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
Texas vs. Colorado
7:00 PM
ABC

Ask and ye shall receive. Here we are. The Longhorns come in
10-1, Winners of the south (thanks, Pokes) and CU comes in 8-2,
claiming the north title. These two unexpected opponents know
each other pretty well. Texas beat the Buffs, 41-7, back on
Oct. 27th in Austin. CU looked a little lost that day, and Texas
pounced on them and wore them down. These are not your October
Buffalos, folks. This team has found itself, and is brimming
with confidence after they thumped Nebraska, 62-36. Put it away,
Buffs, you get the Burnt Orange this week.  Keys for the game:
Texas needs to stop the run (understatement of the year). The
Longhorns will put 8 and 9 in the box to stop the quartet of CU
backs, and dare Bobby Pesavento to beat them. CU has, in my
opinion, the best tight end in college football in Daniel Graham.
He could not be stopped when they met the Huskers, and single
handedly kept the Nebraska db's from crowding the line of
scrimmage. Daniel, this is Nathan Vasher. On offense, Texas will
look for the pass to open the run. Colorado has a suspect
secondary, and the 'horns will try to exploit that with the UT
Towers. If this happens, look for Texas to run well in the 2nd
half.

tEXas tailgate
We are having a tEXas tailgate. It will be located at the
University of Dallas, right across the street from Texas
Stadium. It will begin at 2:00 pm. This seems a little early,
but tickets ordered from the Longhorn Foundation will be picked
up at will call at Gate 10 at Texas Stadium. So you can come by
for a beer and a bbq sandwich, go get your tickets at will call,
and come back for another beer and a sausage wrap, and another
beer? you get the idea.

IT WILL BE FREE OF CHARGE.

That's right. Free. All food and beer will be on a cash basis
(food includes sausage wraps, bbq sandwiches, nachos).
Below is a map to the area around Texas Stadium. The star
represents the U of D campus. There is a pedestrian walkway
from the campus to Texas Stadium.

News and Notes:
* Ced will get his crack at 1,000. The Big XII Championship counts
as a regular season game, so Ced will have another chance to break
RW's record for freshman rushing. Ricky had 12 games his freshman
year, too. He needs 16 yards for the 1,000.
* Benson also set the record freshman touchdowns with his 2 vs. the
Aggies. He has 12 (11 rush/1receiving), breaking Roy Willams' record
of 10 set in 2000.
* Chris Simms passed for 138 yards, giving him 2,473 for the year.
That's 2nd on the all-time list for single season passing yards at
Texas. Unless something really strange happens, that's where he'll
stay. Major holds the record with 3,357 yards (1999).
* Rod Babers blocked his 2nd kick of the season Friday, resulting
in a touchdown after Tony Jeffrey scooped it up. Kool-Aid was the
Co-Special Teams Player of the Week in the Big XII for that effort.
* Texas has now won 8 straight road games.
* The Longhorns post their 1st 10-win season since 1995. They got
their 10th at A&M that year, too.
* The Defense had a season high 4 sacks vs. the A&M Aggies.
* CU is 9-2 this year, tied for the most improved team from 2000
to '01. They were 3-8 in '00, and stand at +6.
* The Buffalos averaged 10.4 yards per carry vs. Nebraska. Yikes.
* Buff tailback Cortlen Johnson needs 49 yards receiving to become
CU's all-time leading career receiver for running backs. He has 677,
and trails Herschel Troutman (725)
* Colorado has only given up 13 sacks in 11 games this season.

Around the Conference:
* Colorado. Wow. 62-36. 62 points. The Buffs had 582 yards, 415
yards rushing. All three are records against the Huskers. 4th
string tailback Chris Brown had 7 touchdowns in the game, a CU
record. That might be more than the Aggies had all season. NU
was definitely looking ahead to Dallas, but I guess they can all
go to tv room in the dorm and watch the game together. They blew
a #1 BCS rating and a shot at the title. The broadcast showed
shocked Nebraska fans in the stands, and one little boy crying.
It makes you feel a little sorry for them. Okay, it passed.
* Kansas beat Wyoming, 27-14. Quarterback Mario Kinsey had 221
yards passing and rb Reggie Duncan rushed for 168 yards and 2
touchdowns. There were 6,500 people at the game. 6,500. There
were more people than that trying to get into K-Mart Friday
morning in south Austin.
* K-State whipped Mizzou, 24-3, on tailback Josh Scobey's 198
yards and 2 touchdowns. He has 31 for his short 2-year career,
tying him for the most t.d.'s in KSU history with Mack Herron
(1968-69). Kansas State is the 8th bowl eligible team in the
Big XII.
* Iowa State beat Iowa, 17-14, in their rivalry game to finish
the year at 7-4. It's the 1st time ever a class of ISU seniors
went 4-0 vs. the Hawkeyes. They should always play this game in
November, not in September.
* Baylor beat Southern Illinois, 56-12. Good for you.
* Tech beat Stephen F. Austin, 58-3. Again, good for you.
* Well, well. Sometimes when I write these, there are things
that happen that I enjoy so much, I want to put them off as
long as possible to savor it. This is one of those times. Let
me get this straight- you lost, AT HOME, to a 3-7 team? 3-7.
It must have been some sort of trick play, I guess. A double
reverse pass back to the punter or something? I can't see any
other way that OSU could score with a TRUE FRESHMAN quarterback
guiding that Offense. Sooner db Derrick Straight said after the
game, "I am in disbelief." You and me both, D. The Sooner
secondary is supposed to be vicious, but they melted down in the
clutch and gave up 2 bombs in the last minute to find a way to
lose. Coach Bob, you seemed so smug in Lubbock after the Texas
players left the Tech game, saying they "had to hope their big
brother knocked us off..." but I guess you forgot about the weak
little sister who just sent you and your legions to Dallas for
New Year's. Bring a coat; it will probably be a little chilly...

That's it for now. The 'horns are 60 minutes from a ring. We need
everybody there to make Dallas our own. Remember, the tailgate
is free, so you should all come.

See you at Christie's on Friday. See you at the tailgate on
Saturday. Let's roll.
