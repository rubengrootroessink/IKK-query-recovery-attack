Burton and Susan:  We are setting up new Physical books for the West in SITARA.  There will be five new books, but we will need each book to have 2 sides, the intra-month book and the firm (FT) book for our hedges.  Below is the list of traders and the new book names:

Trader		Intra-month Book		FT Book
Randy Gay		ENA-IM West Keystone		FT-West Keystone
Tori Kuykendall	ENA-IM West SOCAL		FT-West SOCAL
Jane Tholt		ENA-IM West SJ		FT-West SJ
Matt Lenhart	ENA-IM West PGE		FT-West PGE
Steve South		ENA-IM West Rockies		FT-West Rockies

I have attached a Book Request From that contains an entry for each new book.

 

We will need these requests filled as soon as practical. Our plan is to begin putting new transactions into these books starting bid week this month.. Please let me know what additional information you will need.

Thanks
