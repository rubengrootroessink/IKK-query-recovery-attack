ANYONE REMEMBER THIS??
IT WAS 1987!
At a UNC lecture the other day they played an old video
of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during
the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country
getting the third degree. But what he said was stunning!! He was being
drilled by some senator;

"Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home
security system?"
Ollie replied, "Yes I did sir."
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the
audience, "Isn't this just a little excessive?"
'No sir,' continued Ollie.
"No? And why not?" the senator asked.
"Because the lives of my family and I were threatened
sir."
'Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned.
'By a terrorist, sir.' Ollie answered.
'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that
much?"
"His name is Osama bin Laden sir." Ollie replied.

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

"Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked.
"Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I
know of," Ollie answered.
"And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the
senator.
"Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that
an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
the earth."

The senator disagreed with this approach and that was
all that was shown
of the clip.
