I'm sure you know by know, but Houston got it pretty bad over the weekend.  We were OK, but the flooding was unbelievable.  We were at Lake Conroe (K's parents live on the lake) on Friday night.  It rose at least 3 feet (and it's a big lake!) in a matter of 5 hours.  My boat is on a lift out of the water.  In the morning it was floating.  Their dock is underwater.  I've never seen anything like it.  I hope everyone over there is alright.  Have you seen the newest edition?  We hope to get down your way sometime this summer.  Until then stay dry and take care.
