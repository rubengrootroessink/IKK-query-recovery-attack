I heard you had an email address and wanted to see if it worked.  How are things.  We are pretty wet here, I've heard you are as well.  We got back from Disney World last week.  Things are OK here.  The kids are excited about summer.  They will probably get in the pool everyday.  More to follow.  Try and stay dry.
