It's good to hear from you.  The game is November 10th.  And we hope you come down, it would be alot of fun.  We are getting ready to go to Disney World on Saturday.  The kids are pumped.  First I guess you should see if I'm the coverage area.  We are at:

14343 Millstone Estates Ln.
Cypress, TX  77429
281-304-8303

Right now, we just have dial-up internet service and a local calling company that also gives us 100 minutes of long-distance.  We get off pretty cheap on this, but I would be willing to give this ION a try.  Let me know.

Hi Darron,
Hope all is well with you and your family.  Boy, do I have an offer for
you!!!

Sprint is looking for consumers in Houston to test our new ION
technology.  ION stands for Intergrated On-Demand Network.  It basically
provides your voice service and your data service over the same phone
line.  ION offers several different products.  There is a 1 phone line
version, 2 phone lines and up to 4 phone lines.  We also offer just a
data/internet access only product.  The real benefit with ION is that
when you have one phone line, you can be on the internet and talking on
the phone at the same time.

Anyway, if you are interested in helping us test ION in Houston, please
let me know.  I will need your phone number and address to see if you
are in our coverage area.  Of course, the service would be free of
charge during the testing period.  If you want more information
regarding ION, you can visit our website at www.ion.sprint.com.

We need to start making plans for the KU-Texas football game!

Tell everyone hello for me!
