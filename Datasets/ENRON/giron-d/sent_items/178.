I think Phillip is dead serious about trying to start a business.  Enron's stock is down sharply again today.  It's trading at $16.  Remember in March we got out at $71.  My options are now $68 out of the money and it will be at least 3 years before they will approach breakeven.  If I seem depressed lately, that's why.  Anyway, I love you.
