No.  We are going up without tickets.  People who have been say there are usually plenty available.  Don't worry about the $.  I don't like ND, but from experience, it is better whent the home team wins.  The LSU-AU game a couple of years ago just wasn't as exciting as AU-Florida or Wisconsin-Minnesota.  But the fun thing about it is I really don't care who wins.

Hey...have we had any luck locating NDvTEN tickets yet? How about da Bears game? Just curious.....I may have to bum some $ for tickets...At least till turkey day...I should have some extra cash by then.  So who are going to be rooting for in the games? I can't decide if I want to pull for the SEC or ND...I can't really root for Tenn.  I'll call you tonite to shoot the shit..LAter...Carlos
