I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get the tickets.  If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later date.  Thanks.

DG

Darin - The season tickets are in; OU tickets will be mailed later.  How do
you want to pick them up?  Any plans to be in Austin, soon?

Regards
