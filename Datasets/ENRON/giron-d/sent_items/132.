Darron,

Thank you so much.  It is an awesome letter. I appreciate the time and effort you spent.  One favor...do you think you could ask your admin to put the letter on letterhead?  Jeff wants hard copies, and I thought stationary would look nice.  If not, I can ask her.  Irena, right?  Thanks again.  Have fun in Chicago and tell Phillip hi for me!

Also, the letter should be addressed to Jeff Davis in HR for the Analyst Program.

Thank you for agreeing to write a letter of recommending me for the Analyst Program.  I appreciate your time and opinion.  I have included a one page outline to help give you an idea of my accomplishments, job performance, and job development.  This outline is a guideline to help you.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you again.

Sincerely,

Carole Frank
