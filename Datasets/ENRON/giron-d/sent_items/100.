Subject:	BUDDY REQUEST - Monte Jones

Orientation Date:  July 2, 2001

Candidate(s):		Monte Jones


In order for this orientation to be a success we will need your support with several items:

Clear the candidate's work schedule to accommodate this orientation plan. - Orientation is now 8 AM to 12 PM

NEW INFORMATION:

There has been a change in the orientation program for new employees.  From now on it will only last a half day and they will no longer get a lunch.  This makes it more important than ever to ensure that each new employee has a buddy assigned and ready to go.

It will be the buddy's responsibility to pick the new employee up after orientation, get them some lunch and deliver them to their work station on Monday afternoon.

Whenever an employee is hired, a buddy is selected.  Once we are notified of who the buddy is, we send them an e-mail describing what they need to do.

Provide a "Buddy" to employee.  The Buddy will need to pick the employee up on Monday (EB5C2) at 11:55 PM.
	

*** A BUDDY MUST BE PROVIDED***

Please forward Buddy name and extension to me by Thursday at noon.

Thanks,
Candace
