Sorry to hear that.  I hope everything goes well at work.  My company is crumbling.  It's pretty scary.  A combination of being too far out of downtown and too many trees meant that I couldn't get a good signal.  I ended up getting a cable modem.  I really didn't want to do that because I absolutely hate Time Warner.  And what do you know, they screwed up my first bill.

Hey Darron,
I don't think I'm going to be able to make it down for the game.  My
department just went through a big lay off, everyone got let go but me,
so I'm pretty busy right now trying to make sure the transition goes ok.
I was thinking about trying to take some time off over the holidays,
making my way down to Dallas and LA.  If schedules work out, maybe we
could arrange a visit then.  I'm really sorry.  I was looking forward to
seeing you and the family, enjoy watching KU get beat really bad... but
the timing just really stinks.

Are you still planning to come down?  I need to get a head count because
tickets are sometimes tough to come by.  Let me know.
