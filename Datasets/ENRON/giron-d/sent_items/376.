Periodically, I need some help in data gathering for analysis.  Is it
possible for someone at Enron to occasionally provide the gas market data
that I need?

I would like to look at the following data for 1999 and 2000 prior to our
November 13 meeting.

*	Daily Henry Hub Prices
*	Daily Ventura Prices
*	Monthly Index Henry Hub (Inside FERC Gas Market Report)
*	Monthly Index Ventura (Inside FERC Gas Market Report)

Please give me a call.
