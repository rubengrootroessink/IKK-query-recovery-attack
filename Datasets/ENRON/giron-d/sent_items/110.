OU tix are in!

We'll work out leaving the tix for you under the mat, unless you'd like me
to fedex them to you.  Let me know

It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll probably
just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of the
NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this with you
next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word on OU?

Thanks
DG

   I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get the
   tickets.
   If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later date.
   Thanks.
