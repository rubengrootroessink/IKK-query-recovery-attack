Thanks.  I wanted to see what refinancing to a 15 year would look like.  I just talked to him.  Things are wierd and I know it must be even worse moving to a new group.  I'm glad you like it over there.  I guess it's just wait and see.

How are things in your world ?

Pretty strange to be starting in a new group at such an uncertain time.

I like my group.
