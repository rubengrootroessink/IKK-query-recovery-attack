Mike,
In my opinion Onkyo is just a better quality product than Kenwood, thus the price discrepancy.  I (and this is just me) would not buy a Kenwood.  I would buy Onkyo, Denon, Yamaha, or Harman Kardon.  These are more expensive, but I think better than Sony, Kenwood, JVC, Technics, and Pioneer.  The Onkyo 696 is a great receiver.  And I know you can beat the Crutchfield price.  The sites I would check out are onecall.com, soundcity.com, jandr.com, hifi.com.  You also need to look at audioreview.com.  You can see other peoples opinions of products they have actually purchased.  It is a great site.  They will also indicate where they purchased the equipment and how much they paid.  On those sites to buy that I mentioned, you need to call and talk to someone.  They will give you a better price than advertised on the internet.  Give me a call @ 713-853-9573.  I leave for Chicago later this afternoon.
DG

Darron,

What's going on?  How are Kristi and the kids?  How is that Mustang running?
Hey, I finally got the Tahoe.  Still trying to sell the TA..interested?
Just kidding.  Hey, I am starting to look at receivers and had a question or
two (I got the latest Crutchfield Magazine - what website did Scott use to
order his stuff??)

How important is THX Select/Ultra?

Onkyo has a couple of receivers (TX-DS595 and TX-DS696 for $500 and $800)
that have Dolby Digital, DTS, and Dolby Pro Logic II, and 0.08% THD at
75watts X  5 and 0.08% THD at 100 watts X 5 (both 20 - 20 khz), but are not
THX Select.

If you want THX Select on an Onkyo, you are looking at prices of $1000 and
up.

Kenwood has a new one (VR-510) that has THX Select, Dolby Digital, DTS and
Pro Logic II, but it has 0.7% THD at 110watts X 5 (20-20khz).  Crutchfield
has it at $600.  Is the 0.7% THD too high?  I read an article that said you
should try to keep it below 0.1%.
