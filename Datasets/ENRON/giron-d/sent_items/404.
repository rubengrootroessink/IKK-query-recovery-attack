Carl,
I was supposed to be traveling this morning, but because of the crash in NY
it has been postponed to tomorrow.  I will be in a Dallas airport at the
time of our call tomorrow morning.  Should I use 763-241-2490 as the number
to use for our conference call?  If not, let me know.  I look forward to
our conversation.  Thanks

DG
