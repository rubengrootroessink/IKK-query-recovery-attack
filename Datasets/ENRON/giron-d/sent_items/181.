Reagan,

Lucy wanted me to let you know that I will be handling Utilicorp from the gas end.  It is a territorial issue.  I gave John a quote on the Cal 02 strip and am following up with credit because we don't have an ISDA in place with them.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance on your end.  Thanks.

DG
