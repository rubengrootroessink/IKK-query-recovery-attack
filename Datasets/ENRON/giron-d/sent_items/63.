The HB was pretty wild.  We went to the Big XII CG.  Good game, bummer outcome.

I think I would like to start the 529 plan for each kid.  Can I transfer either the custodial or Ed IRA $$??  I just tried to call, but no one answered.  With all the craziness here, I'm not sitting by my phone.  If you call, ask the person to messenger me.

Darron,

Sorry, things have been hectic lately... How did you like that Horns game???

As for the Ed IRA.. they have raised the limits to $2K

You should however consider the Section 529 plans that I believe we have
discussed previously.  Call me to discuss further.

2001!  I believe that this year the limit has been raised on the Education
IRA's.  Is this true?  If so, I would like to contribute more than the $500
that it has been.  Please let me know.  Thanks.
