>10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
>
>11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor

>store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
>

>11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>
>11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.

>
>Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
