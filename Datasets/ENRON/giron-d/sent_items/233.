We are going to Dallas.  I bought the tickets the week of the OU game.  Thought I would be selling them until last Sat evening.  I think a 5% chance at Pasadena.  I think it comes down to Miami-VT.  Florida should cruise at home against Tenn and anyone in the SEC west on the carpet in Atlanta.  But stranger things have happened........

Well, I feel your pain. Sorry, it came down like that.

So what do your think our chances are of getting in the Rose Bowl?
Are ya'll going to Dallas?
