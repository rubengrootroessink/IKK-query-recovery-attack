Cecilia,
In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

DG

Attached is a long list of counterparty names to move from NG-PRICE into ENA-WT-SOCAL.  Please move only financial deals only.  Please let me know when this is complete.  Thanks.
