Subject: PowerPoint from today's Creditor's Meeting



In case you haven't already seen it, here's the PowerPoint deck that Ken Lay used in his address to the creditors' committee formation meeting today.  Nothing earth-shattering in here, but there are a few interesting slides, especially 16 and 17.
