(Dave's response)
Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11 letters in the name
"David Pawson!" I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a few weeks.
Wait a sec ... just realized "YOU CAN'T HIDE" also has 11 letters! What
am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after me! ME! I can't
believe it! Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could
hide! But no ... PLANET EARTH" has 11 letters, too!  Maybe Nostradamus can
help me. But dare I trust him? There are 11 letters in "NOSTRADAMUS." I
know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in "THE RED
CROSS," can't trust them. I would rely on self defense, but "SELF DEFENSE"
has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone help?  Anyone? If so, send me email.
No, don't... "SEND ME EMAIL" has 11 letters....

Will this never end? I'm going insane! "GOING INSANE???" Eleven letters!!
Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though "I'LL DIE ALONE" has
11 letters.....  Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed! Our
Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4_!
~Dave
      PS. "IT'S BULLSHIT" has 11 letters also.
