I must be jinxed.  Kristi and I are leaving for Chicago tomorrow and will be there through the weekend.  So we will not be there on Saturday.  Sorry.  We really wanted to come.  We are going to see the 'Stros play at Wrigley on Thursday afternoon.  It should be fun.  See ya.

Subject:	Crawfish Boil Reminder

Hey guys,
This is a reminder that the Crawfish Boil is this Saturday at our house.
 We usually get started around 2:00 and go on until late.  Drop by anytime.
 Everyone is welcome and feel free to bring friends and family.  We'll have
140-160 pounds of mudbugs so there's always enough for everyone.  There'll
be a couple of kegs.  You may want to bring a blanket or chair to sit on.

A quick reminder on getting here:
+ Go West on Corporate Drive from I-35 or 121 Business.
+ Go through SS at Edmonds
+ Go until you pass about 10 streets on your right.
+ Start looking for Brittany Drive on your right.
+ Turn right on Brittany.  The street turns to the left.
+ We are the last house on the left.  (901 Brittany - 2 Story Grey brick
with flag)
If you want to pull the map off of MapBlast, our address is 901 Brittany
Drive, Lewisville, 75067.

There is also parking on the street next to ours in front of the field (on
Regency)

Hm 972-459-3938     Cell 214-632-1981
Look forward to seeing you.
