You're in OK on Friday, so you can't make lunch Thursday?

Great, just as I say my schedule is open, it closes.  I will be in the
great state of Oklahoma on Friday, so I will have to cancel.  If I was
going, it would be Zydeco all the way!

   Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
   little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon
   works
   best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
   around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
   Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place
   in 2
   Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

   Schroeder
