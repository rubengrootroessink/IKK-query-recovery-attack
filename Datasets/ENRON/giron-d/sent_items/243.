Hello,
I am sending you this note to let you know that my email address has
changed. I have been having trouble receiving emails from different
individuals and have been unable to correct it, so I created a new address.
If you could please now address all emails to me at

dab312@hotmail.com

I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Drew Beckman
