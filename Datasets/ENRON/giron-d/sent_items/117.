I am happy with my seats.  I just wanted to make sure you were willing to continue allowing me to buy them through you long term.  See you Saturday.  They should be pretty good this year.  But I've certainly heard that before!

I'm certainly OK with the arrangement long term if you're happy with your
seats.  I would have liked to get you down lower, but that won't be
possible today without a much larger contribution.

And I'm OK with you helping with the foundation contribution - you just
won't get any recognition from Texas or from the IRS with that arrangement.
And with the job market these days, there might come a time when I can't
continue my own level of giving and then everyone will have to make a
decision.   I'd lower my giving so that the total contribution was level
year after year.  If and when you decided to stop, I'd have to start making
up the difference again to keep my seats on row 3.  Or I'd be bumped
somewhere.

I got this many because people started asking about getting tickets - this
is probably how a lot of people do it.  I'm not sure today if I could add
any more to the general area where everyone is.  Sheila and Mark are still
getting tix.

I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide
not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.  So
just disregard that suggestion.

I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this
current arrangement long-term.  Because I will commit to purchase the
current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.
It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than
get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony
up alot of $$ to keep similar seats.  I'm just not sure what your plans
would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them
back for yourself.  How did you end up with so many?  Is Mark still getting
the two next to mine?  Just curious.  Don't worry about the OU tix,  I will
find you on Saturday.  Thanks as always.

   I got my files restored and indeed had you down for four OU tix.  So
   sorry.
   Let's try to hook up Saturday.

   I wouldn't mind help with the Foundation contribution, but the downside
   all
   belongs to you.  I could practically guarantee that if you were to split
   away and create your own foundation giving you'd get knocked out of your
   seats unless you jumped in at the $2500 level/yr or higher.  Any money
   given to me would not be qualified for a tax credit for you.  And if you
   decide in the future to start anyway, you lose all the prior years
   cumulative giving where you didn't start.  Any any money you gave me
   wouldn't mean we'd be guaranteed better OU tix (or season tix) because I
   would lower my personal contribution by the same amount.  I don't want
   to
   be on the hook for the extra contribution should you decide in the
   future
   to stop helping.  That said, that may not be important for you and you
   won't mind sending me dollars.

   I know I wouldn't be getting OU tix at all if it wasn't for my
   contribution
   to the Foundation.  Not all Foundation members are getting OU tix any
   more,
   so I continue to consider myself lucky to continue getting tickets at
   all.

   Your choice!

   I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are
   Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

   I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I
   guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know
   the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4
   season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for
   6
   years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this
   arrangement.
   I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the
   Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

      Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my
      records
      of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my
   restoration
      back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them
   with
      seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

      I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you
      paid
      me?

      When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season
   and
      OU
      or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats
   than
      your
      season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix
      with
      their season tix.

      I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

      We'll get it worked out

      I just got the tickets.  Thanks for sending them.  I paid for 4 OU
      tickets,
      could you only get me 2?  Let me know.  I also wanted to ask you
   about
      the
      possibility of getting 2 additional tickets for next season.  I know
   you
      get quite a few each year, but don't know if you have extras
   available.
      Thanks again.

         OU tix are in!

         We'll work out leaving the tix for you under the mat, unless you'd

         It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll
      probably
         just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the
   day
      of
         the
         NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this
      with
         you
         next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any
   word
      on
         OU?

         Thanks

            I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get
   the
            tickets.
            If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later
