How goes it?  I hope good.  I just found out that Enron is making Sprint Broadband Direct available to us at a discounted rate.  Isn't this the group you are working for now?  They will install the equipment for free and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance).  Do you have this?  If so, how do you like it?  Did you hear about Jessie?  Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this.  I have dial-up now and it really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs.  Take Care.
