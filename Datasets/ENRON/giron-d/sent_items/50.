Subject:	hello everyone


Just a quick note to let you all know that my email and cell phone number
have changed.. the new email address is dab312@hotmail.com and my new cell
phone # effective immediately is 713-459-4064.

The reason for the email change is that i have had trouble recieving emails
with this one so I changed it so I can recieve emails from everyone. So feel
free to email me, so that I know that the new one works.  Talk to you later
