If you need a place to stay, you are more than welcome to stay with us. We moved to Flower Mound, but it is still pretty good access to Texas Stadium.

Good.  The game is in Irving, so I will try to find a hotel around there.
It is also at 7:00pm.  We will get into town early so we can come by and
see you guys.  You moved to a new house, right?  I'll keep you posted.

  Mike,
  We are going to be in Dallas for the Big XII Championship game on
  Saturday night.  I just wanted to see if you guys were going to be in
  town.  If so, we would like to come by and see you guys.  Especially the
  newest edition.  Let me know.
