Hey Sara, got your voice message.  Everything is under control.  Specifically:

1. I completed my review of the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage agreements early 
last week so I do not need you to take over the review.  You just need to 
tell me how you wanted to proceed to make sure we are all on the same page.

2.  The Sanford Bernstein and Smith Barney Electronic Trading Agreements are 
among the batch of agreements you gave me on Monday so those will be under 
review by me this week.  I plan to send comments out to them as soon as 
possible.  I am already aware that these are a priority because I keep Aneela 
and/or Theresa updated by phone every day.

 I am feeling alot better, thanx.

Enjoy your day away from the office.
