Yes, this is the document that Anthony and I talked during my call to him on Friday.  He indicated that Andrew was preparing a model from from another such agreement done recently with another Enron entity.

Hi Tom,
	I spoke to Andrew Schwed in my documentation area (Anthony has a day
off today) and explained him the situation and he came with the enclosed
document. Can you please get it signed by both parties as soon as
possible and we will move the assets. If you have any questions please
call Andrew at (212) 762-5164.

				Thanks,
					Ketan
