Sara, I completed review of the Bear Stearns agreement and re-reviewed the 
others on Friday.  I will find you in the late afternoon to discuss after I 
get out of a meeting this afternoon.  

Friday was a marathon day for brokerage agreements -- we stopped the clock on 
almost everything to completed JP Morgan almost from start to finish before 
their lawyer went on a two week vacation.

I hope you enjoyed Florida and the wedding!
