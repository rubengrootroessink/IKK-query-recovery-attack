Sara, nothing has changed since yesterday, I don't think.  

ECI Brokerage Agreement: Anna and I completed negotiations on the agreement 
and she agreed las t week to implement the changes by today.

Assignment: Anna and I have a scheduled conference call today to resolve any 
outstanding issues.  If you talked to her today, please let me know before I 
initiate the call.

Guaranty: To be discussed today during our call.

Anna:

I know that you have been negotiating with Cheryl Nelson about the new ECI 
account.  I am receiving urgent calls from ECI traders and hope you give me 
some answers since Cheryl is in a meeting.

Can we execute the ECI agreement today?  
Have we agreed on the assignment?
Does the assignment also provide for the transfer of the Master Securities 
Loan Agreement?
Regarding the new ENE guaranty, Cheryl has told me that this was already 
requested.  I'll check on the expedited delivery date.

Please call me when you receive this email.  Thanks very much for your 
attention to this matter.
