I am implementing the marked changes as we speak.  When I dropped off the d=
ocuments, she and I had spoken about the status of the highlighted agreemen=
ts.  She says she is currently working on something, and cannot check until=
 later.  Should I give the copy of the BAS to Sara before or after Stephani=
e checks these out?  Please advise.

Stephanie,=20

Keegan is going to forward to you some documents sent by ISI.  The document=
s ae part of a prime broker agreement that ENA has to have in place with Be=
ar so that ISI can clear the trades.  The attached agreement is a boiler pl=
ate vanilla agreement.  Please check the files and Lotus Notes to determine=
 whether ENA has an executed agreement for the account number noted on the =
documents.  Also, please clarify the matter one way or the other with ISI a=
nd Bear by calling, among others, the names listed on the top of the agreem=
etn.  These are the folks at Bear that ISI is dealing with, and who say tha=
t they have no record of an agreement.  I would think we already have an ag=
reement and if not, we do not want to sue the boilerplate -- we would at le=
ast use an edited version of the agreement I have on file which we have suc=
cessfully negotiated with other parties.  If you have any questions please =
let me know.  Please also update lotus notes to reflect what you find.  (A =
while back, Bear goofed when John Galloti got confused and sent us a copy o=
f an executing agreement or boilerplate -- please note that we want to send=
 to ISI a copy of a prime broker agreement between ENA and Bear). =20

Also, Keegan or I will forward to you today or tomorrow the agreement that =
I have just negotiated with CFSB.  Please add a lotus notes entry for this =
clearing agreemetn.  Note that we sent commetns on 5/11 and had to resend t=
hem.  We had a conference call today in which we settled on the final versi=
on of the agreement.  Thanx.
