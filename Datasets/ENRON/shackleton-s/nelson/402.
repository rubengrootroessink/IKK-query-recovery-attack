Hi Sheila, 

Selena Gonzalez called me a week or so and brought this letter to my attention asking whether I could work on it and if so, she would explain the ITG agreement and process.  I told her that I would be happy to do so and she did not have to give me any backgroundsince I was the attorney who negotiated both the ITG Master Agreement for Gary's group as well as legal documents related to the installation process.  


I left you a message to discuss Section E below, although I would like to discuss it in light of my comments to ITG (as opposed to the draft they sent).  There is nothing new for us to do with respect to E because I have already submitted on the group's behalf the requisite legal documents to AMEX, NASD etc.  I completed and submitted the legal documents for you on this issue a few months ago.  The Letter below is just stating that we will fulfill our legal obligations to do  -- which we have already done.  (As ITG has explained, they were supposed to have us sign this letter before we completed all the procedures.  I figured out the legal prerequisites for us and got everything done.

Cheryl,
I did not know you were handling.  I am not sure what E) relates to and think we need more explanation. 
Thanks Sheila

I had a conversation with Cheryl Nelson in Enron's Legal Group last week
regarding her questions/comments on the redistribution letter.  I've been out of
the office for a few days but will be sending Cheryl a revised letter shortly.

Thanks.

I would refer you to David Bender or Saul Sarrett for any questions about this
agreement.  I have copied them here, and expect they will respond to your
question shortly.

Kurt,

Would you please explain to me what E. means?

Also, who should our legal persons call if they have any questions.

Thanks.
