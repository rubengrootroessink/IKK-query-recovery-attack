Hey Sara, Keegan stopped by my office right before lunch to indicate that you 
had requested from her the updated brokerage list.  But reminder that I have 
the updated list and have an updated version.  Reminder that Keegan will not 
start updating the list until after today's meeting.  When I talked to Aneela 
by phone today, I gave her an update and reminded her that she would get a 
formally updated list after today's meeting.  Also, as I indicated yesterday, 
most of the agreements on the list -- the vast majority -- have been executed.

I stopped by your office a few times but you seem to have gone to lunch so I 
am leaving a version on your chair.
