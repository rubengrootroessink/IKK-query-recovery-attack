Sheila,
 By now you should have received our account documents from Tania
Wilson. The commission rates you were asking for are as follows. All futures
products are $9.00, roundturn, inclusive of all exchange and regulatory
agency fees. Options on futures are charged at a rate of $4.50/side.
Currently, I am clearing a portion of the Financials, Stock indices and
Agricultural futures for Enron. Financing rates have not been applicable to
your account with us to date, due to the fact that we are marked to market
daily. If excess margin balances were to occur in the future, we would pay
you a negotiated rate similar to the average 30 day bill rate (because
monies are wired back and forth daily this rarely happens, credit or debit).
  I do understand the need for financing(e.g.. Energy trading
business) and would like to  have the opportunity to bid on clearing and
financing Enrons energy futures trades, as well as utilizing the financing
capabilities that Citibank can provide.
 If you feel that I can further assist in any of these areas, please
call me and I'll come down to Houston to discuss the specific needs of
Enron.

 Thanks for your time and the effort to get our present documents
executed. Sheila, could you please include your phone number in case I need
to contact you? Thanks again.

Sincerely,

 Brian J. Gallagher
