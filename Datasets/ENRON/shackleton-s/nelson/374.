Hi Sara, I hope that you (& your car) are okay and safe in light of the floods.  

By way of update, I am trying my best to get the ISDA comparison done by tomorrow and am hoping although not sure that it can get done before you go on vacation.  On Friday, I had several unanticipated meetings/emergencies and then had to leave work at 6:30 -- earlier than I had anticipated -- in light of the rain.  In light of the flooding, I was not able to get back to the office and the file over the weekend as I had planned.  This morning I have another urgent emergency  -- I was just made aware that we absolutely have to get a brokerage agreement executed for Enron Credit Inc. today so I have to focus on getting that done.  

My extended family here are down two cars due to the flooding so I might have to leave work at about 5:30 today to make sure that I can meet my ride to get home safely.

I am sure that I can take the file home tonight to work on the issues but I am not sure whether I will be finished.
