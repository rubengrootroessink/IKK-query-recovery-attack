Stephanie, I will have Keegan prepare the fed ex labels  for Bear, Goldman 
International and Sanford Bernstein. You can insert the cover letter, 
doublecheck everything and send them out.  I have already sent faxed copies 
where requested.

Keegan, please also prepare for us two fed ex envelopes/packages to John and 
Christine as per the instructions in the email below.  Keegan, I am going to 
forward to you documents to make copes -- put the copies of the docs in the 
package for John.  The originals go to Christine.  As with all, do not send 
-- give to Stephanie - she has to insert her cover letter and we have to 
insert the signed letter from Kate Cole.

Christine, as a follow-up from yesterday, I wanted to pose a reasonable
solution that addresses your concerns and mine. I negotiated the following
language for a similar agreement:

ENRON SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS THEY RESULT FROM ENRON'S WILLFUL VIOLATION OF ANY OF
THE ______ PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.   (Insert the provisions that
raise any particular IT or other concerns for you).
