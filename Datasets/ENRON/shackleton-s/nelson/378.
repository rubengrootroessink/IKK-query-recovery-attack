Why did he call "angry" in the first instance? I thought that there was no rush on Con Ed -- or at least not a rush as in other deals I am working on where (1) the counterparty's attorney is leaving her company or (2) the counterparty's attorney is going on jury duty or (3) the counterparty is already in default?

A very angry George Diskin called about ENA's failure to respond to CP's form of Schedule.  He never asked credit for numbers.  Rather than ocntinue to anger this gentleman, I will create blackline myself.
