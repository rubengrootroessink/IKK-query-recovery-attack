Sara, I confirmed with Mike Bruegel  that he will be opening the account for 
us and has understood this since Tom Doukas and I addressed this issue 
yesterday.  I will edit your lotus notes entry to reflect this correction.

Also, he asked me whether I knew what documents have to accompany the 
agreement.  I told him yes, since I do this all the time.  I have in my 
electronic file folder the blank account form and tax form.  If you would 
like for me to send electronic copes to you if you do not have copies then 
let me know.

That is wonderful.  However my Prime Broker contact at Bear has still not 
been advised of the pending changes.  It would seem to me it will still take 
time for Bear to make the adjustment to the account.

This will likely delay getting the margin relief we so desperately need.

Could you please confirm that they are ready to fully enact the agreement and 
lower the margin requirements as of tomorrow?

Thanks,

Tom

The Agreements will be ready first thing in the morning for signatures.  
Final edits are being completed by Bear Stearns; all the negotiating is done.
