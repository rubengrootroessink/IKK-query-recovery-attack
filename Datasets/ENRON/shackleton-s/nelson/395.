We have a executing broker agreement in Legal for CSFB currently.  London needs this additional information because they house accounts in UK separately.  We trade with CSFB on both sides of the pond as ECT Investments Inc.  London is just looking for documentation which states ECT Investments Inc. is a wholly owned sub of Enron Corp (via Enron North America).
 
Please do not hesitate to call if you would like to discuss.  
Thanks, Sheila
