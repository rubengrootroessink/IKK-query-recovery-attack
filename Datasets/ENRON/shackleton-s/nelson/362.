Keegan, can you make a copy of a portion of this file for me for each of the abovementioned colleagues?

Marie, in response to your note about Morgan-ECI, as per my earlier email to you and Stephanie, I generally do not keep copies of brokerage agreements we send out or receive back, Stephanie does.  With few exceptions, I give all brokerage related documents to Stephanie to send out and to receive back. So please check with the file cabinet behind Stephanie for other copies.
