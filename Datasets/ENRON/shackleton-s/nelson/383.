K, I know we were waiting for Stephanie to get back to us but in the interim can you update the report -- create a new version to reflect the following changes:

SNL -- Comments have been sent.

CSFB -- we executed an agreement for not only ENA BUT ALSO ECT INVESTMENTS.

Let me know when these changes have been made so that I can decide whether to send out the agreement with or without any feedback from anyone else.

Thanx a lot.
