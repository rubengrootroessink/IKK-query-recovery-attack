Hi Sara, attached, as per your request, is a copy of the most updated list.  

Reminder that if you do not receive a copy, you can always go into the legal 
directory and get it.  Look in o:\legal\CNelson\brokerage agreements -status 
reports.  Then, note that the name of each document reflects the date it was 
created.  So, the doc below was done last week on May 23rd.
