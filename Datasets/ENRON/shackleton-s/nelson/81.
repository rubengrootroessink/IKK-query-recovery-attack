I read Sara's message to mean cancel all the meetings since she said she said 
she had no meetings scheduled on her calendar because the meetings were just 
for the initial stages of the project.

In any case Keegan, do not stress about it.   I know you are trying to do a 
good job and I appreciate your efforts.

Just to confirm,  you mean the 9am meeting tomorrow, not the weekly Brokerage 
Agreement Meetings on Wednesday, from 1:30 - 2:30, correct?  I do not want to 
make any more mistakes with your schedule as a result of my confusion.  
Please advise.  Thank you for your help.

Keegan

Keegan, please take the future scheduled brokerage account meetings off of 
the calendar.  Thanx Sara.

Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.  I have no meetings scheduled with you 
tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.  The brokerage 
meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring 
ourselves up to date (and we met last week).  The swap group meeting is 
always held twice monthly.  Hope this helps.

Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.
