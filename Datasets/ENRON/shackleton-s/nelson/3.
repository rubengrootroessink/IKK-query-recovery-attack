Sara, fyi, here is a copy of the second email I had previously sent to Sam 
and Stephanie making sure that they are updating lotus notes after I forward 
the emails to them.  I just want to make sure that you know that I am being 
proactive on my own to get this project done.  Sam and Stephanie are charged 
with updating lotus notes and calling those counterparties who are sitting on 
our comments.  I am completing the legal review and negotiating to get them 
executed.  I am communicating with Sam and Stephanie on progress on a daily 
basis.

Hey ladies,

Sam, I think in the end, you were working on Bear Stearns Brokerage 
Agreement, right?  Sheila Glover's group has identified this as a major 
piriority so please call or email the folks over there again today to find 
out the status of their review of our comments.  Then, make sure that lotus 
notes is updated.

Stephanie, I copied you on the Raymond James email as a reminder to update 
lotus notes on that brokerage agreement.

I know you all are extra busy, so thanx especially for making sure these two 
agreements do not fall through the cracks.
