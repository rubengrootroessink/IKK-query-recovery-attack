Marie, I am forwarding to you for Brokerage files

1. A copy of the executed copy of the Javelin Technologies Agreement that was faxed to me.  We need to follow up to get the original.  In the meantime, we'll put this doc in the executed file.

2.  A copy of the ECI - Bear Stearns guaranty that I had faxed to the office while I was in New York.

Also, Stephanie, reminder that I believe that we still have not sent a signed Tax Form to Bear re: Enron Credit Inc.  (although we did so for Morgan).  In any case, Mike Bruegel at Bear says he does not have it.  Please send one to him.  His phone number is 312-663-3253.  This did not affect the opening of the account but they still need it.  Please make sure that in fact we also sent one to Goldman.
