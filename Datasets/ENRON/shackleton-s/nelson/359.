Hi Sara and Stephanie,

	It is my understanding that the paralegals working on the brokerage accounts are to (1) send documents to counterparties; (2) track their return and (3) keep the fully executed documents received from counterparties in the file cabinet next to Stephanie's office.

	In light of our being short-staffed in light of Samantha's absence, I have tried to be helpful to our team by assisting in preparing the documents for execution & getting some signatures.  I hope that has been helpful.  But once Stephanie [or whichever legal assistant assumes her role] notes that the documents have gone out, then that person should track the documents and be the keeper of records.
