I left a phone message for someone (either Sheila or Selena or Aneela -- I think it was Selena) a few weeks ago inquiring as to whether the attached was the complete agreement because I remember there was a lot more documentation when we looked at the 30 day trial agreement.

Sara and Cheryl,
Who is working on this? It was sent to both of you on 5/30 for both the main doc and the 1 pager subscription.  This doc puts a cap on the renewal rate.
Please let me know when I can expect.
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila and Selena,

I've revised the original contract document to reflect the 10% ceiling on
the second year renewal price.   The contract is attached.

 <<Enron Corp. BTFqfs.doc>>

Let me know if you need anything else or if you have any further questions.

Thanks.

Ellen
