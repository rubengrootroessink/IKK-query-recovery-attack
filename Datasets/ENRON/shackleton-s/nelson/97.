Tom, I am now faxing a copy to you and forwarding a copy to Sara.  

Sara, Tom would like us both to call him to discuss further whether we can 
construe that "repos" as included in the definition of products set forth in 
the Consent.  I told Tom, yes, I would believe so.  But we would like to 
conference you in to doublecheck.  So hopefully you are available in next few 
minutes.

Cheryl:

Can you please forward a copy of the ECI resolution(s) (or consent) which was 
used to establish the Bear account and Securites Loan Agreement?  We need to 
determine all products authorized for ECI trading.  Also, copies of Enron 
Credit Limited authorizations would be useful.  Thanks for your help.
