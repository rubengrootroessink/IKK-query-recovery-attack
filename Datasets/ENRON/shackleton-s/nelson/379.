Hey Keegan, Sara indicated to me this afternoon that she gets the brokerage list revisions I gave you yesterday as soon as possible.  After we finish drafting the changes to the SWAP-related agreements that must go out before the afternoon tomorrow, then please turn to the  Updates.  Thanx again for staying late tonight to help.
