Hi Paris, I hope your dental work was not too painful.  As per my voicemail messages, we also still need to discuss my comments to your comments re: Ocean Energy's ISDA.  Perhaps we can discuss this when we finish with Devon via conference call.   We may have a call scheduled for tomorrow on the latter.  Can we discuss them back to back?
