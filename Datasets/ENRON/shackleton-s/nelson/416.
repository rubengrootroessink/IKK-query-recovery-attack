My thoughts:  I suggest that each Nelson file be assigned by the paralegals to an attorney mentor as well as Cheryl and that we ask that Cheryl not send any matters out until reviewed by the particular mentor attorney.  In this way we can assure that items are not being externally distributed without review.  I am trying to get with her on all Canada files and have asked that she always check in with me prior to distribution.  However, I think other ISDA world matters are being distributed without adequate review.


Cordially,
