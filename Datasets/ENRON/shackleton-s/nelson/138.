Stephanie, 

I have asked a couple of times but still have not heard back from you about 
what happened to the Goldman Sachs completed agreements I gave you on 
Thursday 10th to get signatures and send to Goldman.  When Tom and I spoke 
this morning he expressed angst that Goldman did not have the Agreement yet.  
Can you tell me today where those documents are and whether or not they went 
out to Goldman?

Hi Stephanie, can you call Pam Coleman or whomever you sent the agreement to 
at Goldman last Thursday to get an account number and confirmation?  Thanx.
