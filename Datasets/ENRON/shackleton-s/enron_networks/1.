Hi Pushkar,

I spoke with Sara yesterday and she told me that she can expedite the process 
of
registering for Goldman Sachs' Web ET site.

Would you please send Sara the name and telephone number of your contact
at Goldman Sachs.  She would need to get in touch with their legal counsel 
and 
your contact could provide her the information.  Many thanks.

Regards,

Roy
