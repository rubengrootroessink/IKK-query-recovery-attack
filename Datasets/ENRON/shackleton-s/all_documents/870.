Joe,

Attached is the Deal Confirmation Ticket for the Power Swap Between Enron and 
Eden. The Index (*) is described below.



(*) "The average of the daily MONOMIC Prices at the Ezeiza Market Node Center 
for each day during the Calculation Period. 

"MONOMIC Price" means the sum of (A) the average hourly price, quoted in 
Argentine Pesos, for each day as published electronically in the "Documento 
de Transacciones Economicas"  (DTE) under the annex set forth in the 
"Generadores" file labeled "A1.7 Precios del Mercado en $/MWH - Mercado" as 
published by CAMMESA and (B) as applicable either (i) 7.50 Argentine Pesos 
for those days that are Argentine Business Days or (ii) zero for those days 
that are not Argentine Business Days.

The parties agree that the Floating Amounts payable under this Transaction 
shall be made in US Dollars, and the rate of exchange of Argentine Pesos to 
US Dollars shall be of one (1) Argentine Pesos per US Dollar as set forth 
under Law 23.928, as amended, while there is free convertibility of the 
Argentine Peso and the exchange therein set forth is of one (1) Argentine 
Peso pre US Dollar. Otherwise, the rate of exchange between Argentine Pesos 
and US Dollars shall be calculated using the exchange rate, sell, for 
transfers abroad established by Banco Nacion Argentina at the closing of the 
Business Day prior to that on which payment is effected. Argentine Peso means 
the lawful currency of the Republic of Argentina."
