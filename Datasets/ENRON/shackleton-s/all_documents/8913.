I don't believe so Sara.  Initially, the cp wanted to do a financial trade 
but since then Chris Foster informed me that they are now looking to take it 
physical.  Therefore, I recently sent a request to the physical power legal 
team to process a draft EEI.

I will advise if financial becomes a priority but it doesn't look like it at 
this time.

Thanks for following up.

Tracy

Tracy:

We can't move any further with Southern California Water Company (for 
derivatives trading) as they believe that the company requires CA PUC 
approval.  Does legal need to actively pursue this party for financial 
trading?

Hope you're surviving!
