Russ,
Enclosed you will please find a Form for a Letter of Guarantee  from Enron 
Corp.  As per Jeff Kinneman's conversations, we would like to explore using a 
guarantee to reduce the margin requirements on the Credit Trading portfolio 
for ENA.  
Please advise as to the  margin requirements' reduction we could achieve with 
this approach.
Thanks. Sheila Glover
