Sara:
The offsite list is still on my list of things to do.  On Montana Power, no 
draft has been sent.  Please touch base with Tanya as my recollection was 
that she had a credit issue that needed to be addressed in the draft.  On the 
swaption, the Exercise date is 6/29 and the confirm requires oral or written 
notice of its  intent to enter into the transaction, followed up with written 
confirmation of notice of exercise.  Is there anything that we can or should 
do ahead of time?

Carol:

Have you had a chance to recap our "offsite" discussion?

Also, what can you tell me about Montana Power Company (1st draft ISDA)?

Stop by in the a.m regarding exercise of your swaption.  What does your 
confirm say about the form of notice of exercise and the exercise date (or 
period)?
