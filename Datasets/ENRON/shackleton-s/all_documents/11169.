Sara,
Hi. I work in the swaps group at Goldman Sachs, and have been discussing
several swap transactions with Shane Dallmann and Aaron Armstrong in the
London office. One of these may involve the use of futures. Ahead of
executing any futures transactions, we would like to sign a "Give-Up
Agreement". Aaron asked that I contact you to discuss this.

Are you the right person to discuss this with ? I would appreciate any
direction you can provide.

Best regards,
Howard Russell
