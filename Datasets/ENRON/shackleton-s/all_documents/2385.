Here is my suggestion for the PJM Index. I will use a PJM Peak Loadshape that 
mirrors the ISO NE and ISO NY Loadshape.


Kenny; et al:

Please map in TEST and PROD

Index:  PJM Interconnection
Abb:  PJM InterC
Sort Code: 
Desc:  The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average 
of the hourly prices listed in the Index (in final, not estimate, form) for 
electricity delivered during Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the 
applicable Determination Period.  The Floating Price for each Determination 
Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by 
PJM Interconnection, LLC on its official web site currently located at 
http://www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, 
under the heading "PJM - Locational Marginal Pricing Files"  (the "Index").

The appropriate address is ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html

This is the same as going to www.pjm.com, clicking on "Market & System Data", 
and then clicking on "Daily Real Time LMP Data".
