Sorry I could not make it to the meeting when you discussed the GTC. Can you 
keep me informed on what changes you are discussing and also provide me with 
a copy of the GTC and any revisions. Also, do we have final acceptance on the 
Product Long Description from everyone? Attached is the final version for 
your review
Thanks
