Sorry I didn't reply to this by return.  So far we have had no feedback re 
any of the newer schedules but these things take time in Japan from my 
experience.  I guess we will just have to deal with that feedback when we get 
it - I think though that after all the work you have done in getting the 
forms into shape, it should be much easier for me to take the lead when 
things move forward because we will be dealing with standalone issues.

I have not replied to IBJ and am hoping to get to this this week.  If I have 
any questions, in the first case, if you didn't mind I guess it would be good 
if I could try them on you.  If this didn't work for any reason, I would of 
course be able to address them to your successor.

Re BTM - you may recall that they insisted that we work from their draft. I 
need to try and finalize my response to them this week and if I have any 
questions, would propose that I deal with them as above. 

By the way has your successor been decided?

Finally, I have really appreciated the way you helped me out of the jam and 
hope that I will be able to repay the favor one day.

Good luck with power trading - when our power trading business here finally 
gets on its feet, who knows, we may work together again.

Jane:
I just wanted to let you know that I have been asked to join Elizabeth 
Sager's power trading group, effective this week.  Can you give me a feel for 
where you think things are headed with respect to those counterparties that 
have been sent our schedules?  I will let you know who my replacement is 
shortly. It was a pleasure to work with you and hopefully we will get to meet 
in person sometime soon!
