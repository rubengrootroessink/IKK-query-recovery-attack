Sarah - Good Idea!  Who would you like to nominate from structuring?

Paul - Further to my voicemail, I attach the sample term sheets and look 
forward to discussing the corporate finance implications with you and my 
colleagues shortly.  My assistant, Nina, will be in touch to fix up a 
meeting. Thanks

Regards

Paul

Two samples attached with names deleted. If we are to set up a meeting, I 
might contemplate including someone from the structuring side who can assist 
in providing better descriptions of all the possibilities.
