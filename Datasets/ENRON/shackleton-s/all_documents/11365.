Tana:

When attempting to access the link you sent below I was unsuccessful.  In 
speaking with IT, they indicated that I need to know the server that the 
below database is on in order to be able to launch this database.  I did 
indicate to IT that it was a lotus notes application.  If you can look on 
your lotus notes icon for the below database link and tell me if the server 
is NAHOU or ECTHOU that would help us out a lot.  Or I don't mind coming to 
your work location and looking at the icon myself on your pc to determine the 
information that I need in order to launch the database.

Thanks.
