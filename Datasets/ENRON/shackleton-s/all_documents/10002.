Janice, I forwarded the deal ticket for the 3/16 CAISO transaction to Yair.  
When I spoke to him (before he saw the fax), he indicated that Allegheny 
would assume that one as well, so it needs to be added to the schedule and 
attachment A.  Is Rhonda or someone else there going to make this correction 
and send revised schedule to Kate and revised attachment A to me?
