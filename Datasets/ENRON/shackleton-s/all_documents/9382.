Hi Sara, I have discovered quite a few long term deals that were done with 
Enron Energy Services that have never been confirmed.  These trades were done 
when the other group was confirming financial power deals.  I have created a 
confirm for one of these deals.  Please look at the following and let me know 
if you see anything that should be changed from a legal standpoint.  Then I 
will continue to create the rest of them



Thanks for your help,
Melissa
