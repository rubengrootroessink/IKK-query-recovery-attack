Hey Stephanie, I can see that you are super super swamped, so I am trying to 
help by doing some of the paralegal work to get several of the URGENT 
brokerage agreements done.  I do need your help on the following:

1. As I mentioned earlier today, the last few tasks I left for you for Enron 
Credit Inc. are critical.  I jsut need for you to call that contact to find 
out when they will have the tax I.D. number and let her know that we 
corrected the final slate of officers via Richard Sage and not by the info in 
the system and we want the info in the system updated right away.  We were 
able to get certain key documents to Bear in order to open the account but 
that stunt was contigent on our getting to them the outstanding information 
immediately thereafter and they are calling us on it.  Sara represented to me 
that this work was extremely urgent.  

Sara, maybe you can provide some guidance to Stephanie about whether she 
should put extra focus on these other tasks.

2.  As per my previous emails yesterday and today, please have the documents 
ready for Goldman International by the end of the day Thursday.  


thanx.
