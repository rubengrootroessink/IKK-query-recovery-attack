Theresa and Greg,
The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive 
(acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16 
using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
On the debit side it is competitive.  
Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go 
ahead unless anyone can see an objection.
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila,
 Below is the information I received from Joe Hunter's group regarding 
funding rates for some of the exchange brokers.  For comparison JP Morgan's 
Futures funding rates are:

  Credit rate     Debit rate
US Dollars 90 day US TBill auction rate less 0.25%  JP Morgan Overnight 
Borrowing Rate plus 0.25 %
