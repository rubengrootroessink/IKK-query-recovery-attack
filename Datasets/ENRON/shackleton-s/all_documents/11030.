		 Subject: Merrill/Allegheny Deals


Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the 
transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are 
Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and were 
supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit.  
Therefore, they stayed as Merrill in our books.  Please confirm which are 
Merrill deals and which are Allegheny.  We will need confirmation after this 
review with our attorney as to where these deals will be booked.  

Another question that has arisen is whether Allegheny traders are trading for 
Merrill Lynch.  These issues need to be resolved so that we do not continue 
to have these questions when our settlements people try to check out at month 
end.  Thanks for your help.
