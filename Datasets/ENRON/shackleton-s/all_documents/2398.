Hi Sara, 

I have a question pertaining to Counterparty - Southern Company Energy 
Marketing, L.P.  We have been receiving Executed Financial Confirmation 
Letters with our ISDA Master Agreement Date June 1, 1994 striked through and 
SCEM writes in June 28, 1994 (execution date).  I have been researching with 
Rhonda Denton and we state June 1, 1994 as the effective date, the date that 
is on the Master Agreement.  SCEM wants June 28, 1994 date - when the Master 
Agreement was executed.  I have spoken to Jeff at SCEM and he said it was 
"industry standard" to use the execution date.    Our confirm states "This 
Confirmation supplements, forms part of, and is subject to, the ISDA Master 
Agreement dated as June 1, 1994, as amended....   Is EPMI's Date correct or 
are both dates valid.   Please let me know if you need any further 
information. 

Thank you
