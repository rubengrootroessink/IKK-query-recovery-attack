No we did not execute a deal.  I believe we left it (via our exchanged VMs) 
that we would drop the CSA on the ISDA and only allow the one transaction 
(due to the netting concerns).  I have not heard from Moulton; however, it is 
worth noting that Moulton is leaving the Paper & Pulp group, so this may 
become a lower priority.  Hope you have a good vacation!

Tanya:  I just returned from vacation.  What happened with SITA?  Did we 
execute a transaction (in the name of ECTRIC) on a Deemed ISDA (with or 
without credit?).  I didn't see an entry in Lotus Notes.  Sara

Further to my fax of 3 October we have SITA's instructions.

1 - Credit Support Annex :

SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit Support 
Annex.  SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on the term and 
volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support Annex.

2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its main 
activities. Do you have any news regarding ENRON on this point?

Kind regards
Susan Hopkinson
