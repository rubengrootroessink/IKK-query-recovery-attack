Sara and Jim -
Here is the term sheet for the CSFB forward (this is related to the swap that 
we unwound on Friday).  The same old issues of registration and net cash 
settlement are in here.  I'd also like to talk to ya'll about the fees and 
expenses section.  Jim, where are we on putting together registration 
language that is acceptable to us?  Talk to ya'll later.
CF
