BRAZIL: SUIT TO PAWN STATE'S SHARES OF CELESC
Gazeta Mercantil, 25 Feb 2000, p. a-14:-
 The specific purpose company Invesc, which was created to get funds for the 
government of the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina in 1995, had issued R$ 
100mn debentures using shares of the Brazilian electricity company Celesc as 
guarantee.
But Invesc paid interest of the debentures only in 1997 and so debentures 
holders filed a lawsuit in March 1999 to be paid.
A legal decision was taken on February 22nd 2000 about the matter and then a 
debt of approximately R$ 274mn must be paid to the debentures holders of 
Invesc or 29.32% of the common shares of Celesc owned by the state will be 
pawned (market value of the shares was equal to R$ 171.7mn on February 24th 
2000).
If the shares are transferred to creditors, the state will still own 50.18% 
of the common shares of Celesc and Previ (pension fund of employees of the 
Brazilian bank BB - Banco do Brasil) will increase its participation in 
Celesc from 12.54% to approximately 33%.

BRAZIL: FUEL DISTRIBUTION MARKET - PERFORMANCE
O Estado de S.Paulo, 24 Feb 2000, p. b-8:-
 According to a survey carried out by the Brazilian National Trade 
Association of Fuel Distribution Companies (Sindicom), the largest fuel 
distribution companies in Brazil, BR Distribuidora, Shell, Esso, Ipiranga and 
Texaco, registered sales of 2.551mn m3 in January 2000, a fall by 22% 
compared to the 3.276mn m3 sold in January 1999.
Meanwhile, sales registered by smaller companies grew by 34.1% in the same 
comparison basis.
According to Luiz Antonio Viana, president of BR Distribuidora, this was due 
to an unfair competition caused by these smaller companies, which have for 
instance appealed to tax evasion.


BRAZIL: OIL ACCOUNT SURPLUS' GOAL STILL R$ 3.6BN
O Estado de S.Paulo, 25 Feb 2000, p. b-4:-
 The Brazilian government still has as goal to reach a surplus of R$ 3.6bn in 
the Brazilian oil account (difference between imports costs and consumer 
prices)  in 2000 even with the higher oil prices in the last weeks.
The chief of the Economic Advisory of the Ministry of Planning and Budget, 
Jose Guilherme Reis, said that it is still possible to reach that goal and so 
the government is not analysing alternatives.
