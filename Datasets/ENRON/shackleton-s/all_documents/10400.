Size isn't everything. Not when it comes to enterprise-wide risk management.
Banks of all sizes face very similar difficulties in calculating and managing

VP Bank of Liechtenstein has implemented two integrated risk systems from
SunGard. And the bank is so impressed that it now plans to extend the use of 
BancWare
and Panorama to other areas of its business.
