Listening to HELLO ENRON is the latest trend among Enron employees.  This 
radio-style news program was created with you in mind, so get plugged in

The new program will bring you up to speed on the 1999 Chairman's Award and 
the new office tower being constructed in downtown Houston.  Also hear from 
Portland General Electric President Peggy Fowler and three PGE linemen.

There are two ways to listen:
