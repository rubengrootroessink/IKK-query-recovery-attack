There should be a clean copy of the Agreement in the file.  We blacklined it 
against the existing agreement with Weyerhaeuser Company Limited and such 
blackline is also in the file.  If there is not a clean copy of the new 
agreement, let me know and I'll print out another one.

Stephanie:  The fax that you gave to me with this file states that the CP 
wants to change jurisdiction "back to New York."  I don't see a prior draft; 
only a blackline against a Weyerhaeuser Company LImited document, the latter 
ISDA having been executed in June, 2000.  Does his question refer to that 
executed master?
If so, please let me know what we agreed to.  Thanks.
