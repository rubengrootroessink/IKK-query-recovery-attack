Lisa,

Per our discussion, the following should be inserted at the end of
Section 18:


"except that Subscriber will be liable for all costs, expenses and
direct damages arising from Subscriber's failure or refusal to settle on
terms entered or approved by Subscriber"

In addition, the phrase: "and/or consequential" should be deleted from
Sections 6.1 and 6.2.  Please call me at 713-220-4124 after you have had
a chance to review  these changes.

Thanks,

Jason
