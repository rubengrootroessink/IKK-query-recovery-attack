In the last week, five new ideas have been posted to the Idea Vault and 
routed for review, including Enron Airline Services, the Enron Office Locator 
and the use of geostationary satellites to read meters.  
We also have a success story to share.  Tony Pickett suggested that Enron 
compile a glossary of terms (abbreviations, acronyms and industry jargon) and 
make it available online.  The New Hire Network has stepped up to make this 
idea a reality.

This week, we are releasing a new version of eSpeak!  From the audience 
perspective, the changes are very subtle.  We've added features such as a 
time stamp on each posting, the ability to format responses, and we've even 
put the speaker's photo inside the transcript window (in case you forget 
who's hosting the event).  From eSpeak's perspective, we've smoothed out some 
things  behind the scenes.  We hope you'll take a look at the new site and 
let us know what you think about it.  
The next eSpeak will take place on Thursday, Mar. 29 at 10 a.m. Houston 
time.  Mark Koenig, executive VP of Investor Relations, will discuss Enron's 
investor relations function and provide a stock update.
