Gang,

Apparently there has been some miscommunication from the folks at National 
Bank of Canada.   My understanding had been that the Master ISDA between 
Garden State and NBC would be exactly the same as the Master ISDA between ENA 
and NBC except the $1mm threshold.  This is not the case.  The attached 
documents are what they believe should be the draft documents which have the 
$1mm threshold difference and an environmental reference that is different.  
Can you please take a little time and quickly look through the document and 
see what else might be different. I'd like to get a general feel for what is 
different so that I can decide the best way to deal with this.

Thanks,
Rodney
