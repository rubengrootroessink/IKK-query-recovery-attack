Subject:  Details of the Accounts Payable Department Move

Effective Monday, March 27, 2000, the Enron Corp Accounts Payable department 
will be located on the 5th floor of the 600 Jefferson building in Houston.  
This move will officially combine the Accounts Payable department currently 
located on the 12th floor of the Enron Building and the Accounts Payable 
department known as Enron International Accounts Payable, currently located 
on the 12th floor of Three Allen Center.  In the new organization, Larry 
Dallman will be director of AP operations and Judy Knepshield will be the 
director of Strategic Direction and Best Practices.

This move will not affect the EE&CC Accounts Payable department on the 35th 
floor of Three Allen Center.

Because of this move, our services will be somewhat limited on Friday, March 
24 and on Monday, March 27 as we get situated in our new offices.  If you 
anticipate having special requests on those two days, please get them to us 
before Thursday, March 23.
