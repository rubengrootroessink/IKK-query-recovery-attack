Stephanie- Further to my recent email, please find attached a copy of the
Enron Corp. Schedule "marked-up" with our comments which replica the ISDA
CSFBi has recent executed with Enron Credit Limited. I will send you a copy
of the executed ISDA Agreement once I have received Enron Credit Limited's
approval.
In the interim, please let me know if you have any comments on the Schedule.
Kind regards
Anita
