Melissa,

Can you take care of the below?  If you have any questions about what we did 
in the past, let me know.  Otherwise, Sara has you covered.

Thanks,
Joe

Joe:  Attached in draft form is a transaction that Chris Foster may do with 
Arco today.  His number in Portland is 834-3822.  I'm not certain about 
credit and "ECT" will have to change to "ENA".  Let's keep in touch.  
Thanks.  Sara

Chris, I've attached a simplified confirm based on our prior May, 1999 
version.
The only change in the new draft is to represent the fact that we are now 
using
only firm energy rather than a blend of firm and nonfirm. As a result volume
weighting should only apply on holidays and Sundays when on-peak and off-peak
values may need to be weighted in with 24-hour firm values.

On a related issue, how quickly could you have a corporate guarantee 
available?

Dave
