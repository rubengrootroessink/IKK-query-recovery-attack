FYI.  This should also have the effect of reducing the trigger on the UBS 
forward back down to $50.  If anyone would like to talk about this further, 
let me know.

Clint,

As discussed, effective immediately we are revising the price trigger on the
forward tranche of 1,388,100 shares from $55 to 50.   In return, the share
cap is being revised from 4,164,300 to 4,858,350.

We will send out amendments to document this change shortly.

Thank you,
