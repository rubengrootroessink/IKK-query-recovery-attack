Sara,
Please find attached your approved document with a last minute change, please 
take a look and let us know if you are OK with it.
Also, you can find the GTC disclaimer (essentially the same as for all 
internal products)

Please let us know your approval or comments. I'll  really appreciate your 
prompt response since, as mentioned, we need to have both documents ready on 
the system by noon today in order to have them uploaded into the database and 
ready for trading next Monday,

Thank you
Carlos
