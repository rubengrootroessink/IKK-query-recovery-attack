Sara,
Equity Trading has started a new executing broker relationship with Jeffries 
in Dallas.  They are an OTC Market Maker in names we are interested in. They 
have flow and research in the names we want to trade.
I have requested them to send an Executing Broker Agreement and I will 
forward when we get it.
Thanks. Sheila
