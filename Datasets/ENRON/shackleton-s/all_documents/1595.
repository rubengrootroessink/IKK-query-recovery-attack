For a deal with Southern they would like to amend the true up period to be 90 
days. 

This is some language we used on an older deal under Special Provisions:

For purposes of this Transaction, the phrase "within 30 calendar days" in 
line 5 of Section 7.3 of the Commodity Definitions shall be replaced by the 
phrase "within 90 calendar days."

Is it O.K. to use this again.
