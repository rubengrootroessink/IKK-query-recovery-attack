This is another re-structuring. ET0754 (a Costless Collar) has had the Cap 
Strike Price revised after the first 3 months, and in consideration of doing 
so, we entered into EY1632, another costless collar, at strike that are 
probably off-market. 

The consideration language is in ET0754; please review this and how I set 
apart the Cap Strike Prices.
