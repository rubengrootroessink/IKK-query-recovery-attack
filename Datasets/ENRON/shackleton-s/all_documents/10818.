"Net Asset Value" means as of the relevant time of determination, an amount 
(expressed in United States Dollars) equal to the sum of Party B's Assets 
minus Liabilities.  "Assets" means all assets and "Liabilities" means all 
liabilities, as would generally be classified as such in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
