Becky, 
As regards the ISDA agreement I sent to Brent Hendry, the name of the trader 
in charge of the transaction at Enron is Steven Vu. 
We look forward to receiving your comments on this agreement, together with 
the draft confirmation of the transaction at your earliest convenience. 
Kind regards.
