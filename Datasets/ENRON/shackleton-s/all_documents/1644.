FYI.  (Note that I do not have the final version of the memo to Colin 
Jackson, who was the financial trader that went to Australia last September.)

Subject: Memo to Colin Jackson re: Australia

Attached please find a draft memo to Colin Jackson regarding his role in 
Australia. I have tried to combine the tax and legal concerns into one memo 
so it will be easier for everyone to keep track of. I hope I have accurately 
reflected all relevant points - if not please feel free to make amendments. 




If possible, please respond with any comments by the end of business on 
Thursday, Sept. 9th.  

Many thanks, 

Shari
