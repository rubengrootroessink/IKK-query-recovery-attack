Aneela, I will call Jamie to clarify any confusion -- please forward the 
phone number to me.  We have an executed agreement already  - it was executed 
within the past two weeks.

Aneela:

I received the referenced agreement in inter-office mail.  According to 
Cheryl's latest report,  identical agreements were executed by both ENA and 
ECT Investments, Inc. on or about 4/12/01.

What is it that you are asking us to do with the draft from "Jamie"?
