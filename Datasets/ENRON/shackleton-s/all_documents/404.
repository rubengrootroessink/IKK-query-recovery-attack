Subject:  Champion

This is a draft of proposal to be forwarded to Champion for Sep-Nov deal. 
Contract to be forwarded (following internal agreement with legal on how to 
articulate structure to include the paper pricing index).  Bob, Remi, Don - 
we need to choose (1) a strike price and (2) a volume for acceptable risk; 
I've enclosed a spreadsheet with details the UK-based uncoated free sheet 
sales which Mauro indicated is a larger percentage of Champion's exports. 
(Hurrying to get the spreadsheet out, so will check the numbers.)
