We are currently working on fixing the credit capacity in the Raptor 
structure.  The current thinking is that the swap will be at the money and 
look like the other private swaps in Raptor I and II.  The amount, 
termination date and Raptor vehicle are still being discussed.  The 
termination date could  change with the credit capacity fix.  I will provide 
you the information when it is finalized.
Thanks,
Gordon
