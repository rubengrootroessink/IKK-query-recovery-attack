I spoke to Mark yesterday about (B) of the Setoff clause.  He says it has 
been in our form since time immemorial; he is not sure at whose behest it was 
put in there or for what specific reasons, although he did confirm what we 
concluded -- it is meant to allow the Non-defaulting party to hold back 
payment if it is not paid amounts that, for whatever reason, do not qualify 
for Setoff.  To this end, he authorized me to elaborate on the phrase "other 
obligations" by changing it to "obligations (other than those pursuant to 
Section 6(e))"
