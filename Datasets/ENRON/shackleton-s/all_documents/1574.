Sara,
David spoke to his Posit contact.  Apparently we do not have an agreement in 
place. We used to trade via recorded phone with them and have now gone to 
electronic communication.  

Posit will be sending us an agreement and we will forward it onto you for 
your review.
Thanks. Sheila

Sara,
David is going to follow-up with his contact at Posit tomorrow to find out 
about the agreement.
I will let you know.
Thanks. Sheila
