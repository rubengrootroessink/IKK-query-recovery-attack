Subject: Additional "Authorized Trader" for equity account

Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second 
"Authorized Trader" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account 
which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of 
Rhythms stock).  The rationale for a second trader is not new to us:  in John 
Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.  It is my 
understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of 
this particular stock which will be "dribbled in" periodically.  Please let 
me know if you have any questions.  Both Donna and Sheila are very familiar 
with this transaction.  Sara
