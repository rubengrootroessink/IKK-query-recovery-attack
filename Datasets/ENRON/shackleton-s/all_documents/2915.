This is something that we have discussed a little in London and what I 
believe is required is an umbrella netting and cross default agreement sign 
by all parties. However, this is difficult to draft and is questionable to 
its enforceability, especially with Swiss entities. I guess this is Legal's 
call.

Agreed.  However, if we have to negotiate separate ISDAs, we will have to 
incorporate different threshold amounts.  My question is, Is there any way we 
can draft these documents such that only one, overall threshold could be set 
under which all Vitol exposure can be aggregated?

I have always believed that Vitol SA and Vitol SA Inc are one and the same 
company anyway. IE the later is simply a US branch.

Okay.  I will inform the ENA commercial team that they will need to allocate 
the total available line with ECTRIC.  I believe separate masters with 
separate credit thresholds will be required.  Though I would appreciate input 
from legal if we can somehow net Vitol S.A. (Swiss) with its US unit, Vitol 
S.A. Inc. under one master and thus set only one, global limit without the 
need to allocate.

Yes, we have received figures for end 12/99 plus unaudited figs for 31/5/00. 
I believe Neil is doing the analysis and will input them into CAS - credit  
Analysis shortly.

yet from Vitol.
