All:  I met with Rodney Malcolm and Finley Biggerstaff about the two 7-year 
paper swaps between each of Garden State/CITI and ENA/CITI.  Who will be 
handling credit for the new master and the transactions in general?  I am 
told that this is a Q3 deal.  Thanks.  Sara

Molly:  I left you a vm about prior efforts to amend the ENA/CITI master.  
Weren't ;you speaking wth someone at Citibank?
