=09Zoom  Tip #1: Choosing  the Right Zoom for Springtime Pictures
=09
=09Springtime brings  so many photo opportunities: flowers in bloom, childr=
en in=20
Easter  finery, butterflies, bunnies, and egg hunts. To capture the best =
=20
moments in pictures, make sure you are zoom-wise! First let''s start  with=
=20
the basics.[IMAGE]
=09
=09Zoom settings  are the focal lengths available to you. They are labeled =
 and=20
measured in millimeters (this measurement is actually the distance  between=
=20
the lens element and the film). Zoom settings fall into  3 categories: wide=
=20
angle (less than 28mm), normal (28mm - 50mm),  and telephoto (above 50mm).=
=20
Wide angle settings allow you to capture  a broader scene without physicall=
y=20
moving farther away. Normal settings  let you capture as much as one of you=
r=20
eyes sees (your angle  of view with both eyes open is approximately 28mm an=
d=20
about 50mm  with one eye closed). Since a camera has only one eye (lens),=
=20
50mm  is considered normal. Telephoto settings soar above 50mm, magnifying =
=20
the subject and narrowing the angle of view.=20
=09
=09[IMAGE]To  capture fields of springtime flowers or entire yards on film,=
 try =20
using a setting such as 28mm or 35mm. They will provide a  sweeping view of=
=20
spring color. Remember also that early morning  and late afternoon light=20
intensifies spring hues. Bright  noontime sun is beautiful but will wash ou=
t=20
your photos'' colors  (and cause your subjects to squint). If midday is you=
r=20
only chance  to snap pictures, then try for a bright, cloudy day!=20
=09
=09When photographing  people and animals, it''s best to use low telephoto=
=20
settings, such  as 80mm-120mm. These provide accurate facial and body=20
proportions.  It also helps to keep your camera level with your subject,=20
rather  than pointing downward or upward. If you''re snapping photos of=20
small  children this may mean getting down on their level. The telephoto =
=20
setting will also allow you to be farther away, and less of a distraction  =
to=20
them. After all, the best kid-shots are the spontaneous "un-posed"  ones!=

=09Zoom  Tip #2: Why are my prints blackened  in each of the four corners? =
Does=20
it have something to do with my  zoom lens?[IMAGE]
=09
=09This is called the vignette effect and it''s most commonly  seen in phot=
os=20
taken with a single lens reflex (SLR) camera. It  occurs when you use the=
=20
wrong size lens hood on the front of your  lens while taking a wide-angle=
=20
shot. The camera is actually photographing  the edges of the hood. If you=
=20
look carefully through your SLR viewfinder,  you should be able to see the=
=20
protruding hood before the picture  is taken and correct the problem by=20
either increasing your zoom  magnification or removing the hood. The vignet=
te=20
effect also occurs  when too many filters are stacked onto the front of the=
=20
lens. Simply  remove the unnecessary filter(s) or increase the zoom. If it'=
's=20
too  late and your prints already contain vignette edges, simply ask  your=

=09Zoom  Tip #3: Which  is the better choice, optical or digital zoom?
=09
=09Zoom is one of the great technological marvels of today''s cameras. =20
Virtually every camera and camcorder lens sports some level of zoom =20
capability. But did you know there are two types of zoom? Most of  these=20
products use an optical zoom system, but some use digital  zoom technology.=
=20
So what''s the difference and which is the better  zoom choice?=20
=09
=09
=09As  a general rule, optical zoom produces the clearest, sharpest image =
=20
results. Optical zoom involves true lens element movement when magnifying  =
or=20
widening the subject area. This high quality lens system is found  on=20
traditional point & shoot cameras, SLR lenses, and is a feature  of most=20
digital cameras and camcorders. Although the optical magnification  power=
=20
isn''t as great as with digital zoom, your digital images,  photographic=20
prints, and video footage are sharp, clean, and clear. =20
=09
=09Digital  zoom, on the other hand, uses a system of computerized enhancem=
ent =20
called interpolation to magnify an image. It''s a common feature  in today'=
's=20
camcorders and digital cameras. Digital zoom picks up  where the optical zo=
om=20
leaves off, and allows for much greater magnification.  But the trade-off i=
s=20
in the image quality. Images viewed on a computer  screen aren''t drastical=
ly=20
affected, but printed images and video  footage can suffer a loss of clarit=
y=20
and detail. With camcorders  especially, steadiness becomes an issue: a=20
tripod is a must when  using high digital zoom settings.
=09
=09The  best way to choose a zoom setting is to consider what you wish to  =
do=20
with the image. If you plan to produce prints and enlargements,  or if fine=
=20
detail is a must, then consider using optical zoom only.  If high zoom powe=
r=20
and monitor-viewing are your priorities, then  try the digital zoom feature=
