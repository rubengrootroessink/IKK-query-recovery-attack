Dear E*TRADE Customer:

We have received your new account application and, if all
the information is in good order, your account will be
opened and activated within two business days.  If we have
questions regarding your application we'll call you at the
phone number you provided.

You applied for your account online and pre-selected a User
Name and Password. Here's how to check to see if your
account is activated using your pre-selected User Name and
Password:

1. Click the Log On button of the E*TRADE home page at
   http://www.etrade.com
2. Click on the Log On button in Yellow.
3. Enter your pre-selected User Name and Password.
4. Click on the Account Services tab on the top navigation bar.

If you see a message saying this is a customer-only feature,
then your account has not yet been activated.

If the Account Services section loads, your account is activated and you can 
now access all the customer-only features of the E*TRADE Web site.  Please 
note:  You can start placing trades as soon as your initial deposit clears, 
or assets from a transfer have been received by E*TRADE.  When you place a 
trade, you will be asked for your Trading Password.This is the same password 
as your Log-On Password.

You'll receive a Welcome Kit from us in the mail within
seven business days after we activate your account.  This
package contains important information about your
account - including all your access codes and a handy user's manual, our 
click-by-click guide to online investing.  If you do not receive your Welcome 
Kit within ten business days, please send a customer service e-mail request 
by clicking theCustomer Support support on the home page, or go to:

If your account is not yet activated, you can still use
E*TRADE's Web site to access useful information such as
E*STATION, E*TRADE's 24-hour assistance center.  E*STATION
contains an online Tour that allows you to navigate the site and learn about 
its powerful features, a Learning Center where you can find useful 
information and answers to your investing and account questions, and a 
Service Center where you can send us electronic service requests.  To visit 
E*STATION, click on the Customer Support button on the E*TRADE home page, or
