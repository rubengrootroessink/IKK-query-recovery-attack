David and Heidi,

Hope you enjoyed your Easter holiday and your Anzac holiday!

With respect to your question of whether the financial trader services can =
be=20
charged at cost or must have a 7.5% mark-up, I received advice from Chris=
=20
Catt at PWC-Sydney last summer that there needed to be a mark-up for these=
=20
services.  Given the skills required by the financial trader and the risk=
=20
associated with the transactions, Chris advised that there needed to be a=
=20
mark-up over cost based on a recent ruling by the ATO.

The ATO issued TR 1999/1 in January 1999, which provides a safe-harbor for =
de=20
minimis services that are provided by an Australian company and meet certai=
n=20
monetary limitations.  Under the de miminis safe harbor, where the costs=20
associated with all services provided by Enron Australia Pty Limited to=20
offshore affiliates do not exceed A$500,000 in a year, the safe harbor=20
mark-up of 7.5% may be available.  Paragraph 86 of the ruling sets forth th=
e=20
requirements as follows:

"As mentioned in paragraph 77, the Commissioner will apply a similar=20
administrative practice in de minimis cases where the total direct and=20
indirect costs of supplying services to Australian or foreign associated=20
enterprises, as appropriate, is not more than $500,000 in a year.  The=20
practice applies to all intra-group services supplied or acquired where the=
=20
relevant cost limit is not exceeded.  Therefore, in some cases, it might be=
=20
applicable to all intra-groups services both supplied and acquired.  The=20
transfer prices that must be used, and the conditions for their use, are th=
e=20
same as those specified in paragraphs 82 to 84.  As for the practice in=20
relation to non-core services, all taxpayers in a group must use the same=
=20
mark-up, for incoming and outgoing services, in respect of each foreign=20
jurisdiction, but the mark-up may vary from country to country, within the=
=20
limits described above.

Example

An Australian subsidiary of a foreign based multinational group receives=20
marketing and technical assistance from a foreign associate. No other=20
services are acquired by any Australian member of the group from its foreig=
n=20
associated enterprises.  The total direct and indirect costs of providing t=
he=20
services to the Australian subsidiary for the year are $200,000.  As long a=
s=20
the amount actually charged for the services is not more than $215,000 (or=
=20
$220,000 in the circumstances outlined in paragraph 83), the Commissioner=
=20
would not require the taxpayer to establish an arm=01,s length price for th=
e=20
services."

Based on discussions we had late last summer, we thought that the A$500,000=
=20
threshold could be met.

To my knowledge, the recent changes and proposed changes to the Australian=
=20
tax rules would not affect TR 1999/1.  Please let me know if you have seen=
=20
anything to the contrary.  Consequently, to my knowledge, we are still unde=
r=20
these guidelines.  I=01,m not sure, David, what you mean by 100% being curr=
ent=20
practice as stated in your April 18th e-mail.  I am guessing that you are=
=20
referring to the services provided under the cost sharing agreement.  Under=
=20
that agreement, office costs are being shared by Enron Australia Pty Limite=
d=20
and 3 other Australian entities.  Here, services are being provided to an=
=20
off-shore affiliate.  As a result, it appears that TR 1999/1 would require =
a=20
mark-up.

I will be happy to discuss this with you both at your convenience.

Best regards,
Susan

I've checked my notes and spoken to Heidi and it appears the delay was=20
settling the mark up (107.5%) in the Agreement. Heidi believes that this=20
figure can be reduced to 100% (which is current practice). If everyone is=

agreeable I will arrange execution. =20
