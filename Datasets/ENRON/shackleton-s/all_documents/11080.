Sara, 
I think Guenther may have been involved in this transaction. He is out of the 
office today but back tomorrow and will follow up with you directly. I will 
be in Houston next week so may stop by to say hello.
Regards
Janine

Janine:

First Union National Bank ("FUNB") entered into a credit derivative trade 
with ENA effective 20 April 2001 (our trader was a London trader).  Although 
ENA has a Master ISDA Agreement  with FUNB (the "ISDA"), this does not appear 
to be the impetus for the booking since the confirm didn't reference the ISDA.

Is ENA alright confirming trades in this manner?
