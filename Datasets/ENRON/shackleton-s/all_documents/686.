FYI:  Jeff  I  know  that  you  are  busy,  however  I  have  received  
several  outside  calls  today  (10/13/99)  from  
            a  party  claiming  to  be  with  BP Amoco,  he  requested  deal 
#N16124.1  to  be  faxed  to  (281)366-4934.  The
            party  refuses  to  give  his  name  or  phone  number.  His  
reply  has  been  "If  I  have  to  give  my  name
            and  number  maybe  I  don't  need  your  confirm",  then  he  
hangs  up.  He  has  called  several  times  since
            I  stopped  you  and  Bob  Bowen  earlier.  I  also  suspect  
that  this  same  party  has  been  calling  and  
            hanging  up  without  answering;  and  calling  from  a  
different  outside  line  pretending  to  be  someone  else,
            but  making  the  same  deal  request ,  followed  by  hanging  
up  when  I  ask  for  his  name  and  phone
            number.  I  have  contacted  Susan  Flynn  in  legal  to  
inquire  about  these  calls  or  BP Amoco.  I  was  advised
            not  to  send  any  confirms  out  blindly  and  that  I  was  
handling  it  just  right .  Susan  is  currently  inquiring
            with  the  other  legal  staff  and  attorneys  about  the  
matter.  I  also  was  advised  to  inform  you  to  make  
            other  members  of  our  team  aware  "not  to  send  out  blind  
information  requests" .  The  party  was  calling 
            from  (281)493-0214.  I  will  keep  you  informed.

            Thanks,
            
            Willie
