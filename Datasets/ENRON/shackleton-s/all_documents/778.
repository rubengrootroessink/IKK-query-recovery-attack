Legal Department,

Thanks for sticking with us while we worked through the virus issue.

STEPS WE ARE TAKING TO ELIMINATE VIRUSES:

- Our NT Server Team has dedicated two workstations that continually (24 
hours 7 days a week) scan the legal directory and its subfolders.
- Our application support team actively checks for the latest version of the 
virus scanning software on a moment to moment basis
- Our infrastructure/architecture group has automated the process of keeping 
workstations up to date.

TO DO YOUR PART:

Every night, log out of your machine.  Leave your machine at the "Hit 
Control-Alt-Delete to log on prompt". This will insure that the workstations 
get the most current version of the virus detecting software.

Please contact the help desk if virus issues persist.

I feel confident that the steps we have taken will dramatically reduce the 
number of viruses your department has experienced.

Thanks

Mark Davidson
