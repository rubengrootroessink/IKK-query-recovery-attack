Tax has confirmed that the MG deals should be confirmed in the name of RMT 
(and NOT ENA).  I will have an RMT/MG Ltd. ISDA master put in place.

Joe: (1)   Please confirm the exact name of the MG entity.
          (2)  Please confirm that the first trade date was [6/16/00].

Susan:  Please start the process for a  new ISDA Master to be effective 
[6/16/00].
