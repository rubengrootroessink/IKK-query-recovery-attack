All:

Attached are the two (2) final version GTC's.  The legal terminology is 
identical for each product.  However, Stuart needs to provide a title for 
each product which will also appear in the Paragraph 1.

The former Paragraph 2 has been deleted (it contained the "confirmation 
terms") and the remaining paragraphs renumbered.

Justin:  Will you circulate the revised long description (since your 
conversation with Stuart yesterday afternoon)?  Also, will you let us all 
know when we are competely done?

Please call with comments as soon as possible.
