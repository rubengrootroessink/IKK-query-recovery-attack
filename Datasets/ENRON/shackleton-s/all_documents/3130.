? Hi Thereas, 
We need signed copies for each account, if you do not wish to disclosure.

? . 

Brief Background on the form: 
The Securities & Exchange Commission has adopted? Rule 14b-1(c), effective 
January 1, 1986, which will enable companies, upon request, to ascertain the 
identity of shareholders whose securities are being held for them by 
broker/dealers. 
The purpose of this rule is to improve the communication between a company 
and 
its shareholders. The Rule does provide the customer the right to maintain 
the confidentiality of the account.? The rule requires that UNLESS YOU OBJECT 
IN WRITTING, Morgan Stanley will be required to disclose your name, address, 
and security position(s) to the company. 

Thanks, 
Francis
