Hi Sara 
the counterparty I am interested in getting a line (the ISDA docs) in place 
for is Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. (the swap trading name used by 
Morgan Stanley). The trading centre is New York. I believe Morgan Guaranty is 
the swap trading name used by J P Morgan. We are obviously having some 
confusion over the name "Morgan".
Please advise me of the situation,
thanks,
Aaron.

Madhur and Aaron:  I am waiting for a response from  credit.  
Aaron:  You had me confused because you kept referring to Morgan Stanley who 
we are negotiating with on the equity side.  Who negotiated the 
Enroncredit.com ISDA?
So, this party trades FX and credit?

Sara

Sara,

Do you know where we stand on an ISDA agreement with JP morgan.  We need one 
for Enron North America.

Nicholas:

Henry Steuart asked me to forward to your attention the revised draft ISDA
Schedule which I previously sent to Ms. Flynn. As I mentioned in my last note 
to
Ms. Flynn, the attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should
be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a 
conscious
effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to 
with
other Enron entities.

Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any
questions or comments.

Sincerely yours,
Mike Stolfi
