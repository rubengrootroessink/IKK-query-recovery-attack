Sara,
I spoke with Ellen Su on the trading desk.  As discussed previously, we would 
like fed funds rate.   Also, Ellen suggested that we get the same rate 
reference on the Debit side as the Credit side (e.g. J.P. Morgan Overnight 
Borrowing Rate???? is noted on the Debit side)
I am sending to Shane for him to review the market rates for the other 
currencies.
Ellen said that Canadian should be Canandian Overnight Deposit Rate (CDOR).
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila:  Regarding the JP Morgan ("JP") Futures Agreement, please see the 
attached for debit and credit rates which JP charges its customers.  I asked 
for (1) agreed to overnight rate for debit rate and (2) Fed Funds for 
interest rate.  Please let me know if you are agreeable to the attached 
rates.  SS
