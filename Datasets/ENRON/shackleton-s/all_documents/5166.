Sara,

My understanding is that Legal has not provided feedback regarding the issue 
of notice in connection with online trading sites.    As noted in my email 
below related to the Buy Side Direct agreement:  

Section 12 of the attached Subscriber Agreement appears to specify who will 
receive notice only in the case of default by Enron.  How will legal and / or 
trading receive other notices - i,e, changes to the agreement ?

This issue has been outstanding for months.   When will Legal provide 
feedback on this issue ?

Thanks.

Am I correct in assuming that Sara decided what she would like proposed in 
terms of "notice" procedures for online trading platforms ?  Section 12 of 
the attached Subscriber Agreement appears to specify who will receive notice 
only in the case of default by Enron.  How will legal and / or trading 
receive other notices - i,e, changes to the agreement ?

Thanks.
