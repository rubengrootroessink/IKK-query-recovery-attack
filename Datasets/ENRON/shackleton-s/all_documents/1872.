We are terminating the only outstanding transaction and the cp is no longer 
ACE USA - its Inac something or other.  Shari has been actively pursuing this 
(Sara must not be aware of it) and she has indicated to me that she will keep 
this negotiation.  It is not a high priority.

I guess Shari will be punting this counterparty now that she has left the 
group.  Sara indicated that as of now, nothing is happening with this 
counterparty on legal's part.  Should Sara or Carol take up an active 
position on this c/p?
