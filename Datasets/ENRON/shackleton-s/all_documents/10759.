I will be happy to contribute my share.  As I mentioned earlier, in the event 
someone does not want to contribute, I will be happy to absorb that cost 
also.  Please let me know when you have received confirmation of who will and 
will not contribute and I will drop by to pay you.

I ordered a $75 flower arrangement for Kaye to be delivered today and signed 
all of our names.  Sorry for not checking with each of you individually 
beforehand.  If you would like to contribute, the cost will be $18.75 each.  
I'll absorb delivery.  Thanks.
