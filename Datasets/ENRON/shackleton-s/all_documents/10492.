Cheryl,

Could we also get copies of the executed prime broker agreements (at least 
Bear).  London would like to take a look the agreements.

Thanks,

Tom

Cheryl:

Can you please forward a copy of the ECI resolution(s) (or consent) which was 
used to establish the Bear account and Securites Loan Agreement?  We need to 
determine all products authorized for ECI trading.  Also, copies of Enron 
Credit Limited authorizations would be useful.  Thanks for your help.
