I have a call into the compliance officer who supposedly sent the docs.

*At the request of Michael Schneider I have attached a .zip file containing 
the
documentation we require in order for Enron NA Corp to open listed options
accounts with JP Morgan Securities Inc.  Please review the instructions,
complete the necessary docs and feel free to contact me with any questions
(212/648-4315).

Exchange Traded Options Account Agreement and related documentation is 
attached
below.  In addition to signing the Agreement, you should make sure to read all
disclosure statements as well as sign and date the Options New Account Form.
Also, you should note that in order to have the authority to transfer funds
between or among any accounts which may exist in other areas of J.P. Morgan 
you
must actively acknowledge the "Authorization to Transfer Funds" form attached.
Further, just as with the JPMFI account, we're going to need you to completely
fill out the JPMSI Letter In Lieu attached.
(See attached file: Enron NA Corp OCC Documents.ZIP)
Again, if you have any questions please phone me.

Regards,
Tom Alterson

Sara:

I have tried to fax you the cover and signature page from our Client
Agreement 3
times now and the fax is not going through.  I am sending to fax #
713-646-3490.
Please advise if there is another number I cna fax this too.

In addition, I have been instructed by our compliance people to send you
back
the original copies of the Client Agreement so that a duly authorized
representative of Enron can sign off on Section 24.(b).  The Agreement has
been
sent to you.  Please have the correct boxes checked, initialed and then
sent
back to us for execution by JPMFI.  We will turn them around in one day.

Attached below is a copy of the cover and sig page (fax copy) in .pdf
format.

(See attached file: Enron cov+sig.pdf)

If you have any questions please call me at 212-646-4315.

Thank you,
Tom Alterson
