Sara,

The document attached below titled "114conf.doc", does not pertain to Vitro, 
I think it was attached by accident.
Can you resend us the appropriate documents please. 
Thanks,

 Rod - Please review the attached documents and advise Sara if acceptable 
from a credit standpoint.   

 Souad -  Once Sara and Rod say docs are Ok, you can dup them out for the 11 
subs.  Show Sara all docs before you send them to CP.

 Sara - there is a Guarantor for Vidriera Mexico, S.A. de C.V.   The 
Guarantor is --Vitro Envases Norte America, S.A. de C.V.   Rod wants it to be 
an unlimited Guaranty on our form of CP GTY.   I am sending the form of GTY 
to Eduardo Melo by fax tonight at fax number 011-528-378-4793.  You will need 
to prepare a  form of sub deemed ISDA for this sub to include the GTY.
