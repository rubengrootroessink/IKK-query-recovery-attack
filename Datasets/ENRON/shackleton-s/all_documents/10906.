Please make sure that they know that in addition to the signed confirms, we 
need the legal opinion.  I'm in meetings after 2 today so try to catch me 
before then.

Brent/ Carol- before you go to your conference:

Brent- can you please send out the doc to SAC- checking on the manager (its 
just the one fund) but please just leave blank for now.
Carol- AIG funds.. I am getting the confirm back..their lawyer has a 
question.. we will call you with him today.  Hope to get the ISDAs out to 
them too.
