RE:
Revised Policy / Exchange Provided Order Tickets


Please be advised that at this time NYMEX will continue to provide order 
tickets to the COMEX division members.  The Exchange will not guarantee 
inventory on form types (futures/options, 3-part/4-part); it will only 
guarantee a supply of order tickets.  As the current inventory is depleted it 
is permissible to interchange remaining forms in stock.  There are no 
restrictions concerning the recordation of option orders on future order 
tickets or future orders being recorded on option order tickets; provided all 
relevant order information is recorded.  Should the current inventory become 
totally depleted, the Exchange will only provide a 3-part generic order 
ticket (no 4-part tickets and no future/option specific tickets will be 
provided).

The Exchange will provide adequate notice regarding the discontinuance of 
providing order tickets, so that members and firms currently using these 
order tickets have sufficient time to purchase their own.

Should you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at 
(212) 299-2072.
