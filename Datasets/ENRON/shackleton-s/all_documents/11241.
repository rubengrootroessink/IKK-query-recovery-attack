Hi Sara, I wanted to let you know that I made calls re: these files we 
previosly discussed:

Cross Timbers & Ocean Energy- Jay will call me next week when Fred gets back 
from out of town.

Quebicor - left messages for Ken.

Russell Metals - Carol will get back to me.

Camden -- figuring it out with Aparna.

* I did not call any one on Clorox because I noted that I should call a 
"Gerald Sypro" and could not find such a person in people finder -- but will 
figure this out.  

Montana Power -- I will call Tanya today or Tuesday.
