Brent called this morning and has corrected me on this issue. The scenario 
provided by the FX Desk that I discussed in my previous e-mail is where Enron 
in the UK offers products to external counterparties. The present online FX 
scenario is not the case; we are offering the Product internally, so the 
Enron trading entity would be Risk Management and Trading Corp. "RMT" (as 
seen in the Product Long Description sent earlier).

So, in your consideration today, please amend my previous explanation by 
replacing reference to ENA with RMT, and consider any service agreement or 
tax issues that may occur as a result of this amendment.

My apologies for any confusion this may have caused.

Dale
