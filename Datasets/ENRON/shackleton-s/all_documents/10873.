Sara,
We spoke with Greg Whiting.  We will not open a futures account for ECT 
Investments Inc.  We will only need one account for Enron North America.  We 
will internally take care of the allocation to the business.  This avoids 
having separate margin balance maintenace.

For products:
 Equity: S&P 500, dow and Nasdaq futures
 Fixed Income Futures and Options: 
  Treasuries, euro dollar, bunds, gilts, libor, fed funds, bax, cad 10 yr, 
london short sterling, euribor
  ECU - 3 month, TSE JGB, EuroYen, etc.

Thanks, Sheila

Cassandra, Cheryl and David,
Gary requested this morning that we add Goldman Sach's Futures Clearing 
capability as well.  I will request  account opening information from them 
and forward to legal.

Cassandra, Cheryl and David,

Gary has requested that we establish new futures execution and clearing 
agreements with Solomon Smith Barney/Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.  I will 
forward the agreements when we receive them to Cheryl Nelson in Legal for 
review.

Prudential is exiting the business and the prior people at Pru have moved to 
SSB.  

Please do not hesitate to call, 3-3210,  if you have any questions.
Sheila
