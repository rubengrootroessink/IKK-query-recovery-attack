It looks like we should be able to work our schedule out, especially if you 
spend one day in BA and the rest of the time in SP.

Brent: Jos, Emilio will be available on the week of August 16. I may have a 
conflict because Brian Swinford is going to be in BA this week and I will 
have to arrange some meetings with outside counsel on the CIESA matter and 
fly over to BA myself for a couple of days. Please let me know when you and 
Sara are planning to be in S?o Paulo so we can organize the schedule. I have 
already sent Brian an e-mail asking him to do the same so we can work the 
logistics. Tks. AB
