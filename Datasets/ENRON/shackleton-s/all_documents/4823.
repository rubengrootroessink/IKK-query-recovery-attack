Thanks for reminding us of their policy regarding erroneous trades.  I copied 
you on an email to their sales rep suggesting that this change.   While we 
are likely to trade less actively (and more carefully) if we are dependent on 
the other counterparty to break erroneous trades, we would still like to 
begin using this site.

Therefore, please proceed with your plans to conclude legal discussions.

Thanks.

Mike

I will be reaquainting myself with the Agreement today and Friday.
Please confirm with me that the traders are ok with Trading Edge's
clearly erroneous trade policy - that is that Trading Edge will notify
an advantaged party but will not cancel a trade unless the other side
agrees.

Thanks,

Jason

Jason,

Could you resume discussions with Trading Edge rather than continuing to
wait for resolution of the consequential damage issue, which has been
outstanding for two months ?

Thanks.
