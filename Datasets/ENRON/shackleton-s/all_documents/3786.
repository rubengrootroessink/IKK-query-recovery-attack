Hi John!

Guess where I am again.  I am going to give you a call shortly about the 
attached.  (It's 12:38 a.m. in New York right now and I'm researching on 
Lexis.)  It looks like we're trying to sign next week.  

If I don't catch you, what's the timing on this?  Can I review it this 
weekend?

Best regards,
Susan

Susan/Alan/Sara

As you will note below, Darren, Jane and I met with B&M to discuss the 
potential tax issues related to Darren's activities in Japan.

The going forward strategy will be tax driven, therefore we will need to have 
Susan's input/suggestions.  If we may be of further assistance, please let us 
know.

Cheers,

John

Dear Susan

Jane and John asked us to send you the attached notes on a discussion we had
today concerning ENA's financial trader in Tokyo.  You may also wish to refer 
to
Ed's original June 23 advice on the subject.

We look forward to assisting with the structuring of the arrangements in due
course.

Regards

Paul Davis
