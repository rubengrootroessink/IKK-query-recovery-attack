Sara: The second FPL entity is "FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc."  It is
the FPL entity that handles all trades for the non-regulated business
units of FPL.    We completed the ISDA agreements between Florida Power
& Light Co. (the regulated utility) and ENA in early January and I then
sent you on January 9th a red-line of the FPL Energy Power Marketing
Inc./ENA drafts vs. the final executed Florida Power & Light Co./ENA
agreements for ease of review, since the agreements were near twins
though you may also recall that we had added a guaranty of FPL Group
Capital Inc  (FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc. debt is unrated, FPL Group
Capital Inc debt is single A).  I appreciate you assistance in helping
to move this along.  Regards, -Serge

Serge:

Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:

(1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring
about?
Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?

(2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to
set
up a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit
goup to react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.
