Sara,

Did you have a chance to review the 2000 definitions?  Are we o.k. to send 
NatWest their confirms back ( 2 IR swaps)?

Also, you may have given me an answer on this already, so I apologize if you 
have--did you look at the National  Australia Bank IR swap confirm?  I will 
be on Vacation all next week, and I want to make sure that my desk is as 
clean as possible.  

Thank you for your help!!
