John,
Attached is a termsheet and execution summary for the ENE swap entered into
today.  If we dont get to 1mm shares by Friday we are happy to tranche the
swap based on the number of shares executed at that time.  Please give me a
call if you have any questions or comments.  We will give you a call in the
morning to discuss if you would like us to continue our hedging activity.
Thank you.
