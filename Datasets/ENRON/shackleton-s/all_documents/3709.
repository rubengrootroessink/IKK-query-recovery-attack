Hi Stuart & Laurel,

Enron metals buys 700 million yen 2-dec-00 @ 104.35
Enron metals sells 1.6 billion yen 13-sept-2004 @ 84.70

Enron Metals trader is Roger-Murray Evans. Please confirm counterparty name 
with credit, Laurel.

On the other side,

Enron sell to goldman sachs 900 million yen 13-sept-2004 @84.57
-goldman trader is Jennifer Moyer

Enron buys from UBS London  700 million yen 20-dec-2000 @ 104.35

81-3-5208-7695

Laurel, I apologize but it is probably a better idea if Dart or someone from 
your area enter trades into infinity until I am completely sure  that my 
updates are saved over terminal server. This will be my priority tomorrow. I 
will fax confirm tickets to 713-646-3740

The 15-20 thousand p&l should get booked under Enron Global Markets Japan 
{ask Gary about entity booking}

Take care & thanks,
Darren
