Clint/Sara-

I read the UBS & CSFB confirmations to find any material differences that 
would give one party preferential treatment over the other and came up with 
the following differences:

Settlement Notice:  CSFB 15 days
   UBS 10 days

Most Favored Nation's Clause:  UBS has this incorporated in confirm
    CSFB no mention of clause

Sara-I would appreciate it if you can do a quick review of the confirms in a 
case I left something out.
