Susan,

I received your interoffice mail regarding an ISDA Master Agreement between 
ENA and Southern Ute Indian Tribe, and have the following comments:

1.  Is the Tribe's official name Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern 
Ute Reservation, Colorado?

 Response:   I don't know.  John Suttle of our Credit Department gave us the 
name as it appears on the draft agreement.  I'll have to check with the 
Counterparty.   

2.  What are the payment terms of the Agreement (i.e., how will payments by 
ENA and the Tribe be determined)?

 Response:   Please listen to  the voice mail message Sara Shackleton left 
for you.  If you have any other questions re: payments, please call Sara at 
3-5620.    

2.  I'd like to visit briefly with our outside counsel at Modrall, Sperling 
regarding the language that they proposed in Part 2(b)(ii) of the Schedule to 
the Master Agreement.  Can you provide me with a contact name and number?

 Response:   Contact is William Scott,  phone - (505) 848-1800, fax - (505) 
848-1889.

3.  I suggest that "None" in Part 3 of the Schedule to the Master Agreement 
be changed to "IRS Form W-9."

 Response:   OK

Please call me at ext. 35777 to discuss.

Best regards,

Jeff
