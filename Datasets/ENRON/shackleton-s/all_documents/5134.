Sara and Jeff:

Attached is the term sheet for the slightly different Mahonia structure.

Question for Sara:  With this structure, do we have any CFTC issues if we're 
buying gas from Chase?  

We may have tax or accounting issues if we buy from Chase, so we may buy from 
Stoneville (also a Jersey Is. co.) instead.  Jeff:  Do you know that entity?  
Joe said we did several of the old deals purchasing from them under a GISB 
PSA.   We should know in the next day or so.  I'll let you know.  Will you be 
working on this?

Can you take a look at the term sheet below. This was the concept of 
"participation" in a gas contract as envisioned by Milbank. We may be moving 
away from this concept towards what I suggested last night and perhaps a bit 
further than that as well but wanted to get a legal view on this 
participation concept.
