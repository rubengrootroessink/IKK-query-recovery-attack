Here is a draft forward confirm from Lehman.  It should incorporate the 
registration rights language we want as well as the most recent accounting 
language that is needed.  Please review and give me your comments.  If we are 
happy with this, then we should move forward with an ISDA with these guys.  
Thanks in advance for your comments.
