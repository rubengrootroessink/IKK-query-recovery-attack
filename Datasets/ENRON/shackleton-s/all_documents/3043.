  Katheline,

Attached for your review, please find a blacklined copy of the 
above-referenced Agreement marked to show changes to the draft you previously 
provided to us.   Should you have any comments or questions, please call me 
at 713-220-4124.  Please note that I will be out of town from August 24 
through Labor Day.  Hopefully, we can finalize the Agreement prior to August 
24.

Thanks,

Jason
