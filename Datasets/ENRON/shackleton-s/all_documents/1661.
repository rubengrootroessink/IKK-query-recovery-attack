Damian -

Actually we will need a set of agreements for both entities:

Enron North America Corp.
and
ECT Investments, Inc.

as both do equity trading. I have doublechecked and we did agreements for
both entities when negotiating the US - GS & Co. documents.

With regard to the signature page, can you just duplicate it and make one
for Enron North America Corp.?

Please call if you have any questions (713-853-9477). Thanks!

Shari
