February 21-23, 2001

There are a lot of conferences out there that claim to address issues that 
are critical to online markets.  This is the conference that delivers on that 
claim.

This is the conference that will educate you about how offline market 
fundamentals apply to your online market.  This is the conference that will 
answer your regulatory questions.  This is the conference that introduces you 
to real liquidity providers.  This is the conference that breaks down the 
lifecycle of a trade to find out what is working and why.  This is the only 
conference presented by a non-profit association that is working to help 
establish the industry.
