Please disregard the confirm attached below. Per ongoing conversations, they 
now want for us to create a confirm that allows them to add or delete shares 
at any time without having to create a new confirm for any new trade. They 
expect the volume of trades will increase in the near future. I will revise 
the confirmation to include language to ths effect for your review. I will 
send it to you shortly. I would like to meet with you along with Aneela 
Charania, who is the transaction, to ensure  the confirm captures what is 
intended. Once you receive the revised confirm I will call Kaye to schedule a 
meeting with you.

Thanks for your patience.

Jorge

Good Morning Sara,

Thank you again for reviewing the Equity Swap ISDA Confirmation the other 
day. They now want to capture the trades in question as a basket equity swap. 
I have modified the confirmation to accommodate the basket and included Annex 
I. Please review and advise if any changes should be made. 

Thanks!
