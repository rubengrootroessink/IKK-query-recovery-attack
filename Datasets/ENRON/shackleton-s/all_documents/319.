In January this year, EHMC was established as an internal collaborative 
effort of Enron International-Renewable Energy, Enron Engineering & 
Construction Company, and Portland General Operations.  The business 
objective was to establish Enron as a leading supplier of hydroelectric 
modernization/upgrade services to dam owners, developing and executing 
construction projects, and taking payment in new power, or other commodities.

With the recent corporate-wide reorganization, EHMC will now function as a 
collaborative effort between EE&CC and PGO.   Its business objective will 
continue to be the support of all Enron Business Regions in the development 
and execution of these specialized, high-value projects around the world.

Rick Whitaker (X68660), who will report in through EECC,  will continue to 
lead this effort .
