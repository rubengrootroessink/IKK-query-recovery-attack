All -
I received a fax from Lehman yesterday with a form of forward confirmation 
that they believe meets 007 and 0019 requirements.  This isn't for any trade 
that we've done with them, but just an example of something that they think 
works.  I will send copies of this to each of you.  Please review this and 
let me know your thoughts.
