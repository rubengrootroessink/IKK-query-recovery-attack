Larry,
I just left you a voice mail message.....  

ECT Investments, Inc. has been trying to get an executing broker agreement in 
place with Frost Securities.  Our legal department has not been getting much 
cooperation.  I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this situation 
on your end.

Our SR. counsel, Sara Shackleton, 713-853-5620, has been the person who 
fowarded our comments to Frost Securities and has now been told that all our 
comments have been rejected absolutely.

Please advise.
Sheila
