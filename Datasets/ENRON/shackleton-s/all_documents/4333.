I have confirmed with Shane & Jurgen in London and William Stuart here in 
Houston (Traders) that this FX Trade was done with Merrill Lynch 
International Bank and NOT Merrill Lynch Capital Services Inc.. I have a call 
in to Liz Fernandez with Merrill. I will follow up with Merrill's response.

Hope you are having a fabulous day!

Regards,

Jorge
