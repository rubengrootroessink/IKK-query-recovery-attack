Sara,

As discussed, ECC hopes to transact with ATCO over the next week or so if we 
can agree on pricing.  This is the form of agreement they propose.  It 
represents 
the way their 3-way JV owned plant will sell power offtake to marketers such 
as Enron.  I would be interested in your opinion especially if we are close 
to 
commercial agreement.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Duncan Croasdale
