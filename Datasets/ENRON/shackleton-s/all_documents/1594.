Sara,

Are you going to be handling the opening of a bond custody account?  Shari 
had reviewed a bunch of paperwork related to opening one at Bank of New York, 
and Carol St. Clair had done some work on opening one with Chase Tx.  Are you 
at all familiar with either of these.  I think we are meeting at 4pm at 
Sheila's desk to discuss these agreements, although based on your email, I am 
guessing you won't be able to come down....
