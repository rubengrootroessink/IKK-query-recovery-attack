Dear Sara,

If you haven=01,t already done so, your deadline to open and fund your IRA =
for=20
2000 is just a few weeks away!  If you haven=01,t made plans for your 2001 =
IRA,=20
now is also a great time to consider opening a monthly ShareBuilder No Fee=
=20
IRA so that it funds automatically from now on.

SET UP AN IRA TODAY
You can open a  No Fee IRA entirely online at =20
http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/account/index.asp and build your=
=20
portfolio by making automatic, recurring dollar-based investments. =20
Importantly, ShareBuilder IRAs have no account or investment minimums, and =
no=20
annual fees!  Simply set up a monthly plan that fits your budget.

Even if you already have an IRA, you should consider opening a supplemental=
=20
ShareBuilder IRA because of the unique monthly investing feature.  The beau=
ty=20
of our automatic funding method is that unlike your current IRA, it lets yo=
u=20
program $166 each month to be automatically deducted from your checking=20
account or payroll, giving you the ability to continuously invest throughou=
t=20
the year.  You=01,ll be dollar-cost averaging, so the annual IRA rush will =
be=20
one less thing for you to worry about at tax time.

For most people, an IRA is one of the smartest ways to save for their=20
retirement.  But not everyone has $2,000 to invest in one lump sum prior to=
=20
the tax-filing deadline.  This is the only No Fee IRA that lets you=20
automatically build a retirement portfolio made up of individual stocks at=
=20
$166 a month.  Go to =20
http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/account/index.asp to open an Accou=
nt.

RETIREMENT PLANNING IS EASY
While we offer several choices, most of our customers are using the Roth IR=
A=20
alternative.  You can visit the ShareBuilder Investor Education Center to=
=20
learn the difference between a Traditional and Roth IRA, as well as get som=
e=20
tips on to how to diversify your portfolio.  We can help you determine how=
=20
much you=01,ll really need to invest for a comfortable retirement and how t=
o=20
estimate your retirement expenses.  The sooner you get started, the sooner=
=20
your money can start working for you!  Visit =20
http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/research/investor_ed/articles/inde=
x.a
sp?topic=3D2 to start planning your future.

There are only about four weeks left for your 2000 IRA, so if you haven=01,=
t=20
done it yet, open an account this week.

Best regards,

Jeff Seely
President and CEO
