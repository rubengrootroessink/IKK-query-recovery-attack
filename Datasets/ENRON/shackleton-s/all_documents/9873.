>  Sara/Janice, thanks for your comments.  I have reflected them in the 
attached draft, marked to show your changes.  The governing law provision is 
a formulation that we have used at S&C to accomplish the purpose of giving 
effect to NY-GOL 5-1401 and should achieve the purpose of the language you 
added to the power master amendment; I was planning to conform the latter to 
the language used here unless you have an objection.
>
>  Allegheny has not yet reviewed this draft so it remains subject to their 
comment.  I also need Yair to confirm that he is happy with the new Part 6 - 
Commodity Definitions section (Yair, this is attached as Exhibit "C" to the 
attached document).

>  Let me know if you have any further questions or comments.  Thanks!
