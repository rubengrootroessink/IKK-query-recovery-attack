Fede-

I am reviewing this counterparty's financial statements and will advise.  We 
also need to run a credit reserve for this transaction you have outlined

Pat,

EDEN is a power LDC, owned mainly by AES. We have basically offered them a
financial product that works as described below:
Attached is a one page description of the structure.

(See attached file: Structure.ppt)

Terms and Conditions of the agreement:
Volume: 20MW x 7 days a week x 24 hours a day
Term: 3 years, 1999
Start Date: August 1st.
Index: Simple hourly average Monomic at Ezeiza
Structure: "Collar" (Enron sells and EDEN buys):
- Cap: @$20.15/MWh
- 1st year, floor: @$18.14/MWh
- 2nd year, floor: @18.05/MWh
- 3rd year, floor: @17.96/MWh
Zero-cost call option (Cap) for Enron:  @$22.16/Mwh.  (Enron buys and EDEN 
sells).

Example:
When Index is between $22.16 and $20.15, Enron pays to Eden. If Index is 
above $22.16, Enron keeps on paying $2.01 (Difference between $22.16 and 
$20.15).
When Index is between $20.15 and the floor (different every year), no 
payments are involved.
When Index is below the floor price, Eden pays to Enron whatever Index minus 
Floor is.

Pending issues:
Credit approval
Master Swap Agreement in place
Finalise negotiations. There is a high probability of this deal happening. 
Timing for closing is close to 10 days.

If you have any questions, let  me know.

Rolo
