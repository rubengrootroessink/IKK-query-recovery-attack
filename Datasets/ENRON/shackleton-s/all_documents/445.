Attached is the E-Mail from Sean we discussed, wherein he identifies the 
documents sent to Catalytica. I received an E-Mail from Sean yesterday 
indicating that Catalytica had approved the transaction outlined in the 
documents in principle, and requesting I prepare definitive agreements for 
Catalytica's review. I'll forward the draft agreement as soon as it is 
prepared. FYI, the terms of the Catalytica agreement may change depending on 
negotiations with GE under the proposed ENA/GE agreement, which is continuing 
to be negotiated. Thanks for your assistance.

Attached FYI is a copy of the Agreement that was sent to Catalytica for 
review, along with the Spark Spread Option Confirmation.  For sake of 
clarification, both documents sent out are attached below.



I think that the MOU document no longer needs the Attachment 1; I believe the 
reference now needs to be to the Confirm Sheet but this other issues can be 
sorted out accordingly.

Regards,
