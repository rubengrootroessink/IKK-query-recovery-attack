Sara  I   have  informed  BP  Amoco.  I  spoke  to  Bill ,  a  VP  who  
informed  that  the  telephone  number  that  the
   person  that  called  me  is  not  a  BP  Amoco  line,  however  the  fax  
number  is  a  one  that  is  in their  trading  room.
   I  was  also  told  that  Michelle Reasor  is  the  trader  and  would  
have  been  the  one  making  any  inquiry  requests
   of  us.  He  investigating.  He  highly  complemented  us  on  our  
security  measures.  Thanks,  Willie
