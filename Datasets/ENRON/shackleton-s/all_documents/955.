David,

Per the discussion, we are going to adjust the Determination Periods and 
Floating Price also.
I thought we were going to discuss this one in the meeting today.  We'll try 
to standardize all of our language a bit and that might have some effect on 
this deal.

Joe

I've updated the Aquila confirmation as we discussed last night.

Please let me know if you agree with these changes and/or have additional 
modifications.

Thanks, Dave
