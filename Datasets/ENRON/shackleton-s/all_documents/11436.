Dear Sara,

I refer to our conversation this afternoon.  I confirm that my colleague,
Maryline Labiche, has spoken to Christene McAdams at Carr Futures in Illinois
and will liaise with her regarding issue and execution of the required give-up
agreement.

We have also agreed that the Give-Up will be subject to the laws of New York.

If you have any questions regarding the documentation please feel free to call
either myself (+44 207 325 3619) or Maryline Labiche (+44 207 325 0434).


Regards

David Thompson
