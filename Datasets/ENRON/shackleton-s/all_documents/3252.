Corporation (Helsinki Stock Exchange: UPM1V; NYSE:UPM) and Repap Enterprise=
s=20
Inc. (TSE:RPP) today announced that they have signed an acquisition agreeme=
nt=20
under which UPM-Kymmene will acquire Repap in a transaction to be effected =

way of an amalgamation. Pursuant to the agreement, Repap=01,s shareholders =

The Toronto Stock Exchange. The transaction values Repap=01,s equity at=20
approximately CAD 160 million (EUR 120 million), implying a total enterpris=
e=20

=20
such securities after consummation of the transaction and/or leaving such=
