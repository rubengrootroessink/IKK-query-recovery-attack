Amy:

The timing of this issue is perfect!  I've been working with Sara Shackleto=
n=20
this week to hammer down a number of issues relating to financial power and=
=20
the related indices.  We have revised the index language for PJM, NE ISO an=
d=20
NYISO, and I will provide the revised language to you and Melissa in the ne=
xt=20
couple of days.  The revised language for the PJM index is set out below:

The average of the hourly prices as published by PJM Interconnection, LLC=
=20
(=01&PJM=018) on PJM=01,s official web site currently located at=20
ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, und=
er=20
the headings =01&PJM =01) Locational Marginal Pricing Files; Western Hub=01=
8 for=20
electricity delivered during On-Peak Hours during the applicable=20
Determination Period.=20

Let your contact at Edison Mission know that we are correcting all PJM inde=
x=20
language per the above  and make sure she doesn't have any objections.  Let=
=20
me know if she does object to the language. =20

On Monday or Tuesday, I'm going to get you and Melissa all of the final=20
indices, as well as some additional provisions to add to all index deals. =
=20
After I get you the new language, I would like to correct all confirmations=
=20
for deals yet to flow to replace the old index language with the revised=20
language and to add the new riders.
