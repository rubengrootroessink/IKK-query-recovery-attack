Ed,

Please review the below language for "threshold" and "credit rating".  The=
=20
main question we have is if a rating is required from both S&P and Moody's.=
 =20
The threshold language reads such that if a party fails to have a credit=20
rating from either entity, then the threshold will be zero.  Is this your=
=20
intention or does a rating from only one agency suffice?

(B)  =01&Threshold=018 means, with respect to Party A (a) the amount set fo=
rth=20
opposite the lowest Credit Rating for Party A=01,s Credit Support Provider =

the relevant date of determination; or (b) zero if on the relevant date of=
