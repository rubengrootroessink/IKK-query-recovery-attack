Subject: EOL FX transactions

Janine:  Thank you for scheduling the meeting last week.  Let me know if I 
can be of any help whatsoever.  Also, whatever flowcharts or schematics you 
can offer would greatly appreciated, as well as a list of services agreements.

Dale Neuner is anxious to resolve the issues surrounding FX transactions on 
EOL.  Have you concluded that we need RMT as the EOL party for internal 
hedging FX products for London and Japan.  Am I correct in the following?

RMT will be the party transacting directly with international Enron 
affiliates (i.e., ECTRIC, through EEFT, and Enron Japan) under new/existing 
services agreements. 
ENA will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties.  
Does ENA also act directly with non-affiliated Japanese customers (if the 
situation should arise?)

Thanks.  Sara
