Bob and Joe Jure are happy with the language in the KPM Lasara draft. Once 
you have modified it to fit the Medie News I will have Bob give his final 
approval. If you have any questions with regards to the project itself talk 
to Dick T. Robinson, Joe Jure, or Robert Pratel and reference the Kafus 
project.

Thanks,
Jarrod
