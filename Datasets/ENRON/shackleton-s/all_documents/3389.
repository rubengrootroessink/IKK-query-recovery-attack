I gather John would like this taken care of straight away.  Could you please 
keep me posted on the progress?  Thank you.

Laurel,

Please take care of this for us.  It is a contract to have an Instinet 
terminal installed on my desktop here in London.

Thanks and regards,
John

Good afternoon John.

Attached is a suggested draft letter.  As it is from a US company to another 
US
company, you may want to Americanise the salutations/layout etc !!

(See attached file: Enron- London terminal.doc)

As soon as I receive the signed version back form you, we can move ahead with
the installation process.

Kind regards.
Mark
