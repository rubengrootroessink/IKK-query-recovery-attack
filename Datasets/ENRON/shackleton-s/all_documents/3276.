Dear SARAH:

How would you spend a $20,000 E*TRADE brokerage account?

Perhaps you would explore new investment opportunities, or take an
exotic vacation, or start your kid's college savings fund.  The
possibilities are limitless...but the deadline for entry is midnight,
November 29, 2000.

It takes less than a minute to enter, at
http://e-trade.0mm.com/ETR071011+C
