Please be advised that beginning on Friday, February 16, 2001, the Exchange=
=20
will offer a new end of week trading session. The new program applies only =
to=20
the NYMEX Division and does not affect COMEX=01,s existing post-settlement=
=20
session.

This new End of Week Session is being offered only for the crude oil, heati=
ng=20
oil, unleaded gasoline and natural gas futures contracts.  It is not=20
available for options contracts in these commodities.  In addition, the End=
=20
of Week Session is not available for NYMEX Division metals contracts nor wi=
ll=20
it be offered for the Exchange=01,s propane futures contract.

Specifically, the new program provides for a special trading session (the=
=20
"End of Week Session") to be offered on certain days after the close as a=
=20
substitute on such days for the NYMEX Division post-close trading session. =
=20
This End of Week Session will be offered on Fridays and additionally on the=
=20
day before any mid-week Exchange holiday, e.g., Thanksgiving.

This End of Week Session shall be offered (20) minutes after the close of=
=20
trading in all futures contracts and shall be ten minutes in duration.  Thu=
s,=20
on most Fridays, the End of Week Session will be offered from 3:30 to 3:40=
=20
p.m.  However, because next Friday is the Friday before an Exchange holiday=
=20
(President=01,s Day), early closing hours shall be in effect.

Therefore, for this reason, the End of Week Session to be offered next Frid=
ay=20
on February 16 shall be commence at 1:20 p.m. and shall continue until 1:30=
=20
p.m. On the following Friday, the End of Week Session shall be offered at t=
he=20
3:30-3:40 time slot.

The new End of Week Session is both similar to and different from the prese=
nt=20
post-close trading session.  Like the current post-close session, the End o=
f=20
Week Session is limited to the first four listed contract months.  Also, li=
ke=20
the current post-close session, trading transacted during the new End of We=
ek=20
Session shall not be included in the calculation of settlement prices.

Unlike the current post-close session, the trading range for the new End of=
=20
Week Session shall be the trading range for the entire day.  The more=20
expansive trading range should provide a better opportunity for unfilled=20
orders to be executed and for market participants to get flat in the market=
=20
for that trading session.

Also, unlike the current post-close session, there shall be no restrictions=
=20
on participation in the new End of Week Session.  However, only orders=20
submitted after regular trading hours may be executed in the End of Week=20
Session.

  If you have any questions concerning the new End of Week trading session,=
=20
please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at=
=20
(212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor=20
Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General=20
Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.
