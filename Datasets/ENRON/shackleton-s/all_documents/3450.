Steve is absolutely correct -- all intercompany swap transactions between ENA 
and Enron Corp. affiliates should be confirmed directly by RMT.

Hopefully, none of these transactions have been "booked" for ENA by a trader 
located in a foreign country.  That said, the general rule is that 
intra-company transactions are generally booked directly to RMT rather than 
to ENA and then back to RMT.  I have cc'd Rhett Jackson on my reply so that 
he can confirm this since Rhett has become the "keeper" of the RMT technology 
for our group.  Sorry for the delay in responding.  Steve.

The following Enron companies have recently booked financial trades with 
ENA.  I think these should be booked directly with RMT.  Please advise.

Enron Netherlands Holding BV

Enron Development Funding Ltd.

EnronCredit.com Limited


Thanks for your help.  Sara
