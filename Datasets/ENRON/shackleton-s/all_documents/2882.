See below.  I will keep an eye out for availability of the electronic format 
of ISDA.  I thought it would be helpful to new attorneys in working through 
the various definitions and use within the docs.  Mary

Dear Ms. Cook;
Thank you for your inquiry into ISDA documentation.  ISDA is in the process
of making its documentation available electronically.  We hope to have this
project completed by the end of the year.  Please continue to check our web
site for an announcement of its release.

Regards
Corrinne Greasley

Can I obtain by electronic email the ISDA Credit Support Annex 1994 (New
York Law) and the ISDA Master Agreement 1992 Multicurrency--cross border?
This will allow us to avoid an original type of the agreements.  For
training new attorneys we want search capability with respect to usage of
definitions and the like.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  If
charges to our account are necessary, please advise and I will get
authorization.
