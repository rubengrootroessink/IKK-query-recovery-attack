Bennett,
At the bottom of the message is the name and address for the entity that will 
be used to buy the GAIL shares we discussed.   Please let us know if there is 
any other info you need to set up the settlement and custody accounts we will 
need.
You can contact me or Lauren Hagerty in legal.
Thanks

Thanks Lauren, this was really quick.

Mary, it would be useful if you could fill out the Jardine form and send it 
to us. 

We want to send the filled up form and the Officer Certifiacte from Wade only 
when we give in our bid to Jardine.

Rahul
