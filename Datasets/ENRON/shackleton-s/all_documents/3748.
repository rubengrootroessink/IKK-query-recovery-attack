Good morning, Sara.

- I have recieved the ISDA Notebooks from the printers.  I will be happy to 
distribute the four sets that you requested.  Please provide name, address,  
etc.  
- The ISDA Notebooks now consist of 3 volumes.   The definitions have been 
split into two binders.  Would you like me to update your binder?

Good morning.

Following-up yesterday's discussion regarding the ISDA Notebooks, I am 
preparing to have extra sets of the ISDA Notebooks printed.  Please advise 
how many sets you need, if any.
