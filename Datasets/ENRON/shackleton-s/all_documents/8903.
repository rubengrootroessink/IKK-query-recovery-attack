Rod Nelson would probably be the best starting point.

Dear Sara & Cheryl,

I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

There had been some question as to which Enron entity
was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
& Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

Thanks and Regards,
