Allison is writing her thank-you notes.  With gifts going in different
directions after the wedding, cards were detached from boxes and envelopes
were scattered in different directions.  Allison has not been able to account
for everything, and while we're not trying to be rude, can you let us know
what you sent so she can match everything up and thank you in writing.  Hope
you had a good time.  Sorry I didn't get to spend more time with you.

Love - Anita
