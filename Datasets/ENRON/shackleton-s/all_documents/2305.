Hi Sara,

Gareth and I were going over the documents this morning and was wondering if
you have any comments on the revised Swaps (the three currency swaps and the
two option swaps).  Could you fax me your comments?

Could you also forward to me the Master Agreement btw UBS and Enron and
Enron's std language with respect to set offs, jurisdiction etc.. (as per
your e-mail two weeks ago).  Thanks.
