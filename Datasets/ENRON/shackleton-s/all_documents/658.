Just note that the sub's full name is Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. 
Regarding the sub's credit, we should have pretty good info since we are an 
equity owner ( I think 30%) in CCSI. I understand CCSI has no revenues, that 
its principal asset is the Xonon system patent, and that the proceeds of 
Enron's investment in CCSI will be the source of the funds for the purchase 
of the spark spread derivative.
