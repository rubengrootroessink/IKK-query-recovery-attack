Sita have asked me to let you know that they strongly wish to sign theG 
uarantee and ISDA Master Agreement before 22 December 2000.? Please would  
you therefore send me the marked up version of the Guarantee and ISDA Master  
Agreement today if possible for my approval.
?
Please would you also respond regarding the power of attorney.? We are  
concerned that it is not dated, that there is no date for the TransactionA 
rranging Agreement, that we do not know whether the Transaction ArrangingA 
greement is still in force and therefore whether the power of attorney is 
still  in force (leaving aside for the moment the fact that the power of 
attorney is  undated).? There is also no date for the Intra Group Services 
Agreement and  the name of the Director who signed the power of attorney is 
not  indicated.? 
?
Many thanks for your assistance on this matter.
Susan
