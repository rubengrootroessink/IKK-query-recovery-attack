Apologies - I have been out of the office for the past 10 days.

I had asked Cindy in legal to provide you with signature blocks when you 
first asked for it - I will chase her again today.
I will call you this afternoon to discuss the status of the agency agreement 
and any other requirement that you may have - let me know when you are 
available.

Regards
Mahesh
