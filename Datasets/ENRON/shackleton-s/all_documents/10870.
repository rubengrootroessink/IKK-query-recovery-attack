Hello, thanks for looking at the contract we have with Sempra.  Do you think 
we could have EOL add the rounding language and the correction to published 
prices as part of the product description for all power financial products?  
Would the correction to published prices language contradict the language 
already in the ISDA agreement?

Let me know what you think.
Thanks,
Melissa

Melissa:

I started with Sempra.  It's one of the more unusual masters ( a "Master 
Master"  covering both physical and financial) and it's not the typical "ECT 
Master".  Further, it contains no rounding or correction to published prices 
provisions.

We'll have to review these masters on a case by case basis.
