Sara,

We're waiting on Shifali Sharma for this info.  She is our Risk person for 
the Crude Desk.  There are going to be quite a few Traders and Books.  All 
deals that are Financial will be booked as ENA (RMT if internal).  I'm not 
sure if that's what your looking for as far as question 3 below.

We'll forward the other info along as soon as we get it.

Joe

Joe:  A few questions:

1. Who trades this?
2. What book does it sit in?
3. What legal entity is that book?

Please let me know as we are comparing this to another product.  Thanks.
