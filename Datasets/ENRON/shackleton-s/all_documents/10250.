		 Subject: ISI executing broker agreement with ECT Investments, Inc.

Cheryl and Cassandra,
 ECT Investments, Inc. has begun an executing broker relationship with ISI 
for research access and order flow.  This relationship is for execution 
only.  All settlements will still occur through existing Prime brokers, 
Goldman, Morgan and Bear.


Thanks,
Theresa
