Sara, 

Sharon at Cargill called in regards to deal EW5791.1.  She wants to see if we 
can delete the Effective Date and Termination Date on the confirmation.

(Since the term is defined in the Determination Period, she thought it would 
be less confusing.)

Let me know what you think....


Bernice
