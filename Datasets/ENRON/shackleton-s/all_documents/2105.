Hello all,

Carol, I have sent to you copies of all confirmed deal activity currently 
evidencing live deal activity.  Let me know when I can discuss the below 
agreement with NGTS, as they are currently shut down on EOL and telephonic 
trading and the position continues to grow.

Thanks
Brant

Brant and Sara:
Here is a very rough draft of a proposed letter agreement for NGTS.  It 
requires some work but hopefully it's a start.  It cannot be finalized until 
we see all of the physical and financial confirms and agreements and should 
NOT be sent to NGTS until Sara and I are comfortable that it works.
Carol
