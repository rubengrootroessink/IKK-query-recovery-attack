Jeff,

Sara has asked me to follow-up regarding the captioned Enron Affiliate and 
the need to confirm a trade.

Being that this Enron affiliate does not appear in the Corporate Database I 
was hoping  you could furnish details regarding this Enron Affiliate, as 
follows:

1. When was the company incorporated??? 
2. Where was it incorporated???
3 Or did we acquire an existing company by virtue of an acquisition???
4. What is the date of the FX trade, for which this Enron Affiliate is a 
party???
5. If this is a newly formed Enron Affiliate was the date of the FX trade 
dated simultaneous with the company's incorporation???
6. For notice purposes under the ISDA -- would we use the following??? 
    
    Bay Wellington Tower - BCE Place
    181 Bay Street, Suite 1540
    Toronto, Ontario M5J 2T3
7. If the foregoing address for notice is sufficient -- please advise as to: 
(a)  whom's attention, (b) phone number, and (c) fax number.

In discussing this matter with Sara, we have determined it would be a cleaner 
transaction if the FX trade could be confirmed under an RMT master rather 
than doing a Deemed ISDA confirmation.  Therefore, once you furnish the 
foregoing information Sara and I will be able to decide what path to take in 
order to consummate this FX trade.

Thanks for the help.


Cordially,

Susan:

Laurel Adams has an FX deal where RMT must be a party.  The counterparty is a 
100% owned Enron sub named "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona".  When I last 
checked, nothing shows up in the corporate database.  However, I have 
verified the name, ownership, etc.  with Jeff Blumenthal.  I will separately 
email you the counterparty info that I have.

We need a deemed ISDA for the parties.  We should later do the ISDA when the 
information is available on the database (which could be any day, I 
suppose).  I would just use our standard RMT format.

Please assign.  Feel free to call me or Laurel with questions.  Thanks.
