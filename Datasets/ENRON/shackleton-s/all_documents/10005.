Sara, I just the message you just left about playing phone tag with Anna at 
Bear Stearns.  As the lotus notes and the attached correspondence indicates, 
I was proactive today in contacting Anna to follow through since she did not 
return my last call a few days ago.  Since we already have a meeting set up 
for tomorrow at 10, I guess her message to you must be old (unless she is not 
the person responding to her email).  I also spoke this week with the 
attorneys representing the other brokerage firms and resent comments to them 
after they confessed that they had misplaced the previous ones.  Thus, from 
my perspective, we have been diligent in trying to open the accounts.

I too would like for us to discuss the other tasks that have to be done.  
However, I cannot meet today to do so at all.  I am troubleshooting several 
ABSOLUTELY URGENT tasks that have to get done today for ITG and for the CYNET 
deal.  I am available to meet tomorrow at my earliest convenience.

 As you may or may not know, we had two other "EMERGENCIES" with respect to 
brokerage accounts having to do with Frost, Cynet and another -- I cannot 
even remember which.  And, aside from these, we just executed four agreements 
in the past week.   

I want to reassure you that I believe to the best of everyone's ability we 
are as diligent as possible in getting these things done.   I will contact 
Keegan to set up a meeting as soon as possible tomorrow to talk about Enron 
Credit Inc.
