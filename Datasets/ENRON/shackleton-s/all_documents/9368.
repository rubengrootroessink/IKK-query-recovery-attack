Hi Sara,
Any progress on the blackline?  I was hoping to review and determine any
"final" outstanding issues before going back to legal and/or credit.
Although we entered into the deal you referenced without docs in place,
First Union credit had been assured that we were very close to finalizing
our docs before giving approval to proceed with the trade.  As previously
discussed, our equity and credit default business people are also
anticipating our getting docs in place with Enron Corp. and Enron Credit
Limited following completion of Enron North America Corp.   I look forward
to hearing from you.
