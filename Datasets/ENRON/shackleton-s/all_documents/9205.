Cheryl,
I had Gary execute and then sent both copies to ITG for their signature.  
I did not think we needed Cassandra's signature.  We have not in the past.  
RAC was notified by the initial e-mail that it was being done along with Bill 
Bradford.

Sam,

We are moving forward to execute the ITG Quantex agreement now that the final 
revisions were approved.  Sheila has forwarded a revised version of the 
document for Gary Hickerson to sign.  Please make sure that, once Gary signs 
the two copies, they are both forwarded to Cassandra Shultz for signature.  
Then, I think, Selena said she would send to ITG, but make sure.

I am hoping we get signatures tomorrow; I will be out of the office all day 
tomorrow -- traveling to New York and will not return until 10 a.m. Tuesday 
morning (Monday being a holiday).
