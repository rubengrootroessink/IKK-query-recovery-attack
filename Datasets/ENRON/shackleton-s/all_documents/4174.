Welcome to the world of Scott Paul Wines!

All Contents Copyright, 2000.

Dear friends of Scott Paul Wines -

Thank you so much for all of your interest and support. The response to our 
first mailing-list offering has been quite wonderful, and we're very 
appreciative.

We just wanted to remind you that all orders need to be in by October 31st, 
and that it appears that all wine allocated for this offering will sell-out - 
if orders continue at their current pace. If you'd like to place an order, 
you may do so now at:

http://www.scottpaul.com/store/index.cfm

For those who've asked about purchasing smaller quantities, here's the 
answer! Beginning in November, Groezinger's Wine Merchants in Yountville, CA 
will have a small quantity of the 1999 Kent Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay 
available, and they will gladly sell & ship quantities other than the 6-packs 
and cases offered on our website.

To order direct from Groezinger's - call 1-800-356-3970 and ask for Rick or 
Chris. (They will also have a bit of the '99 Pisoni Vyd. Pinot Noir in the 
coming months.)

We also hope to be announcing limited restaurant availability of the debut 
Scott Paul wines before the end of the year.

Thanks again for your business and support. If you have any questions, you 
can always e-mail us at scott@scottpaul.com or call us here directly at (707) 
944-1188.

Cheers!

Martha & Scott Wright
