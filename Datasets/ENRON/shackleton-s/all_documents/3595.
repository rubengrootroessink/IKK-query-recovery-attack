A couple of clarifications to the Proposal itself. The option to acquire 
535,715 additional shares is in place now and is currently exercisable by 
payment of the $26.88 per share strike price, but after effectiveness of the 
CCSI S-1 related to the spin-off, we have the option to exercise the option 
on a cashless basis and the shares will be split 2 for 1. That wasn't clear 
to me in the revision, and I will have my secretary E-Mail to you and the 
other members of the distribution a revised Proposal reflecting my 
clarifications on those points and Exhibit A incorporated therein.
