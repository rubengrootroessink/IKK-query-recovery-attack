Sara,

The desk has transacted two five year swaptions.  Do you recall where we were 
on the ISDA?  Negotiations had cooled significantly in light of the 
structured Skeena deal dying; however, now may be a good tome to resurrect.  
I have made the ISDA a condition precedent to exercise of the swaption.  I 
seem to recall the open issue was the definitions for the financial covenants 
of the MAC clause (cross border lease, etc.). I seem to recall that they 
didn't provide us with some of the definitions within the definitions.  I 
will pull my file to see if I can determine where we are.  Please let me know 
what your file indicates.

Thanks.
