Sara,

Spoke with Tom Moore this morning regarding the last outstanding issue 
(assignment clause for cp) and he is on board with my methodology and agrees 
as well.  He and Yair will propose to Enron replacement language to get us 
where we need to be hopefully.

Tracy:

Did you and Yair finalize the "transfer" language?  It seems that too many 
confirm questions are popping up and different forms are being drafted.  We 
;should be done with the ISDA.
