Sara, I am attaching some examples of Conditional deals that we have done 
recently. Let me know if you need anymore or have any questions.

The Dial Draft that we discussed Dale has reviewed and revised and forwarded 
a copy to you. I do know that commercial would like to get the Dial Draft out 
today. Please give me a call if you have any questions, I would be more than 
happy to go over it with you.

Thank you,

Jarrod
