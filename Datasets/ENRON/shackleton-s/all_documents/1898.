Sara:

Last week I had sent you a final version of the memorandum regarding pulp and
paper transactions (with attachment).  However, this morning I had an
computer-generated error message regarding that transmission.  I am sending 
you
the files again just in case you didn't receive them or couldn't open them.

If you would like a hard copy, please e-mail me back and I will send you a 
set.
Thanks.
