Hey guys,

Jamie at Frost is on the business side and did not know that we had an 
executed agreement.  Please disregard the agreement we sent interoffice today.

Thanks,
Aneela

Aneela, I will call Jamie to clarify any confusion -- please forward the 
phone number to me.  We have an executed agreement already  - it was executed 
within the past two weeks.

Aneela:

I received the referenced agreement in inter-office mail.  According to 
Cheryl's latest report,  identical agreements were executed by both ENA and 
ECT Investments, Inc. on or about 4/12/01.

What is it that you are asking us to do with the draft from "Jamie"?
