Dear Sir or Madam :


 Enron Corp. ("Enron") believes in conducting its business affairs in 
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of 
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a 
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does 
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct 
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or 
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your 
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects 
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that 
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department will 
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and 
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical 
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length 
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations.  
If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

James V. Derrick, Jr.
Executive Vice President and General   Counsel
(713) 853-5550	 or report
	anonymously
	to:	Enron Compliance Officer

		PO Box 1188
		Houston, Texas   77251-1188.

 Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to 
maintaining that relationship with you.

          Very truly yours,
