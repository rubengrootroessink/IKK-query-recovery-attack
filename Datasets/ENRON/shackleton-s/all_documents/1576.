Paul,
Would you please help complete the attached comparison between BONY and Chase 
for next Tuesday's meeting with Puskar, at 4:00. 
 
Carol, Shari and Sara,
Who will be attending for Legal?  Laurel said that there is some uncertainty 
as to whether Carol was involved in this project.

Thanks. 
Sheila
