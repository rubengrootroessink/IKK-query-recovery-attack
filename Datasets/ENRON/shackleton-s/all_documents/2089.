Sara,

I have attached draft Confirmation of a Collar with Rand Whitney. They want 
to go live with this deal today and send out an executable Confirmation. 
Tanya wants to put a provision in the confirmation that states that the deal 
is subject to Credit approval. If we do not get credit approval Tanya will 
kill the deal. I have left a message with Tanya asking her exactly what she 
wants to say in the Confirmation. Please let me know what you think of the 
Collar the way it is writtne and if we have any language to use for the 
credit provision. I have a meeting at 3:00 an should be back at my desk by 
4:00. 


Thanks,

Jarrod
