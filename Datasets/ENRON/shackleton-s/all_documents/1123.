Julian and I only have one change.  We would like to have the full text to 
the second paragraph of the Floating Price difinition included so the 
customer sees it up front.  This is the language which I pulled from the 
Central Puerto confirm:

The parties agree that the Floating Amounts payable under this Transaction 
shall be made in US Dollars, and the rate of exchange of Argentine Pesos to 
US Dollars shall be of one (1) Argentine Peso per US Dollar as set forth 
under Law 23,928, as amended, while there is free convertibility of the 
Argentine Peso and the rate of exchange therein set forth is of one (1) 
Argentine Peso per US Dollar. Otherwise, the rate of exchange between 
Argentine Pesos and US Dollars shall be calculated using the exchange rate, 
sell, for transfers abroad established by Banco Naci?n Argentina at the 
closing of the Business Day prior to that on which payment is effected. 
Argentine Peso means the lawful currency of the Republic of Argentina.


Julian is traveling to Houston tonight and will call you tomorrow to discuss 
the sending of the document to CMS.  Thanks for your help.
