The Physical Liquids group is proposing that they begin e-mailing 
Confirmations rather than faxing.  Does anyone have any issues with us doing 
the same for Financial deals?

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

I believe that we should have a meeting on this before we respond.

Sundar, when can you meet for a few minutes?

Joe, let me know if you would like to attend or conference in.

Thanks !!

Sam, your name was passed along to me as someone that maybe able to help us. 
We are investigating the prospect of emailing our confirmations vs faxing 
them and one of the things that came up was the possibility of a drop box 
email address for the counterparty involved that would be setup in the global 
counterparty system. Any ideas off the top of your head of what it might take 
to get this information included in the global counterparty system?

Nony, there is some discussing around developing an email process for our 
confirmations (vs. faxing) and we are wanting to get an opinion from Legal on 
the proposal. Can you please let me know what Legal's feelings would be about 
such a process? Thanks.

Herbert - Would you please investigate what it would take for us to begin 
E:mailing our confirmations as opposed to faxing.  Check with Legal, Ron 
Nolte, and Global Counterparty.

Linda - let's see about starting Freight off this way.

I would like to go this route if possible.

thanks,
Jeff
