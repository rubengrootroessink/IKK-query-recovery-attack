Subject: Entities - changes

As discussed, Please change the name of : Enron Investment Services Limited

to - Enron Credit Resources Limited.

Please process this as soon as possible and advise me as soon as possible.

Once the above name change has occurred, please set up a new entity called 
Enron Investment Services Limited.  The details for the new set up are 
exactly the same as before - The only difference is that the parent will be 
ECT Investments Inc.
