Marie, I am forwarding to you for Brokerage files

1. A copy of the executed copy of the Javelin Technologies Agreement that was 
faxed to me.  We need to follow up to get the original.  In the meantime, 
we'll put this doc in the executed file.

2.  A copy of the ECI - Bear Stearns guaranty that I had faxed to the office 
while I was in New York.

Also, Stephanie, reminder that I believe that we still have not sent a signed 
Tax Form to Bear re: Enron Credit Inc.  (although we did so for Morgan).  In 
any case, Mike Bruegel at Bear says he does not have it.  Please send one to 
him.  His phone number is 312-663-3253.  This did not affect the opening of 
the account but they still need it.  Please make sure that in fact we also 
sent one to Goldman.
