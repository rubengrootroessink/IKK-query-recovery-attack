RE: Large Trader Reporting Requirements for the Mid-Columbia Electricity

______________________________________________________________________________
_______________

This is a reminder that the Mid-Columbia Electricity Futures Contract will 
begin trading at 4:00 P.M. on September 14, 2000, which marks the start of 
the September 15 electronic trading session on NYMEX ACCESS. The first 
delivery month will be November 2000.  The Daily Large Trader Report 
submitted on Monday, September 18, 2000, for the close of business on 
September 15, must include reportable positions for this contract.

The quantity fixed for filing reports pursuant to Rule 9.33 (Position 
Reporting) is 25 contracts for the Mid Columbia Electricity Futures 
contracts.  If a person controls or holds a position equal to, or greater 
than, 25 contracts long or short in any one month, then all such futures and 
options on such futures whether, above the reportable level or not, shall be 
deemed reportable positions.

For the Clearing Members that file reports pursuant to Rule 9.33 in a machine 
readable format, the six digit CFTC commodity code for the Mid Columbia 
Electricity Futures contract is 64656.
