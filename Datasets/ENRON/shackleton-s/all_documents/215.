Subject: REGULATORY AFFAIRS DATABASE

Regulatory Affairs=01, electronic Database:  http://ei-sp-data 01/regulator=
y

Considering communication as one of Enron=01,s most important values, we ar=
e=20
pleased to announce the new Brazilian Regulatory Affairs=01, electronic=20
Database. The aim of this database is much more than a collection of=20
information. Instead, it was created to make our work easier, more efficien=
t=20
and more effective by stimulating the exchange of ideas on the main=20
regulatory issues throughout the company.=20


The new database is a web site already available in Enron=01,s intranet. To=
=20
access it, all you have to do is type the address=20
http://ei-sp-data01/regulatory in your browser. The site is divided into si=
x=20
parts, which are:

1)   Pertinent Legislation
In this link you will find the Brazilian Federal Constitution, emphasizing=
=20
the most important articles for Regulatory Affairs, some Federal Laws,=20
Decrees and  =01&Portarias=018 from  Ministry of Mines and Energy;

2)   Documents
Contains Concessions (Elektro=01,s  Contract),  Authorizations (EPE, ECE),=
=20
Procedures, Resolutions, other documents from ANEEL, MAE and  ONS as well a=
s=20
those sent by Regulatory Affairs;

3)   Discussion Room
In this link you can contribute messages to the regulatory topics being=20
discussed. You can also begin a new internal discussion by creating a new=
=20
topic. Your message will be displayed in the topic form so everyone=20
interested can read it. You should be aware that all Enron=01,s employees w=
ill=20
have access to view it;

4)   Links
Here you will find links to many pertinent sites such as ANEEL, ELETROBRAS,=
=20
CSPE, Diario Oficial da Uni?o, MAE, MME, ONS and news through Panorama=20
Setorial;

5)   Current Activities of Brazilian Regulatory Affairs at EISC
This link contains the current month=01,s weekly events as well as monthly =
and=20
annual reports;

6)   Give your feedback=20
If you have a suggestion about how to improve the system, and we hope you=
=20
will, this is where you will make it. In order to suit our needs, this=20
database is going to be modified based on the users=01, comments.

All pieces of information and documents, when  possible and economically=20
viable, will have both English and Portuguese versions.

It was intended to create something basic, make it available to everybody =
=20
and receive feedback from the users. The next step will be the development =
of=20
a =01&search engine=018 and the inclusion of more information. The system i=
s quite=20
easy to navigate but we will be more than happy to answer any questions you=
=20
have regarding the database.=20

Please feel free to call Carlos Gustavo Azevedo at 011 5503-1295 or via=20
e-mail.

FYI - This Database was developed by Carlos Gustavo (Regulatory Affairs) an=
d=20
Adriano Pereira, items 3 and 6 ( Information Systems).
