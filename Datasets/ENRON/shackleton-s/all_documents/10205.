Sara,
Apologies for the delay.  The JPM salesperson has been traveling and I needed 
to
make sure that the commission schedule was complete.  I am told that it will 
be
completed by Monday morning, so Thomas Alterson from our Client, Credit and
Control group will be sending you the final agreements by e-mail today.  For 
the
sake of time, you can execute the agreements by fax with originals to follow.

Tom's fax number is (212) 648-5347.

Regards,
Corinne 6-4292

Corinne:

Just checking to see if you had sent execution copies of the agreement.  I
spoke with Mike Schneider last week to verify our acceptance of the rate
schedule.  Please let me know when we can execute - my traders are calling!
Thanks.

Corinne:

We will accept your interest rate schedules.  Also, you can include the
witness line for our signatory.
Please prepare execution copies and let me know if there is anything else
to be done.  Thanks for your patience.

Sara,
We are in agreement with your proposed changes to the arbitration language.

I await your reply concerning the rest of the comments to the client
agreement.

Sara,
Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement
procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer
3
forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration
will be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne

I just sent you a fax re:  arbitration.

I have not heard from your salesperson re:  interest schedule for debit
