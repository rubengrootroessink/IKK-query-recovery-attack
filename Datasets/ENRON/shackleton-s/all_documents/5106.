Regarding Buy Side Direct:

   Has Sara addressed the notice issue ?

   Another issue I forgot to discuss with you is our most recent
discussion
   relates to the following changes we requested several months ago in
the
   Weiss, Peck & Greer Agreement:

     Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest
     that section 9 state this, or be removed.

     Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions
     through Buy Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.
WPG
     would only request margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.

   Were these changes made ?

Regarding TradingEdge, my understanding is that you recently resumed
discussions with their legal counsel.  Could we get an update on these
discussions ?

Thanks.

Am I correct in assuming that Sara decided what she would like proposed
in
terms of "notice" procedures for online trading platforms ?  Section 12
of
the attached Subscriber Agreement appears to specify who will receive
notice only in the case of default by Enron.  How will legal and / or
trading receive other notices - i,e, changes to the agreement ?

Thanks.
