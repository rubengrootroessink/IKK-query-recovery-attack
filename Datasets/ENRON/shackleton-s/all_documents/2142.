Jaime -  Your contact person would be Sara Shackleton. Her extension is 
35620.  However - I have promised to remain responsible for Vitro and Enertek 
for you, which by the way I have not heard from either of them in  a while. 

Hope you are doing well! 

Kind regards,

Shari

Shari, do you know who is going to support the Mexico Risk Management 
Busines, going forward, and from the legal point of view ? 
Thanks and regards.
