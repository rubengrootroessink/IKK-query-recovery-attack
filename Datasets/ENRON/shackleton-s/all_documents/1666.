We are very short on legal help at the moment.  Please permit me to respond
to your request early next week with an acceptable time.  Thank you.  Sara

Sara, could we schedule a time to talk about the margin loan agreement and
the form of guaranty? I can do it anytime tommorrow (Friday) afternoon.
Kris will not be on the call. I would like to see what points we can
resolve before we resort to the business people. Thanks.
