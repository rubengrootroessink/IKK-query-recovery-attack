Please note that CSFBC cannot  make certain of the changes requested to the 
Default/Remedies provision due to  its?position as a futures commission 
merchant.? I would appreciate it  if you would?phone me to discuss the 
revised document in the morning so  that we may potentially reach agreement 
on it by Wednesday, in advance of  Guillaume's visit.? Thanks and I look 
forward to speaking with you  soon.
