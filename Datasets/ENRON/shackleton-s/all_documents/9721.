Sara,

Some thoughts on some of these:

Entergy Power Marketing - shouldn't be using anymore - Axia is the mktg JV 
for Koch and Entergy
LG&E - hardly ever see trades here anymore; once in a blue moon we see 
something - not worth anyone's time
PMI - highly negotiated their paper; not going to touch it
Cross Timbers, Belco, Breitburn, Cabot - all Fred customer's - I would not 
hold my breath
Dynegy Canada - should already be on our list
Dynegy - should convert to an ISDA
Reliant - should convert to an ISDA
MSCG - should convert to an ISDA

The rest can wait for another time.

Attached is a list of high volume "old" ECT Masters which was obtained from 
the confirmation desk.  Many of them appeared on our working list from last 
year.  

Tanya:  We have enough legal help to pursue the names on the list.  Would you 
like to prioritize or amend?
