FYI.  How all of this may work with respect to the swaps in these structures 
(which I believe to have been signed, but still have not been provided 
executed copies) is unclear.

FYI. 

Mark -- lets give some thought to how this effects both structure and the 
ability to give the FAS 125 opinions on the sale of the notes on Raptor 3.

At AMT's and/or Brent's convenience, I would like to better understand the 
tax issue and discuss what steps we can take to mitigate as this proposal has 
real momentum.

Thanks.
Jordan

From discussing this with Brent and AnnMarie, there may some tax issues with 
merging these 2 structures. As best I can articulate this, the merger of 
Timberwolf into Porcupine would be treated as a reissuance of debt by LJM, 
causing them to recognize gain [made all the worse by no associated 
distribution of tax]. The TIA executed in connection with Raptor 3 would 
require indemnififcation by ENE based on LJM's demand in this case, withuot 
the need for the Service to take a position on the issue.

At his staff meeting this morning, Andy raised the possibility of some type 
of "merger" between Raptor 2 and 3 so as to provide support for the hedge on 
TNPC warrants.  My understanding is that Ryan is currently reviewing the 
feasibility of this type of arrangement from an accounting perspective.  I 
wanted to provide you with a heads-up in the event that this takes on some 
urgency in the next few days/weeks.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
