Subject: ISDA request for FX desk

Tanya:

Our FX desk has requested an ISDA Master Agreement for ENA's FX trades with:  
Credit Suisse First Boston, London Branch.

The entity with which ENA already has an executed master (effective 4/21/93) 
is Credit Suisse First Boston International, which trades derivatives.

I will have the name of the CSFB lawyer this afternoon.

Can you please prepare a credit worksheet?  Thanks.
