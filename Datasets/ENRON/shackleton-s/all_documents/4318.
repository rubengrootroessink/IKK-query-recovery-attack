RE:  Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Tuesday, October 31, 2000, is the First Notice Day, 
for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of November 
2000 (the new spot month).

On Monday, October 30, 2000, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers and 
Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") 
system trained representative available until such time as the Exchange deems 
necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and 
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a diligent 
effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing member or qualified Floor Trader to show due 
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe 
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David 
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.
