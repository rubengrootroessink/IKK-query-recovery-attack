I gave your name and contact information to the credit officer at Gen Re.  
They curently have an ISDA in place with us with mutual put language starting 
in 2004.  I have asked that that put stipulation be extended to a rolling 
10-year put.  They are currently considering this change.  He may be calling 
you to discuss an appropriate way of amending the ISDA agreement.  Thanks!
