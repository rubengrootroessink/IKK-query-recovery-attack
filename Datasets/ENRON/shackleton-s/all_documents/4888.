It is too late to get into the system, but if you could furnish me with any 
feedback that you have regarding Reggie, I would really appreciate it.  I'll 
just have to make sure it gets considered in the PRC meetings.

I had no idea that I was Reggie's supervisor until it was too late to request 
feedback through the system!
