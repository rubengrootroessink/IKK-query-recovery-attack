Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a 
policy  - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA 
agreement.  This could be related to credit activity in London.  I am waiting 
to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.
