Please disregard the request for the Enron Credit documentation in the name 
of NBR Default Swap and Tranocean Sedco Rig. All others are still outstanding

Sara,

Please see the attached spreadsheet of the Convertible and Credit Trades in 
the name of ECT Investments. We are making an effort to complete our working 
files. Please provide us with a copy of the documentation file for the 
referenced assets highlighted in green.

Feel free to call or e-mail me and I will be happy to swing by and pick them 
up.

Thanks in advance!
