Randy,

Hedges in the Raptor structure require that a Proposal Sheet be submitted to 
the counterparty to the swap (the counterparty is owned by an outside 
investor and our agreement with them requires this). Attached to Mary's email 
below is the Raptor Derivative Proposal Sheet that the business unit will 
need to submit. Gordon is responsible for this process and can answer any 
questions you have.

Also attached below is a Raptor Securities/Confidentiality Response Form that 
ENA legal prepared to help them conduct a due diligence exercise on their 
merchant assets being hedged to confirm that there were no contractual or 
other legal restrictions that may affect their ability to enter into the 
swap. Although  many of the items on this form won't be relevant to what 
you're hedging, I thought it may be helpful. Because we're not familiar with 
the assets or any South American legal issues that may apply, we'll be 
looking to you for confirmation that there aren't any issues in this regard.

You can ignore the document entitled Raptor Process for Inclusion of Swaps 
into Raptor Vehicles.

Please call me or Gordon if you have any questions. Thanks!

Scott

We can discuss tomorrow, but the swap group is not staffed either to fulfill 
the coordination of all the work in respect of the underlying assets.  Do you 
have alternative ideas?

Although I'm happy to discuss this at our meeting tomorrow, I don't think the 
draft process document describes a role for Global Finance legal that we can 
properly fulfill.
