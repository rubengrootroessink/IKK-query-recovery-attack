Welcome Back Stephanie.

While you were out, I prepared "execution packages" for several brokerage 
agreements.   I will forward to you the remaining ones  that need to be sent 
out today and Monday.  (See yesterday's email and report).

Please check the package to make sure everything is there and mail the 
originals SSB agreements to Sharon at the address on the top of the 
agreement.  I have already faxed a copy to her.
