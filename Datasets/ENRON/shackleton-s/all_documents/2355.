Sara,
I will send the Guarantee w/i the hour. 99% of the time, I can get the
Guarantee executed in One Business Day or less following the execution of
the Master Agreement. Have you reviewed the Cnf Agr language?. I had one
knit on 5(a) "Conditions Precedent", - add "or delivery" after "payment" and
before "obligations under Section 2(a)(1)".
Do you have any comments on the term sheet or Confirmation?

Regards
