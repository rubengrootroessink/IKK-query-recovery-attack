Do you know about this? Sounds like maybe we want to duplicate the ENA ISDA 
to Corp.

Paul,

I don't mean to dump this on you, but it was part of my old life.  Do you 
know who would cover an ISDA contract with Enron Corp?  I was working on 
these corporate type contracts for a bit before I left.  If you did not 
assume this responsibility, could you forward to the guilty party.  (I would 
ask Bill, but he's out - as you know).

Hope things are going well otherwise.

Later,
Rod

Dear Rod:

It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday.  As discussed, I found the 
draft from last July and I have attached it below.  Please let me know whom I 
should contact to follow up and I will do.  I greatly appreciate your help in 
moving this negotiation along.  As per notes from my colleague, Joyce Lim, 
this draft was constructed based on our executed ISDA Master with Enron North 
America Corp.
Regards,
Glen  (212) 852-6274
