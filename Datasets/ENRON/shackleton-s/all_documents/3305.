 Hi  Sara,

I have just recieved the attached fax and phone call from Matt Flett at 
Morgan Stanley in London. I believe that he has taken over the above 
transaction from Megan Duffill. He has contacted me in the abcence of Edmund 
Cooper who is currently on sick leave and asked for a response on the points 
raised in the fax.
Is this one of yours or have we now become involved in some way? When you 
have a moment please could you let me know  either way. 

Many Thanks

Matt Dawson
