It was my understanding that they would not be able to opt out of trading 
under the ISDA, since this contract has not been terminated.  However, if 
this is not the case and the trades that we are currently entering into are 
not being confirmed under the ISDA, I think that we should get together as 
soon as possible.  We do a significant volume of trades each day with this 
counterparty both OTC and EOL.

Lets discuss.

Ed - After we hung up, I though a bit more about trading with Mirant.  In 
light of the letter sent by Mirant on February 26 that stated ". . . no 
further transactions will be enter into under the agreement", we need to call 
Mirant prior to completing the trade.  I will try on this end, but you should 
also try.  The contact is Nicole Russell (678) 579-7489.
