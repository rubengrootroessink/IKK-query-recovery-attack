Stephanie, I left Terry, the attorney a note asking him to confirm that he 
sent us BOTH agreements -- one for ENA and one for ECT since it appears that 
he did not.  I will keep you posted.

Did we resolve this?  Its both.  The one marked account number 70900497 is 
ECT.  We should also have one marked acct number 70901071 for ENA.  Let me 
know where we stand and whether we need for me to call them back.

Which entity is this agreement for?  It does not indicate on the agreement.

Thanks

Hi Stephanie, 

I thought the execution process was complete on this one but actually we are 
still in the process of executing.  DBAB has sent to us two copies signed by 
them and hence, ready for our signatures.  I am forwarding to you so that you 
could get the signatures and prepare the Authorized Officers List and the 
Consent Form for signatures as well.  

Cassandra wants an explanatory blurb about why the account is necessary, 
please check in to get some justification from Aneela, Sheila or Theresa.

Thank you,
