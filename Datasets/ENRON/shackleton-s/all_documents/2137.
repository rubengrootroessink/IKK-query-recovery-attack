Sara - I can't print out a list of your documents in your folders.  I've 
asked Brenda and the help desk and it can't be done.  It will have to be done 
from the screen.  Sorry.

No, you are not subject to the "backup" of documents.  To get them out of 
your directory I will go in manually and delete them.

Kaye:  Can you print a list of the documents in my folders so that I can 
eliminate old items?  Also, am I still subject to the "backup" of documents?
