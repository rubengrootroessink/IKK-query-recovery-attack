Subject: Revised Australian Services Agreement

Attached please find my mark-up of the Australian Services Agreement. I have 
attached a blacklined version for ease of reference. 

Apart from changing the name from ECT to ENA, I have modified clause 1 in 
Schedule 1 to more accurately reflect the intended products.



Please call me if any questions. 

Many thanks, 

Shari
