Magnus,

My suggestion is that you contact Laurel Adams in our foreign exchange 
confirmation group.  Please advise if anything is needed from my end in 
Credit Risk Management.

Thanks,
Bill

Dear Mr. Bradford,

I hope you are the right person but if not could you please direct me in the
right direction?

We have had some foreign exchange trades where we have sent you
confirmations but we have not received those back from you. Would it be
possible for you, or anyone relevant, to look into this?

Regards

Magnus Ward
