shockwave has got 'em all. 

Now that you have your Shockwave Player, you're ready to check out 
the best music, games, and shows on the Web--everything from Joe 
Cartoon to Jimi Hendrix to Joust and Defender, only on shockwave: 

* Play games
Dominate the battlefield in 3D Tank Wars, hop into the explosive 
world of Tamale Loco, or stick with classics like Real Pool and Spy 
Hunter. (We've even got jigsaw puzzles.) 

* Watch shows
Come watch an original series by Tim Burton or check out twisted 
exclusives like Radiskull & Devil Doll. 

* Mix music
Hit the turntables for some digital mixing--or just kick back and 
listen to Shockwave Singles from Madonna, Beck, Dr. Dre and other 
cutting-edge artists. 

* Send greetings
Pick from dozens of animated greeting cards for every occasion. (And 
if you're not exactly sure what to say, get some help from Frank 
Sinatra, Bill Clinton, or Chef.) You can even send puzzles, cartoons, 
and photos that you put together yourself. 

We hope to see you soon at Shockwave.com!
