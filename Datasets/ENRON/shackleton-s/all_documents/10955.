RE:
Disputed High/Low Futures Prices


Please be advised that effective Monday, May 14, 2001, the COMEX Division 
will begin utilizing Price Reporting System functionality that will permit 
the Floor Committee to highlight high and low futures prices, which are being 
disputed.  A flashing asterisk will appear on the wallboard to the right of 
the high or low price that is under review.  When the dispute regarding the 
high or low price is resolved the flashing asterisk will disappear and the 
correct high or low price will be displayed.  This functionality will not 
exist for options.

Should you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at 
(212) 299-2072.
