The letter is ok if you change SZP family to "ECT Investments, Inc." and the 
"TZJ Family" to Enron North America Corp."

There is an agreement.  The SZP family is ECT Investments and the TZJ family 
is ENA.

Does ENA have an existing Account Agreement with Bear Stearns, which will 
govern the transferred account?

I spoke with Bear Stearns this morning and all that they require to move an 
account from one family to another is a letter signed by authorized 
signatories.  I have drafted the letter and I will sent it to them if there 
are no problems with this from the legal department.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Terri
