I have attached the query result.  I ran a query for all deals where the 
index is a Linear Low Density.  
According to Lee, we would be interested in deals that are active effective 
4/00 forward.  The ones in yellow apply. 
Sara- I will forward you the signed confimations of all of the yellow ones.
