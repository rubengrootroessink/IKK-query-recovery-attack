OAKLAND, Calif., March 9, 2001 -- The Brita Products Company today announced 
that it has reached a settlement agreement with Innova Pure Water, Inc., and 
that Innova has dismissed its patent infringement lawsuit against Brita in 
which it claimed the water filter in the Brita Fill & Go(R) sports bottle 
infringed on one of Innova's patents. Under the terms of the settlement, 
Brita may continue to market the Brita Fill & Go(R) sports bottle under a 
newly issued Innova patent.

"We're pleased that this settlement opens the doors for Brita and Innova to 
establish a cooperative relationship and work productively together in the 
future," said Scott Weiss, vice president-general manager, Brita Products.
