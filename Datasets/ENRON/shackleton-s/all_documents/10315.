Sara,  Keegan and I do not know what you are saying you want to do finally.  

You indicated yesterday that you did not have any meetings scheduled with me 
today on brokerage accounts and immediately thereafter, Keegan and I adjusted 
my schedule accordingly with other meetings.  

Are you now saying that you want to still meet at these times referenced in 
Kay's email below.   

Or, are you saying, based on a more recent email, that you only want to meet 
Monthly?

Let us know.
