Sheung and Ketan,
Anthony Capelango was supposed to give Sara an account number this 
afternoon.  We are still awaiting it so we can trade compare the position 
with the lead underwriter and fund the account.

We will have all documentation to MS tomorrow and are awaitng some signatures 
from India.
Thanks. Sheila

Sheung,
Sara is working with Anthony Capelango, MS, to get this account open.  We are 
expecting an account number this afternoon.  I will send the number to you 
when I hear from Anthony. 

The IPO is being priced today and we should know how many shares we got 
tomorrow.
Sheila
