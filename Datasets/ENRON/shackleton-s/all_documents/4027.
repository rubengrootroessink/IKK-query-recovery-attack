Hi Sara

We are Enron Trading Services Inc. (FCM) in New York. We came along with the 
MG purchase and report through London. 

We handle clear/broker US Futures and act as an IB for Enron Metals Ltd. Our 
client base is the Americas with an overlap to Houston. 

We would like for funds and commercial clients to have one Swap document 
including several commodities and Enron units. For example we understand from 
Per that you are working a document for Catequil that should include metal.

Justin

 Could you advise

Thanks
Craig Young
