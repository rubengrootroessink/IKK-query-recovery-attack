The Enron policy for our English law Master is for arbitration - although I 
have to say, for purely financial contracts, I myself always prefer the 
Courts.

Mark:  Thanks so much for your explanation earlier today.  Just one more 
question, please:  is arbitration or litigation the preferance under English 
law?  How often do you negotiate to the contrary?  Thanks.  Sara
