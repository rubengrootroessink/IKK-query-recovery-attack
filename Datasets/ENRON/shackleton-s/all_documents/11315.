Funny you should ask.......... I asked that question a long time ago to 
London legal but I've not managed to get a response yet.

Cindy - The A&J memo shows as follows:

Directors: MG Metall Recycling Verwaltungs GmbH Management
Officers: Achim Lindhorst, Hermann Ritterbach, Micahel Schaaf, Stefan 
Scheppler, Hans-Peter Schneider.

My questions are still the same: (i)  what is the title of each of the 
officers, and (ii) should I name the directors of MG Metall Recycling 
Verwaltungs GmbH as directors of the captioned co?  Until I get a response my 
hands are tied.

Susan - this is probably not too helpful to you but you can see my dilemma.

Best regards Kate

Kate,

Hi!!

Please advise:  Who is an authorized signatory for the captioned Enron 
affiliate. 
    According to the Secretariat Database, no directors, officers, or 
managing directors have been designated.


Reason for inquiry: I need to get an ISDA Master Agreement executed for this 
Enron affiliate, in order that their financial FX transactions can be 
confirmed    under said ISDA.

I look forward to your response.


Cordially,
