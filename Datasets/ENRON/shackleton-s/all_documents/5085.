Can you take a look at the term sheet below. This was the concept of 
"participation" in a gas contract as envisioned by Milbank. We may be moving 
away from this concept towards what I suggested last night and perhaps a bit 
further than that as well but wanted to get a legal view on this 
participation concept.
