Sara, I noticed in reviewing the documents today that you had named the trust 
as Bow Valley Trust in the ECC - Trust confirm in both the lead-in and the 
signing line.  I think the name of the trust is Bow River Trust not Bow 
Valley Trust.  Hopefully, the bank's comments are of a similar scope and 
nature.

Cheers

Greg
