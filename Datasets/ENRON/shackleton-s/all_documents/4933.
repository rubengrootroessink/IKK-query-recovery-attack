We have in place an executed Agreement for Prime Brokerage Clearance Services 
between J. P. Morgan and ECT Investments.  The Agreement is dated July 24, 
1996.  I spoke with Aneela and confirmed that this is the Agreement I copied 
for her.  We do not have an Agreement in place for ENA.  I have added the 
Agreement between J.P. Morgan and ECT Investment  to Lotus Notes.
