Rick, attached is draft optional termination language.  Assuming you have no 
comments on it, it will be included in the next distribution (to occur after 
noon Calgary time).  Please note that we are expecting to receive final 
comments (if any) from Royal's in-house by noon Calgary.

Once you and Royal have settled on the bigger issues, please call me to go 
through Enron and Blakes comments on your memo.

Attached is my suggested language.  The confirms already provide for Market
Quotation and Second Method; the Optional Early Termination provision
should be the only exception for using the Calculation Agent for
termination purposes.  Of course, the Calculation Agent will determine AECO
prices for payment purposes, but that is not related to termination.

Please call.  713-853-5620.  Sara(See attached file: OPTIONAL EARLY
TERMINATION PROVISION.doc)
