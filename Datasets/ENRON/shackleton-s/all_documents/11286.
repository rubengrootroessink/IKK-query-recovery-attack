I am not aware as to why we used ECT as the counter party but will endeavour 
to find out. ETOL is not up for sale - why do you think it may be?
Regards
David

David,

Perhaps you can shed some light on this..... Houston legal/tax is questioning 
why the original master agreement was not executed between Enron Teesside 
Operations Limited and Risk Management & Trading Corp?  (We use RMT on 
intercompany deals to get the benefits of the Texas tax code.)  Was there a 
specific reason it was done between ETOL and Enron Capital & Trade Resources 
Corp?  


Also, is ETOL up for sale?  Has it always been up for sale?  

Thanks for your help.  I am working with Sara Shackleton in Enron Houston 
legal.
