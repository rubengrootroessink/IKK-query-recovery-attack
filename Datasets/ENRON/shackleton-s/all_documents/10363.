Hi Sarah and Rod,
Before sending the docs for these two additional Enron entities, would you
run these securities by your credit folks to see if they are OK with
including government agencies as acceptable collateral.  First Union has
recently changed it's position and is now including these in all of our
CSA's, valued at 92%.  Thanks, Dee
