RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of Amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.21C and Related=
=20
Implementation of Electricity EFS Program
____________________________________________________________________

Please be advised that the CFTC has approved amendments to NYMEX Rule 6. 21=
C=20
("EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP TRANSACTIONS FOR=20
FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ONLY ON VIA NYMEX ACCESS").  The amendments, which=
=20
are shown below, permit the exchange of futures for swaps ("EFS") for NYMEX=
=20
Division electricity futures contracts.  The EFS program for electricity=20
futures will go into effect on Monday, November 27, 2000.

 One change from the terms of the rule should be noted.  Rule 6.21C provide=
s=20
for report of EFS transactions to be given to the Exchange "via NYMEX=20
ACCESS."  However, this functionality still needs to be added to NYMEX=20
ACCESS.  Therefore, the Exchange=01,s current procedures instead provide fo=
r=20
reporting EFS transactions to Exchange Floor Dept. staff located in the Lat=
e=20
Submissions Area on the NYMEX trading floor in the same manner as the=20
reporting of EFP transactions. Such reports of EFS transactions would be=20
subsequently disseminated to NYMEX ACCESS System Users through a bulletin=
=20
message sent via NYMEX ACCESS.

 As a reminder, it is necessary for market participants to comply with the=
=20
CFTC=01,s EFP-related reporting and recordkeeping regulations as if these=
=20
regulations applied to EFS transactions.  Specifically, the Exchange will=
=20
require:

1) Each Exchange member, futures commission merchant ("FCM"), and introduci=
ng=20
broker ("IB") to comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation=20
1.35(a) as if this regulation applied to EFS transactions and will further=
=20
require each Exchange member, FCM, and IB to provide the required records t=
o=20
the Exchange for inspection upon request;

2) Each customer to comply with the requirements of Commission=20
Regulation1.35(a-2)(2) as if this regulation applied to EFS transactions an=
d=20
will further require each customer to provide the required records to the=
=20
Exchange for inspection upon request;

3) Each Exchange clearing member, FCM, and foreign broker to comply with th=
e=20
requirements of Commission Regulations 17.00(a)(1) and (2) as if these=20
regulations applied to EFS transactions, and NYMEX will further require eac=
h=20
Exchange clearing member, FCM, and foreign broker to file the required=20
records with the Exchange;

4) Each trader who holds or controls a reportable futures position to compl=
y=20
with the requirements of Commission Regulation 18.05 as if this regulation=
=20
applied to EFS transactions, and NYMEX will further require each trader to=
=20
provide the required records to the Exchange for inspection upon request; a=
nd

5) Upon the request of the Commission, each FCM, IB, foreign broker, and=20
trader to comply with the requirements of Commission Regulations=20
24.03(e)(1)(iii) and (e)(2)(iv), and NYMEX will further require each FCM, I=

foreign broker, and trader to file the required records at the place and=20
within the time frame specified by the Exchange.

  If you have any questions concerning the operation of this program, pleas=

Rule 6.21C.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP=20
TRANSACTIONS FOR FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ONLY ON VIA NYMEX ACCESS

 (A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)=20

 a=20
futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer a=
nd=20
seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of th=
e=20
swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the future=
s=20
contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such commodity)=
. =20
The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately equivalent to the=20
quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap component of an EFS=20
transaction must comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation Part=
=20
35 (Exemption of Swap Agreements).  The initial term of the pilot program=
=20
shall be three years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21C.

(2)The pilot program is available only to commercial market participants. F=
or=20

=20

=20
Exchange and also shall include an entity that regularly maintains a book o=
f=20
and acts as a dealer in swap transactions.

(B) The report of an EFS transaction involving a futures contract that is n=
ot=20
listed for trading on the Exchange trading floor and instead is listed for=
=20
trading only on NYMEX ACCESS shall be given to the Exchange via NYMEX ACCES=
S=20
during the hours of trading on NYMEX ACCESS for that futures contract.

(C) A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by=

information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS complied with t=
he=20
requirements of Part 35 at the time the EFS was entered into between the=20
buyer and seller, a statement that the EFS has resulted or will result in a=
=20
change of payments or other such change, the kind and quantity of the=20
futures, the price at which the futures transaction is to be cleared, the=
=20
names of the Clearing Member(s) and customers and such other information as=
=20
the Exchange may require.  Such report (form) shall be submitted to the=20
Compliance Department by 12:00 p.m. New York time, no later than two (2)=20
Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS via NYMEX ACCESS.

(D) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that t=
he=20
transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the=20
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master=
=20
swap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the Cleari=
ng=20
Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing Members=
=20
for examination by the Exchange.

(E) A report of each EFS transaction shall be given and notice thereof shal=
l=20
be posted on NYMEX ACCESS in the manner provided by the Exchange on the day=
=20
that the transaction thereto was made, or if such agreement was made after=
=20
the close of trading, then on the next business day.  EFS transactions shal=
l=20
be cleared through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures, shall=
=20
be clearly identified and marked in the same manner as EFP transactions, an=
d=20
shall be recorded by the Exchange and by the Clearing Members involved.

(F) All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS=20
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange'=
s=20
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus accou=
nt=20
or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another omnibus accou=
nt=20
or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant to Rule=20
6.21C(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other information =
as=20
the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be submitted to the=20
Exchange_s Compliance Department by 12:00 p.m. New York time no later than=
=20
two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the Floo=
r=20
of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to submit=
=20

=20
result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition o=
r=20
deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the market.
