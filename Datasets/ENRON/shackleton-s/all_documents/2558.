Dear Sara,

How nice to hear from you.  We did have a Maxwell Hendler exhibition and it
was incredible.  I thought I sent Mike the review.  If not, I should have.
Maxwell is currently  in an exhibition in Verona, Italy, at Studio La Citta,
that has been very successful.  I still have TANGEE at my home, AQUA POOL
remains available,  and there are some new pieces, as well.  We have had a
terrific season.   Hurry Back!   Best regards,   Patty
