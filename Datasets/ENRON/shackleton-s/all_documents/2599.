All -
I put together a first draft of a procedure memo for executing equity 
derivatives on Enron common stock.  Please review this, and give me any 
comments you might have.  I would appreciate it if I could have comments back 
from you by Friday morning so that we can have a working document as soon as 
possible.  Thanks in advance for your help.
