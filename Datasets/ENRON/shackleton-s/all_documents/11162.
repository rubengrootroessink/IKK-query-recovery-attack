All,

Tanya thought that there were several issues raised by Carol and/or Sara 
regarding the ISDA for Montana Power Company that you wanted to discuss with 
Tanya before the draft was sent to the Counterparty.  She is not sure what 
you wanted to discuss.  Please let me know and I will convey the info to 
Tanya.

Thanks,
Stephanie
