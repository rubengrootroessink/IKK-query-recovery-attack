Why don't you tell Stewart that we will have an answer for him by Friday.  
Pat just said on the phone that he would send two cases to me and I will 
forward them on to you right away.  ----cgy

Hi, Christian:

Stuart has already called this week inquiring about his ability to continue 
negotiating with the PUDs.  Have you had a chance to speak with Pat 
Boylston?  Let me know if I can assist.  Thanks (as usual) for all of your 
help.
