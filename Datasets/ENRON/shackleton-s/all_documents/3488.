Sara,

Thanks for the update.  I have had some brief discussions with Mark 
Tarkington who has provided me a fax of credit issues under discussion.  Why 
don't we sit down to discuss prior to the call on Wednesday.  My 
understanding is that we will negotiate one ISDA for ENA and mirror the terms 
for ECT Investments, ETRIC, etc.

Bill

Bill:  I will fax to you the stair-step threshold in the DB Credit Support 
Annex.  DB made a change and we cannot locate info in Carol St. Clair's 
file.  
Also, I am checking the guaranty and other changes marked by DB.

Please note that I frequently see credit derivative deals between ECT 
Investments, Inc. and DB (unclear where EnronCredit.com Limited fits into 
thiis Houston picture!) where DB is requiring an ENE guaranty as well.  Do we 
need an ISDA here?

Thanks.  Sara
