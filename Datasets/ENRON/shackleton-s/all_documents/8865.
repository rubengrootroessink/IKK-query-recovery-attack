Sara- I apologize for not responding yesterday to your question.  The
outside counsel for legal opinions for the Moore off-shore funds (Moore
Global Investments,Ltd., Moore Global Fixed Income Fund, Ltd. and Moore
Emerging Markets Fund, Ltd. ) is Graham, Thompson & Co. in Nassau, Bahamas.
The contact at Graham Thompson that handles the relationship is Gilbert A.
Ward at 242-328-6287.

With regard to Remington Investment Strategies, L.P. (the Delaware limited
partnership), the legal opinion is done by Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft in
New York.  The contact at Cadwalader is Jeanne Naughton Carr 212-504-6427.

I am waiting for a reply as to who FIF Masters Fund Ltd. uses as their
outside counsel.  I will let you know once i find out.

Regards-
Rose Liu
