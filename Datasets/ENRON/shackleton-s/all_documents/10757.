Hello, Maud!

My name is Becky Spencer and I work for Brent Hendry.  In answer to your 
question of this morning, yes, Brent did receive the document you sent to him 
on April 12th.  Could you please let us know the name of the contact person 
here at Enron to whom you have been speaking so we can better coordinate our 
discussions with you? 

Thank you!  We look forward to doing business with you.
