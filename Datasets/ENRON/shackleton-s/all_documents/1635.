Alan, Julie, John, Gary and Jeff:

Below you will please find an structure overview for ECT Investments, Inc. 
relating to Management Reporting, Tax Reporting, Legal Entity, Regulatory 
Reporting and Prime Broker Accounts.

It appears to me,  as it currently stands, we have a disconnect between the 
Prime Broker set up and the other reporting we are doing.
Terri and I discussed some options with Julie Gartner, Tax.  which are noted 
on the page.
I will follow-up with you as to what we want to do.
Thanks. Sheila
