Russ,
I just want to confirm that by moving the Credit account to a Stock Loan 
account status that we will not have less favorable financing  terms.  
We currently have FF-25bp and FF+75bp.

Sara Shackleton is working with Legal at Bear Stearns but BS - Legal may need 
to discuss with you have the guarantee will work.  Sara said that they may be 
unclear as to its purpose.

Thanks. Sheila

Russ,
We need to discuss what difference a Letter of Guarantee will make to our 
margin requirements before we proceed too far along.  Obviously, we would 
continue only if the benefits will be there.
Many Thanks.  Sheila

Russ,
Enclosed you will please find a Form for a Letter of Guarantee  from Enron
Corp.  As per Jeff Kinneman's conversations, we would like to explore using
a guarantee to reduce the margin requirements on the Credit Trading
portfolio for ENA.
Please advise as to the  margin requirements' reduction we could achieve
with this approach.
Thanks. Sheila Glover
