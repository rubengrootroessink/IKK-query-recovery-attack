Sara,

I left you a voice mail message regarding the above.  If Bear Stearns is 
insistent on its consents/waiver provision, does that mean that ENE cannot 
modify the provision or does it mean that there is some opportunity to 
counter with minor changes.  The provision in totality does not need to be 
deleted, but in order to have our setoff/counterclaim provision work 
properly, we cannot waive all of our defenses.  I am assuming that there are 
mutual obligations on both sides of the table.  If that is the case, then it 
is not unreasonable for ENE to request having reservation of defenses of its 
subs.  I have taken the liberty of modifying the Bear Stearns provision as 
appropriate.  Let me know your thoughts.

Clem
