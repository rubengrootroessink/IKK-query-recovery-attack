Sara, since you had asked whether I could summarize some of the issues I have 
come across in the physical arena of ag regulation, I have gone ahead and 
summarized some notes I have been putting together.  Obviously, some of this 
bears a more detailed discussion and analysis, particularly regarding the 
"hedge-to-arrive" contracts, but I wanted to go ahead and send you something 
quick to read
