To make sure we are all on the same page and talking to the same Bear Stearns 
people (I'm getting calls from Chicago and NY.  I told NY to go away and talk 
to Chicago), please have all the paperwork to open the account and all the 
paperwork to transmit the actual shares flow through one person.  I nominate 
Aneela Charania to take all pieces of paperwork and make sure they get to the 
right person.  I spoke with Mike Bruegel at Bear (312) 663-3253 and I think 
he fully understands what we are trying to do, which is simply to sell these 
shares and move the cash out of the account once the trade is settled.  I 
also told him the account will not stay open once the trade is done.  
Obviously this is what is causing BS heartburn since they want more business, 
and if it weren't for the fact that BS is the investment banker, we would not 
be using BS at all.  We would go with the existing account with Morgan 
Stanley.

I really appreciate everyone's help with this, but to avoid any more 
confusion, please use Aneela as the point person for all document 
submission.  Her phone number is 30951.  If anyone has any concerns, please 
respond to the group.  Thanks again.  Donna
