Do you mean athat CSFB International is where they currently trade 
commodities? Why would we include 'London Branch" in the name of the 
contracting entity?  Wouldn't all branches be eleigible under this one doc? 
Lets discuss.

Tanya:

Our FX desk has requested an ISDA Master Agreement for ENA's FX trades with:  
Credit Suisse First Boston, London Branch.

The entity with which ENA already has an executed master (effective 4/21/93) 
is Credit Suisse First Boston International, which trades derivatives.

I will have the name of the CSFB lawyer this afternoon.

Can you please prepare a credit worksheet?  Thanks.
