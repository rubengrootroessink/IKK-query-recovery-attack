Sorry everybody.  I missed one word in the provision---in the middle of the

version.

   

I know it's hard to believe I could make a mistake..........oh well.

Mike--- here is our proposed language which is drafted in accordance with the 
recent group discussion.  Would you please circulate it among your group, and
