Further to my fax of 3 October we have SITA's instructions.

1 - Credit Support Annex :

SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit Support 
Annex.  SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on the term and 
volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support Annex.

2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its main 
activities. Do you have any news regarding ENRON on this point?

Kind regards
Susan Hopkinson
