Dear Sara

This month's cover story is "Singapore's banks won't obey the government."
The big three private banks have been slow to implement the government's 
wisdom, and former president Lee Kwan Yu has publicly criticised one of them. 
But the country's banks face other problems, too. They must grow stronger 
domestically before they expand regionally, and financial mergers have been 
doomed to failure.
Find out how these institutions plan to reform themselves.

Included with the February issue: Deals of the year... Thailand's outgoing 
deputy prime minister... Korean restructuring... Vietnamese growth... Asia's 
best companies... Thai corporates... Asia's top banks.
