Dear Ms. Shackleton:

Thank you for your recent order placed at
www.bravo.com.  Bravo 20 has recently merged with OFFI
& Company.  During this transitional period, our time
between order receipt and shipping is longer than
usual, as we are in the midst of manufacturing and
re-stocking.

Due to this delay, the approximate shipping date for
your order is 7/25/00, although we hope the actual
ship date will be earlier.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us at 800-383-OFFI(6334) or offiweb@yahoo.com
if you have any questions or if we can be of further
assistance.

Thank you,
OFFI & Company
