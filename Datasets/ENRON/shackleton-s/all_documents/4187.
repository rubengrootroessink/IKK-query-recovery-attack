Hi Sara -

Hope we get to see you next time you're up here! I don't know when we'll be 
able to ship direct to TX - it's too dicey right now, but there are lawsuits 
underway that will hopefully change all that in the not too distant future. 
As to the sales tax issue in selected other states: in NY,
FL, & MI the only way to ship there is through a shipper that is also a 
licensed wholesaler & retailer in that state, and to do so they must charge 
the local sales tax to run it through the three-tier system within that 
state. In Louisiana, wineries must have a permit to ship there, and
they have just (in the last few weeks) made it a condition of the permit that 
the winery must collect LA sales tax and file reports with the state every 
month. What a pain! Someday soon this will all get a lot easier, we hope...

Thanks so much for your interest, and your order - enjoy the wine!

All the best,

Scott & Martha Wright
