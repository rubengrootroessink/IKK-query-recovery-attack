Sara,

here is online (web based) convertible trading site hat I could use - kindof 
like an online broker where they match up buyers and sellers.  I take it that 
before we enter to any agreement with them you need to approve it all.  

 I have not looked at this document yet, so please feel free to make any 
comments you may have.


Madhur
