Pls find redlined version as attached.  Our additional changes reflect
our tel conversation earlier today.  Pls call me if this is going to
cause a huge problem.  I hope to have comments on your PCG to CA
tomorrow.

Thx for Matthew Dawson's tel nbr.  Got thru and resolving my issues
there with him.  We are getting our credit reports out now.  All prices
are being updated and I will rerun tomorrow morning.  We should touch
base then to agree on an amount of collateral you require to keep CA on
board.

best regards
