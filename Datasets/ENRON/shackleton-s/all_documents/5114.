Chris:

Please call me and let's discuss.  My hesitancy comes from the big difference 
in the ISDA for general corporates and GOVERNMENTALS (which you know are 
treated differently).

Sara:  

There is more and more interest amongst our custoemrs in the West in looking 
at Swaps.  I want to be able to show them how the ISA contract fits together 
with the credit support annex and confirmation letter.  I have built a pro 
forma Cofirrm based on the SoCal Water deal you worked on with me.  Can you 
make a pro forma master and credit support annex so we can fax or e-mail 
these to potential clients so we can try to get their interest and encourage 
them to get contracts and credit in place with us?  I know you are hesitant 
to do this, but it would help our marketing significantly.

Thanks

Chris
