Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.
