The Chautaqua Airlines master agreement has a confidentiality clause in it 
that precludes us from showing the agreement to third parties.  The clause 
does allow the parties to show it to their "affiliates" who are required to 
keep the information confidential.  In this case if Wexford is an "affiliate" 
of Chautaqua Airlines then Chautaqua can give Wexford a copy of the 
agreement.  An "affiliate" would be an entity that would be contolling or 
under common control or controlled by the other entity. 

The only way for us to deliver the agreement to Wexford is if we received a 
waiver from Chautaqua allowing us to give a copy of the agreement to 
Wexford.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
