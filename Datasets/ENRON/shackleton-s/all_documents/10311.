Sara,
We are getting pressure from our commercial people to finalize the ISDA with 
Louis Dreyfus Plastics.

Stephanie,
I hate to keep bothering you about this, but if there's any way to hurry up 
this process it would be greatly appreciated. Louis Dreyfus Plastics is one 
of only three big marketers that plays the LPG market on EnronOnline, and, by 
losing them, we have lost a great amount of liquidity and volume. Not to 
mention, our customer relations are definitely going downhill.
I completely realize that this is not "our fault," but I would like to 
solicit your help in resolving this as quickly as possible.

Thanks,
Jennifer

We are reviewing some changes that they have requested to the agreement and 
need to determine if we can agree to the terms they have requested.

Stephanie,

Just wanted to touch base regarding the ISDA agreement.  I was wondering if
you had a chance to look over our latest comments of 3/15/01.
