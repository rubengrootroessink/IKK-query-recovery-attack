No.  I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving 
and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the 
correct parties etc.  Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted 
for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of 
inapplicable specifics) .    We ought to also check with Joel about any 
provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment.  
I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE 
under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be 
clean from the ISDA point of view.  Mary

Mary:

Do you have a form of "approved" assignment for transferring trades into the 
Raptor vehicle?
