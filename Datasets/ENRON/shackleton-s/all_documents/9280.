Anna,

Enron Corp. will provide a certificate from the officer executing the 
guarantee that the guarantee complies with the policy for issuance of 
guarantees as approved by the Enron Corp. Board of Directors and an 
incumbency certificate from an Assistant Secretary of Enron Corp. stating 
that the officer signing the guarantee is authorized to do so.  This is 
widely accepted by all of Enron Corp.'s counterparty's in all of its 
transactions involving trade guarantees.  I will also need the effective date 
of the guarantee for purposes of insertion into the appropriate certificates 
and the guarantee.  Thanks

Clement

 Sara and Clement:

      In addition to the form of guarantee, we need to obtain from you
evidence that the guarantor has the power and authority to issue the
guarantee and that the signatory is authorized to sign.  I attach a sample
form of corporate resolutions which I hope will be acceptable to you.
Please call me to discuss at (212) 272-2547.

  Thanks and regards,

      Anna Meytina
