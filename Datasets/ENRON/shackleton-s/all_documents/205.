I responded to your notice, but I want to confirm the time for breakfast.  
The notice said 11:30, what time were you planning on meeting?

I am in at least in the morning on Tuesday. Would you like to have breakfast 
at Brent's hotel and then meet further after that?

Regards,
Randy

I am planning on coming to Sao Paulo next Tuesday if that works for you.  I 
will arrive Monday night and leave Wednesday morning.  Andrea Bertone and I 
determined today that it would be best if I came next week rather than the 
week after.  She and I will be meeting to go over the information each of us 
has regarding physical and financial trading in Brazil and she wants to set 
up some meetings with some of the commercial group to discuss some of the 
alternative deal structures for a few transactions that are being 
considered.  Please let me know if I need to block out some time, other than 
for the chief counsel meeting, for you, Andrea and I to meet to discuss 
trading issues in Brazil.  As soon as I know what your schedule is Andrea can 
set up the other meetings.  I look forward to seeing you next week.
