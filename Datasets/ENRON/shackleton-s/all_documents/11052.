Re:
-Changes to Audit Trail Summary Fine Structure-NYMEX & COMEX Divisions
-Incorporation of Spreads into One Minute Trade Time Submission for NYMEX


Modification of =01&Clear-out Period=018

The Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for=
=20
one-minute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions.=20
Presently members falling below 80% timely submission per month are issued=
=20
escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their=
=20
record by being in compliance for six consecutive months.  After six months=
,=20
the member returns to a =01&warning letter=018 level.  Effective immediatel=
y, this=20
=01&clear-out period=018 is reduced from six months to four months.  One-mi=
nute=20
trade timing statistics for the month ending April 30, 2001 will reflect th=
is=20
modification.


Implementation of One-Minute Trade-Time Classes

The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ=
ee=20
and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing one-minu=
te=20
trade time fines on the NYMEX division.  The purpose of the program is to=
=20
improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by=20
identifying individual issues, tailoring individual solutions and statistic=
al=20
follow-up.  Training will be conducted at dates to be announced during June=
,=20
July and August 2001 by a team comprised of Committee Members and Complianc=
e=20
Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee.

As incentive, any member attending the class will be allowed to =01&do over=
=018 up=20
to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between 70% an=
d=20
79%.  The member will still have to complete four violation free months=20
before his record is =01&cleared out=018 but he may take up to six months t=
o do=20
so.  Members may take one class per year.

Audit Trail Classes

? Purpose=01*to reduce number of members falling below the 80% standard for=
 pit=20
card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a =01&warning le=
tter=018=20
level.
? Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card=20
violations may:
 Attend an audit trail class, to be offered in June, July and August of 200=
1,=20
with future dates to be determined by the Floor Committee/Compliance Review=
=20
Committee.  The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems=
=20
and pitfalls.  Materials will focus on how the audit trail works and=20
successful strategies for achieving a passing grade.  Members attending cla=
ss=20
will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia=
l=20
presented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve.  Members will also=
=20
be required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card=
=20
performance rates.  Each plan will be discussed with the group and members=
=20
will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members, a=
nd=20
Compliance and Floor Department Staff.  Members attending classes are=20
strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them!
 Upon completion of the class, members will be allowed to =01&do over=018 u=
p to two=20
subsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandar=
d=20
trade time rates between 70% and 79%, on their way to achieving four months=
=20
clear.  No fine or warning letter will be issued for a =01&do over=018 mont=
h but=20
the month will not count as a passing month.  A member who falls below 70%=
=20
will receive a fine or warning letter.
 The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted a=
s=20
a failing month will not count at all, as long as the member achieved at=20
least a 70% rate.  Members still need four problem free months to return to=
 a=20
warning letter stage from a fine stage.  A member who has been problem free=
=20
for 3 months would benefit by =01&doing over=018 a fourth (and possibly a f=
ifth)=20
failing month, thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter=20
phase despite intervening failing months.  A member who falls below 70%=20
before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning=
=20
letter, as appropriate.  The member can still use a second =01&do over=018 =
month as=20
long as he meets all criteria.
 Staff will follow up with members attending the classes.  Members will=20
receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine.  They will also =
be=20
invited to discuss their percentages with staff one-on-one.  Further, staff=
=20
will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by e-mail upon request=
.
 Members are eligible for only one class per year.  A member must take a=20
class before being given the benefits listed herein.  Classes will be offer=
ed=20
in the third week of the months listed, at a date to be announced, and the=
=20
program will apply to the next full month of audit trail results.  The=20
Compliance Review Committee and the Floor Committee will evaluate the resul=
ts=20
of this program before deciding whether to extend this program into 2002.




Incorporation of Spreads into One-Minute
Trade Time =01&Pit Card=018 Statistics for NYMEX Division

Present one-minute trade time =01&pit card=018 statistics do not include sp=
read=20
times.  During the most recent NYMEX Rule Enforcement Review--the CFTC audi=
t=20
of the Exchange=01,s Compliance programs and procedures--the CFTC recommend=
ed=20
that the NYMEX Division incorporate spread trades into the one-minute time=
=20
statistics.  The CFTC has made this recommendation in the past and the=20
Exchange has committed to respond to it. The COMEX Division one-minute trad=
e=20
time statistics already include spreads.

NYMEX Division Members should note that intra-commodity spread trades will =
be=20
incorporated into pit card one-minute trade time accuracy rates after a=20
=01&phase in=018 process of approximately 90 days.  In order to avoid subst=
andard=20
percentages once spreads are incorporated, members must make sure that thei=
r=20
spread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change=
=20
Register for spreads is accurate.  If a spread print is not reported, you=
=20
will not be credited with timely submission of pit cards, even if you throw=
=20
the trade into the pit in a timely manner.

Pit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX=
=20
floor on a weekly basis.  Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics=
=20
for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread=20
trades.  These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you=
=20
can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of=20
spreads in the one-minute trade time submission percentages.  For informati=
on=20
purposes, the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells=
=20
the premium month.  In the case where the spread trades flat, the seller is=
=20
the party who sells the nearby month.

If you have any questions about this information, please call Nancy Minett,=
=20
Compliance Counsel, at (212) 299-2940, or Thomas LaSala, Vice President=20
Compliance, at (212) 299-2897.
