Sara,

The emails -- with respect to the priority agreements -- should be in lotus 
notes since I immediately forwarded the emails to Sam and Stephanie asking 
that they put the information in there.  

I think that after we get the priority agreements done in the next few days 
hopefully, we can get lotus notes updated for all of the agreements.

You are correct in that I do not need the emails.  However, when I receive 
calls from Sheila or Gary or a counterparty, I rely upon  Lotus Notes and the 
information is not there.  I know that everyone is working diligently to 
satisfy the traders' requests.  The emails you are sending can be entered 
directly into the database so that everyone can access the information.  I 
will be glad to show you how to utilize this feature.

What do you think is a reasonable date to ask Sam and Stephanie to complete 
their review of the brokerage agreements in Lotus Notes?

Sara, earlier this week, I asked Stephanie and Samantha to update lotus notes 
on the brokerage agreements that we prioritized last week.  In addition to 
lotus notes, I often send emails to the traders to keep them updated -- as 
the attached is an example.  If you would like to be copied so that you know 
what's going on -- i.e., that I am working diligently on the brokerage 
agreemetns on a daily basis, let me know.  I fgured that you did not want to 
be flooded with the emails and that, instead, we would meet every other week 
for an update.  Let me know -- whatever makes you feel more comfortable is 
what I would like to do.

Hey Aneela, here is the other email sent to Paul this week.  As you can see 
from the attached, we are still in the process of discussing key issues with 
RJ, the agreeemtn is not yet in execution posture.  In a phone call 
subsequent to the attached email, we resolved all of the issues identified 
below (in Enron's favor), except for the limitation of liability issue (see 
my previous email to you) that Paul and I are looking into.  I just want to 
convey to you that this is a priority to us and we are working on it daily.

Paul, I tried to call you at our scheduled time but you were not available.  
To expedite the process, let me tell you here what the outstanding issues are:


1. Para. 15 - Can we clarify this last sentence that you put in the most 
recent draft.  What are we meaning to say there?


2. We feel strongly about including the limitation on liability issue.  We 
especially want to limit any liability to punitive damages.  We think its 
mutually beneficial.  Did you leave this out intentionally?  


3.  Did you intentionally reject our draft confidentiality provisions?


If you do not have time to call me today, please send back an emailed 
response.
