I see so, in another words the "credit book" consists of -- or is considered 
--- "obligations" etc. but there are no other agreements.  Thanx for 
reiterating.

(1)  The only agreement that ENA is assigning is the Securities Loan 
Agreement.

(2)  Remember, ENA is also assigning the "credit book" (identified in 
Sheila's earlier email and more clearly identified in Tom Doukas' email of 
yesterday which I forwarded to ;you yesterday).

Sara, I am on hold on a conference call but wanted to talk with you about 
some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not 
holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we know 
it executed).  But for my own understanding:

1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the 
Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need 
an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a 
Securities Loan Agreement?
