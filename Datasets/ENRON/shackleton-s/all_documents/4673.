The fight for the Florida ballot continues today, with a number of ongoing
developments:

Palm Beach County began a hand recount of ballots at 7 a.m. ET this
morning, but halted it pending a judge's decision on what constitutes a
valid vote.

Miami-Dade County Tuesday night voted against a full recount, after a sample 
recount showed
little change from the original vote total. The Gore campaign is considering 
court action to
try to force a review of the Miami-Dade tally. Another recount might also be 
possible in
Broward County, where Democratic Party officials have already gone to court.

George W. Bush is leading Al Gore in Florida's official vote count by 300
votes, after most Florida counties met a deadline yesterday set by Florida
Secretary of State Katherine Harris. Harris has set a 2 p.m. ET deadline
today to receive explanations from counties on why they intend to revise 
their figures.
