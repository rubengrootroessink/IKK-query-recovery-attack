Good  morning Sarah and Jackie.
?
Do we  now have an agreement on the PrimeTrade access agreement ?? If yes 
could  you fax it to me @ 603-250-4916.
This  will then allow us to focus on the clearing docs.? Please note that 
these  clearing docs are signed by a large number of 
international/supranational  organizations as well as US government agencies. 
As such they should not  represent any difficulties and should not be 
contentious.
Thanks  for the list of traders received yesterday, I will start the process 
of getting  them logins
as  soon as the documents are signed and the software installed I plan to 
fly  to?Houston and train everybody.
?
?
PS  Ellen could you give me the name of the person who will install the CD I 
sent  you on your network...he should contact my IT colleague Mr. Sachin 
Joshi?  212-325-8926? & sachin.joshi@csfb.com
and  get assistance from him to install the software.
?
Please  do not hesitate to call me with any questions
?
Regards
?
Guillaume
