Alan,
You had sent me the Corporate Datasheet on 6/6/00 to validate that Gary had 
been added as a officer of ECT Investments, Inc.
We need to change the Attorney in fact names.  Bennett and Neil should be 
deleted.  Theresa Brogan and I should be added.  Laurel and I believe that 
Theresa may have already been added.
Thanks. Sheila
