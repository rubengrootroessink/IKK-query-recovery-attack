Subject: Enron=01,s Entry Into Global Metals Market

This morning, we announced an offer to acquire London-based MG plc, one of=
=20
the world=01,s leading metals marketers, for $446 million.  We have been=20
monitoring the global metals market for several years, and we believe that=
=20
now is the right time to enter this $120 billion market.  We are confident=
=20
that our successful business model, which we have proven in the natural gas=
=20
and electricity markets, gives us a tremendous advantage in a market that i=
s=20
undergoing fundamental change.

Our offer to acquire MG plc has been unanimously recommended by MG plc=01,s=
=20
board of directors, and we expect to close the transaction by early third=
=20
quarter of this year, following shareholder and customary regulatory=20
approvals.

MG plc is a leading independent company in global non-ferrous metals tradin=
g=20
and marketing and the only such company that is publicly traded. =20
Headquartered in London with major offices in New York and Frankfurt, MG pl=
c=20
has 330 employees in 14 countries.  It is the world=01,s leading copper=20
merchant, one of the top three merchants of copper concentrates and nickel,=
=20
and a leading European merchant of recycled metal.  Other products that MG=
=20
plc markets include aluminum, lead, tin, zinc, brass and stainless steel.

This transaction provides Enron with access to new customers and enables=20
cross-marketing opportunities.  We plan to sell Enron energy products to MG=
=20
plc customers and offer bundled products combining metals and power=20
outsourcing.  Enron will help producers and consumers manage the risks=20
inherent in volatile raw materials and energy markets, and we will improve=
=20
commodity prices for both buyers and sellers.

MG plc=01,s existing market-making capabilities and market knowledge provid=
e an=20
immediate platform upon which to overlay Enron=01,s proven ability to offer=
=20
innovative e-commerce-enabled services to commodity-based industries.  Our=
=20
new metals business will be integrated into our wholesale business by Enron=
=20
Europe CEO John Sherriff, who will work closely with Enron Net Works CEO Gr=
eg=20
Whalley.
