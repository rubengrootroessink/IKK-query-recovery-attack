All NYMEX and COMEX Division Members

RE:
Members' Forum on Brent Crude Oil Futures


All NYMEX and COMEX Division members are invited to an informational meeting 
regarding the planned Brent crude oil futures contract on Wednesday, May 23, 
at 3:30 PM, on the NYMEX Division trading floor.

This informational forum should not be confused with the special meeting of 
stockholders of NYMEX Holdings, Inc., to elect equity holder directors and 
fill two other vacant positions at 4:00 PM on the 10th floor.

The board and executive committee encourage all members to attend the 
briefing on Brent futures.
