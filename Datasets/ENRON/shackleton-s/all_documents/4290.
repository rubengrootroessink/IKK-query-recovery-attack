Investment Technology Group Limited (ITGL) -
I've e-mailed twice and phone once.

Lotus Notes - The software has been loaded on my computer but it crashes my 
system.   I've been told that it should be resolved today.

Jason:  Which files have you left messages for Mark Elliott?  Have you
emailed and phoned?  Are you up and running on Lotus Notes?  SS

(1) I have a message into Mark Seffinger at ING Barings with respect to
item 1.

(2) I left a message with Mark Elliott.  I still have not heard from him.

Jason:  (1)  You were going to verify whether or not arbitration (for the
executing brokers) is mandatory.  Have you heard anything?

(2)  Did you ever speak with Mark Elliott about ITG?  Are you still having
problems connecting with him?

Sara
