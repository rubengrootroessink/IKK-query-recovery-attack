Bill and Mary,
Who can I talk to to discuss gettting a letter of guarantee for the Credit 
Trading Portfolio at Morgan Stanley Prime Broker?  The Margin Requirement on 
the Credit Trading Portfolio from Morgan is 50 - 100% of Market Value, 
resulting in a margin requirement of $51 million for this portfolio.  This is 
very high compared the the 15% margin requirement on the Long/Short Equity 
securities. 

Jeff wants to see if a  Letter of Guarantee may be utilized to increase our 
leverage on the Credit Trading Portfolio in the Enron North America entity.

Please advise who I can follow-up with.  I would like to provide a copy of a 
form Letter of Guarantee if possible.

Thanks. Sheila
