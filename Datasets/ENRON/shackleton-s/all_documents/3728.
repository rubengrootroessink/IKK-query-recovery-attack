Sara,

I know you received some Natwest IR confirmations from Laurel because they 
referenced 2000 ISDA Definitions.  If I could get an estimated time frame of 
when we will be getting those back that would be great.  The only reason why 
I am asking is because NatWest has called me wondering when they will be 
receiving them back.  I really appreciate your help on this matter.


Thank you, 
Melissa
