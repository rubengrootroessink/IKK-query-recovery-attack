Sara, 

Would it be possible for you to forward the Early Term. Language that you 
requested be changed by Chase?  They have not responded at all and I would 
like to continue insisting by faxing it over to them as many times as it 
takes to get this issue reolved.  Let me know if this is possible.

Thanks, 
Melissa
