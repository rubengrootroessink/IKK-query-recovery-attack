Please see the attached e-mail,

 I thought it would be good to discuss this ISDA with legal as well, as Sara 
has reviewed OUC's proposed draft and has many comments.

Thanks

Bill, could Fred and I have a meeting with yourself and Russell to discuss 
credit provisions for Orlando Utilities Commission.  We are trying to 
finalize a master swap agreement.  OUC wants 4 counterparties to hedge with 
and they have requested Enron be one of them.  We can go into particulars 
when we meet.

Thank You for your time.
