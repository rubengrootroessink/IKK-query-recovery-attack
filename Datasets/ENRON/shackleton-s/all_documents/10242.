Hello Sara,

I received your voice message and called you back but you are not available.

My understanding of where we stand is not consistent with yours.  Here is my 
understanding:

Guaranty: Yes, I got the guaranty executed and have it in my possession.

Assignment  Agreement:  No, we do not have a final draft.  As I mentioned on 
Friday, the last version that Anna sent did not have all of the all of the 
edits/changes I had recommended to her implemented.  In particular, the 
arbitration language had not been changed and there were some grammatical 
edits.  I refaxed my comments today; Anna agreed to implement them and I am 
awaiting her draft.  (Anna may not have gotten some faxes on Thursday or 
Friday because her fax number changed when she changed building locations 
last week).  

Account Agreement: Yes, you are correct that Anna has to send back a revised 
draft.  She and I have been clling each other every hour.  Anna said that she 
would get back to me in two hours or so after her meeting on another matter.

Authorized Traders List:  Stephanie had originally taken on this task and 
sent me an email indicating that the list was complete.  Last week, Stephanie 
indicated that the information upon which she relied was no longer in the 
database.  Therefore, there is some confusion as to who the corporate 
officers are.  I called Richard Sage, with whom Stephanie has been in 
contact, for assistance.  He has not called me back so if you had further 
suggestions on how to proceeed, please let me know.

Account & Tax Forms: I have the requisite form -- the same one I have used 
for the same tasks for other new Enron entities - in my possession and am in 
the process of filling them out.  

Logistics: You indicated in your voice message that you were not sure whether 
I had thought logistically about getting the agreement executed.  Let me 
reassure you that I have.  In light of the above, I did not maintain the view 
that all the documents would be ready for signature by noon particularly 
because (1) we do not have in our possession final versions of two of the 
three agreements and (2) I determined on Friday that the Authorized Officers 
List might now be outdated.  I received some emails today disclosing how to 
proceed re: sending the document.  However, as I confirmed with you on 
Friday, I spoke with Mike Bruegel on Thursday and confirmed where to send the 
documents.

When you are available, please let me know so we can update and resolution on 
how to proceed on any outstanding matters.
