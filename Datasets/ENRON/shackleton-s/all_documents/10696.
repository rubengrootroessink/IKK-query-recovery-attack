Sara:  I got your message while I was out on vacation last week, but I myself 
did not have any personal knowledge about a lawyer or firm in Arkansas.  I 
asked an associate that works with me, Mike Didriksen, to check with a few of 
my energy/corporate partners to see if they might be able to make a 
recommendation.  I am not sure if Mike spoke to you on Friday, but I'll 
follow up with him to see if we came up with anyone that you might wish to 
contact.  If you want to reach me on Monday, I will be in the EB in the 
afternoon, and probably can be reached through Elizabeth Sager. Thanks. John
