Our legal specialist is Sara Shackleton and she can be reached on 713 853

regarding documentation on the partnership agreement and the assignment of 
the ISDA from the corporation to the LP.   I shall contact you, as agreed, 
next monday to discuss next steps regarding the proposed $345/t three year 
linerboard - OCC spread trade.

Thankyou for your interest,
