Laurel,

Attached is a term sheet from Merrill Lynch on ENE stock that we traded 
yesterday in swap on behalf of Corp.   ML is requesting that someone sign the 
term sheet.  Can you forward this to legal and find out who would be the 
right person to sign the term sheet.  I think it may be of an urgent matter 
b/c we are trading with them today.
Keep me posted.

Thanks,

Selena

John,
Attached is a termsheet and execution summary for the ENE swap entered into
today.  If we dont get to 1mm shares by Friday we are happy to tranche the
swap based on the number of shares executed at that time.  Please give me a
call if you have any questions or comments.  We will give you a call in the
morning to discuss if you would like us to continue our hedging activity.
Thank you.
