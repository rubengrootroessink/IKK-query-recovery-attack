Lately, people have been asking about anonymity.  It seems that some might 
like to go "incognito" on eSpeak.  But, the purpose of eSpeak is to encourage 
open communication, and communication can't be open unless all participants 
are open about who they are.  So, we will continue to require you to log in 
with your eThink IDs and passwords if you want to ask a question during an 
eSpeak event.
There are ways to ask questions anonymously at Enron.  You may send an e-mail 
to the Office of the Chairman e-mail address -- this goes to Ken Lay and Jeff 
Skilling.  You may also use interoffice mail to send a printed question to 
Ken or Jeff anonymously.
These two avenues have always been available.  It bears mentioning, however, 
that they have not been used nearly as much since eSpeak hit the scene.  You 
might say that open communication has caught on at Enron.
