Lynn-

This is a response from Jeff Kabel (manager at Enron Argentina) to my 
question regarding who was advising them on strucuturing a loan through a 
swap from a tax perspective?

Regards,

Pat

Though termed "dummy swap" for internal discussions it is actually an 
out-of-the-money swap for Enron.  That is, to ensure that Acindar repays the 
loan through the compensating in-the-money purchase of power in 2003 (with no 
payments from them before this time) we need to structure the swap starting 
in 1999 in this way.  Andersen has advised us of the tax implications of 
various financial "risk managment" structures and loans, this one qualifying 
as the former with no withholding tax levied.

We are being advised by Arthur Andersen. We are diiscussing with them on all 
tax and swap design issues (on taxation purposes).

Bernardo-

Who was advising you on the tax issues of this deal and making the 
recommendation to set up "dummy swaps"?

Pat
