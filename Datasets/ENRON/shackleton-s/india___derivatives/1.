Nothing since that report.  There was a proposal earlier last year that we 
should look into this again but Harry Arora then said that this was not going 
to proceed through London and so we never proceeded with an up-date.

Kind regards

Mark:  I've been asked whether ENA can enter into derivatives with an Indian 
company.  Do you have research regarding legality/enforceability since the 
1997 global review which ENA conducted through Allen & Overy?  Thanks.  Sara
