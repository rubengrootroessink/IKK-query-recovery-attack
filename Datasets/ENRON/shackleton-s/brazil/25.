I am planning on coming to Sao Paulo next Tuesday if that works for you.  I 
will arrive Monday night and leave Wednesday morning.  Andrea Bertone and I 
determined today that it would be best if I came next week rather than the 
week after.  She and I will be meeting to go over the information each of us 
has regarding physical and financial trading in Brazil and she wants to set 
up some meetings with some of the commercial group to discuss some of the 
alternative deal structures for a few transactions that are being considered. 
Please let me know if I need to block out some time, other than for the chief 
counsel meeting, for you, Andrea and I to meet to discuss trading issues in 
Brazil.  As soon as I know what your schedule is Andrea can set up the other
meetings.  I look forward to seeing you next week.
