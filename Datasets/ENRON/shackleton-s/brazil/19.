I spoke to Andrea and she said that the commercial guys were taking care of 
this issue.  This came up because during my trip a week and a half ago I 
suggested they let Houston know about the deal so that no one was surprised 
when the deal was executed.  They are trying to close the deal by the end of 
the month.  I am not sure if they can pull everything together in time. 
Additionally Diomedes told them that he does not want Electro buying the 
power but wants a free customer of Electro buying the power which just 
complicates things even further.  Do you have a time frame for when you can 
come to Brazil yet?  Let me know when you do and Andrea Bertone will check on 
the availability of Jose Emilio Pinto and Luis Mauer to spend some time with
us.  Talk to you later.

Hey guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I just checked with Ted 
Murphy and there is no authorization in place for trading transactions in 
Brazil.  This is pretty serious, and I suggest that someone call Ted (x33324) 
prior to execution to explain the deal and work through issues.

I know that Don had written a trading authorization memo, but since Ted has 
not seen it, I assume that in the frenzy of business, it was not submitted. 
The submission of an authorization memo to Ted for Rick Buy's and Jeff 
Skilling's execution is standard practice and required prior to entering a 
new market.   This is an interim step prior to going to the Enron Board for 
formal approval of trading limits.

I understand that Don is in Houston on vacation and I'm trying to track him 
down.

FYI-

Brazil is starting up it looks like although they still have some regulatory 
issues that need to be resolved before we will see alot of transactions.  I 
am going to ask the attorney in Sao Paulo, Andrea Bertoni, to summarize the 
regulatory issues just so we can understand this market better.

The transaction below is what they are looking at for the time being. 
Although I do not see large credit issues with this specific transaction, I 
am going to forward a memo that Julio and I wrote that outlines the credit 
procedures that need to be followed.

Regards,

Pat
