Sara: The contract was negotiated and signed in Portuguese (actually Enron 
still did not sign it). I will prepare an English translation for you.

I hear that a binding agreement and/or PPA was signed with MOEMA for a 
10-year transaction.  Do you have an English version of the MOU or PPA?  
Details?  Thanks.  Sara
