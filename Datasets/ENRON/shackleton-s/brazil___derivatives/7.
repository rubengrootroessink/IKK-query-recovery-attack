Sara:

I am sorry for not replying your e-mail before.  Marcelo has prepared a memo 
and a chart summarizing the memorandum on the matters we discussed before.  I 
will review the documents and send a copy to you during the course of the day 
today.  Once you have received them we can discuss any comments or questions 
you may have.

Best regards,

Antonio Felix

I know that you were in the Rio office during the latter part of last week.  I
sent you an e-mail last week to see how you were doing with the research/memo.
I also called Marcelo Rodrigues and left a message.  I have not heard from
either you or Marcelo and I am anxious to continue our dialogue.  Please 
e-mail
or call at your earliest convenience.  Thanks.  Sara
