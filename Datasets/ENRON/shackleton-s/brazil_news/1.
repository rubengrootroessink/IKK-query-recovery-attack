BRAZIL: CONCLUSION OF MAE RULES
Gazeta Mercantil, 01 Mar 2000, p. a-14:-
 On February 29th 2000, last outstanding matters on the rules for beginning=
=20
of operations of the Brazilian Electricity Wholesale Market (MAE) were=20
decided and approved.
Thus, first reference date for the MAE to begin operating was set for=20
September 1st 2000.
Rules had been defined into seven groups: prices formation, measurement=20
standardisation, thermal generation, energy reallocation, international=20
interchange, payment of the system's service burdens and penalties.
These first six groups will be produced within the next 10 days for approva=
l=20
by the Brazilian National Regulatory Agency for Electricity (Aneel), while=
=20
the penalties group still remains an outstanding matter to be defined and=
=20
approved before September 1st 2000.
One outstanding matter that was hindering the definition of MAE's beginning=
=20
date was conflicts between electricity distribution and generation companie=
s=20
on the way to negotiate the so-called exceding energy, which is the=20
difference between energy initially provided in supply contracts and that=
=20
actually consumed on the market.
The answer is the creation of energy "credits" whenever consumption is high=
er=20
than hired contract. Exceding energy will be converted into credits that ca=
n=20
be both exercised afterwards or traded on the market. Payment of distributi=
on=20
to generation companies have been maintained as provided in contracts.
This credit system will be in effect from September 1st 2000 to December 31=
st=20
2002. After that, remaining credits not used will be liquidated through the=
=20
optimisation tariffs that currently is about R$ 3/MWh.


ARGENTINA: OIL PRICE AND ROYALTIES
Los Andes (Argentina), 08 Mar 2000, p. on line:-
 The US$ 34 per barrel price reached by crude oil in overseas market may ha=
ve=20
a positive impact over the incomes received by the province of Mendoza,=20
Argentina, in concept of royalties, according to estimations made by this=
=20
province's government. However, Gustavo Callejas, former Secretary of Fuels=
=20
of Argentina, admitted such royalties should be increased, as provinces=20
should debate with companies and the federal government the proceedings use=
d=20
to fix such incomes.


ARGENTINA: FRAUD MANOEUVRE DENOUNCED
La Nacion (Argentina), 04 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 A new scandal involves the Argentine tax bureau AFIP. One of its officials=
=20
and a fishing company which also trades gasoline, Kiball, are involved in a=
=20
US$ 330mn fraud due to falsified accounts they presented during the terms=
=20
1995, 1996 and 1997. Through a "ghost" firm, Kiball purchased fuels without=
=20
paying the gasoline transfer tax (ITC) and falsified the payment=20
certification the AFIP grants, and even adulterated the gasoline with a mix=
=20
of different fuels.


ARGENTINA: WIND NOT SO FREE ANYMORE IN CHUBUT
Clarin, 08 Mar 2000, p.20:-
 Legislators from the Argentine province of Chubut are drafting a bill that=
=20
charge companies or entrepreneurs for using the wind for profit. Ecologists=
=20
criticise the move and believe that the bill could scare off a US$ 50mn=20
investment in a wind powered electricity plant that would create some 1000=

ARGENTINA: CRUDE OIL PRICES + REGULATION
El Cronista Comercial, 07 Mar 2000, p.2:-
 Argentine Senators are in the midst of drafting a new fuel bill that sends=

ARGENTINA: GAS DISTRIBUTORS PROTEST COMPETITION
La Nacion (Argentina), 09 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 The Argentine gas distributors association Adigas has complained that plan=
s=20
by regulatory body Enargas to allow large consumers direct access to the=20
wholesale gas market through brokers will favour new actors in the market a=
nd=20
reduce their income. Adigas claimed that its members have respected the rig=
ht=20
to access to gas transport and distribution capacity, and that the entry of=
=20
new players under more favourable conditions would make it impossible for=
=20
them to compete on an equal footing.


ARGENTINA: DEBATE OVER ACCESS TO GAS MARKET
El Cronista Comercial, 07 Mar 2000, p.3:-
 The Argentine National Gas Regulator (Enargas) will hold public hearings o=
n=20
7 March to determine whether to change or modify the current natural gas=20
commercialising and distribution system. Natural gas retailers want to be=
=20
able to compete with gas distributors, but are unable to because of the=20
current fixed rate system. Distributors believe that changing the current=
=20
system would violate concession agreements and these companies are=20
threatening to international measures to enforce the agreements. Distributo=
rs=20
also say that retailer have made no infrastructure investment in Argentina=
=20
and a change in the regulation scheme would create a disincentive for=20
investment in Argentina. Enargas is also considering the possibility of=20
allowing more small and medium sized business access to the wholesale natur=
al=20
gas market.


ARGENTINA: GOV'T WANTS TO LOWER GAS RATES
Buenos Aires Economico, 06 Mar 2000, p.2:-
 After negotiating a slight drop in telephone and electricity rates, the=20
Argentine government would like to see gas prices follow suit and will=20
conduct public hearings on the matter on 6 March, much to the dislike of=20
Argentine gas distributors. Gas companies state that contrary to the electr=
ic=20
and telephone service sectors, natural gas distribution has a very low prof=
it=20
margin and there is nowhere to cut. The government initiative aims at=20
reducing production costs for manufacturers and large natural gas consumers=
.


ARGENTINA: GAS SECTOR DE-REGULATION DEBATED
Clarin, 04 Mar 2000, p. 22:-
 Argentine gas distribution firms resist the government's decision of=20
de-regulating the local gas sector, as they do not want to share their=20
corporate clients with newcomers and be forced to reduce prices. The=20
Argentine gas sector bureau ENARGAS is encouraging a debate to implement=20
de-regulation measures to authorise companies to be supplied gas directly=
=20
from producers, without the intervention of gas distribution firms. Big fir=
ms=20
demand 10,000 cubic metres of gas daily in Argentina, and all such demand i=
s=20
channelled through gas distribution companies. The government wants to redu=
ce=20
such amount to 5,000 cubic metres allowing several firms to purchase gas=20
directly from producers, possibly implying a 10%-25% reduction in terms of=
=20
prices. In terms of daily distribution of gas, MetroGas leads the sector wi=
th=20
15.2mn cubic metres, followed by Camuzzi Gas Pampeana (10.9mn cubic metres)=

Camuzzi Gas del Sur (9.2mn), Litoral Gas (8.6mn), Gas Natural BAN (8.3mn),=

ARGENTINA: GAS MARKET RULING TO COME
El Cronista Comercial, 08 Mar 2000, p. 8:-
 The Argentine natural gas regulatory board, Enargas, now has 60 days to ma=
ke=20
a ruling as to whether large consumers of gas have free access to natural g=
as=20
distribution networks thereby breaking up the supply chain into production,=
=20
transport and distribution. Industry, gas sellers, and consumer rights grou=
ps=20
have battled head on with Argentina's gas distributors (Gas Natural BAN,=20
Metrogas, and Camuzzi, among others) to present their case to Enargas. =20


ARGENTINA: ENRON FIGHTS GAS COMPANIES
El Cronista Comercial, 06 Mar 2000, p.7:-
 Public hearings will be held on 7 March in the offices of the Argentine=20
National Gas Regulator (Enargas) to determine whether the Argentine natural=
=20
gas market needs more competition and incentives in order to reduce natural=

gas costs for the private sector. US gas company Enron which controls 35% o=

Argentina's Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) has thrown the first stone in=

the fight between gas distributors and gas brokers that want to enter the=

market. In fact, Enron believes that the market needs more competitors to=

lower rates and offer the possibility of receiving integrated services that=

BRAZIL: ELECTRICITY COMPANIES' OUTSOURCING
Gazeta Mercantil, 03 Mar 2000, p. c-4:-
 Many Brazilian electricity distribution companies began to outsource=20
