ARGENTINA: NATURAL GAS POWERED CARS
Gazeta Mercantil Latinoamericana, 20 Feb 2000, p.13:-
 With gasoline prices skyrocketing all over the world, alternative fuels have 
been put back on the agenda, and many Argentines are looking to compressed 
natural gas as a solution to reduce fuel consumption and costs. The number of 
converted vehicles in the country has grown 9 times since 1994, reaching over 
489,000 vehicles in 1999. Argentina is the country with the most natural gas 
powered cars in the world where it is estimated that over 1.3mn gas powered 
cars exist. Over 3000 vehicles per month are converted to natural gas and 
over 800 service stations in 144 cities offer it in Argentina. Of the 489,000 
units, 71.2% are used by private citizens and 10% by taxis. Natural gas 
engines are environmentally friendly and wear out engines less than regular 
gasoline. The savings in fuel consumption can be as high as 70% compared to 
gasoline, making the engine conversion investment amortizable in only 9 
months or 25,000 km. Car maker, Fiat is the only company to produce natural 
gas models in Argentina direct from th
e factory, without the need to convert the models later.

ARGENTINA: DIESEL FUEL PRICE RISE DENOUNCED
Buenos Aires Economico, 24 Feb 2000, p. 2:-
 The four associations representing road passenger transport companies in 
Argentina have announced that they will present formal complaints against oil 
companies for the recent rises in diesel prices, totalling 61% since July 
1999 in comparison with a 37% rise in world oil prices. The companies plan to 
present complaints both to the courts and to the National Competition Defence 
Commission over the increase, which has resulted in an additional cost of US$ 
150mn to passenger transport companies.
The sector has also announced that bus services between the hours of 23.00 
and 4.00 will soon be cut off, due to the crisis affecting the sector, while 
daytime services will be reduced up to 10%. These measures will result in the 
loss of up to 5,000 jobs, according to sector chamber CETAP. 
The urban passenger transport sector is now also faced with losses of some 
US$ 400mn annually due to competition from illegal mini-cab companies, as 
well as unpaid debts of some US$ 800mn arising from the liquidation of former 
state reinsurance company INDER. A 1997 decree which suspended lawsuits for 
accidents as a result of the emergency faced by the sector will expire on 31 
March, and companies fear a wave of lawsuits thereafter.
