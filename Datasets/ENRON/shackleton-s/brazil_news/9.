the interest on thermal power stations is so big that his ministry was 
obliged to refuse 4 proposals in its thermal power stations program, saying 
that there would not be gas supply enough for so many stations.
The program include 41 gas powers stations and some people say gas is not 
enough even for these 41 stations, but some of them will not be constructed 
as expected due to problems to acquire turbines which have high international 
demand and to environmental problems.


ARGENTINA: AES TAKES OVER ALICURA
El Cronista Comercial, 23 Feb 2000, p. 17:-
 US-based energy firm AES Corp. announced the acquisition of a 59% stake in 
Argentina's hydropower station Hidroelectrica Alicura which was in the hands 
of US-based Southern Energy for US$ 205mn. AES is currently concluding the 
works to install a combined cycle station in the province of Buenos Aires, 
Argentina, which will allow this firm to have a 1,500 MW installed thermal 
generation capacity in Argentina. Alicura is located in the province of 
Neuquen, Southern Argentina, and has a 1,000 MW generation capacity. In 
Argentina, AES controls the hydropower generation stations of Cabra Corral, 
El Tunal, Ullum and Quebrada and the thermal stations of Sarmiento, Dique and 
San Nicolas. It also owns the energy distribution firms Edes, Eden and 
Edelap, in the province of Buenos Aires, Such investments allowed AES to 
close 1999 with a US$ 530.4mn billing in Argentina. In alliance with PSEG 
Global, AES is constructing a combined cycle station named AES Parana which 
will demand US$ 448mn having a 826 MW installed capaci
ty. The firm has recently been adjudicated the construction of two hydropower 
stations in the province of San Juan, Caracoles and Punta Negra, with a 120 
MW and 62 MW capacity respectively, which will demand US$ 185mn and US$ 119mn 
in investments respectively. 


ARGENTINA: EDESUR EYES STAFF'S SHARES
Buenos Aires Economico, 23 Feb 2000, p. 5:-
 Argentina's electricity distribution firm Edesur announced it has made a US$ 
1.55 per share offer to take over a 10% stake its staff owns. Initially, the 
offer had been accepted by the board of shareholders of its staff, in a move 
which may involve US$ 120mn. The firm is a subsidiary of Spanish Endesa.


ARGENTINA: RESULTS OF GAS NATURAL BAN
Buenos Aires Economico, 23 Feb 2000, p. 3:-
 Argentina's gas distribution firm Gas Natural BAN closed 1999 with net 
profits of US$ 45.6mn, 4.1% over the positive results it reported back in 
1998. Such positive variation was mainly related to the firm's network 
expansion project, which allowed Gas Natural BAN to gain new clients. By 
December 31, 1999, the firm had 1.187mn clients. It also expanded the sales 
of liquefied natural gas (5.2%) compensating falls of 13.6% in the case of 
the demand of industrial users and of 11.6% in the case of the demand of 
commercial users. 


ARGENTINA: ALCOHOL FUEL COULD SAVE SUGAR SECTOR
La Gaceta (Argentina), 20 Feb 2000, p. 10:-
 The crisis-ridden Argentine sugar sector is looking to promotion of the use 
of alcohol fuel as a solution to its problem of surplus production, which 
reaches some 200,000 tons per year. Most sugar mills already have the 
infrastructure to supply raw material to produce alcohol fuel, and the move 
is seen as an alternative to crop replacement to reduce sugar production, 
given that this would take at least five years to achieve. Supporters also 
argue that high world oil prices imply that production of alcohol fuel would 
offer price advantages, while the use of alcohol as a fuel additive could 
replace the use of petrochemicals which are not renewable resources. 
The North-western refinery Refinor has expressed interest in the use of 
alcohol as a fuel additive in order to replace the use of MTBE, given that 
alcohol has the additional advantage of being exempt from fuel taxes. Refinor 
is testing a new proportion of 10% ethyl alcohol and 90% petrol for such a 
mix.
At the same time, it is argued that the existing 17 distilleries which 
produce 150mn litres of alcohol annually have the capacity to produce 600mn, 
thus allowing them to increase their exports or meet much of the annual 
domestic demand of 850mn litres which would result from the replacement of 
MTBE.
The principal concern expressed over such a programme is that it could cause 
Brazil to demand that Argentina eliminate the tariff barriers imposed on 
subsidised sugar imports from that country.


ARGENTINA: FINDING WAYS TO LOWER GAS PUMP PRICES
El Cronista Comercial, 23 Feb 2000, p.4:-
 The Argentine government announced yesterday that it will introduce a 10 
point voluntary plan aimed at increasing competition in gasoline prices. The 
measures would at best have an effect in the medium or long term. Firstly, 
the Energy Secretary will facilitate the import of gasoline for independent 
importers. Service stations would also have to register their contracts with 
gasoline suppliers in order to prevent taxation that would effect competitive 
pricing. The government will try to ensure that Repsol sells off some of its 
service stations at competitive conditions. Moreover, the Energy Secretary 
will report comparative gasoline prices and determine whether there is 
overcharging. The Secretary will keep a register of wholesale diesel prices 
and will force service stations to clearly advertise their prices. The 
government will further investigate competition practices by oil companies 
and will step up efforts to eliminate black market fuel sales.


BOLIVIA: OIL PRODUCTION FELL 15.43% IN 1999
El Diario (Bolivia), 22 Feb 2000, p. 1:-
 Bolivia produced 10.679mn barrels of oil in 1999, 15.43% under the figure 
reported during the previous year, according to this country's statistics 
bureau INE. Bolivia's main petroleum pole, the department of Cochabamba, 
produced 5.1mn barrels (47.83% of the oil produced by the whole country) 
followed by Santa Cruz (39.98%), Chuquisaca (7.47%) and Tarija (4.74%). 
In the case of natural gas, Bolivia's output of 1999 was 15.9% under the 
figure reported in 1998. The most important producer of natural gas was the 
department of Santa Cruz (41.08mn cubic feet and 44.53% of the overall 
produced in Bolivia), followed by Tarija (25.58%), Cochabamba (19.06%) and 
Chuquisaca (10.82%). 46.6% of Bolivia's output of natural gas was exported to 
Brazil.
