BRAZIL: SALE OF LIGHT'S SHARES WAITS FOR ANEEL 
Gazeta Mercantil, 01 Mar 2000, p. B-4:-
 The BNDESPar, the participations company of the National Bank for Economic 
and Social Development (BNDES), is waiting for the authorisation of the 
National Electricity Agency (Aneel) to sell its 9.23% of shares in the 
electricity distributor Light, which operates in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
BNDESPar was waiting for the register of the Securities Commission (CVM) on 
February 29th, but it was not possible to be done because Aneel had not 
approved the sale yet.
The reason for the necessity of the approval by Aneel is that the sale of 
these shares will result in the transferring of the control of the company.
The French company Electricite de France (EDF) and the American companies 
Reliant and AES own 11.4% of Light's shares, and EDF will probably acquire 
the shares currently owned by BNDESPar.

BRAZIL: ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE RISK
O Estado de S.Paulo, 01 Mar 2000, p. b-1:-
 The Industries Federation of the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo (Fiesp) is 
worried about the risk of electricity shortage in the next months since rains 
are not being enough to restore water reservoirs of hydro power stations in 
the Brazilian Mid-South Region. And Fiesp believes the problem will be even 
worse in 2001. If the Brazilian economic growth is higher than expected, 
power supply may have problems.
The energy secretary of the state of Sao Paulo, Mauro Arce, says water 
reservoirs level will be less than 60% in April (the usual would be more than 
70%) but even so he does not expect problem with power supply in 2000 because 
new electricity generation projects powered by nuclear energy and thermal 
energy (which do not depend on rains) amounting to 4,200 MW are expected to 
begin to operate in 2000. But he says situation may be bad in 2001, since 
only between 1,300 MW and 1,400 MW new projects are expected to operate in 
that year and reservoirs may be lowered to 10% on average in December 2000, 
being necessary then intense rains to restore reservoirs after that.
The energy secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Mining and Energy, Benedito 
Carraro, says that it is still too soon to affirm that there will be problems 
with power supply in 2001 and water reservoirs and estimations for the next 
months and for 2001 will only be able to be analysed in April 2000.


MEXICO: FUTURE OF BUFETE
El Financiero (Mexico), 01 Mar 2000, online:-
 It is believed that Mexican construction company Iconsa is out of the

Industrial, as Bufete's creditor banks are believed to have accepted the 
offer of a capital injection from US-based Enron. Creditor banks, including 
Serfin, Citibank and Santander, are expected to absorb part of Bufete's debt 
and to allow Enron to take over administration of the company.


BRAZIL: CSN MAY SELL SHARES OF LIGHT
O Estado de S.Paulo, 01 Mar 2000, p. b-12:-
 The president director of the Brazilian steel company CSN (Companhia 
Siderurgica Nacional), Maria Silvia Bastos Marques, informed that the company 
does not plan to acquire shares of the Brazilian electricity company Light 
which will be sold by BNDESPar (subsidiary of BNDES, the Brazilian National 
Bank for Economic and Social development) and it may even sell the shares of 
Light that CSN owns if there is a good proposal.
