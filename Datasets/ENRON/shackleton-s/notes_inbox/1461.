This is a reminder for those who have not had a chance to respond to the 
attached survey.
It would be appreciated if you take a few minutes to complete the survey.

The Internet provides instant access to global information, products and 
services.  
Technological advancements, such as faster computer processors and Internet 
connections, make access easier and more efficient.  

In keeping with Enron's vision to be the best company to work for in the 
U.S., 
the Company is considering offering a program that will empower eligible 
employees -- and their families -- by providing access to this new technology 
from their homes. 

The attached survey will give the program administrators the information 
needed 
to assess Enron employee participation.  Your feedback is critical and we 
would 
appreciate you taking a few moments to give us your opinion.  Click the link
