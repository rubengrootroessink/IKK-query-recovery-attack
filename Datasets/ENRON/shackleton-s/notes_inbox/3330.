Rather than a "redline" of their confirmation, maybe its better if we just 
send our confirmation, and see if that would be acceptable.  Can you either 
email me the appropriate draft to distribute to them or have it distributed 
directly? Thanks.

Hi, Janelle - Per our conversation this morning, the appropriate contact
would be Jackie Kmiotek-Welsh in our Legal Dept.  You can e-mail her the
agreement with the desired changes (redline) to her. If you could cc Terryl,
Leon, and myself on the e-mail, that would be great.

Jackie's telephone number is (914)390-8019.  Any questions, please contact
us.
