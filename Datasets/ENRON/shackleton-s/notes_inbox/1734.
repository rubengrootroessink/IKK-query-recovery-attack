about half a dozen crude swaps. I'll have to pull the file and get back to 
you on the credit worksheet.  I thought i did something on this back when we 
did the AAA derivative program (or am i thinking of the wrong customer?)

Just got off the phone with outside counsel for Credit Agricole.  We're very 
close. 
Tanya:  Can you tell me what products we trade? Are there many outstanding 
transactions?  Also, I'd like to make sure that the "credit worksheet" is 
current.  It looks like we're working off of something dated 1/31/96 (Terry 
Donovan!!!!!).  This must be wrong.
