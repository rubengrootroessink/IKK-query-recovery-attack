Dear Sara and Shawna:  Ofelia is leaving for a visit to Colombia to see her 
children and grandchildren on June 19, and she'll be gone for one month.    
Therefore she's asked me to tell you she'll be working at your houses on 
Thursdays as follows:

May 31:  Shawna
June 7:  Sara
June 14: Shawna
BREAK
July 26: Shawna
Aug. 2:  Sara

Ofelia says she can get a substitute maid for you while she's gone.  
Otherwise, she asks that you wait for her to return and then she can pick up 
where she left off on the schedule.

Please let me know if you want me to ask Ofelia to arrange for a sub.

Thanks,
Mary
