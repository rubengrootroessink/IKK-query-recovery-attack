Things to do:

The language that was provided by William and approved by Sara Shackleton is 
good; unfortunately, however, referencing the currencies in the Product Type 
description creates a situation where we would need a new Product Type with 
each new currency exchanged (something we should not do).   So - I took a 
stab at some 'generic' Product Type language that should allow us to 
introduce other currencies - see attached. Brent Hendry has agreed to look at 
this for us, as Sara is on vacation.

Brent, pay close attention to what's in bold; it's a belt and suspenders 
approach to understanding who pays what, but may be considered redundant.

If we are going to treat this as a Physical Product, then we have the hurdle 
of the 'Location' field to get over. 
Mark Dilworth/Jason Althaus  - for these Products, can we set the Location to 
something like NULL and have the feild pull in no text  (like the Strikes on 
the Options)?  (Something tells me we'll have to resort to something CHEEZY 
!!)

Tomorrow Rob and I are going to try to set up a Conference Call to Amita. I 
need to have a better understanding of what trading wants to offer so that we 
make sure we're representing the right Enron Entity. When we set up the first 
internal FX products, they were done with RMT b/c we knew our only customer 
would be ECC and product would be CAD. I would be surprised if they're aren't 
tax consequences associated with having ETRIC manage ENA Products.

We have not been trained on how the FX Manager works; perhaps someone can 
educate us.

Hi ,

Just so that everyone is on the same page:

As it stands now we need to create two internal products (Stack Manager) 
USD/EURO, and USD/JPY, and two Fx link products ( Fx manager) USD/EURO, and 
USD/JPY .  These will be 24 hour products manged by London and Houston Fx 
traders.
To overcome the numeric display issues volume will be in millions of dollars 
and on the USD/JPY Fx link product  we need to find a non-technical solution 
to the number of decimal places that can be displayed both in the FX Manager 
and the website.
We have the legal descriptions required for the internal products and per 
William Sarah has approved them as is. Melba can you please check on it and 
co-ordinate with William on building them.
Metals Traders should work with London Product Control to get the legal 
descriptions and GTC's approved for the mteals products in EURO and JPY
Melba can you please co-ordinate with William and Jason to get the FX link 
products set up in FX Manager . Once they are set up William and Shane should 
co-ordinate with the metals traders to test that the links are working ok. 


Thanks.

Savita
