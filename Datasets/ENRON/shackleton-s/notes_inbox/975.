Susan,

With respect to the comments provided by Rick Tucker I have provided my own 
comments below to you and Sara:

Schedule:
Part 1:
I am OK increasing the default threshold to $3MM for PCES.

Part 5:
Sara may have comments on this.

Credit Support Annex:
Paragraph 13 -Threshold
I feel that if we provide a $10MM guaranty to PCES, they should have no 
problem accepting a $10MM collateral threshold.

Paragraph 13 - L/C 
I am OK with this.

Paragraph 13(m)
n/a

Schedule 1:
Probably need further discussion amongst ourselves.


I am out tomorrow, 9/20/00, but let's try and work on this towards the end of 
the week.

Thanks
Russell
