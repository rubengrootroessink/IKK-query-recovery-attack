Great. I can not wait to see you guys. Looks like I will have to postpone my 
wine celler plans.
Us poor struggling title lawyers!! I doubt if you knew Bill Perkins from 
Tulane Law School. He
graduated with Monty's class. Monty called me today to tell me that he died a 
week or so ago.
Liver problems!! Bill was not into moderation.

I invited Monty to join us on the 16th and told him that Southwest has a 
special now with $41
flights to and from New Orleans. He said he would look into it. However, if 
you called him, I
would suspect that the odds of him showing up would increase dramatically. 
Sort of a belated
B'day. He thought it was funny that you and Donna had to look forward to May 
16th to have a
mutually open date. I told him that attractive, single, open minded, mature 
females are in much
demand in the big city.
