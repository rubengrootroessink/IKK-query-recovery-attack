Hello, I searched in Enpower and I do not see any financial trades that we 
have done with TransAlta Energy Marketing.  We may have done nymex trades 
with them.  These trades would be in TAGG.  It is possible that TransAlta is 
on the list that Sara and I have been using because of a nymex trade.  

Thanks,
Melissa
