Hi Sara,
I'm sending this to confirm that all issues have been agreed upon.  Pursuant
to our conversation, please email the final blackline to my colleague, Kim
Farr, in my absence.  Upon her review, we will be ready for executable docs!
Thanks for your help, now I can go on vacation!!!
Regards,
Dee
