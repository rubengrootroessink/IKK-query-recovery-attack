Peter -
Thanks for the note and apologies for this dragging out as long as it has.  
It is clearly our intention to transition the swap into a forward (dated, I 
believe, August 4th) in the very near future and would ask that Merrill Lynch 
hold on to all payments due to Enron until that time.  Either Sara Shackleton 
or I will call you tomorrow.

Regards,
CF

Hey Clint,
I was talking to some folks in Trading and Risk Mgmt. who are concerned that
we are sitting on swap payments that technically should have been paid to
you.  Can you send us a short letter notifying us of your intention to
complete the transition to a forward and for us to hold onto the interest
payments until such time.  Thanks and sorry for the inconvienience
