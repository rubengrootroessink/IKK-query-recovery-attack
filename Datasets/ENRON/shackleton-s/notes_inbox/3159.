Dear Sarah,
 Please forward me an updated list of officers for this entity.  I am trying 
to update the signatories for this account and upon getting approval, Mr. 
Kinneman advised me that he was no longer President of this entity.  I obtain 
my information from secretariat and as you know is not the most efficient.  
Thanks in advance.
