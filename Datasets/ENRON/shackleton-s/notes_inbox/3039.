Sara and Jeff -

I have reserved conference room EB2831 for our meeting at 2 p.m. on 
Wednesday, March 7.  


Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.



Thanks,

Jay


p.s.  Just to get a final headcount, how many people do you expect to bring 
from Legal?  From the Credit side, I have an initial head count of about 10 
people, including the members of the Credit/Power team and the Credit/Gas 
team.
