RE:  Proposed Amendments to COMEX Division Rule 4.08, "Not Held Orders"
____________________________________________________________

Attached please find amendments to COMEX Division Rule 4.08, "Not Held=20
Orders."

  As part of its Report on Gold Options Trading on September 28, 1999 (the=
=20
"Report"), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission") reviewed=
=20
the current COMEX Division rules regarding not held orders.  As a result, t=
he=20
Commission recommended the Exchange revise its rules to clarify its format=
=20
and more clearly define its characteristics using the corresponding NYMEX=
=20
rules as a model.  NYMEX Rule 6.15(H) provides that if a trading member=20
obtains agreement from the customer prior to accepting an order that it is=
=20
being accepted on a not held basis, then the trading member is not=20
responsible for failure to execute the order, absent fraud or willful=20
misconduct.  NYMEX Rule 6.16 covers orders other than not held orders, whic=
h=20
applies a due diligence standard to executable orders and a negligence=20
standard to contingent orders.  The attached COMEX rule incorporates the=20
Commission=01,s recommendations, based upon the NYMEX rules described herei=
n.

  The COMEX Governors Committee, the Compliance Review Committee, the=20
Executive Committee and the Board of Directors have already reviewed and=20
approved the proposed amendment.

The proposed amendments to COMEX Rule 4.08 affects a Special Matter under t=
he=20
terms of the COMEX By-Laws.  Accordingly, COMEX Division Members have ten=
=20
(10) days to submit a petition signed by owners of at least 155 COMEX=20
Division Memberships requesting a vote of the COMEX Division Members to=20
disapprove the amendments, pursuant to the procedures set forth under COMEX=
=20
By-Law 205(D).  If a petition is not received, or if the amendment is not=
=20
disapproved, it will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi=
on=20
(CFTC).

If you have any questions, please contact M. Dawn Lowe at (212) 299-2370, o=
r=20
