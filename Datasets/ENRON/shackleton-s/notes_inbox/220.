I was only handling the confirmation of the financial swap portion of the 
deal.  
(Chase sells to ENA) Laird Dyer told me that he coordinated with Randy 
Gay to handle the physical portion.  

Chase ---ENA---APEA---Glendale
         fin              phy          phy

...........so I don't know what happened on the physical side.  Sorry.

He is a lawyer for APEA.  Can I call him and let him know that the confirm 
was sent to APEA?  When was it sent?  Sara

I'm not sure who Philip Levy is, but yes, I did have my questions answered.  
Bob
Bruce was able to help me set up the notification for Chase, and before I even
sent it, I had confirmed the changes verbally with Chase.    

Thanks,
Diane
