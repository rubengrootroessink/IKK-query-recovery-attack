Caroline,
The  original AIG-Bermuda confirms that I did a few weeks ago that were sent 
to them had the opinion attached.  They have seen it because they commented 
on it.

We need the Bermuda law legal opinion.  What is the hold up?

Caroline:
I have received and reviewed their comments.  On the legal front, they are 
objecting to the Bermuda law opinion.  We cannot do this without an opinion.  
If we need to recommend Bermuda counsel to them we can.  On the credit side, 
for AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP they want to increase the cross default 
threshold from $1,500,000 to $2,500,000.  Paul, are you okay with this?  I am 
okay with their other comments.
