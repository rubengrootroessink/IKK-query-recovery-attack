Laurel,

It should be the same as whatever it says in the orignal contract.  In other 
words, if I am authorized to trade on Instinet on behalf of both ENA and ECT 
Investments then we need to have this contract say the same thing.  In 
reality, it is just a formality to get the software on my desktop.  

Thanks and regards,
John

John,

Will we need to reference both Enron North America Corp. and ECT Investments 
Inc. in the letter?  Or will you only be executing trades as one entity?  
Please let me know.    

Thank you
