Sara,

I spoke to Susan Hopkinson at SITA.  I proposed an alternative to her 
suggested language in the guarantee that dealt with indemnification and she 
appeared to take it positively. She stated that she would get back to me very 
shortly.  My concern was not with the concept of ENE being a primary obligor 
and not simply a surety, but with the whole notion of ENE indemnifying SITA 
for any and all kinds of losses should the guaranty become void, 
unenforceable, etc.  I'll keep you updated.  

Clem

Tom:

SITA may be anxious but their lawyers raised a few new issues that we are 
responding to.  Also, we have not finalized the Enron Corp. guaranty.  Sara

Further to our recent telcon and mails re the above CP, pls can you advise 
the status of the documentation, and when the CP can reasonably expect to 
receive them.  They are anxious to sign the docs and to commence transacting 
at the earliest opportunity.

Any update would be much appreciated so that I can advise the client.

Best regards
Tom
