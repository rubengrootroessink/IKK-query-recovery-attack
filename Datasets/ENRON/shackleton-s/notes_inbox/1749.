This is the latest state of play. I've copied Rod and Paul so they are in the 
loop. I'd like Paul to get familiar with the Harvard negotiations so he has 
some background for the other funds I'm talking to. The Harvard traders want 
to see us reach agreement by their year end which in June 30th. They're as 
motivated as we are so let me know when the docs are received.
Thanks. Per
