All publics are in draft awaiting the resolution of this issue, except Active 
Power.  There is a memo to be released today discussing the entire Active 
Power scenario which should help us figure out how to draft same per Mike 
Galvan.  Further, I have asked Galvan to double check the Carrizo warrant 
numbers that were provided because I am not sure they make sense based upon 
the certificates for the warrants.  He is checking on that matter.
