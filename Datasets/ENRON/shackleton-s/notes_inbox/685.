Julie,

I just spoke to Emma Clasby (011-44-207-369-7307) at Autex re: the 
installation on my desktop in London.  I gave her your name and number to 
help coordinate this install.  Apparently the setup here will be the same as 
the setup in Houston.  In other words no new permissioning, contracts, etc. 
will be required.  As the app is on the network in Houston I would think it 
would be fairly easy to "recreate" the script or whatever it is to work in 
London.  I will leave all that in your capable hands.  

For your information, I have now had Win 2K installed and am using it almost 
exclusively.  Therefore, you may need to direct the Autex people to the Win 
2K rollout team (I've been working with Judi Hemsley) to get it on my 
desktop.   Also, for your information, there are apparently still issues with 
Reuters Kobra so I have had to get Bridge Telerate installed and it appears 
to be working fine in the Win 2K environment.  

Please let me know if and when you hear from Emma and/or if anyone wants to 
discuss any of this further.

Thanks and regards,
John

Julie/Laurel,

I just spoke with Neil Allen regarding getting Autex installed here in 
London.  I gave Neil both of your names as contacts to get the installation 
process and any related contractual issues going.  Neil promised me that 
someone would be in contact with either me or one of you today.  Please let 
me know if someone has not contacted either of you in the next few days.

Thanks and regards,
John

I spoke with a Neil Allen with Autex about 2 weeks ago and asked him to call 
you.  I also sent him an email last week to find out if he had
contacted you yet but have gotten no response.  I called the head of the 
London Autex office who is Tony Booth but he is currently in Sweden.
I asked that either Neil or someone make contact with you as soon as 
possible.  Let me know if you do not hear from someone.  The number
to the Autex office in London is 171 369 7103 and I believe that Neil Allen's 
number is 207 369 7352.


Thanks,

Julie

Julie,

Have balls in the air with both Instinet and ITG.  Thanks.  Have not heard 
anything from Autex, though.  Can you please chase up with someone there for 
me because I do not have a contact there.

Thanks and regards,
John
