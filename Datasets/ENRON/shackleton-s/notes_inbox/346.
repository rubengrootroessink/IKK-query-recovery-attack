REMINDER MESSAGE:  ShareBuilder offers No Minimums and Low Transactions Cost 
- It's Investing made Easy!

So what are you waiting for?  Get started on your long-term investment 
strategy with ShareBuilder today!


Dear Sara,

We noticed you still have an approved, but inactive ShareBuilder Account and 
we're not sure what you're waiting for.  As you are already aware, 
ShareBuilder offers No Minimums, Low Transaction Costs and it's Easy to set 
up. Just go to 
http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/promotion/index.asp?promocode=AFASBEO
CT to get started.

With ShareBuilder, we made it easy to make regular investments in the stock 
market over time - helping you build your portfolio with companies you 
believe in. Unlike traditional online investment services, ShareBuilder gives 
you a unique and powerful way to invest in the stock market for the long-term.

* No account or investment minimums
* 3,000+ of the largest market-cap companies on the NYSE and Nasdaq, and 50+ 
index products (like SPY and QQQ)
* $2 recurring transactions, and only $1 for custodial accounts
* Real-time trades for only $19.95

While ShareBuilder does the work for you, it can't start until you create a 
ShareBuilder Plan and choose a funding option to begin investing. We offer 
three easy ways to fund your ShareBuilder Plan: automatic transfers from your 
checking account, automatic payroll deductions from your employer, or simply 
mail us a check.

ShareBuilder makes it easy!
1. Simply choose which stocks you want to invest in.
2. Select how often you'd like to invest (weekly or monthly).
3. Let us know how you'd like to fund your account.

It doesn't get much better than this! To start your long-term investment 
plans, go to 
http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/promotion/index.asp?promocode=AFASBEO
CT and click on the "Get Started" button.

If you have any questions on how to set up or fund your ShareBuilder account, 
please feel free to contact our customer care department at 
mailto:customercare@netstock.com or call us directly at 1-888-NET-STOK 
between 6 AM and 6 PM Pacific Time Monday through Friday.

Sincerely,

Brian Ratzliff,
V.P. Marketing
