John:

I have attached a memo regarding the issues that our respective credit
departments discussed.  Since negotiations began with Enron, we have updated
our ISDA form, so I will be forwarding to you today our updated version of
the ISDA Schedule.  I think the best approach at this point would be for you
to get back to me on some of the sticking points.  Maybe we can overcome the
more difficult issues first and then move to the Schedule.

I am available at your convenience to discuss the documentation.  I would
like to finalize this as soon as possible so we can start doing business
together.

Thanks,
Megan
