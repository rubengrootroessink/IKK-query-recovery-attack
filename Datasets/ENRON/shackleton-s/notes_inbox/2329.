Gareth:

    Following up on our telephone conversation yesterday, attached is a
new Certificate for ENA, incorporating the pertinent parts of your
suggested language.  I have also attached a draft of the Assumption that
we will need ENA to certify to on future FAS 145 deals.

    Please let me know if you have any questions.  If not, please
circulate the Certificate for execution.
