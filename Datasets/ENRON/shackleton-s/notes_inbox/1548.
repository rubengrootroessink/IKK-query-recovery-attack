Jason,

I received a response from my tax department and they seem to think that it
might be best to have a conversation with your tax people to better explain
how DLJIC is treated as a US partnership for tax purposes.  It is our belief
that the new regulations becoming effective on 1/1/01 will be helpful
because they will treat DLJIC as a US person.  Please let me know if you
think a conference call will work for you.  Perhaps we can schedule that
when I return from vacation.

Regards,
Suanne
