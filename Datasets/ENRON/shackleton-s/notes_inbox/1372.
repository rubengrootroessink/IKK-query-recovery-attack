We invite you to participate in an online survey on investing.  Your
valuable feedback will be used to develop improved investing services
available online.  The results of the survey will be used for marketing
research purposes only.

Respondents will be entered into a drawing to win a Grand Prize of either a
Sony DVD player (model DVP-C650D) or a Nikon Coolpix 800 Digital Camera,
each valued at approximately $500.  In addition, respondents will be
eligible to win one of 28 gift certificates to Amazon.com.  Three
certificates will be valued at $100, five will be valued at $50, and 20
will be valued at $25.  Please click on the URL listed below to begin your
survey:

For details on sweepstakes rules, please go to:

We are looking for respondents who meet certain criteria, which will be
determined on the basis of several preliminary questions.  Therefore, it is
possible that you may be screened out on the basis of your answers to these
questions-however you will still be entered into the sweepstakes.  No one
will know how you personally answer the survey, nor will anyone attempt to
contact you because of your participation.

The survey is being conducted online by MarketTools, Inc. on behalf of an
online investing service.  We hope you will choose to participate and look
forward to getting your input.
