I received a call from Bank of New York's Ray Palmer.  He indicated that he 
would like to set up a conference call.  They are a bit more expensive and we

Paul:

Laurel Adams told me that you would provide me with a name and phone number 
of someone at Chase for purposes of negotiating the global custody account.  
Do you have any information?  Thanks.
