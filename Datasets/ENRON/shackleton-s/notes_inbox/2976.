RE:
ANNUAL ELECTION =01) TUESDAY, MARCH 20, 2001

This past week you received a NYMEX Holdings, Inc./NYMEX Exchange, Inc.=20
Ballot for the upcoming election and REFERENDUM vote.  In response to certa=
in=20
inquiries, the Exchange would like to make several clarifications:

P The Board endorses the REFERENDUM and recommends that you vote =01&FOR=01=
8 the=20
REFERENDUM.

P Passage of the Referendum will increase the Board by creating three (3)=
=20
Equity Member slots.  In essence, you may lease out your last seat and may=
=20
sit on the Board if this referendum is passed.

P Passage of the Referendum requires a majority of the eligible votes (at=
=20
least 409 =01&FOR=018 votes).

P You must vote on the Referendum as BOTH a Stockholder AND a Class A membe=
r=20
on the Ballot.  If you wish to vote in favor of the Referendum, you must=20
check =01&FOR=018 in both boxes.

P Only individuals who own or ABC a seat may vote.  Lessees are not eligibl=
e=20
to vote.

P For each membership that you own or ABC, you should have received one (1)=
=20
blue Ballot and one (1) Proxy envelope.

P If you own or ABC multiple seats, you must place only one (1) ballot in a=
=20
Proxy envelope.  Do not place more than one (1) ballot in one (1) Proxy=20
envelope.

P You may Fax your Ballots and Proxy Forms to the Office of the Corporate=
=20
Secretary up until 4:00 PM on Election Day (March 20th) to (212) 301-4645. =
=20
Your name and signature must be included on each Proxy Form.

P If you are not sure that you voted correctly, you may vote again at any=
=20
time prior to or on Election Day.  Your last vote is the one that counts.

Voting machines cannot handle multiple votes by multiple seat owners. =20
Therefore, they will not be available this year.  A table will be set up in=
=20
the Members=01, Lounge on the 3rd Floor on Election Day (March 20th) beginn=
ing=20
at 8:30 a.m. to accept ballots.  If you need further clarification or if yo=
u=20
need replacement Ballots, please contact the Office of the Corporate=20
Secretary (Donna Talamo at 212-299-2372 or Dawn Lowe at 212-299-2370).
