I will be reaquainting myself with the Agreement today and Friday.
Please confirm with me that the traders are ok with Trading Edge's
clearly erroneous trade policy - that is that Trading Edge will notify
an advantaged party but will not cancel a trade unless the other side
agrees.

Thanks,

Jason

Jason,

Could you resume discussions with Trading Edge rather than continuing to
wait for resolution of the consequential damage issue, which has been
outstanding for two months ?

Thanks.
