See below for prior message regarding same.  Please advise me of the status.  
If you want these executed, send them back to me for Murphy's signature and I 
will forward to brokers.  Thank you.  Mary Cook

Prior Message:

John,  I will deliver the originals for your signature as vp of ena.  Please 
verify the executing brokers' identities, provide me a contact person at each 
firm, and return the docs to me at EB3807.  I will have our paralegal forward 
them for signatures of the executing brokers.  If you would like to handle in 
another manner, just advise.  Thanks.  Mary
