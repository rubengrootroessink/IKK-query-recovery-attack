All,

Please find attached the revised structure for the Alberta pre-pay. 


The diagrams are accompanied by narrative & should provide some clarity.

Please note that the numbers used are not actual proposed prices/volumes & 
have just been used for the purpose of illustrating the structure.  

Regards,

Soma
