Francisco,

I have verified that there are no obstacles for Enron to do a deal with a 
Chilean company from Houston.  If you have also made sure that there aren't 
any legal problems from your side, all we have to do is agree on a price.  
Please e-mail me or call sometime today.  I will be in the office today but 
gone on Thursday and Friday.  If you miss me at my desk 713-853-0508, you can 
always call my cell phone at 713-806-0612.  I look forward to the opportunity 
of doing business with you.

Thanks,

Jay
