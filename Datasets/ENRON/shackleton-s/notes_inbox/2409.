Sara:

I am looking at a transaction with MErchant Energy Group.  We have an ISDA 
with them.  It is a financial tolling deal where we will be a fixed price 
payor for power and gas and we will pay them an option premium.  They 
forwarded the attached pro forma to illustrate how the deal would be 
papered.  Can you please review the attached and let me know if it looks OK 
or what changes are required?  They indicated an interest to transact late 
this week or early next.
