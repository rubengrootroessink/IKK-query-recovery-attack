Re:  COMEX to TMS/C21 Interface

COMEX Trade data will be combined and integrated into the current NYMEX trade 
and PCS transmission files as part of the COMEX integration into the TMS/C21 
systems.  This document will emphasize COMEX issues related to clearing 
member transmissions to and from the exchange.

Intraday Files
Currently, some COMEX members receive intra-day trade files in various 
formats.  Under TMS/C21 system, members will be able to receive intra-day 
files four times a day (12pm, 2pm, 3:30pm and 5pm). Each file will be a 
complete replacement of the previous file.

COMEX to TMS/C21 Implementation
The COMEX to TMS/C21 implementation plan is to integrate all the COMEX 
commodities into the TMS and C21 system at once. When implemented, all COMEX 
OLTE and COMEX Clearing functions and reports will be replaced by the TMS/C21 
counterpart. In addition, Average Pricing of trades will not be implemented 
in the initial rollout and deferred to a later date,

Please contact Richard DeCicco at (212) 299-2852 if you have any questions or 
if you want to receive these intra-day replacement files.
