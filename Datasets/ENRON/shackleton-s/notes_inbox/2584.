Sara,

Credit has approved LD Plastics to trade some products online until the 
master agreement is finalized.  However, the EOL group also needs approval 
from legal.  This is part of the approval process Tana normally handles.  
They said that an email from legal would be fine since Tana is out.  I'm not 
sure what Tana "approves" for online trading.  I told them I would need to 
talk to an attorney up here.
