Russell,

Please give Grim a call and find out what they are trying to do.  Explain to 
him why this is a bad idea.  Sara, we don't trade financial out of ELFI so 
that's one off the list - and liquids does not have a master physical to the 
best of my knowledge. We are doing some financial business with ENA/Hess 
Energy Services today with a gty and omnibus treatment. My understanding from 
Bob Bruce is that all the finc trading is being cleaned out of ECTRIC and 
stuck somewhere else too.  I do not think ECT Singapore does financial 
trading either -so that may be another quick one to shoot down.

Hi, Tanya:

I received another call from Dana Dellacona at Hess asking about online and 
offline trading.  I'll direct her once again to Tana for online trading.  

I'll ask her again to describe the products they want to trade.

Will you evaluate?

I have received the following request from a Hess lawyer:

ECT and Hess have an executed ISDA effective 1/29/98.

Guess what they want?  The following ISDA agreements to trade financial (and 
PHYSICAL):

(1)  Amerada Hess Corp.   and  ENA
(2)  Hess Energy Services Company, LLC and  ENA
(3)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and  ELFI
(4)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECT Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(5)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECTRIC

I explained our financial trading entities.
She did not know what products each of the Hess affiliates would be trading.
Hess CREDIT:  Grim Trivino at 212-536-8979
Hess LEGAL:  Dana Dellacona at 212-536-8133

Please let me know who will handle in credit (and I'll intercede with the 
lawyer).  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY AT ENRON IS PUSHING HESS.
As usual, thanks for your help.
