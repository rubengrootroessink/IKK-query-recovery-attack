All,

There seems to be a lot of confusion, on our ability to trade with Total 
Intl.  Our London group seems to be able to trade with this counterparty on a 
regular basis, but I understand, we have a legal issue outstanding with 
Total.  Could I please have further info on why Houston cannot trade with 
this counterparty.

Thank you,

Lee Jackson
