Dear Sara,

Summer is over and it's time again to get back to school, work and some=20
serious things, like investing.  One of our goals this August has been to=
=20
build in some important features to help you with your investing strategies=
. =20
Indeed, we=0F've been hard at work implementing changes for ShareBuilder.

We=0F've just expanded our Research section, something many of you had=20
requested.  We have added a number of new tools to track stocks, access=20
information and experiment with investing ideas.  One of my favorites is=20
"What If I Had Invested" a tool that lets you analyze what would have=20
happened had you invested monthly for any period of time in any stock.  Giv=
es=20
new meaning to the concept of "20/20 Hindsight"!  Go to  to check it out,=
=20
along with these other great resources:

?  Charts and quotes on any NYSE or NASDAQ stock.
?  Interactive historical charts for stock performance.
?  Earnings estimates and financial data on public companies.
?  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings for each security.
?  Detailed company profiles.
?  Real-time market updates.

We have also installed a number of tools that you can use as easy-to-use=20
calculators that let you plan college savings, retirement, tax calculations=
=20
and so on.  These are provided as part of our Research area and will always=
=20
be available from our Home page.

Another important change regards the start of "decimalization" in the=20
securities industry - namely, quoting stock prices in decimal amounts inste=
ad=20
of in fractions.  This is something that affects everyone in the securities=
=20
industry and is intended to provide investors with simpler and more efficie=
nt=20
share pricing over time.  Decimal quotes officially began on August 28th at=
=20
the direction of the SEC for a small pilot group of stocks.  The pilot grou=
p=20
will expand significantly later this month.  Eventually, this system will b=
e=20
phased into the entire industry for all stocks. This is what it means for=
=20
you- if you are buying any of the stocks in the initial pilot group, then y=
ou=20
future purchases and quotes will be presented in decimal form; all other=20
stocks will continue to be quoted and traded in fractions.  The ShareBuilde=
r=20
stocks that are currently affected are listed below.

Shares Quoted in Decimal Amounts:
?  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)
?  Forest City Enterprises Inc. Class A (FCE-A)
?  FedEx Corp. (FDX)
?  Gateway Inc. (GTW)
?  Hughes Supply Inc. (HUG)
?  Media General, Inc. Class A (MEG-A)
?  Regal-Beloit Corp. (RBC)

Back to school brings thoughts of college, and college planning.  If you=20
don't have an investment plan set up yet for your kids (or your grandkids,=
=20
nephews or nieces), think about a ShareBuilder account to get things starte=
d=20
this fall.  If you have additional questions, feel free to contact one of o=
ur=20
customer care agents via email at mailto:customercare@netstock.com or call =
us=20
toll-free at 1-888-NET-STOK between the hours of 6 AM and 6 PM Pacific Time=
=20
Monday through Friday.
