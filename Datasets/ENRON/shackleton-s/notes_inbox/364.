TO:  All COMEX Division Brokers

FROM: Michael Campanelli, Vice President
Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:  Exchange Provided Order Tickets


Effective February 1, 2001, NYMEX will no longer provide order tickets to the 
COMEX division.  These order tickets are no longer an integral part of trade 
processing and members will have to purchase their own order tickets.  After 
February 1st the Exchange will no longer guarantee that order tickets will be 
available, as we expect existing inventory to be depleted.

If members would like a list of the current NYMEX vendors that provide these 
order tickets, please contact Ray Russo at (212) 299-2515.

Should you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at 
(212) 299-2072.
