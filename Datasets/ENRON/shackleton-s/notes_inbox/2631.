Carlos,

We will go ahead and approve the Foreign Currency product based on the=20

consequences of extending the product beyond 6 months over the next few day=
s=20
in the event that the trader wants to extend the term of the transaction=20
beyond 6 months.  Please give Jeff or me a call if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Susan
