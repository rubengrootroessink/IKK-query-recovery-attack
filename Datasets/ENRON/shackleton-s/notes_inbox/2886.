Subject: Trade Assignments


Tracy,

Attached find the trades we have in our system. Please note that the last tab 
("Merrill Final") will not be assigned to Allegheny Energy. We are currently 
in the process of reconciling all the trades wit your spreadsheet. We propose 
to use the attached spreadsheet as the master list for the trades to be 
assigned with the understanding that any discrepancies discovered between 
your records and our records will be mutually resolved by no later than April 
1st. This proposal is based on our phone conversation, whereby you indicated 
that your file might not represent the full trade population.

I have counted the trades by execution:

Gas

Daily Options 9
Nat Gas Swap 41

Power

Phys Power 623 (excluding the 4 trades not to be assigned)
Cal Option 1
Power Swap 13

Not to be assigned

UCC  1
Physical Power 4


If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best Regards,

Joram Cukierman
