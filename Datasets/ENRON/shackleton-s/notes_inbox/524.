Doesn't the Termination event apply to both now?  Or is it just S&P?  I am ok 
with either.  Despain has made his position very clear on the cross-default.  
It has to be $100 to match our Citibank revolver.  If we concede the Term 
event definition - maybe we can get them to go up to 100.  We should stress 
it is bilateral.  Who are Paul Rosica and Richard Weiss?

Spoke with Paul Rosica and left vm for Richard Weiss to discuss ENE draft 
which we will email this morning.  Paul indicated that Lehman would 
compromise the cross D/F threshold at US$70 Million and would like the 
Termination Event (or Event of Default) downgrade to apply to S&P or 
Moody's.  Jurisdiction will require further discussion.  I will ask Tanya 
about the threshold and downgrade issues now.
