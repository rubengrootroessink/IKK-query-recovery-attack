Sara,

Thank you for your response,  unfortunately the document attached was 
prepared for a power deal versus a gas deal.  Please let me know if you would 
like me to update the appropriate language or if you rather send me an 
updated template. i.e. (watts to mmbtu.)

Please advise.  Thank you - Janie

Janie:  I prepared a format last week for Allegheny for use until the ISDA 
Master Agreement is executed.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Kim:  It looks fine, and, you should use this format until the ISDA is 
executed.  We spoke with Allegheny this morning and they promise to execute 
next week.

Hi Sara,
Attached are the changes you requested.  Shall I begin confirming all 
Allegheny deals on this form until the ISDA is complete?

Thanks for your help!

Hi Sara,
Ok, I think I have properly referenced the side letter in this confirmation.  
Please let me know what changes should be made.

P.S. I am leaving at noon today, so if I haven't heard from you by then, I 
will give you a call tomorrow morning.
Thanks!
