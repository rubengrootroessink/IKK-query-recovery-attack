Sara and Stephanie -

I got a call this morning from Todd Gibson at Merrill Lynch International 
Bank, following up on the status of our $150 MM guaranty.

Can you please give me a call sometime today and let me know where we are on 
this?  I want to give him a call back to advise on status.


Thanks,

Jay
