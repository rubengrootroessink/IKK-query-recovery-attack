Sara:
I have reviewed Tanya's list and of the ones that she told us to pursue, it 
appears as if from our Lotus Notes entries that we are in fact  in the 
process of getting ISDA's put in place.  That leaves us with Fred's customers 
(other than Cross Timbers which we are getting an ISDA in place).  Any 
thoughts on how we should proceed?  Should we focus on the remaining 
counterparties on Joe's list or others?  Please advise.
