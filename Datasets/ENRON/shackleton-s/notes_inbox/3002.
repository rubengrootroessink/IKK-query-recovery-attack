Notice No. 01-84
March 7, 2001

TO:
All COMEX Division Brokers

FROM:
Michael Campanelli

RE:
Exchange Provided Order Tickets


Please be reminded that effective July 1, 2001, NYMEX will no longer provide 
order tickets to the COMEX Division.  All members and firms currently using 
Exchange provided order tickets will have to purchase their own tickets.  
After July 1st the Exchange will no longer guarantee that order tickets will 
be available, as we expect existing inventory to be depleted.

If members would like a list of the current NYMEX vendors that provide these 
order tickets, they can contact Ray Russo at (212) 299-2515.

Should you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at 
(212) 299-2072.
