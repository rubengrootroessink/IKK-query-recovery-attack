Samantha,

In the attached e-mail, Midcoast has requested a few changes to the Enron 
Corp. Guaranty.  Could you please provide Clement Abrams with these requested 
changes and let me know if they are acceptable.

Thanks,

Jason

Jason? - Attached is a highlighted re-draft of  the Schedule to the ISDA 
Master and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex for  the Midcoast/Enron 
ISDA.
The provisions where we do not agree are indicated  along with my comments 
which are embedded in the text.
After you have an opportunity to review these please  give me a call. We're 
at the point where we should discuss any remaining  items.
