Thomas:

Attached is a redline of the Client Agreement.  I know that Gary Hickerson
will be meeting with J P Morgan early next week and would like to have this
agreed.  Please advise as to what attorney will review my comments and put
me in touch with that person today.  Please let me know if you have any
questions.  Thanks.
