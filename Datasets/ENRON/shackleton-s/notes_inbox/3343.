I have reviewed the attached revised guarantee and find it acceptable, but
for the following two minor items:

Paragraph 2:  As I discussed with Sara (and she found this acceptable), we
prefer to be more specific and replace the proposed "the nature of the
claim" with "the underlying agreement and the parties thereto".

Paragraph 8:  The insertion at the end of the Paragraph should begin with
"Capitalized".

Thanks.
