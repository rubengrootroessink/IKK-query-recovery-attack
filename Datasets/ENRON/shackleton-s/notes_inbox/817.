Hi Sara,

I am currently working with FYI-Net on an EnronOnline CD for our customers 
and hoping to get copies of the:

Master Services Agreement
Project Work Description
Project Services Agreement

It is my understanding that we have these existing agreements from previous 
work with FYI-Net on EnronOnline Powerpoint presentations.

Could you please send me email copies of these contracts?

Thanks,
Lisa Gillette
