nope.....He had some limited background in credit default swaps, which is why 
Sheila wanted him, and we thought his experience with other types of 
transactions would be transferrable--allowing him to easily learn a new 
product, but apply already existing documentation review skills.  
unfortuantelty, it doesn't seem to be working well, from my perspective.  
He's too process oriented, not much analysis on display....
