Sara,

Are you certain that the executing broker - equities list is definitive?  I 
reviewed the list of executing brokers that are currently used by ECTI and 
ENA, and at least half were not on this list.  Is it possible that we are 
trading without agreements with all of these brokers?  

examples:  Lehman Brothers, Hambrecht & Quist, Thomas Weisel Partners, DLJ, 
SBC Warburg Dillon Read to name a few.  

Could you have someone check on this?  Thanks!
