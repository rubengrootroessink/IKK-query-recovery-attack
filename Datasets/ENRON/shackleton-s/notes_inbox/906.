Your move has been added to the 9/26 Churn (Tuesday evening after 5pm).

Janet Moore - EB3853 to EB3890

Robert George, Sr. Counsel will office in EB3832 staring on October 2, 2000.  
He will need a telephone and computer.

John Viverito will be turning on October 2, 2000 from Tokyo and will need his 
telephone changed back to original set up.  His Extension is 57814 in office 
EB3853.

Janette/Chaundra:

We will need telephones & computer equipment in the new offices as well by 
Friday, October 29th (before our visiting attorneys arrive on Monday, October 
2nd).  If we can get the new telephone extensions ASAP, we can add that to 
the visiting attorney log, and forward the information to the visiting 
parties and their assistants, so people will have a telephone number  to 
contact them here in Houston.  

Thanks.
