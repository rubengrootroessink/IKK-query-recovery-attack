Bob

Just so you have the answers.


Products will be settled in the currency they are traded in....that is USD, 
Euro or GBP
We would intend the new Enron softs entity to be a US entity and that the UK 
trading would be done through the arranger....EEFT.


I am presently looking at another structure, that if it can be done 
technically then I will go for that.

Lets discuss when you are out of your meeting.
