Gentlemen:

Sara Shackleton of Enron North America Corp. has asked me to follow-up on an 
engagement letter faxed to Mr. Slade on May 2.  Attachment "B" should be 
completed and faxed back to Sara at 713/646-3393.  If you did not receive the 
faxed engagement letter, please let me know by return email and I will fax it 
to you again.

Regards,
Kaye Ellis
