Sara,

Please find attached the amended Las Vegas Cogen swap.. I have faxed both the 
new and old deal tickets to you.  Please have a look.  ( I think my 
"Additional Provisions" section needs some definite work--The 45K orgination 
will not be cash settled, but will be handled via reporting entry.  )
