Hi Sara, I have updated the file attached.  I ran a report of all financial 
power trades done in 2000 and included all counterparties we have traded with 
in 2000 on this list.  I bolded the counterparties that we are having confirm 
issues with.  All of the counterparty names appear on this list as they do in 
Enpower.



Thanks,
Melissa
