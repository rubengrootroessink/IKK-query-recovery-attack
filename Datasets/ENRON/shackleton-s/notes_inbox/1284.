Sara advised that we are reconsidering the staffing of the multitude of 
structured finance transactions which include swaps.  In connection with such 
considerations, please see the last note on the attached email from Sefton.  
I will cover Raptor 3 for now.  Mary

Raptor 3 is now on. It will be the same as Raptor 2. We're also now going to 
do Raptor 4, a radically different structure using RESCO warrants. More info 
to follow  on that.

This deal is in being restructured to use Resco warrants instead of Enron 
common stock. As a result, I suggest you hold off on reviewing the docs at 
this time. Thanks!

Carol St. Clair has forwarded to me the Raptor III documents.  I will review 
only the Master ISDA which I presume is similar to the prior drafts and is 
intended to work the same role in the structure.  Please advise if you need 
me to review any other aspect of the transaction which is all otherwise being 
drafted by VE.  Mary
