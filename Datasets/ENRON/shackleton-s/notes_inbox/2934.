Richard Sage has asked us to change the slate of directors and officers of 
this entity to U.S. people, with the exception that perhaps Richard Sage will 
retain an officer title.   Will you please provide to me a list of who the 
directors will be and who the officers will be and their respective titles.  
My understanding is that these elections should take place effective March 5, 
2001.  Please advise or if you would like to discuss please call me at 
X58444.  Thanks for your assistance.  Teresa

Teresa,

Both Richard and Bryan signed the letters on 5th March.   If you need any 
other information regarding these then your best bet would be to contact 
Simon Pook.

Sorry no.   I gave them back to Simon Pook.    Do you want me to contact 
him?

Richard:  I am touching base with you regarding the change of officers and 
directors to US resident - Are we ready to do this yet?

All,
So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of 
steps of which I am aware.
I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in
etc

Thanks,
Richard
