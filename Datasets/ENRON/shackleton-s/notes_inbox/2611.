Sara,

I would like to set up a conference call with you and my counterparts at the 
City of Glendale.  They have some questions regarding some currency 
language.  Just let me know when you are available and I will set it up with 
Glendale.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear - I got the information off of a 
voice message.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim
