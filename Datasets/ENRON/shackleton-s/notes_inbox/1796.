All -
Sorry for getting this to you late, but we didn't get this until Friday 
afternoon, and for some reason it did not make it out to the team on Friday.  
I do not know when we will be receiving the rest of the documents.  Please 
provide us with whatever comments you can at our meeting at 3:00 on Monday.
