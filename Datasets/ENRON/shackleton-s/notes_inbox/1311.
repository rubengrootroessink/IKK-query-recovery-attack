Sara,
If it is a fairly straight forward task to move the Credit and Convertible 
books into Enron North America, we should negotiate the new agreements in the 
name of Enron North America.
If is is going to take more time then we should go ahead in the name of ECT 
Investments and change it to ENA as soon as the books are moved.
Please advise.
Thanks, Sheila
