Mahonia has signed the documents.  Michael Garberding has the documents to 
obtain Enron signatures.  I hope to have them later today.

Teresa,

I'm following up on whether we had our amendment to Mahonia docs (for 
rehypothecation) finally executued. I don't appear to have a copy of the 
executed docs & would be grateful if you would provide them for me if they 
have been executed. If not would you let me know whether Chase are still 
holding the docs for signature. 

Many thanks,

Soma
