sorry for the delay..I looked at Rod's wkst and it seems fine.

Also, on the Chase agmt - setoff against bank accts - Despain wanted to know 
if there was a cure period before they could do that  (we would insist on 
one).  do we even have any bank accounts with Chase and do they get swept to 
Corp? Kelly Boots did not know so I have a call into Mary Perkins. Other 
questions I have thought of, can it be any Enron afiliate with the bank 
account or just the contracting party? We MUST exclude our custody account 
for securities as this is where we hold securities that are posted to us as 
collateral from third parties.

Thanks,
tanya

Tanya:  I faxed the prior credit worksheet (from 5/16/00) to you last week.  
Aaron Armstrong in London is asking for the draft  ISDA.  Have you had a 
chance to review the old credit?  

Please let me know if I can help.  Thanks.

Tanya:

Our FX/currency traders in London need an ISDA with MSCI.  Rod prepared a 
credit work sheet on 6/16/00.  The negotiations never went anywhere.  MSCI 
has now sent their form of agreement.  

Do you want to propose new credit or use the existing credit from last year?
