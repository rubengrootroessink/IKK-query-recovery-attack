SUBJECT:
STRIP Code Changes on NYMEX ACCESSc


Currently, the commodity codes CS and NS are used on NYMEX ACCESSc to trade 
Cinergy STRIPS and Entergy STRIPs respectively.  These codes are known only 
within the NYMEX ACCESSc system.  These codes have been approved to be used 
to trade WTI Calendar Swap and SoCal Basis Swap on enymexsm.  As a result, 
the NYMEX ACCESSc strip codes will be changed.

The following STRIP code changes will go into effect on Sunday, March 25th 
for trade date Monday, March 26th:

Commodity Old STRIP Code New STRIP Code
Cinergy              CS              CE
Entergy              NS              NE

Please call the NYMEX ACCESS Control Center (NACC) for further information at 
1-800-438-8616.
