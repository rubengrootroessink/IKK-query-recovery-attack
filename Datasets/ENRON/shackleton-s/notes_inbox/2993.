I have gotten MSDW to reduce our borrowing rate from FF+85BP to FF+75 BP.
I have accepted the schedule and returned it to them and copied legal on the 
schedule.

Hi Sheila,

Attached is the most recent fee schedule (All done away trade ticket
fees waived).  Please send us a signed copy at your earliest
convenience.

I spoke with the manager of our Finance area, but he was on his way to a
meeting.  He asked me to give him a call with you later if needed, but
explained that the reason the Libid (Libor rate from 2 days ago - 12.5
bps) rate is calculated off a Libor rate from 2 days ago is strictly
standard practice in the industry.  If you would like to follow up on
this, he will be back any time after 11:00 AM EST, and I can patch him
in on a call.

Regards,
Joe
