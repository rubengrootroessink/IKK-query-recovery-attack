Are we then in the process of opening a brokerage account for ENA?

Right, neither the file nor Aneela's list indicated that we wanted such an 
account; we only determined that we'd need such an account when I 
doublechecked with Aneela yesterday.  Can you enter in lotus notes or catch 
me while you are doing it so I can see how it is done?

Cheryl,

Regarding the J.P. Morgan electronic agreements in connection with the 
existing brokerage accounts, ECT Investments has an account with J.P. Morgan 
but I see no record of an account with ENA either in Lotus Notes or in the 
files.
