Mary,

Bonus Resources Common has been taken out of Raptor I.  I am not sure who 
else in legal would need to be notified.  If you could pass along this 
information I would appreciate it.  I will have a clerk send you a complete 
set of documents when we have finalized the notional value of Raptor I this 
afternoon.

Regards,


Brad Carey
