This is about the fifth email I have received today regarding Barep.  They 
appear to be the flavor of the day counterparty.  Has a decision been made to 
only have one ISDA master between Barep and ENA and to the extent Europe 
wants to trade with Barep we will back to back the trade through ENA to 
ECTRIC?  I would rather do this than have two masters in place with the same 
counterparty.  In the US we do not use novation agreements we use assignment 
agreements.  I know several years ago when I worked at Salomon I had to use 
novation agreements with UK counterparties because of some oblique tax 
problem, is this still a requirement?  

I am attaching a general form of assignment agreement used by the swap group 
if that form is acceptable otherwise I am sure Paul has an appropriate form.



Regards,
Brent

Sara

It has been agreed between ENA, ECTRIC and the c/p referred to below to, by 
way of novation, replace ECTRIC with ENA in a weather transaction.  Pls 
advise me of any particular form used in Houston for the purpose of such 
novation. Tks.

Steve, Catherine,

Please have your legal teams for ENA and ECTRIC speed up the process to put 
the
two ISDA Master agreements in place.
That should avoid future problems with documenting our trades.

Thank you in advance.
