All,
So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of 
steps of which I am aware.
I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in
etc

Thanks,
Richard
