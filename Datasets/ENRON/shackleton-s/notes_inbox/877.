Equity Trading is requesting an Executing Broker Agreement be set up for ECT 
Investments, Inc. and Enron North America Corp with Deutsche Bank 
Securities.  We do not have one currently in place and we have done a 
significant amount of business with them in 2000  (included in top 10 for 
8/2000 YTD in brokerage commissions).
Thanks. Sheila
