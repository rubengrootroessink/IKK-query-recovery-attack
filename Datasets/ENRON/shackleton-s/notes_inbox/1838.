I am not that impressed with Fiocco Posman & Kua so I contacted  Geoff 
Applegate a partner I know at Gadens, which is a large Australian firm with 
an extensive PNG practise. Although currently working in Sydney Geoff is 
admitted in PNG and has lived there for many years. He said he would be most 
happy to to give you an advice on Ok Tedi Management Ltd. His contact details 
are; 

phone; 612 9931 4852
fax; 612 9931 4888
email; gapplegate@nsw.gadens.com.au      


I have arranged for details on him to be faxed to you.

Sara, Mallesons our principal legal firm on financial trading has an 
association with the PNG law firm of Fiocco Posman & Kua. telephone  675 320 
0127 fax 675 320 0361. I have not not been able to speak to the Managing 
Partner Mr Rio Foicco. But he is to call me back tomorrow. The major issue is 
conflicts. Mallesons don't believe they act for Ok Tedi but it is a mighty 
small place. If this crowd don't work out there are two other firms 
Australian firms; Gadens and Blakes that both have strong PNG practices.

David:  I will try to call you before I leave work today to follow up with 
any questions you may have with respect to the following items:

(1)  I am having the Representative Agreement executed by ENA and will return 
an original to your attention.  Shari suggested that Susan Musch initial the 
agreement and Susan is out until May 22.
(2)  The ENA/Aquila weather deal has not been finalized ONLY because I have 
been waiting to actually view the Floating Price source materials which our 
traders have never been able to produce or cite a reference to (so that I 
could view).  There is no problem with the deal.
(3)  As a policy matter for Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited, do you 
always agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South 
Wales as opposed to arbitration?  I am negotiating the ENA/ABN AMRO 
(Australian branch) futures agreement and am trying to determine appropriate 
jurisdiction.
(4)  ENA is attempting to draft an ISDA Master Agreement with a company 
incorporated in New Guinea (which may have a US office).  I don't know a darn 
thing about New Guinea law.  Do you happen to know if we've ever dealt in New 
Guinea, any lawyers located in New Guinea, what law is used (I guess New 
Guinea!) or whether it's similar to other PacRim countries? 

I'll speak with you later.  Regards.  Sara
