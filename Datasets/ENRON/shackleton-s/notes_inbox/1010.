Attached is an update of what has been complete and what is outstanding.  We 
are missing 4 valuations; Amerada Hess, LSI Preferred (We have the warrants), 
Merlin Credit Derivative and Chewco SLP.  Of the 31 privates plus Chewco SLP, 
we have proposal sheets and confirms for only 7.  The publics have all been 
received.

We need to have the valuations, proposal sheets and confirms to Talon by 
Wednesday for their lawyers to review.  The deadline is still to have 
everything completed by this week.

Please call me if you have any questions.



Thanks,
Gordon

Subject: Raptor Swap deadline

I have been informed that all the documentation for the Raptor swaps and 
confirmations needs to be completed and finalized by next week, 9/18-22.  
Talon will not accept any documentation after this date.  Please let me know 
if there are any problems.

Thanks,
Gordon
