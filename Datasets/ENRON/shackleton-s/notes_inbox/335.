Sheri:

As I mentioned in my voice mail, in addition to the subusers requested the 
other day, please set Sara Shackleton up so that she can read only all of the 
product groups -- she'll need to review the financial products.

Additionally, please set Marcus Nettelton  up for read only rights for 
Natural Gas Liquids.

Thanks,

Leslie
