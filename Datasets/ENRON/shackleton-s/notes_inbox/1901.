from subscribers--just like you--of SmartPortfolio.Com's reports:

****************************************************************
Brilliant; congratulations to the whole SmartPortfolio.Com team!
This is exactly the kind of newsletter I wished for. It is
written in a concise and precise way, just about right for those
who are participating in the market. It allows me to react in
proper time, and far more important, it supplies me with a
second opinion.

Chris Medernach

Let me tell you how impressed I am with SmartPortfolio's
reports. They are so informative, easy to understand and
amazingly accurate. Truly sound investment advice, which I and
my 401(k) self-directed account are thankful for.

Kirsten Strand


I 'm a "short & sweet" decision maker both as portfolio manager
and as CEO. My instincts are well-honed. All I need are
pertinent facts, the core elements of a given situation and
SmartPortfolio gives me exactly what I want. Nothing more,
nothing less, ASAP.


William L. Morgan, CEO
HATIS Corporation


It is perhaps somewhat unusual nowadays for one to comment on a
good or a service unless the comment is in the form of a
complaint, but I have to veer from what perhaps is the norm to
say...

**Great newsletter**...

I find the format and the information to be concise, incisive,
and of a great benefit in digesting the day's market action.
Plus, the letter contains informative, relevant news which is
not all that available.  All in all, you do an outstanding job
in disseminating information which I find to be invaluable for
my investment strategy.

Keep up the good job.

Jim Freyer


I am delighted to have the opportunity to tell you how terrific
I believe your reports are.  They are extraordinarily well-
researched, detailed and accurate.  I have recommended them to
so many people that I have lost count.   Again, SmartPortfolio
is the best product of its ilk on the Net or anywhere else!
