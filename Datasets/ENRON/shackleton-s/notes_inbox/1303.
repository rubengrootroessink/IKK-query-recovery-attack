Sara,

Stuart just executed an FX deal with MG.   He is hedging some cashflows for a 
metals trade that they have done.  As the MG entitity which Enron purchased 
is MG Plc, I am assuming that we should book this trade as MG plc.  Would you 
think otherwise?  Does Legal have any official documentation on the MG 
purchase that we could send to Global CP so that they can set up MG plc in 
their database.  Currently, there are lot's of MG's in global, but  they all 
have different names (MG Metal & Commodity Co. Ltd, MG Refining & Marketing, 
etc. )
