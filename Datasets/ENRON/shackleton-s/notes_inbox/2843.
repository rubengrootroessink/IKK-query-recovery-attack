Peter, Jeff,

I have talked to Clement about setting up a meeting to discuss ways that we 
can help improve this process.  He is available any time on Thursday and 
Friday, please let me know when you all are available.  

Russell

Jeff, as per my voice mail, Credit would like to follow up with a call with 
Clement Abrams to facilitate the quality and timeliness of the review of 
guarantees.  Mark Haedicke and I spoke to Rob Walls a few weeks back, but not 
much has changed, and Credit is quite frustrated.  I will participate but do 
not believe Mark needs to be involved at this level, however a senior trading 
lawyer from Houston would be helpful as this is not a unique Canadian issue, 
and I thought of you.  Tanya and Russell will set something up and let us 
know.  Regards, Peter.
