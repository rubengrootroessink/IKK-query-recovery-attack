Sara,

1. Bank of America uses ADP, a third party, to process al of its trades.  
BofA indicated that ADP process trades for "75% of Wall Street" and that they 
have confidentiality agreements in place with ADP.

2. BofA also uses a statement vendor to process account statements.  Again, 
BofA indicated that they have confidentiality agreements in place with such 
vendor.

Suggested language -    "Clearing Broker may disclose Confidential 
Information to third parties to the extent necessary to facilitate orders and 
to perform its services and obligations hereunder"

Let me know what you think.

Jason
