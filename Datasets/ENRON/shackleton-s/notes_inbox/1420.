Sara,

Thanks for your message.  Perhaps we can speak over the next day or so.  

As far as MG's business is concerned from NYC and the US, the legal support 
will be managed from Houston (Alan Aronowitz and Marcus Nettelton)  - I 
believe they will shortly be visiting NYC.

I would very much appreciate your support re: other legal issues, CFTC, etc

Thanks.
Justin
