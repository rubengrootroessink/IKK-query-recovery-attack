Re: Trading prohibition and registration requirements for all Floor Employe=
es.



Any member who is employed as a floor employee on a division of the Exchang=
e=20
where he/she is not a member cannot trade or have any trade executions plac=
ed=20
in his/her account in any products traded solely on that division.  For=20
example: Member A is a COMEX Division member employed as a clerk by NYMEX=
=20
Member B.  Member B must register Member A as a floor employee with the=20
Exchange.  Further, like any other floor employee, Member A is prohibited=
=20
from trading any NYMEX Division product in any fashion.  Naturally, Member =
A=20
may trade on the COMEX Division, where he/she has a membership.

Also note that, although members may visit the trading floor of either=20
division, they are prohibited from entering orders from the trading floor i=
f=20
they are not members of that division. (Unless otherwise provided for in th=
e=20
applicable by-laws and rules). Example: NYMEX members may visit the COMEX=
=20
floor, but cannot verbally request that someone execute a trade for them no=
r=20
can they hand a COMEX member or ask a clerk to hand a COMEX member a writte=
n=20
order. NYMEX members can only trade COMEX contracts by placing orders from=
=20
locations off the trading floor.  The same holds true for COMEX members=20
visiting the NYMEX floor.

If you have any questions regarding these requirements and restrictions,=20
please call Tom LaSala, Vice President Compliance, at 299-2897, David=20
Schneiderman, Director, Trade Practice Surveillance, at 299-2857 or Nancy=

Minett, Compliance Counsel at 299-2940.
