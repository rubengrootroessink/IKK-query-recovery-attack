Hey Sara where ya at?

I attended the Gordon Arata McCollum etc. etc. duck lunch yesterday and
ran into several of your friends. Paul Dubroc ( I might not be spelling
his name correctly my eyes are going and I could not read his name tag )
asked about you. Also, your friend, who is the office administrator was
there and so was Paul Dunning my X boss and new client.

On the news front. Guy Wall left the firm last week to go solo. I need
to call him and find out where he is going to office etc. He is a friend
of mine, and I know he will do well on his own. Unlike me, he is not one
to do anything rash. I am sure he has a plan of action. Also, on a sad
front, Jason Jumonville is at MD Anderson being treated for cancer of
undiagnosed origin. I imagine you know him. I have not worked with him,
but wish him the best. He is in a real tough spot.

Last but not least, I was able to visit with Monty at his office. He is
doing well slightly hung over but broke into a big smile when your name
came up. So, how are you? How is your portfolio? I know your Enron stock
is up. I hope your hounds are well and that things are good with you.

Drop me a note if you get a chance. Maybe we can do lunch.

Carson
