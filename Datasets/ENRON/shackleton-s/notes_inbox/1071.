Alan-

Both Darren and I are available for the conference call Monday at 6:30 p.m. 
(Houston time) to discuss financial trading in Japan.  As Jane McBride will 
have already started as the permanent lawyer for Enron Japan, I will ask her 
to attend, as well.

Cheers,

John

Sara Shackleton and I would like to visit with you and Darren about the 
implementation issues going forward on ir/fx trading in Japan. Could you 
arrange a meeting with Darren and hook in with Sara and me at 
6:30p.m.-7:00p.m. on Monday evening Houston time? If this time does not work, 
please suggest another time the early part of next week. Thanks.

Alan
