That is wonderful.  However my Prime Broker contact at Bear has still not 
been advised of the pending changes.  It would seem to me it will still take 
time for Bear to make the adjustment to the account.

This will likely delay getting the margin relief we so desperately need.

Could you please confirm that they are ready to fully enact the agreement and 
lower the margin requirements as of tomorrow?

Thanks,

Tom

The Agreements will be ready first thing in the morning for signatures.  
Final edits are being completed by Bear Stearns; all the negotiating is done.
