Luis, I have just been informed that indeed Jeff Kinneman is no longer the 
President of ECT Investments, Inc.  Gary Hickerson is the new President but I 
do not have an effective date for that as yet.  All other officers would 
remain the same as far as I know now.  I've left a voice mail for Mr. 
Hickerson's assistant to get effective date of change for me.  There was no 
announcement about this change and no one here in Legal had heard about it so 
I had to ask around a bit to find out about this change.   Sorry for the 
delay.  Deb

Dear Sarah,
 Please forward me an updated list of officers for this entity.  I am trying 
to update the signatories for this account and upon getting approval, Mr. 
Kinneman advised me that he was no longer President of this entity.  I obtain 
my information from secretariat and as you know is not the most efficient.  
Thanks in advance.
