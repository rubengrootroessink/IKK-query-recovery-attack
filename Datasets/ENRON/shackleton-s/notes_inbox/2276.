Sara, Brent, Frank and Mary -

Midcoast Energy is being acquired by Enbridge, Inc. and has posed a question 
related to our Master Swap agreement with Midcoast Marketing, Inc.  The 
question concerns the issue of a merger event and whether this constitutes an 
Event of Default if we don't provide a waiver.  The Midcoast people need to 
have this question answered before submitting a final merger proxy to 
shareholders.

The attached document is a proposed form of waiver that Midcoast crafted for 
their ISDA with Scotia Bank.  Can you please take a look at this format and 
let me know if you have any issues with it?


Thanks,

Jay
