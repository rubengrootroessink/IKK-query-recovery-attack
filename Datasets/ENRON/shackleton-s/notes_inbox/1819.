Sara - Yes we have.  It's been a while since I used them, but let me see if I 
can pull the name up for you . . . I'll get back to you ASAP.

Rob:  Have you ever directly engaged counsel in New Guinea?  I have searched 
our jurisdictional database but to no avail.  I only find Australian firms 
with New Guinea associations.  Thanks.  Sara
