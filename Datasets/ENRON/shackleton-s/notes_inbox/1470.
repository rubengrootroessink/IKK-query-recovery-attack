Thanks for your reply!!.  Per Sara's e-mail dated 7/27/00 (attached below), I 
just need to verify that the guaranty cap for Credit Agricole has not 
changed.

Would you please generate a fresh ENE guaranty and email to the lawyer (see 
Lotus Notes - Emma Nakakuki is the new attorney).  Also, please verify with 
credit (Rod Nelson in London) that the guaranty cap has not changed.  I have 
the file in my office.  Thanks.  SS
