Subject: ADR

Rahul,
Thanks for the message about the potential purchase of ADR's.  Has this deal 
gotten an approved DASH? Not yet, we will be taking it for approval in a day. 
What is the name of the entity we are buying? Mike/Lauren to advise us.

On the bank account side, just let me know what Mike decides on the tax side 
and we will work to get the appropriate accounts set up.  Is there any chance 
to use the GAIL entity?  It already has a Morgan Stanley account.Mike to tell 
us. I'd like to use that or the Mauritius entity if possible from a tax 
standpoint.

On the trading side, we have a directive that all market trades must be done 
through the securities trading process.  You need to contact Donna Lowry 
first.  She will then get you in contact with the right people on the trading 
side.  They will work with you on the details of how the trade needs to go.  
Be sure to keep Cathy Moehlman involved (she's on my team).  She will make 
sure the money gets where it needs to go.OK, we'll be in touch with Donna and 
Jeff Kinneman

 We use Morgan Stanley here to settle market trades.  As soon as we know 
about the specific entity, that account can get set up.

Talk to you soon.
Mary
