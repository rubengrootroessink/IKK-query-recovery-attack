There is an executed Assignment Agreement transfering CES's transactions with 
Bank of Montreal to ENA.  The CES Master Agreement was not terminated, but is

Re:  Bank of Montreal and ENA, have we terminated the CES agreement (and has 
credit agreed)?  I don't know how Susan F. "inactivated" the CES ISDA with 
BOM,  We are in the process of negotiating with BOM in connection with our 
Japanese affiliate.  Sara
