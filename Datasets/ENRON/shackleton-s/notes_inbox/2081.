Sara,
I have been dealing with GSI in Euros for a month now.  There is no problem 
there.
However, for me to deal in US$ with GS, ECL must have another ISMA in place 
with GS&Co.   
I cannot do US$transactions right now based on what I have between ECL and 
GSI.   and GSI will not finance US$ and US treasury repos.
That has to be done by GS & Co.
I thought you were aware of these differences.
thanks
Derek

Derek:  Gail Shanley (Goldman Sachs & Co. in N.Y.) sent me Enron Credit Inc. 
documents (with Goldman Sachs & Co.).   Enron Credit Limited will be dealing 
with Goldman Sachs International in London.  I'll try to find out who the 
London lawyer is and have the docs sent to Denis O'Connell who is the lawyer 
for Enron Credit Limited.
