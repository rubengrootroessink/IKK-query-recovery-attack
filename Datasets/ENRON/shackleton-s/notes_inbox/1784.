Hi Sara,  the financial companies attachment above is all companies that we 
have trades with that flow in 2000 or out into the future.  I also have 
indicated whether we have a financial contract with the company or not (to my 
knowledge).  The financial deals attachment is all of the deals that flow in 
2000 or out into the future and the terms of those deals.

Let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks,
Melissa

There are two companies in the attachment with similar names.  PPL 
Corporation and PPL Electric Utilities Corporation.  I am about to call my 
contact at PPL to determine if the deals under PPL Electric Utilities should 
be changed to PPL Corporation.  We are selling on both deals under PPL 
Electric Utilities Corporation so hopefully they will sign our confirms.  
They have already signed one of our confirms but I may have to change the 
name on the confirm and re-send it.
