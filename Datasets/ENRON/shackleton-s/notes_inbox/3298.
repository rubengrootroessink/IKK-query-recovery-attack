Sara,

I do know that we just spoke today, however, I failed to bring an important
issue up in our conversation. It is a priority of ours to allow Amerada Hess
Corporation to trade on Enron On-Line. I know that this would be possible if
we execute the ISDA.  Therefore, can you give me a call so we can discuss an
approximate date for execution or some other way that Amerada Hess
Corporation could begin to trade on Enron On-Line.

Thanks,

Mark,

I would like to contact you in order to follow up to your conversation of
last week with Mr. Chuck Cerria regarding executing an ISDA between
numerous
Hess entities and numerous Enron entities.  Unfortunately, I do not have
your phone number.  Could you either call me or e mail it to me?

Thanks so much,

Dana Dellacona
