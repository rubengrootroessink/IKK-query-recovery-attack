Notice No. 01-171

ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS
ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS

FROM:
Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

SUBJECT:
COPPER WAREHOUSE RATE CHANGE


The following new rate for the handling out charges for copper has been 
submitted to the Exchange by Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. for its 
facilities located in Amarillo, Texas.  Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. is a 
COMEX Licensed Warehouse for the storage of copper deliverable against the 
COMEX Grade 1 Copper Futures Contract.  The new rate will become effective on 
July 1, 2001.  All other charges remain unchanged.


RATES AND CHARGES FOR COPPER

Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc.                Effective:  July 1, 2001

Handling Out Charge per Short Ton:  $  22.75

The following previously published charges for the storage and handling of 
copper at Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. remain unchanged.

Handling Inbound per Short Ton:   $    0.00
Monthly Storage Charge per Short Ton:  $    3.60
Preparation of Warehouse Receipt:  $    0.00
Replacement of Each Warehouse Receipt:  $    0.00
Bill of Lading:     $    5.00
Insurance Premiums:    $    0.00
Loading Trucks & Trailers or Rail cars:  $    0.00

Please be advised that the warehouse, at its discretion, may require handling 
fees based on the new rates for all copper physically in storage as of the 
effective date.  That is, the old rates are not grandfathered for copper 
already in storage prior to July 1, 2001.

Specific to handling out charges, invoices prepared by COMEX Clearing for 
warrants issued prior to July 1, 2001 should not call for reimbursements for 
handling out charges based on the new rates.  Reimbursements for these 
warrants should be based on the old handling out rate because the warehouse 
was prepaid based on the old handling out rate.  Though the warehouses have 
been prepaid the handling out charges based on the old rate, the party 
shipping the metal out on or after July 1, 2001, may owe the warehouse the 
difference between the old and new rates upon shipment, at the discretion of 
the warehouse.  Clearing Members are advised to carefully review invoices to 
ensure that reimbursement payments are not made for charges that have not 
actually been prepaid by the market short.

Should you have any questions or require any additional information, please 
contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608, Nick Galati at 212-299-2920 or Ploumi 
Efkarpidis at 212-299-2334.
