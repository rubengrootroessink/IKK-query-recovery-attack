As you may have heard, Dell is voluntarily recalling certain batteries from 
some of the Dell Inspiron laptops.  The recalled batteries were sold with the 
Inspiron 5000 series notebook computers, comprising both the Inspiron 5000 
and the Inspiron 5000e models (please see the bottom of your computer for 
model ID).  The systems and/or batteries were shipped to customers between 
January 7, 2000 and March 21, 2001.

As a result, you will have the opportunity to return your battery in exchange 
for a new one.  We appreciate your patience through this process.  Dell is 
committed to your continued service and is sincerely apologetic for the 
situation.

Please visit  http://support.dell.com/i5000battery/, or call Dell at 
866-220-3355 for further information.
