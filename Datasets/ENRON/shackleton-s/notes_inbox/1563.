Sara, Ted,
CSFB has a new electronic access trading system for futures. 
Financial Trading, Enron North America, wants to establish a relationship to 
support this trading.  

To Trade Electronically, ENA will need a Standard Execution Agreement 
(Executing Broker) and a "Prime Trade" Agreement which supports the 
electronic trading.  
Financial Trading is still assessing whether we need a Give-up agreement with 
CSFB or will utilitze our current relationships with Carr and Prudential to 
hold the positions.  I have confirmed with Bob Klein that noone at Enron 
currently trades futures with CSFB.  
Trading will include Futures including, S&P, Nasdaq, Fixed Income (bonds, 
eurodollars) and Forex.

Sheila
