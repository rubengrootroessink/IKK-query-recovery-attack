Paul,

Susan Randolph of Goldman Sachs called inquring as to the status of an ISDA 
draft between GSCM and Enron Corp.  I requested a credit review of this 
counterparty back in December; however, with how busy we've been, no Credit 
Worksheet was never submitted to Legal.

Could you prepare one at this time.  Apparently, GSCM has entered into a 
trade and would very much like a master in place.

Thanks.

Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey
