Brenda,
Please find attached a copy of the ISDA.
ENA will execute the prepay and as discussed  our deadline has been brought 
forward to next Friday.
I will send you a copy of the term sheet as soon as I have received it.
The contact on the trading side in Houston is John Wilson.
Toronto Dominion Texas are funding the Prepay with Morgan Stanley Capital 
Group Inc and Enron Corp guarantees will be required for the WTI swaps.

Regards
