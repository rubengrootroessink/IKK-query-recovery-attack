Stuart, this instruction is correct.  I will be sending you an e-mail 
addressing the issues relating to the Bonus and Tetonka shares covered by the 
equity derivative later this morning.  I understand that Peter is addressing 
the Helms-Burton issues on the Beau Canada shares.

Greg

Attached is a representation that should be included in all Raptor 
confirmations in which the underlying security is publicly traded on a 
Canadian exchange.

Greg/Peter - please confirm that my instruction to Mary is accurate.
