Sara,

Would legal support an initiative to create an internal web-site for the 
confirmation of intercompany deals, as opposed to sending a hard copy 
confirmation for each deal?  I would envision it working something like this:

Each intercompany entity can go to a web site and click on a button that says 
they agree to be bound by the terms of the 1997 ISDA between RMT and their 
company (assuming they  have one, or course!)  They could then enter a site 
which would display the economic terms of each deal they had traded that 
day.  They would have to click a "confirmed" button next to each deal, as 
opposed to one button for the entire day.  If they disagreed with a deal, 
they could click a "Do not agree" button, which could then bring them to an 
email screen, where they could alert us to the discrepancy.  

What kinds of issues would this raise from a tax/legal perspective?  Would 
this have the same effects as a legal document?  Do you have some time where 
we could get together and discuss potential issues?  Thanks.
