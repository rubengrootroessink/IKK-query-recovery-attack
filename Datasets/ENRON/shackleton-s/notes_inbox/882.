This came in this morning, the long awaited Bear Stearns forward.  I haven't 
looked at it but will take a look at it shortly after I update some slide for

Jeff:

The Forward Draft that you have been expecting is attached for your review.
Registration rights language reflecting the most current EITF ruling will be
available in the near term and when ready will be forward to you for review
as well. At least you can begin reviewing the Draft of the proposed
confirmation. We will look forward to hearing your comments at your earliest
convenience.
