Ed - After we hung up, I though a bit more about trading with Mirant.  In 
light of the letter sent by Mirant on February 26 that stated ". . . no 
further transactions will be enter into under the agreement", we need to call 
Mirant prior to completing the trade.  I will try on this end, but you should 
also try.  The contact is Nicole Russell (678) 579-7489.
