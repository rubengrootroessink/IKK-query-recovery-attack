Sara - per my voice mail, I am forwarding you a copy of the long form 
confirmation that Peoples has suggested we use prior to an ISDA between 
Peoples Energy Corp. and enovate, L.L.C.  We would like to execute on this 
Gas Daily option early next week so your input on the most expedient 
documentation is extremely appreciated.  Any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Gregg

Gregg,

Can you have the appropriate people on the ENE side review this document
which we hope to use in the interim between PEC and enovate, L.L.C. for the
Gas Daily Option deal (Financial).  We hope to transact by very early next
week, which may need some quick turnaround.

Thanks,
