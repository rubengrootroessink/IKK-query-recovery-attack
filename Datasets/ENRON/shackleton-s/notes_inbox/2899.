Lauren -- 
Just to confuse things a bit more, I'm only doing the physical power side of 
this deal.  Sara Shackleton, a colleague in our Swaps Group, will be handling 
the financial trades piece of this deal.  Her email address is 
"sshackl@enron.com" and I've copied her on this email so she can see the side 
letter you drafted.
Regards,
Janice

Dear Shari:
Per my voicemail, please find attached drafts of the above agreements (in
one document) which we have prepared on behalf of our client, Allegheny
Energy.  I have attempted to incorporate the credit terms that were agreed
late this evening between Tracy Ngo and Tom Orr; however, please note that
these drafts have not been reviewed by them nor by anyone at Allegheny.
Therefore these drafts remain subject to their review and comment.  Please
let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks.
