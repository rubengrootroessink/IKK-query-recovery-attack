All COMEX Division Brokers

RE:
Exchange Provided Order Tickets - FINAL REMINDER


Please be reminded that effective July 1, 2001, NYMEX will no longer provide 
order tickets to the COMEX Division.  All members and firms currently using 
Exchange provided order tickets will have to purchase their own tickets.  The 
Exchange will not guarantee inventory on form types (futures/options, 
3-part/4-part); it will only guarantee a supply of order tickets until July 
1, 2001.  As the current inventory is depleted it is permissible to 
interchange remaining forms in stock.  There are no restrictions concerning 
the recordation of option orders on futures order tickets or future orders 
being recorded on option order tickets; provided all relevant order 
information is recorded.

If members would like a list of the current NYMEX vendors that provide these 
order tickets, they can contact Ray Russo at (212) 299-2515.

Should you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at 
(212) 299-2072.
