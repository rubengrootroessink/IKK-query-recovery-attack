Good Morning Sara,

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the Kroger Company. I spoke with 
Chali Zulu, (Legal in London), and they have changed the Credit Risk System 
to reflect that Jeff Kinneman executed the trade rather than Sueng Taek. 
Although I do not agree with the tactic to bypass the legal due diligence, 
they are anxious for us to execute the confirmation. Please advise your 
opinion and an update on the authorization status of Sueng Taek as a trader 
for ENA. If all is acceptable please provide me with an e-mail with 
authorization to execute the confirmation.

Also, I wanted to follow up with you regarding the JP Morgan Equity Basket 
Swap Confirmation.

Regards,

Jorge
