Jim -
Have we received the signed version from them?  Do we need to sign it as 
well?  Where does this deal stand?  I haven't seen/heard anything since we 
last spoke with CSFB.  Have you seen a confirmation for the amendment to a 
swap?  Please let me know.  
CF

Clint--the term sheet below is the 'final'.  It has received all approvals 
necessary at CSFBi.  They are going to send us the signed version on Monday 
(the delay simply because it will come from London), but it is all done and 
we can count on it as a final deal.
