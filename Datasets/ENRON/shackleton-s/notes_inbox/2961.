Gary,
Sara and JP Morgan have agreed to the Futures Agreement.  The remaining open 
issue is the schedule of Interest Rates they sent us.  I sent a copy to Glenn 
Divencenzo yesterday for him to run the traps on his side.
We want the same reference on the credit and Debit side.  We want US to be 
off FF not 90-day t bill.
Sheila
