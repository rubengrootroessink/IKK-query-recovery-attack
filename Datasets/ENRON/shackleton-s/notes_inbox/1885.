Anytime will be okay with me.  I have a 9:00 Lotus Notes training session 
this morning which should last until about 10:00, but I think I'm free the 
rest of the week.  Just let me know.  Erica is making minor revisions to one 
of the lists and the rest are ready, so I just have to do my short memo re 
procedures.

Marie

Subject: Brokerage Agreements

Marie:  Per my voice mail, please let me know when you will have your memo 
regarding brokerage agreements and the updated list available.  I would like 
to include Susan Flynn, Sheila Glover and Laurel Adams in a meeting since 
they are all involved in the brokerage agreement process from time to time.  
I'll try to gather the group if you provide me with some suggested times.  
Thanks.  Sara
