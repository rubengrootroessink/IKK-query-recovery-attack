A financial trade v24545 was done with Total International Limited.  This 
entity is subsidiary of a very good credit customer, TotalElf (S&P rated 
AA-).  Risk is acceptable, small volumes, short tenor, but from a legal 
standpoint, I do not think this entity is an "Eligible Contract Party" as we 
have no guaranty support or financial statements to support trading.  I 
noticed that quite a bit of financial trades are currently booked in London 
with this customer.  Does Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. 
(London financial) have the same ECP requirements as ENA.  If so, I would 
like to know how they have established eligibility.

thanks
