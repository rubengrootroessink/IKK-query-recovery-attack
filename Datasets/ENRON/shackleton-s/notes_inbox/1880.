Please proceed with the assignment referenced above.  In terms of the ISDA 
assignment and amendments, everything was satisfactory.  I do however, 
recommend, if this hasn't already been done, that legal bless the guaranty 
language by Conectiv.

If you should have any comments or questions, please contact me at x5-7712.

Rgds,
Ed Sacks

 Tracy, as we have discussed, the CP's attorney wants to get this assignment 
in place before the end of April.  The CP's attorney calls almost daily to 
check the status of the assignment.   I know you are busy, but could please 
take a look at this document today?   Thanks!
