Thanks, Sara. We have some deals brewing but nothing has been signed since 
Moema. I believe I have sent you a copy of the Moema Agreement, right? If 
not, let me know and I will forward one to you.

Hi, Andrea!  Attached are updated power trading forms currently in use by 
ENA.  I thought these may be useful.  I have forwarded these already to 
Sami.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance or if you have a recent 
English translation of a current deal.  Regards.  Sara

Sara --  As discussed last Friday, attached is the referenced agreement 
reflecting the power group's most current thinking, though it has not yet 
been finalized or rolled out.  I also attach the 'long form confirmation' 
used for trading wholesale power with counterparties who have not executed a 
master agreement or other sort of enabling agreement with EPMI.  The latter 
document has not been updated in about nine months' time and thus may not 
reflect all proposed changes to the master.   The formatting may also be out 
of kilter on Annex  A of the latter document but I believe it should be 
usable by the person you are assisting in Brazil.  Please  contact me if you 
have any questions.  --David
