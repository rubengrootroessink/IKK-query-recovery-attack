Joe, I think the counterparty's point is correct.  Per our discussion, it i=
s=20
unlikely that the price would be described as both a "settlement price" and=
=20
be expressed as a high and low price, so I think the suggested revision=20
language in your 9/12/00 e-mail to Sara would be better.  I would just inse=
rt=20
one phrase in the final sentence for clarity:

"In the event that Monomers Market Report publishes both a high and low pri=
ce=20
[for "CG Propylene Contract"] then the Floating Price shall be the arithmet=
ic=20
average of such high and low prices." [my insertion bracketed and in bold]

one suggestion on the last sentence.

"In the event that the settlement price published by the Monomers Market=20
Report includes both a high and low price then the Floating Price shall be=
=20
the arithmetic average of such high and low prices."

thanks, lee

Sara,

We have a Counterparty with a request to adjust our Floating Price language=
=20
for Propylene so that a couple of things will be specified. =20
1) the published rate is currently one price only.  They do not specify a=
=20
high and low (But it is possible that a high and low do get published)
2) the publication calls the price "settlement" price in the description.=
=20
Therefore, this Counterparty wishes to see that language included.=20

Current:
The Floating Price for each Calculation Period shall be the arithmetic=20
average of the high and low price of Propylene - chemical grade in=20
Cents/Pound published under the headings =01&North America Product Prices f=
or=20
the applicable month: CG Propylene Contract=018 in the month-end issue of=
=20
Chemical Market Associates, Inc.=01,s Monomers Market Report for the applic=
able=20
Calculation Period

Suggested
The Floating Price for each Calculation Period shall be the settlement pric=
e=20
for the applicable Calculation Period of Propylene - chemical grade in=20
Cents/Pound published under the headings =01&North America Product Prices f=
or=20
the applicable month: CG Propylene Contract=018 in the month-end issue of=
=20
Chemical Market Associates, Inc.=01,s Monomers Market Report for the applic=
able=20
Calculation Period.  In the event that Monomers Market Report publishes bot=
h=20
a high and low price then the Floating Price shall be the arithmetic averag=
e=20
of such high and low prices.

Give me a call in the morning and I'll get you a copy of the CMAI publicati=
on.

Thanks,
Joe
