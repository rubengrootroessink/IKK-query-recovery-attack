Who is the proposed counterparty, Coillte Teoranta or the joint venture 
entity, Lousiana Pacific Coillte (Ireland) Ltd?  This will help me focus my 
research.

Brent,

We currently have not executed any transactions with this counter-party, but 
Rob is ineterested in doing a financial deal with them once an ISDA gets put 
in place. Thanks.

Brent:  Attached is Aparna's email.  Please call her if you have any 
questions.  I believe that Rob Scheuer is the commercial person.

Aparna:  Would you please advise Brent as to whether or not a transaction has 
been executed.

Sara,

Here is the link to the Irish entity I just spoke to you about. The Lumber 
Group is looking to get an ISDA in place with this entity but I wanted to get 
your input on the legal side on an entity that is probably 100% owned by the 
Irish Govt.

Thanks for your help!
