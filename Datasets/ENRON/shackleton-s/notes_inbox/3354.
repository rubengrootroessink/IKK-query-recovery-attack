Alan and Sara,
Last Wednesday we met to discuss the change of organization structure for the 
two Proprietary Debt Trading Books, Credit and Convertible, from ECT 
Investments, Inc. to Enron North America.  

As a follow-up to our discussion, the attached document details the accounts 
maintained at prime brokers and OTC Swaps currently in place for these two 
books.

My initial discussions with the three prime brokers have indicated to change 
the account name, from ECTI to ENA, and the related tax ID will require an 
Assignment and Assumption Letter.

Please let me know if anything else is required.
Thanks. Sheila
