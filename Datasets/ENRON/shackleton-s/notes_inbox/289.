Sara,

The executing broker agreement for Raymond James is currently in the legal 
process.  Raymond James has informed us that they will not execute any trades 
for us until the agreement is complete.  Therefore, can we please move this 
agreement up on the priority list.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Aneela
:-)
