Hi Sara:
Yes, I am interested in the Mineral Law Institute books. Also, I would like 
to convert my hall
closet to a wine cellar a la yours. I know you had a little difficulty with 
your contractor but
would you still recommend him. Yours looks beautiful to me. I am not sure 
that I knew Joe. Who
was he with? See you after October 15th.
Geaux Tigers.
