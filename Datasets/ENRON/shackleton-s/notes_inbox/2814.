Akasha:
As we discussed, the following are my questions:

1. We need some verification that the debt that is referred to in the 
articles is the debt of Asia Pulp & Paper Co. Ltd. ("Asia Ltd."), the entity 
referred to in the Confirm and that the amount that is the subject of the 
standstill is at least 10 million.

2. We need to confirm that the debt that is the subject of the standstill 
meets the following characteristics:

 - it is a bond or a loan 
- it ranks pari passu with other senior, unsecured debt of Asia Ltd.
 - it is not payable in the currency of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized
 - it is not governed by the law of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized
