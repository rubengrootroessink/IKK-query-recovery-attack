Re:  Revised =01) Crude Oil Futures Expiration Date


It has come to the attention of the Exchange that some earlier publications=

may contain an incorrect Futures expiration date.  Please be advised that t=
he=20
expiration date for the Crude Oil Futures December 2000 contract month (CL=

Z00), has been revised to Friday November 17, 2000.

Should you have questions regarding this matter, please contact the Floor=
