Have we formed a separate legal entity or entities for agricultural trading, 
or are we planning on using ENA?

At Larry Lawyer's request, we are trying to compile a list of all of the 
legal entities doing trading or other actitvities within the Enron Global 
Markets arena.

Thanks for your help.

Alan
