Whichever one of you has the great good fortune to work on the subject,=20
please note the following:

All 5 additional events of default should also be Material Adverse Changes=
=20
with respect to the ability to hold collateral.

In addition to the financial triggers indicated in my earlier-emailed credi=
t=20
worksheets (FYI=3D=3D> ), the following should be added as additional termi=
nation=20
events:

1  The Manager ceases to be either Joseph Kleinman or Simon Glover and an=
=20
alternate Manager acceptable to Party A has not assumed the responsibilitie=
s=20
of Manager.

2  In the event there exists one Manager, if the Manager resigns, is=20
terminated, or is otherwise incapacitated for a period exceeding one month.=
 =20
In the event there exists more than one Manager, if for a coincident period=
=20
of one month, all of the Managers have resigned, been terminated, or have=
=20
otherwise been incapacitated.


Add the following definition:
 "Manager" means any person(s) with ultimate authority to direct the=20
investments of Party B, currently Joseph Kleinman and Simon Glover.

Replace Independent Amount definition with our new hedge fund standard.  It=
=20
is extracted from Union Spring as follows (But change the Independent Amoun=
t=20
to be each of the two counterparty's pro rata share of $50,000; The pro rat=
a=20
distribution should be based on the allocation of the trade volumes):

(A)  =01&Independent Amount=018 means with respect to Party A, the amount s=
pecified=20
as such for Party A in each Confirmation, or if no amount is specified, zer=
o=20
and means with respect to Party B the amount specified as such for Party B=
=20
which may be either increased or decreased from time to time in a=20
Confirmation, which amount as modified shall be the Independent Amount=20
applicable for all outstanding Transactions, provided, however, that in no=

event shall Party B=01,s Independent Amount be less than $100,000 if there =
are=20
any outstanding Transactions.


Add as an additional termination event and Material Adverse Change for Enro=
n=20
the following:

(ii) The following will constitute an Additional Termination Event with=20
respect to Party A:

Party A=01,s Credit Support Provider=01,s credit rating is below BBB- by S&=
