You had done the master and it appears restricted.  Could you look at this 
one?  Karolina Moran is preparing a credit worksheet to forward to us.  
Thanks.

Karolina in my group will contact Mark.  Karolina investigated the 
transaction and transacting entity to ensure that no CredReserve was 
required.  She will also ensure the documentation is acceptable.

Typically, on deals such as this (financing related) the lender will dictate 
the terms - to avoid subordination or early termination events.
