Sara and Susan,

I've reviewed the attachment and the tax rep's. in Section 6 are fine for 
both parties.  I know we spoke yesterday about the fact that the confirm is 
currently drafted such that it will be sent to Bob Crane in Houston but, if 
at all possible, can we substitute "Brad Kirchhofer" in place of Bob?  Also, 
I'd prefer that Stadacona's fax number (and phone number, if applicable) be 
included in the confirm in place of any Enron U.S. entity's.  Finally, as you 
suggested, we should include a line on the signature page where Brad will 
sign that will allow him to designate his physical presence (i.e., Canada) 
when he executes the agreement.

Please call me at ext. 35777 if you'd like to discuss.
Best regards.
