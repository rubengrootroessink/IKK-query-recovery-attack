Among other things they want an unlimited collateral threshold, and moreover 
Sara has quite a legal objections to there format.  They have a loosely 
written ISDA with J Aron, although Goldman provides them financing, so this 
ISDA can be loosely written because they have recourse on the financing side.

Bill, could Fred and I have a meeting with yourself and Russell to discuss 
credit provisions for Orlando Utilities Commission.  We are trying to 
finalize a master swap agreement.  OUC wants 4 counterparties to hedge with 
and they have requested Enron be one of them.  We can go into particulars 
when we meet.

Thank You for your time.
