Dear John and Sara,

I refer to my email to you both earlier today on this same issue.  As I 
suspected, IBJ are not willing for a rating drop to trigger an IBJ event of 
default.  I may well have misunderstood John's latest proposal so would be 
grateful for clarification on what exactly it is we are proposing as soon as 
possible.

Thanks and sorry!

Jane

Dear Jane,

Thank you for your email regarding the additional provision related to
collateral issues.

I heard that Mr. Konishi and Mr. Matsui did discuss how the matrix
arrangement works when the exposure between IBJ and Enron excesses the
credit line limit  but did not talk about the wording with respect to the
rating downgrades.

First of all, IBJ do not agree that the ratings downgrade triggers an Event
of Default.
As the foremost aim of entering into CSA is to reduce exposure and enjoy
ample
liquidity in trades between IBJ and Enron and not to avoid an event of
default due to ratings downgrade, your proposed words for ratings downgrade
do not seem to have the same effect as CSA.
IBJ can only accept to reduce the exposure by terminating Transactions or
posting collateral when the exposure between IBJ and Enron excesses the
credit line limit for rating of either party specified in your matrix.

I hope you will understand our position and look forward to your response
soon.

Regards
