Per our discussion, OK on the registration provisions.  On it overall--we 
would like to have the cash settlement option taken out [if, down the line 
when it unwinds or settles, you at Global Finance would like to have that 
ability we would simply raise the issue with Lehman and attempt to 
renegotiate].

Here is a draft forward confirm from Lehman.  It should incorporate the 
registration rights language we want as well as the most recent accounting 
language that is needed.  Please review and give me your comments.  If we are 
happy with this, then we should move forward with an ISDA with these guys.  
Thanks in advance for your comments.
