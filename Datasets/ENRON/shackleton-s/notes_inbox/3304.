Stephanie, I have forwarded your draft to my colleague Anita Khosla who has
just recently concluded negotiations with Enron Credit Corp and is therefore
probably better placed than myself to take on board these negotiations.  She
can be contacted on (212) 538-1938 and at antia.khosla@csfb.com

Thanks and regards

Keith
