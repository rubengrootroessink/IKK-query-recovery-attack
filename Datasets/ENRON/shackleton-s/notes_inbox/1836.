We would like to proceed with the closing of our trading account with Cargill.
I have checked with Matt Brown, book administrator for the Crude Oil account 
as well
as Mark Fondren, his supervisor, for any outstanding issues with Cargill and
nothing has appeared to need discussion.

Please let me know if I may be of any assistance in this effort,

Thanks
David

Thanks for the following email regarding our ability to remove Cargill in our 
reporting
system and replace their name with another broker.

May we discuss the possibility of closing the account with Cargill?

They added approximately $20,000 to our margin account by mistake on April 
7th.
They reversed this yesterday but didn't take out the entire amount, so it 
appears to be
creating additional work for our margin accounting group. Gerri Gosnell in 
our margin accounting
group may be contacted at 3-4898 if you need further information.

Please advise,

Thanks,
David

We trade with hsbc,sakura, and carr for other commodities....so we can't 
delete them.
With your permission, I'd like to delete Cargill for now as we need to add 
Bank One
as well as a new broker which we will start doing lumber trades with called 
'Paul Court'.

Thanks
David

You previously asked which clearing houses you could delete from our 
"Exchange Furture Net Position Summary" sheet in order to insert new houses 
(eg, Banc One).  Feel free to delete Sakura Dellsher, Carr, and HSBC.

Hi,

We discussed closing the Cargill account yesterday possibly but you said that 
you wanted to keep it for
additional trades. We will leave it open as long as you need it.

I talked to Bank One this morning and they said that initially only NG would 
be traded; however,
if you want me to talk to them about rates for doing CL trades, I will.  
Legal should have the paperwork
set up within the next 2 weeks.

My contact at Bank One is Linda Bergdahl, 312-408-8333.

Regards,
David
