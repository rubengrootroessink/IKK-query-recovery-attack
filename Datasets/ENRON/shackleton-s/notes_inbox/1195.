I wanted to thank each of you for your contributions to date on Project 
Raptor.  By the end of the day, we will have successfully completed 
incorporation of the public hedge candidates into the Raptor Structure.  I 
appreciate the hard work that it took to get it done and apologize for being 
a pain.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that the private hedge 
candidates must be completed ASAP.  If you have any checklist response forms 
that have not been completed for the private candidates, please complete and 
return them to me immediately.  Many thanks.

Stuart
