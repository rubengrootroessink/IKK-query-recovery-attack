Susan:? Sorry for the delay in  getting back to? you.? We have agreed to
delete the CSA and will  return a blackline to? you shortly.? You may recall
that SITAe xpressly requested that theE nron agreement be governed by
English law which  is why we prepared thisd ocument for execution by our
affiliate in London  with the jurisdictionl anguage appearing in the prior
draft.? There are  still issues posed by? your markup and we should be able
to schedule a  conference call next? week.? Thanks.??  Sara

Further?  to my fax of 3 October we have SITA's instructions.

1 - Credit  Support? Annex :

SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to  have a Credit? Support
Annex.? SITA have asked that ENRON come up  with a proposal on? the term and
volume of the transactions on the basis  of no Credit Support? Annex.

2 - SITA does not provide investment  services ancillary to its? main
activities. Do you have any news  regarding ENRON on this? point?

Kind regards
Susan?  Hopkinson
