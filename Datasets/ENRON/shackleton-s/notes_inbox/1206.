Hi Sara, yes I sent this to David and I thought I copied you on it.  I can't 
find it in my e-mail I must have deleted it.  If he still needs it I can 
re-send it.

Thanks,
Melissa

Sara:  When you have a chance, would you forward me a sample confirmation for 
one of the above referenced trades?   I want to have a sense of the terms of 
the GTCs attached to such confirmations when an ISDA master is not in place 
with a counterparty.  Thanks.  --David
