Thank you for the response.  However, as originally instructed, the company
name used on the confirm should be Compagnie Papiers Stadacona, as this will
ultimately be the proper legal name for the operating entity.  There will be
no "de" in the name.

Also, you have confirmed that the settlement of the contracts will be via
the Citibank Toronto accounts, but who will trigger the settlement and
request the transfer of U.S. dollars to Bank of America.  Will this be done
by someone in Houston, will it be automatic, or will I need to request a
wire transfer to Bank of America to fulfill the settlement?

Thank you for your help.

Pat Rigey
