Greg Malcolm, the Contract Administrator for OPG just called to give me the 
status of the following documents that were sent to them by Enron last fall: 

1. EEI (physical power): Said I could expect to receive their comments to our 
initial draft no later than the end of Feb.

2. ISDA (financial): I should receive a response from them on our initial 
draft sometime in March (he was not as firm on this timeframe as he was about 
the EEI). 

3. Physical Power Confirms:  For interim trading, he is going to send me the 
form of confirmation template they want to use for sales to us. 


Commercial People: If these timeframes are unacceptable given whatever 
business you are trying to do with OPG - please ask your equivalent at OPG to 
put pressure on OPG's Legal Dept. There is nothing I can do to make this go 
any faster.

Thanks,
