Dear Sara,

It's February and that means it's time to start getting your tax returns 
prepared, making your IRA contributions for the last year and it's a great 
time to start planning for this year. The subject of this month's newsletter 
talks about how ShareBuilder (Netstock's online brokerage) can help you with 
all of those things.

INVESTING ISN'T A SCIENCE... IT'S A DISCIPLINE
In January I talked a little about why it is important to think about 
diversification. Whether you are new to investing or have been for a while, 
you've probably witnessed the stock market's volatility over the past year. 
It's important to realize you have to manage your investment risk and there 
are some simple investing strategies that can help.

Once you have determined the amount you can invest each week or month, the 
next step is to create a diversified portfolio that meets your long-term 
goals. If you're only investing in one or two stocks each month, you're 
putting all the risk into the performance of those specific stocks. 
Increasing the number of securities in your portfolio can help you by 
spreading risk among a broader group of stocks. To set up a ShareBuilder 
Plan, just go to http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/account/index.asp 
and select "ShareBuilder Plan".

INDEX SHARES... AN EASY WAY TO DIVERISIFY!
Another great way to add diversification is by adding Index Shares to your 
portfolio. Index Shares are securities that represent the composition of a 
broad-market, specific sector, or international index. With Index Shares you 
instantly get exposure to a portfolio of stocks.

Here are the Top-10 Index Shares available through ShareBuilder:
? QQQ - Nasdaq-100
? SPY - S&P 500
? DIA - Dow Industrials
? XLK - AMEX Technology Select
? XLE - AMEX Energy Select
? XLF - AMEX Financial Select
? IWB - iShares Russell 1000
? IWM - iShares Russell 2000
? IYH - iShares  US Healthcare Sector
? IYF - iShares US Financial Sector


THE SHAREBUILDER NO FEE IRA: A POPULAR CHOICE!
In December we introduced the ShareBuilder No Fee IRA, which allows you to 
setup automatic monthly funding for your retirement account. You can invest 
in a portfolio of stocks automatically through monthly contributions, just 
like you would a regular ShareBuilder Plan! This IRA lets you effortlessly 
get invested throughout the year to help fund your retirement.

Instead of writing a last-minute check for $2000 (and missing a whole year of 
investing), open a ShareBuilder IRA now. Not only do you still have a chance 
to contribute for 2000 taxes (before April 15th 2001), you can also set up an 
investment plan for 2001! Simply select the stocks you want to invest in, 
specify your monthly contribution, and the account will run automatically. 
You will be investing your funds throughout the year without your having to 
think about it. Just go to 
http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/promotion/index.asp?promocode=iraedu 
to get started today!
