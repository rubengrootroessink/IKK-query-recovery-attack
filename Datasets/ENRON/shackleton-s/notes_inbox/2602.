Hi Sara,
I'll look forward to receiving the docs for Enron Corp.  As far as the
vacation went, I wound up being sick for the first 5 days, and my husband
got it after me.  It was cold and rainy in Ft. Worth all but one
day.............I'll stop whining, it was still good to be away for a bit,
but don't think I'd do the drive again!
Thanks for the update,
Dee
