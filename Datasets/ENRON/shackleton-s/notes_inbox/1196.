(1)  Will the ISDA be negotiated prior to execution of your trade?

Yes

(2)  Are the trade terms correct?  You did not send me a deal ticket.  Who is 
the trader?  Who will be responsible for payments under the swap (i.e., will 
it be you)?

The project company Lost Creek will be responsible for payments under the 
swap.

(3)  What happened to comments on the Schedule?

We spoke to Barclays about your comments and other comments from BR (who is 
the admin partner for Lost Creek).  A revised version of the comments is due 
from Barclays.  I will send them to you once I get them.

(4)  Who is reviewing the Schedule from a credit perspective?

No one from Enron credit is reviewing it.  It does not seem that such a 
review is necessary -- give me a call and we can discuss.  We have negotiated 
a cross acceleration to the project debt (rather than a cross default).

Could you please refax my comments to your Schedule?  I have misplaced my 
version.  Thanks.  Sara

Yes
