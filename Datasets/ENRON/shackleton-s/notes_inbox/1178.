Sara,

Due to Marathon Ashland's recent request, for future confirms can we change=
=20
the current Rounding paragraph in their Confirms to:

For the purposes of the calculations of the Floating Price(s), (i) prices=
=20
quoted in Gallons shall be converted to Barrels by multiplying such price b=
y=20
42 and (ii) Floating Prices(s) relating to commodities quoted in (i) gallon=
s=20
shall be rounded to five places, (ii) MMBtu=01,s shall be rounded to four=
=20
places, (iii) barrels shall be rounded to three places and (iv) gigajoules=
=20
shall be rounded to four places. If the number after the final number is fi=
ve=20
(5) or greater then the final number shall be increased by one (1), and if=
=20
the number after the final number is less than five (5) then the final numb=
er=20
shall remain unchanged.


Everything same, except adding the Gallons to Barrels conversion.

Thanks,
Joe
