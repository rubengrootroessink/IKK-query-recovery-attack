Spread Margins
Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Note the outright margin 
level required for the February 2001 contract, and all subsequent contracts, 
are different.  Spreading between differently margined contracts results in a 
higher spread margin than between equally margined contracts.  Below are 
margin examples of certain spreads where the legs of the spread are margined 
differently.
Example of Clearing Member Rates for February 2, 2001 Margin Change:
One Long February Copper HG   (1 x $3,000)           =        $   3,000
One Short April Copper HG         (1 x $1,000)           =   -     $   1,000
Net Scan Risk                  ($3,000-$1,000)         =        $   2,000
Spread Rate                   (1x $420)             =   +     $      420
Total Requirement                                 =        $  2,420
