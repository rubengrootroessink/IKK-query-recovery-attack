Hi Sara and Ed!
ConEd wants to get going on an ISDA , in parallel to adjusting as necessary 
the long form for the upcoming transaction.  They believe that the ISDA will 
not be negotiated in time for when they want to execute, thus the parallel 
documents.  
Regarding the annex, the uncoming deals could potentially be swaps, collars, 
or participating swaps.
I think they are quite eager to hear our response.
Thanks,
Janelle
