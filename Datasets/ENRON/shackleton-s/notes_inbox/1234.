sara -- you would LOVE this.  ryan told me that he in fact has NOT approved 
the language in the avici deal.  he has kicked the issue up to rick causey.  
if rick wants to change it, we will do it.  but who knows what he will do?!  
apparently EBS is adament that it must be done today.

ben has also signed the confirm.  i have it with me.  will get you the 
original when i have LJM's signature as well.
