Sara,

Let's discuss when you have a minute or two.  I'll start reading through this 
now.

John:

Attached are the ISDA and CSA which reflect our earlier discussions.

As you will see, these documents contemplate L/Cs as collateral. We think
that the L/C provisions as written would work well for both of us, but are
open to your ideas on the form of the L/C and other mechanics in view of the
fact that you probably have more experience with this form of collateral for
ISDA trading relationships than we do.

Please take a look, forward to the appropriate person in the ENRON legal
group and give me a call to discuss.

Best Regards,


Kim Noble
