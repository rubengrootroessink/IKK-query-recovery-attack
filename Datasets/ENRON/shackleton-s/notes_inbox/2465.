I think permitted transfers are those where the credit support is the same 
(Enron Corp gty covers affiliate we transfer to).  In this case, FUNB could 
transfer to an affiliate if they were willing to gty the obligations of the 
affiliate (since it is the parent, in essence).

Tanya:

For purposes of "Transfer", shall we permit both parties to transfer to 
Affiliates?  Would FUNB require a guaranty?  Or do we feel strongly that 
neither party should have the ability to transfer except with the written 
consent of the other party?
