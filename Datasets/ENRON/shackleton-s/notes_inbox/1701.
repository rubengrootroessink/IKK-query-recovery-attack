Rogelio, the new corporate purpose looks very good to me...However, as you 
know, Enron has recently acquired the largest metals trader in the world 
(MG), and as of next september we will be able to trade metals on the London 
exchange...I want the new corporate purpose to include "metals" in its 
definitiion....

Peggy, let us know if this is O.K. with you so we can proceed....

Thanks and regards.
