SUBJECT:  MARGIN RATE CHANGE  FOR NOVEMBER 17th, 22nd, 29th, 2000



MARGIN RATE CHANGE  FOR NOVEMBER 17, 2000

Effective Date:      Friday, November 17, 2000  (close of business)

Futures Contract:    Palladium Futures

Contract Months:    November and December 2000 Only
NYMEX Division Margins on Palladium Futures Contracts
Effective Date:      Friday, November 17, 2000  (close of business)

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):           Old:  $15,000   New:  $25,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin):               Old:  $16,500   New:  $27,500
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):           Old:  $20,250   New:  $33,750

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.
 Because there is a difference between the margin required for the November 
and December 2000 delivery months and other months, each spread which 
includes either one leg in the November or December delivery month will have 
its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $10,250 starting 
on November 17th.  This figure is determined as follows:

Example At Clearing Member Rates for November 17th Margin Change:
One Long December Palladium   (1 x $25,000)          =        $25,000
One Short March Palladium         (1 x $15,000)          =   -     $15,000
Net Scan Risk                  ($25,000-$15,000)       =        $10,000
Spread Rate                   (1x $250)             =   +     $   250
Total Requirement                                 =        $10,250
