Goldman Sachs has given us the go-ahead to do Foreign Listed Equity Options.  
Kara Saxon at Goldman called me today and will follow-up with an e-mail.  
Goldman Sachs legal has said that we can trade as we currently do as ECT 
Investments, Inc.  This includes the whole European market.  I asked her to 
check on Canadian and Australian.

I will forward Kara's e-mail tomorrow.
Sheila

Sheila-

I just left you a voicemail.  My 2 follow up questions on the European
listed options are:

What is the title of the person in London who would be making the
investment
decisions doe Enron?

Does Enron have any foreign subsidiaries?

Thanks,
Kara

You are interested in trading European listed options and not OTC Euro

Thanks,
Kara
