Harry / Sara

Duke Energy has given us their guaranty language for review.  We are asking 
them to cover a subsidiary that trades physical and financial NGL products.  
I have asked them to use our language to which they refused.  I was told by 
other people in the credit group that Duke only issues guarantees in their 
language.  The credit manager did indicate that he would certainly be open to 
any suggestions we would have to their language.  Can you both look at the 
attached guaranty and let me know if it is acceptable for their issuance or 
if you have comments.

I would really appreciate your help as we have begun selling to them.

Thanks,  Cathy Tudon
