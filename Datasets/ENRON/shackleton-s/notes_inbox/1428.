Attached are revised drafts of the proposed Schedule and Addendum, marked to
show changes from the most recent draft you reviewed.  I believe that we
have implemented most of the changes you suggested.

Although I have discussed most of the changes with Kim Noble, she may have
additional or different thoughts.

We are still in the process of reviewing the form of Enron guaranty, and
will come back to you with comments shortly.

We look forward to hearing from you at your early convenience.

Best regards.
