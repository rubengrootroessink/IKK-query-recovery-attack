Good morning Sara,

I was out yesterday. I was involved in a car accident. I was at a red light 
behind 6 cars and a Toyota Corolla slammed into the back of my Explorer. I 
was at a stand still, he was travelling at least 40 mph.  I ended up with a 
severe case of whiplash. The other guys car was completely totalled. I'm sore 
today but ready to work.

I listened to your messages this morning. Aneela Charania, X 30951, is aware 
of the transaction. I spoke with Jeff this morning and provided him with her 
phone number.

Please advise if I can be of further assistance.

Thanks for your response regarding the JP Morgan Equity Swap Basket 
Confirmation.

Enjoy your day!

Jorge

Jorge:  I never heard back from you about the ENE forward amendment?  Did you 
speak with Jeff Nogid?

These are fine as long as the economics are what was agreed.
