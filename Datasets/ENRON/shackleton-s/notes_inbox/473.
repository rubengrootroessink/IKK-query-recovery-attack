Sara, Mahesh and Janine,
I suggested to John that if someone needs to sign the EISL agreement for 
Instinet that Shane Dallmann could sign.
 Gary had suggested that Shane be one of the directors for EISL. 
Thanks. Sheila

Sara,

What is the status on this?  I really need to get this issue resolved as soon 
as possible as this application is a key part of my ability to begin trading 
in Europe.

Thanks and regards,
John

I am still waiting for a copy of the services agreement and the form of 
signature.  Instinet is proceeding but will still require this information.  
Thanks.  Sara
