Nicole - Please find attached: (a) a revised version of the Guarantee 
containing our proposed changes; and (b) a note indicating what changes have 
been made to the original form of guarantee that was forwarded to us with 
Mirant's letter of February 22, 2001.  I will be talking to Derek Halvorsen 
at BP this afternoon to confirm the provisions of Section 8 with him.  I 
would appreciate it if you would review the events delineated in the preamble 
of the guarantee to confirm that they are correct and provide me with any 
comments you may have by return email.
