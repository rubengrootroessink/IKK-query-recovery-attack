Charles,

I would be grateful if you could respond to me as referred to below, namely:

Provide a copy of the CFTC filing.

Confirm whether any CFTC licensing/registration/disclosure requirements 
applied "upward" to any Enron entities or their officers - I assume not.

Thanks.
Justin

Dear Markus,

I currently don't have any info that would help here.  I suggest we address 
these issues with Lou/Marcelo when we are in NY this week.

Regards

Shona

Edmund/Shona
 
I thought either or both of you would be best placed to assist Bob Bruce with 
this request.

 Would you be kind enough to see what documents we have which may throw some 
light on MG's licensed status.
As to whether any licensing/registration/disclosure requirements may apply 
"upward" to any Enron entity, Edmund do you know whether the MG parent 
company was so obligated?
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

Hello, Justin and Jon, this is Bob Bruce with the Enron North America legal 
department in Houston.  Sara and I were wondering about a few things; perhaps 
David Gilberg or someone else is already addressing these issues --

(1) Given MG London's status as a licensed FCM and CTA, did Enron's 
acquisition of MG require any CFTC filing?  If so, Sara and I would like to 
get a copy of the filing.

(2) Sara and I were also curious as to whether, or to what extent, CFTC 
licensing/registration/disclosure requirements may apply "upward" to any 
Enron entities or their officers.

Please let us know if you can shed any light on these areas, or if there is 
someone else we should be checking with on these matters.  Thanks -- Bob
