As we discussed last Friday during our meeting,
I am sending a fax to you as this is being written.

The two-page fax depicts our margin account information and zero
open positions. Since we haven't traded with them since last summer, the 
traders
have decided to close their account. 

Cargill has made errors recently in our margin account, which Gerri Gosnell
maintains, and it would be to our advantage to close the account to prevent
further potential errors on their part.

I've received the approval of the traders and book administrators.

Please let me know what our next step should be.

Thanks
David
