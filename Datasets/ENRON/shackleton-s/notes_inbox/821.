Erin -

Attached for your review is the form of assignment that ENA is asking be 
executed in connection with the assignment of FX trading from MLIB New York 
to MLIB Ltd.

Two additional questions:  1) How and when will we and our traders know the 
Migration Date? and 2)  When can we expect to receive the guaranty?



Thanks,
Stephanie
