I don't know if Enron has any ISDAs with Sumitomo or Sakura, but I thought 
I'd forward this to you just in case.

As a result of yesterday's merger between Sumitomo and Sakura Bank, our
main dealing counterparty Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets, Inc. has been
renamed to SMBC Capital Markets, Inc..  The credit rating is unchanged.
