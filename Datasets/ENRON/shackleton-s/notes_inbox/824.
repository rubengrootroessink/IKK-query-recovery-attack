FYI.

You've already seen these comments.  Limitrader requested that insert our 
comments into the document.  They had trouble reviewing our fax.  Let me know 
if I can throw you a life preserver - I've got some extra time if you need 
help on anything.

Attached is the LIMITrader agreement with our proposed changes.  We may
