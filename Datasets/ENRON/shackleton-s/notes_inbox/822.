Gil,
We had set up an account for EBS at Morgan Stanley in March for a specific 
position.  The account was established in the name of Enron Communications 
Investments Corp.  038-112207.  If we are requested to do other activity for 
EBS, can we use this same account, entity, for EBS's activity?  
Please confirm as soon as possible.

Thanks. Sheila
