SMUD is working on a weather transaction with Enron which may get completed 
shortly - since this is a financial deal we need to get a ISDA in place 
asap.  I believe this is a blacklined copy of the ISDA.  Feel free to call me 
or Gary Taylor at 713-853-1511 to get more info on the weather deal. 


Stewart 

PS I hope this leads to us getting the power schedule as well!

Marino Monardi asked me to send a copy of our ISDA Master Agreement and
Schedule for your review. He would like to have these agreements in place to
facilitate the precipitation hedge he is discussing  with Enron. We have not
included a Credit Support Annex. Since we are a municipality, pledging
assets as collateral involves complications that could possibly impact the
schedule Marino has established for finalizing the precipitation hedge
agreement. As an alternative, I believe he is open to making periodic
payments during the year in lieu of providing collateral as financial
positions change.
