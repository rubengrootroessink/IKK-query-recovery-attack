Dear ShareBulder:

I am pleased to announce the selection of the GE Money Market Fund (the "GE
Fund") as an improved way to manage your ShareBuilder account cash
balances.  Beginning October 2, 2000, all customer deposits and cash balances 
will
be automatically "swept" into the GE Fund and maintained there.  When you
purchase stock through ShareBuilder, money will be automatically transferred
back from the GE Fund to cover your transactions.  This will all be done
automatically.  You do not have to do anything to arrange transfers and you 
will
be able to access your ShareBuilder cash balances as quickly as you can
today.

The GE Money Market Fund is administered by GE Asset Management, Inc., a
registered investment adviser and wholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric
Company.  GE is one of the largest fund management businesses in the U.S. -
their investment advisory business oversees more than $100 billion.  This
replaces our current structure, which pays daily interest on your cash
balances.  You should generally realize a higher return through the GE Fund - 
money
fund dividend yields tend to exceed the discounted T-Bill interest rates we
now pay.  GE Fund dividends will be calculated daily and posted monthly to
your online ShareBuilder account statement.

This ShareBuilder upgrade will be part of every account and will be added
to the "Terms and Conditions" in the account agreement.  Beginning October
2nd, all current and future customer accounts will automatically incorporate
the GE Fund for cash balances.  We will provide a link to the GE Fund's
prospectus directly from ShareBuilder.com.

Again, you don't have to do anything to effect this change.  However, if
you have any concerns or questions, please contact us via email at
mailto:customercare@netstock.com or toll-free at 888-NET-STOK between the 
hours of 6 AM
and 6 PM Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.

I am very excited about this enhancement to ShareBuilder, and I hope you
enjoy the change!

Sincerely,

Jeff Seely
President and CEO
