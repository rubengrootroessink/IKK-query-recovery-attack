Jason:  She did call and wanted John, you and me.  I am available untill
roughly 11 am when the lawyers depart for the Woodlands.  She indicated
that this provision was necessary if we EVER decided to net
physical/financial.  (Jason:  we won't agree to that now and if we ever
did, I am sure we would either amend all of our masters or put a separate
netting agreement in place).  She did indicate that Harvard MIGHT drop the
request.  I don't  particularly want the provision in the agreement.   My
calendar is open if you want to schedule.  SS

Sara,

Kim Noble called.  She was hoping that we could talk in the morning.  She
indicated that anything before 10:00 AM worked for her.  I told her I would
pass it on.

Jason
