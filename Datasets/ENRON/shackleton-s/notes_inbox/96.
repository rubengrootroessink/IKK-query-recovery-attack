In order to get around the wording on the Jan 02 product,  how about if it 
states "The Valuation Date for each Determination Period shall be the first 
Business Day of such Determination Period."  
This way the determination period is still one calender month and instead of 
the payment being the last day it will be the first day of the month.
Let me know if you think this will work.

Thanks,

Steve

Subject: Re: EOL description change  

The last line in the first paragraph (which is the Product Type description) 
states that the The Payment Date is the Valuation Date. This was written 
specifically to be able to handle day-long and month-long transactions, as 
the Index states that the Valuation Date is that last day of each 
Determination Period. That being the case, the language being proposed would 
alter the operation of Valuation Dates as they relate to month-long 
transactions, so we should not make the change.

The valuation date is agreed upon on the point and click because the product 
is a Jan 02, 2001 product.  That is the settlement  date for the transaction.

I am forwarding this to Rob and Melba, who will assist you with this, as I am 
no longer involved in the day-to-day work regarding the development of 
Products for EnronOnline.

Rob/Melba/Steve:

One question comes to mind immediately; the suggested language states  "The 
Valuation Date for each Determination Period shall be the date submitted by 
the counterparty." When is this date being submitted, and how is this 
submission taking place? Please investigate this.  I would think that (i) if 
the Valuation Date of the transaction is unknown on Trade Date then the 
integrity of the economics of the deal hasn't been established, and (ii) if 
this requires a follow-up phone call after the trade is done on EOL, the 
'point and click' trading isn't accomplished.

Dale

Dale,

Below are proposed descriptions of two EOL products that we need to change.  
Our Calgary office needs to change the settlement date for these products so 
I changed the descriptions to match their wishes.  These products are not 
active yet because I need to switch the descriptions in the product manager. 
The proposed changes are in bold faced type.  Do you do that or am I able to 
change the product description in the product manager?  Also, are we able to 
just switch the description or do we need to get approval from someone else?
if you have any questions please call me at extension 3-7214.

Thanks,

Steve
