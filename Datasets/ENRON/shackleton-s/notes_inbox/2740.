Caroline Abramo has initiated a new hedge fund family for financial trading.  
I am anticipating up to 4 separate masters, but likely only one series of 
negotiations (the others will likely duplicate the terms of the first one).  
The paper has started flow in.  Would you please advise which attorney will 
handle this?  The group is Wexford.  I need to start forwarding up to you 
copies of the offering memoranda.

Thanks.
