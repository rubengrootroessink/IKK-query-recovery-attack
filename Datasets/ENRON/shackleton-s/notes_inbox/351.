Sara,

Hi there.  Joe Hunter gave me your name as his contact for having
previously worked on this deal with him.  He's on vacation this week,
and I'm working on the same deal for purposes of sending 
the counterparty notification of a change.

We did a financial commodity swap with Chase in April, 1999, and
both the Notional Quantity per Calc. Period and Floating Price were
done as attachments, with variable prices, quantities, and reference
locations.  Also, there is a provision with the confirm (drafted by Chase)
where Enron may request a change to any alternate "Price Source for any
Floating Price for all or a portion of any Notional Quantity..."  

We have made two such requests, on April 22, 1999 and again on
May 27, 1999.  We were notified this month of a third request for change,
and although our paperwork here is unfortunately not perfect, I followed
the format for what we sent out twice previously.  Attached are my drafts.
Could you please take a look at them and make any changes you
deem necessary?  I have the original confirmation down here - and
if you need to see that too, I'll run it up to you.  

Thanks.
