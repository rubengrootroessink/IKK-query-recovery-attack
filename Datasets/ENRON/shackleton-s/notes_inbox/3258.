Please try to make yourself available on MARCH 5 for a presentation by Ken 
Raisler of Sullivan & Cromwell to the swaps group regarding the Commodity 
Futures Modernization Act of 2000, the new legislation that has significantly 
overhauled the Commodity Exchange Act of 1974.

This is an extremely complex piece of legislation, and it is crucial that 
everyone in our group has a solid understanding of the new law -- and that 
our understanding of the law is consistent throughout the group.

I will send a follow-up e-mail with more details on the presentation.  
Caveat: it is possible this presentation will be March 7, rather than the 
5th, although the 5th is looking more likely at this point.  Thanks -- Bob
