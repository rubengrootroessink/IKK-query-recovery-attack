Sara:

I have tried to fax you the cover and signature page from our Client 
Agreement 3
times now and the fax is not going through.  I am sending to fax # 
713-646-3490.
Please advise if there is another number I cna fax this too.

In addition, I have been instructed by our compliance people to send you back
the original copies of the Client Agreement so that a duly authorized
representative of Enron can sign off on Section 24.(b).  The Agreement has 
been
sent to you.  Please have the correct boxes checked, initialed and then sent
back to us for execution by JPMFI.  We will turn them around in one day.

Attached below is a copy of the cover and sig page (fax copy) in .pdf format.

(See attached file: Enron cov+sig.pdf)

If you have any questions please call me at 212-646-4315.

Thank you,
Tom Alterson
