We have located an existing ISDA agreement that might be the one were were 
looking for. It's the 1997 ISDA between Enron International and Risk 
Management & Trading Company, which would have covered our trades since we 
were part of EI at the time. I will see if this is what the CFO had in mind.

Separately, we now fall under EES jurisdiction and have no separate P&L or 
business line. I suppose our trades would be conducted through them. Is there 
any need for a new ISDA for EECC in  that case?
