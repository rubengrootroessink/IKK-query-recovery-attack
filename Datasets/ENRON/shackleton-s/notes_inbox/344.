Sara,

Rhett has responded to my e-mail regarding NNG and has said this trade should 
be confirmed as RMT.  I am attaching the confirmation I have put together for 
your review before it is sent out to NNG.  Please advise if this format is 
acceptable.  I will also fax the confirmation and deal ticket.

Thank you for your assistance!

Rhett, 

We have done a trade with NNG and they are requesting that we send them our 
confirmation.  Would we confirm this as RMT or ENA?  Could you please let me 
know if you are the correct person I should be contacting on this matter.  I 
can be reached @5-7679.  

Thank you, 
Melissa Rodriguez
