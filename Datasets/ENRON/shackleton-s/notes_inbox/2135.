I spoke with Jesus and Marshall re the 97/3 split.  B of A would have to 
decide if they want to go ahead at this early of a date to fix the 3% 
certificate portion on their end.  Jesus thinks it not probable that they 
would do so at this time, but rather lock in a few days before the VPP 
transaction.  B of A economics would be different.  However, it does seem 
that B of A should be consulted.  

Cordially,
