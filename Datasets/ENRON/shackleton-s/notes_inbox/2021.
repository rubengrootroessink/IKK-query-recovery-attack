Brent,

We currently have not executed any transactions with this counter-party, but 
Rob is ineterested in doing a financial deal with them once an ISDA gets put 
in place. Thanks.

Brent:  Attached is Aparna's email.  Please call her if you have any 
questions.  I believe that Rob Scheuer is the commercial person.

Aparna:  Would you please advise Brent as to whether or not a transaction has 
been executed.

Sara,

Here is the link to the Irish entity I just spoke to you about. The Lumber 
Group is looking to get an ISDA in place with this entity but I wanted to get 
your input on the legal side on an entity that is probably 100% owned by the 
Irish Govt.

Thanks for your help!
