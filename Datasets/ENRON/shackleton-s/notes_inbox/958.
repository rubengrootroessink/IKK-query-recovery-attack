I am fine w/ the use of a letter of credit from an accounting perspective.  I 
am sure the treasury people understand the effect of the loc on their 
available credit lines.  By the way. how much will the loc be for?

Cris,

Following up on our conversation yesterday, I would be grateful if you would 
please confirm that from an accounting perspective we can use L/C's as 
collateral within our proposed structure. 

Having spoken with Legal & Credit, I understand that the use of cash as 
collateral creates difficulties under Canadian bankruptcy law regarding title 
to security & rights of set-off, therefore use of L/Cs would be the preferred 
route.

Sara, can we revert to using L/C as collateral within docs. 

Many thanks,

Soma
