Sara and Clint:

I attach a final draft of the equity forward confirmation for the two
outstanding equity forward transactions. We need to fill in the: (1) par
value of your stock in the definition of Shares in each of the attached that
appears on page 3 for the May 8, 2000 trade and on page 2 for the August 4
trade; and (2) date when the share repurchase program was publicly announced
that is page 16 of the May 8, 2000 transaction and on page 15 of the August
4, 2000 transaction.

If the attached is acceptable to you, please advise me of the above so that
we may prepare execution copies and finalize these confirmations.

Regards,
