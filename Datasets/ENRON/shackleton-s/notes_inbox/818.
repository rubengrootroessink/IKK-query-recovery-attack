I received this letter form Goldman Sachs this morning.  According to them 
short positions are the only ones that require this letter.  Can we 
use/modify this letter and submit it to Morgan Stanley and Bear stearns, or 
do we need to get something from each of them?  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Terri

Apologies for the delay.  My e-mail went totally dead last night, and has
just now come back.  (Apparently I have sent to many large document files).

Attached is the assignment agreement that we discussed.  Please feel free to
call me if you have any questions.  I can be reached at (212) 902-1930.

Kind regards,

Eugenie Sibeud
