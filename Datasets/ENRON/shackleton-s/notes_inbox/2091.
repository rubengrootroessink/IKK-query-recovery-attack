Now that you have received the credit worksheet from Paul, what is the 
status/timeline of getting an ISDA agreement I can forward to the customer?  
Thanks for your assistance with this, - Mike

Sara-- Are you still the swaps lawyer to assist with this?  If not, would you 
pass it to the person who can help Mike Curry with this?  Thanks.
