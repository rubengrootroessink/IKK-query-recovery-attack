Hi Sheila,

As we spoke yesterday, I've attached our commission rate schedule for
all futures:  equity, fixed income and commodities.

Regarding documentation, I wasn't aware of anyone here sending you
futures account documents.  The person who can coordinate your
documentation is Michael Poacelli - 212.761.8236.  Ed Zabrocki -
212.762.8322 - is one of our attorney's who can liaise with your
attorneys.  For futures, you only have to open one set of accounts with
us as they are good for any future regardless of the asset class.  I've
left a message with your secretary on these issues, and if you and I
speak, I can get the right documents to you ASAP.

Lastly, we at Morgan Stanley our keen to work with you, Gary, and your
other colleagues, and thank you for the opportunity.  We also look
forward to meeting with you and demonstrating our technical
capabilities, as well talking about our overall global coverage effort
for all products, which we believe is second to none.

Again, thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to speaking
with you shortly.

Mike
