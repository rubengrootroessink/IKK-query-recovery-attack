Good Afternon Sara,

Here is the revised confirmation that I believe captures what they are 
looking to accomplish. They are looking for us to create one confirmation 
that is open ended to allow additional trades as well as deletions along the 
way. I believe this language accompishes this concept.

Please review and advise should any changes be required.

Thanks again!

Jorge
