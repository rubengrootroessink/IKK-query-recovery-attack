Dear Sara:

I did receive your message. Next week looks like a hectic one. I will then be 
in New York from Sept. 13 through 17. Thus, your last suggested dates (Sept. 
19-24) seems to be the most appropriate. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Best regards, Jos, Emilio

Although I am still waiting for another Brazilian visa, I would like to pose
several potential dates to meet with you regarding Enron North America Corp.
trading issues.  I am presently considering several time periods:

     September 9,10, 12-17,19-24

Obviously, I can be available at any time during the month of Septermber as 
well
as future months.  But I would like to get started as soon as possible.

If you could kindly e-mail or call me (713/853-5620), I can elaborate further.
Thank you.  Sara
