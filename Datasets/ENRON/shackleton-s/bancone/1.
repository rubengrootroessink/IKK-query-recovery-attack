Sara,

I had both addresses for you so I figured I would sent this e-mail to
both.  Attached you will find the draft documents for the uncommitted
line of credit to support margin requirements.

They include:
   a line letter
   the note
   a gty form (from Enron Corp.).

Let me highlight a just a couple of points:

   This would be a $50 million uncommitted revocable line
   Pricing is Fed Funds plus 30 bps.
   The facility would include a gty from Enron Corp.  (in order to
   simplify the credit underwriting process

Should you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.

Ken Fatur 312/732-3117
