Sara,

As discussed, attached are all of the Contract Review forms for the Financi=
al Liquids contracts that we were asked to review this weekend for Ed Smida=
.   Nony will also send you a copy of the list of other Financial Liquid co=
ntracts that we have been asked to review.  I agree that we need to coordin=
ate this work so that we are not duplicating efforts.  If you have any sugg=
estions or if your group is already reviewing any of the contracts that we =
have been asked to look at, please let me know.  Thanks.

Weezie:

Please email the names of any financial counterparties which you have revie=
wed on behalf of global markets to Susan, Stephanie and Samantha.  Such cou=
nterparties may have been previously reviewed for a different financial pro=
duct and we do not want to create multiple files or conduct multiple review=
s.

Bob Sevitz is the "gatekeeper" for the data collection process.

Thanks.
