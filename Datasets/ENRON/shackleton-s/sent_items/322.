Bruce,

I sent a quick memo out on Friday and followed up this morning with your e-mail below.  
Hopefully, there will be a beneficial match on both sides.

Regards,
Sheila

Dear Sheila:
Thanks for taking time to speak with me today. 
Quantlab Capital Management is a small but growing Houston-based hedge fund management firm.The firm currently applies its quantitative trading technologies to over $110 million in assets inboth offshore and domestic funds that it manages. Our affiliated company, Quantlab Financial, LLC, is a research and development company specializing in the design, development, and application of advanced quantitative modeling and trading technologies for the financial markets. We are currently seeking candidates to help us develop our trading and back office operations as well as to support and grow our captive broker-dealer which is currently in formation.
As I mentioned, we have spoken with several ex-Enron people from the hedge fund group including Jeff Kinneman, Samantha Davidson, and Aneela Charania. We have been impressed with the caliber and experience of your people and would be happy to speak with others that are looking for opportunities in the hedge fund arena.
Best regards,
Bruce Eames
