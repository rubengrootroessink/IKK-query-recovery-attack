Sorry for the delay (meetings).  The authorized signers (for both the authorization letter and the Waiver and Release) are:

(1)	Enron Credit Inc.
	Gary J. Hickerson
	Managing Director

(2)	ECT Investments, Inc.
	Gary J. Hickerson
	President

(3)	Enron Credit Limited
	Bryan R. Seyfried
	Director	

(4)	ECT Europe Finance, Inc.
	[leave blank as I will have to find someone]

Please note proper spelling of the company names.

Hope this does it.  I'll see Gary at a 1:30 meeting (Houston time) and can secure his signature; will have someone locate the remaining signer.  Please email to London as well for the Enron Credit Limited signature.

Thanks.  Sara
