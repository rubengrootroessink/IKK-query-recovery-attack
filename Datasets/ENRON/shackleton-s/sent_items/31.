Alex:

The documents look fine.  I am having the waiver reviewed by our bankruptcy attorney and I have not yet received a response.  The signature blocks will change.  The U.S. Enron Entities will require a V.P. signature.  The U.K. entity has two directors. I'll touch base with you in the morning.  Thanks for your help.
