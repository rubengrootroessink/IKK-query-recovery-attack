Steve Kessler (212-469-8202) with DB legal has called to request an ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC.  Who is the appropriate legal contact in London to initiate this process?

DB has an ISDA with ENA.  Steve told me that DB also has an ISDA with Enron Credit Limited.  Is a master netting arrangement appropriate here?

London:  Please let me know on Monday which lawyer will handle this ISDA request.

Jay:  Please let legal know if this arrangement requires a master netting agreement.

Thanks.   Sara
