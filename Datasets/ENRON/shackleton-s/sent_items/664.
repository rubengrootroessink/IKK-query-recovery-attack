My comments to the Customer Agreement which you delivered yesterday:

Please confirm the Enron party signing this agreement.  If it is ENA, then need to add 

(1)  ENA's standard limitation of liability clause
(2)  Par. 18 - exception for CSFB to attempt to communicate to ENA through reasonably available alternative means in the event of communication failure
