Two things:

1.	Mary Cook, Mark Taylor, & Brent Hendry all have conflicts this Thursday and Mary Cook suggested cancelling this Thursday's meeting.  Okay to cancel?  I need to do it by 10 am on Wednesday. [Shackleton, Sara]   cancel 

2.	The best date for all concerned seems to be Tuesday--will you approve? [Shackleton, Sara]   sounds fine
