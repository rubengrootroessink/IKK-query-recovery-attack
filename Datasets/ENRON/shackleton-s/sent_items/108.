Tanya:  Enron Corp. wants to transact with FTU.  I sent FTU a "blank" Paragraph 13 subject to ENA's credit review.  Can you give me a call about this one?  The FTU lawyer is calling me and already has comments to our draft Paragraph 13.  Thanks.  Sara

Tanya:  FTU has asked to resume negotiations on the ISDA.  We originally sent our draft without a Paragraph 13 and FTU wants a Paragraph 13 (similar to the one FTU negotiated with ENA).  If you are agreeable to credit, can you please propose a credit worksheet?

Thanks.  Sara
