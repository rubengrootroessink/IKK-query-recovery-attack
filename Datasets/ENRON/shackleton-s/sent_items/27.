Sara,
Has Enron Credit filed for Bankruptcy?  [Shackleton, Sara]  not yet  If not, do we try to sell the positions? [Shackleton, Sara]   Enron Credit Limited is reviewing the positions and I am engaging our bankruptcy lawyers to see what type of structure is plausible  I do not even know who the Authorized traders are on the account.

Sara,

The attached shows our balances at GS and Bear Stearns.

1) Bear Stearns owes us $3.9 million to ECT Investments, Inc.
	Ena is owed 159,022
	Enron Credit Inc has positive liquidating equity at BS of $14,013,523 which includes cash and positions.

2) Goldman Sachs ENA account grouping includes a positive cash balance of 1,493,288 which belongs to Enron Credit Inc.  As discussed, GS will not touch any monies relating to ENA.

3)  Enron Credit Inc. has a positive cash balance of 132,680 at MSDW.  It is segregated from any other entity's balances.

Adding up all three pieces of Enron Credit is $15.6 million, which includes positions and cash balances and presumes that the market value used by the prime broker is correct for some of these illiquid positions.

Please call so we can discuss.

Thanks. 
Sheila
