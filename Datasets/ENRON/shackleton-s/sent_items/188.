Susan:

I'll continue to review the RMT masters and these should be included in the attorney rotation which Mark should mention at our swap meeting.
Let's discuss the recent changes to the form.

Sara,

Please advise if you are still the lawyer who reviews RMT masters, when requested for preparation.

If so, Legal has been requested to prepare an ISDA between RMT and Enron Japan Corp., which shall support their FX transactions.

Let me know, so I can pass this draft on to you for review.

Thanks.

Cordially,
