ENA executed an "Assignment and Novation of Transactions" effective 9/1/01 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached Exhibit A reflecting that the HESC position would be assumed by Energy Marketing, a division of Amerada Hess Corporation.  ENA was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two Hess parties.  The assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ENA ISDA with Amerada Hess Corporation.

Amerada Hess Corporation terminated its ISDA with ENA on 12/3/01.

(1)  Louis/Mike:

	(i)  We need a copy of the fully executed assignment document.  Please forward to Samantha.
	(ii)  You need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached Exhibit A to that assignment.

(2)  Samantha:

When we receive the fully executed assignment document, we need to insert into the Amerada Hess Corporation file and conduct a contract review.  If all outstanding transactions were assigned, we need to note in the Hess Energy Services Company, LLC file that no further action is required in that file.

(3)  Angelo:

If all of the above occurs, then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by Amerada Hess Corporation which has terminated.
