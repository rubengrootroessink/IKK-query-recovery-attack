Clem:

Attached is my proposed form of guaranty (format accepted by Societe Generale when ENE executed guaranty for credit arrangement to fund FIMAT USA, Inc.'s margin calls to ENA).  FIMAT will not trade without an ENE guaranty.

Sarah Wesner will fax the form of guaranty submitted to us (ENE) by FIMAT.  If that format is acceptable, we're done.

Please let me know what you think.

We are moving futures positions ASAP.
