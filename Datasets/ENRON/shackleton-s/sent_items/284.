I believe the Goldman account (for ERMT Corp.) was funded on 11/6/01.

Cathy and Greg,

Would you confirm whether the $250 MM was swept back by Enron Corp.?

Best regards,
Susan

I'm not so sure of that because we couldn't see all of the wire transfers.  There was a credit to the new entity's account in the amount of $250 million on November 5th and then there was a debit of $249,900,000 on the 6th.  It looks like that money went into a Goldman Sachs account.

I assume this means that the payment was made and not swept back by Enron Corp.?
