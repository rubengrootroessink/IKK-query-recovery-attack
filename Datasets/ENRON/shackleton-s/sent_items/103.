Sara,

Attached is the initial draft of the term sheet prepared by Bear Stearns for use in connection with Project Bruin. I hope that the e-mails I am forwarding to you are sufficient to give you an idea of the nature and intended accomplishments of the exercise.

Now that I am re-reading the message from Tom Blair of Bear Stearns, I see that he intended to follow up with additional detailed term sheets. I will ask whether those have been provided to us and forward them to you in the event we have them.

Paul

Kevin,

Please find following an indicative term-sheet for your/team's review.
While there are three simultaneous trades occuring at the same time, Davis
wanted one term-sheet to use for your internal conversations for simlplicity
sake.  We will have additional term-sheets available for all three
components of the trade tomorrow.  I will make sure you have a summary pitch
book available to discuss the merits/risks of the trade by Friday.  

Speak with you in the am.

Best.

Tom
