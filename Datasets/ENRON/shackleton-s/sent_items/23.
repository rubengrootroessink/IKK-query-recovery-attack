Carol:

As the log is continually updated, we should be clear as to which entities we are reviewing for purposes of informing the book ad mins.
To date, we have only focused on:

	ENA 
	EPMI
	ENE
	ENA Upstream Company LLC
`	EPMI

We have consciously excluded EES and the London entities or US entities trading through EEFT in London (such as ECTRIC).

Since Enron Global Markets (and presumably EIM next) is under a mandate for liquidation, don't we need to liase with Alan (for his US products) and London (for products such as weather) which are EGM products?  Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions). 

Or is our focus still only gas and power? I just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process.
