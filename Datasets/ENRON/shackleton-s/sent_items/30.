Tom:

Further to my voice mail, attached is a "short list" of FX/rate desk financial counterparties.  We will need an aggregate ENA exposure before attempting to negotiate ENA's in-the-money positions on a commodity by commodity basis (i.e., the FX/rate exposure, in particular).  I will speak with Clara Carrington about segregation of the terminated trades from their books.
 
I'd like to sit down with you and Sheila Glover as soon as possible to strategize.
 
Thanks.  Sara
