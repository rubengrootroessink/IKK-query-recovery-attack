I faxed my comments to DB on October 17 since I didn't have an electronic version of the futures agreement.  Comments were sent to both Tracey Jordal (legal) and Barbara Russo.  If you would like to see the comments, let me know and I'll send a copy down to you.  Also, if I need to send the comments to anyone else, just let me know.
