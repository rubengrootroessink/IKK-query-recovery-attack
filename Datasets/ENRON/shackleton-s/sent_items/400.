Beth, here are the confirms you requested.  Only one of the deals, YD1782.1, was unexecuted because the deal was revised after originally confirmed.

Beth:

I spoke with Louis Dicarlo this morning and he referred me to you as the contact for estate confirmations.  Is it possible to get copies of the confirmations for the Enervest deal numbers listed below?  George needs them for a meeting with the estate lawyers.

Please let me know.

Thank you:

Derek
