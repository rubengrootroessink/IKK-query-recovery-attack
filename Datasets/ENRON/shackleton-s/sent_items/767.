Have a good Turkey day!  It's pretty morbid here but I'm trying to remain optomistic.  I am also going to N.O. and big B.R.  Tell Monty to call me soon.  Sara

Hi Sara:

Just a note to let you know that I will do my part to consume your
excess wine even though Enron is experiencing such difficult times. That
is the kind of guy I AM. I am sure that Donna will do her part also.

I am off to New Orleans to spend Thanksgiving Day at the Fair Grounds
Race Track. I might even see Monty. I hope you and your family have a
wonderful day.

Keep your head up,

Carson
