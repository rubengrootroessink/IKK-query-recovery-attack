Sara - did Bears come back to you on selling the MLM shares we have left in the broker account?

We tried to call them before Christmas but they were going to call Alex Shears and then he was 
going to call you

thanks
Simon

Simon,
You can take the Metal Management issue.  

Why don't we fill out a wire request for the 66,307.44?  Bryan can sign and then fax to me for gary and my signature.  Lets try and see what happens. What do you think?

we've got 91,000 worth about $1 a share

Simon,
I just faxed to you BS reports as of 12/28/01.  It appears total equity is 66,367.44 USD for Enron Credit.  The  metals position is still there.  

The quality of the reports is not good.

Please verify equity you think we should be able to withdraw.

Sheila
