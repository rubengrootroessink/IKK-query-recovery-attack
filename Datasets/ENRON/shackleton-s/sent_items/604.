Tthanks for the heads-up.  What is the full name of this party?  Exactly what "ISDA" did you  leave for them to review (i.e., was this a customized agreement with credit?)?  Can I please have a copy in case someone calls me.

Thanks.  Sara

As we discussed, in order for Enron to provide either physical or financial products as an Oregon Direct Access ESS provider, the EEI and ISDA contracts that we left with you today will need to be executed.
