Has the account issue been resolved?  I'm concerned about the ENA examiner and the cash control situation between ENA and Enron Corp.

Louis,

Cynthia says Select Energy sent the funds in question to the wrong bank account (Corp acct).  Cynthia will create a journal entry to clear these items.
Please disregard Select Energy invoices on the AR Redlist Co 364.


Regards,

Angelo
