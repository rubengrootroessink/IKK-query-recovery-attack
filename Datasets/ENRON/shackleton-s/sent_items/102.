Susan:  While Tanya is reviewing credit, can you please send a "blank form Paragraph 13" for this master.  Just our standard.  Caveat:  subject to credit review even though there are blanks.  Thanks.  Sara

Hi Sara,

I just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft
Credit Support Annex (similar in form to the one previously executed with
ENA).  I understand you may not have credit approval yet so perhaps we can
leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime.

Thanks and regards,

	Vijay:

	I've been trying to call you for about an hour, but the circuits are
all
	busy.  Sometimes it's easier for NY to call out than for us to call
NY.
	I'll be in my office for about an hour before meetings.  Also, I am
free
	in the morning.  We'll need to recall exactly where we were at the
	beginning of August.  Thanks.  Sara
