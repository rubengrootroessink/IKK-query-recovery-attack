Sara - I talked to Joanne Rozycki and she was trying to help you set her up to do your expense reports.  The floor tech will not be able to help you without knowing the following.  However, Joanne should be able to walk you through this or call the ISC help desk @ 54727and we can help you.

Your user id is P00500661 - initial log into expensexms.enron.com is your birthdate in this format yyyyMMMdd (month being the first three letters - all caps)

Joanne is aware of this email so if you have any questions, please contact her.


Thanks,
