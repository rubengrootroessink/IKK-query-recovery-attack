Sara,

I know we haven't spoken much this month about the goldman account, but are we nearly complete on the transfer to ECI from ENA?

Tom,
When we last spoke you had said that you were going to move Enron Credit out of Enron North America Grouping of accounts.  
Please advise status.
Thanks. Sheila
