Sara,

Have you been able to get any information on the corporate ownership of EFET.  ABN/AMRO requries this information to make decisions on the disposition of their trades with us.  Ideally, they would like a corporate org. chart and balance sheet.  

I am also going to contact Ted Murphy and Eric Shaw.

Thank you
Mark
