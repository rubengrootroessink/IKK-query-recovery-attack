Brent:

I must have been reviewing something from this CP when I sent the message to Tanya.  Is Tanya right about having discussed this with you already?  I can't remember.

The trades have already been pulled from the system.  I'll have to check with Debbie on the file of terminated trades.  Didn't I discuss this one with Brent before the holdiay?

How many outstanding trades will we be terminating with this party?  Is there only a collar?
