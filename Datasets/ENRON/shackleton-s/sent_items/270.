Nora:

Can you send me a copy of the executed repo between GS&Co. and ENE so that I can log it into my database?

Also, if you need the link for ENA's Lotus Notes database, please let me know.  We have a section for various types of agreements, including, repos, futures, brokerage, give-ups, custody, etc.

Thanks.  Sara
