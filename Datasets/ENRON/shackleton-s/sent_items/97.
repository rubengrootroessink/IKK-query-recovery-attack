Vijay:

I've been trying to call you for about an hour, but the circuits are all busy.  Sometimes it's easier for NY to call out than for us to call NY.  I'll be in my office for about an hour before meetings.  Also, I am free in the morning.  We'll need to recall exactly where we were at the beginning of August.  Thanks.  Sara
