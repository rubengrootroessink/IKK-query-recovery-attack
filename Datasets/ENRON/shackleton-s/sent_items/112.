Dear All,

Thank you to everyone who has helped out today with the hopeful transfer of Anker positions from Enron Credit Inc. to ECT Europe Investments Inc. for quarter end.

We are still working on an effective means to move the positions over.  

David Wall and Edmund Cooper in London will be working on this in the am for us.

From many discussions here today our options right now appear to be:

1.Transfer via stock power to ECTEI Inc.
Positions must be in certificate form first
Will take over a week to obtain certificates from DTC
NOT PLAUSIBLE

2. Set up prime broker account for ECTEI Inc. and transfer via DTC 
Must fill out paperwork and set up account before transfering position
Highly unlikely to accomplish in one day considering amount of paperwork and signatures required

3. Find a merchant account with a prime account already set up 
May not satify audit requirements, but many US entities have accounts
Possibly can find a Europe account with a custody or prime account that can accept DTC positions
Potential Cayman entities that roll to Europe with accounts

4. Internal structures
Suggestions Please
