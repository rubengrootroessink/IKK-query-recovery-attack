Sara
I am in today and subject to a theoretical 1 pm (never received confirmation), I am available to meet at your and Raj's convenience. 

My number is 54613.  I believe the other number is from a prior secondment to Enron.

Neil:

I wasn't sure if you still had the 53913 extension.

Raj Thapar wants to discuss this global settlement.  Are you in the office today?
