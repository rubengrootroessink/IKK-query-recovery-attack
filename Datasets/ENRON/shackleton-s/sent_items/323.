Sheila,

At this time, there are no updates to report on deferred compensation since the bankruptcy filing.  As you know, the assets of the plan(s) are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors.  Thus, no distributions (current or future) can be made.  We sent a letter to you on December 10th with your 11/30/01 balance in the event that you wished to file a claim with the bankruptcy court for your deferral benefit.  We also indicated that the Company would explore options with its creditors to seek approval to restart the deferral plan(s).  To my knowledge, these talks have not begun.  However, I will see if I can find out any additional information to pass on to you.

On the December 10, 2001 letter we indicated that we would forward your "Life to Date Deferrals" at a later date.  This follow-up letter should be sent out to you next week.

Renee
