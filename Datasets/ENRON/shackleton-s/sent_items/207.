Rob:

Attached is a "recap" of outstanding issues with the utility.  I have not had any conversations with anyone at ConEd.

FYI, I did receive a call this afternoon from Sylvia Dooley asking that I call her about one of the unregulated affiliates.  I left a voice mail.

Let me know how you want to proceed.  Ed asked that we prepare a blackline and not change items to which the parties have not agreed.  Thanks.  Sara
