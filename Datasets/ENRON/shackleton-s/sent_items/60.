fax from genre....

sara -- to bring you up to speed, BNP Paribas decided they could not go forward with the transaction.  We were able to get GenRe back into the trade late Friday night and are attempting to complete the novation/assignement over the next couple of days.  In order to reduce concerns over potential clawbacks, I think it is best to take this transaction through the Houston process.

Can you let me know exactly what needs to be done and I will start working on our side.  Thanks.
