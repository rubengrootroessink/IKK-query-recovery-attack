Rebecca:

Per our conversation, attached please find Clorox's blackline.  You should have Aparna's file including the credit worksheet.  Also, Aparna should have provided you wtih a copy of the ISDA boilerplate (let me know if you need this or anything else).  The credit issues we should focus on include:

(1)  request for cross acceleration [Part 1(b) page 1]
(2)  Cross Default amendment for operational issues [Part 1(b) page 1]
(3)  Credit Event Upon Merger:  use of "materially weaker" definition [Part 1(c) pages 1-2]
(4)  Additional Termination Events:  use of rating downgrade Part 1(i) pages 2-3]
(5)  Delivery of documents [see page 5 comments]
(6)  elimination of "non-reliance" representation [pages 7-8]
(7)  elimination of affiliate setoff [pages 8-9]
(8)  Change to definiton of "Credit Support Amount" [Annex A page 1]
(9)  complete change to Threshold and Independent Amount [Annex A pages 2-3]
(10) "Minimum Transfer Amount" from $0 to $500,000
(11) elimination of the MAC in Par. 13 to the Credit Support Annex [Annex A page 8]
(12)  Enron Corp. guaranty:  elimination of cap [see Enron Corp. guaranty]

I look forward to meeting with you on Wednesday.
