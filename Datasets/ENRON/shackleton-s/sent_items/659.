Kim:  Sorry.  I will send the hard copies of the three (3) ELFI confirms that are being restated in the name of Enron North America Corp.  The redline below was just to let you know that we are almost agreed as to  the format for the confirms.  (remember late Friday afternoon I mentioned this?)  Sara

Re:	Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc. to Enron North America Corp.

Sara:

As discussed, attached you will find the revised Confirmations showing
Enron North America Corp. as the party to the transactions instead of
Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc.

Should you or any member of your operations group have any questions,
please feel free to contact me or Laura Perilli.   If you find these
Confirmations in good order, please arrange for an authorized signatory
to sign the Confirmations and return them to my attention via facsimile
(212-507-4898).

Kind regards,
Beth
