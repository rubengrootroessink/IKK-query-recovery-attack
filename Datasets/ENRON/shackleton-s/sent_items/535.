Ed:

Looks like Haedicke and Derrick are the sole directors and signers for this deal.  Both are in the office today.
Can you please prepare a short memo summarizing deal and request for signatures for me to present to them?  I am not familiar with either the insurance contract or the credit derivatives.  
Thanks.
