Sara, here is the schedule.  I look forward to meeting you tomorrow.
Please come to the 8th floor reception at 8:45AM and ask for me.  One
Wachovia Center should be right next door to the Hilton where you are
staying.   Our building is located on College Street between 2nd and 3rd
Streets.  You will need to sign in on the ground floor with security by
showing your driver's license.
