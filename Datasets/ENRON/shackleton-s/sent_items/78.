Sara,

Sorry, about the mix-up, but below are both their reply and our original sample confirmations.

Thanks,



Scott


  


Scott: here are the comments from the USFilter legal group. Please review
with your legal people and provide a response. The documents to which Keith
refers are the most recent Confirmation for the Deferred Premium call and
the associated Terms and Conditios Addendum.

Thanks,
