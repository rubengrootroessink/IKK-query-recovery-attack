sara,
as discussed attached is a cleaned up redlined version of the schedule.  as
you know, there are still several open issues, but hopefully, it will be
easier to work from this document.  in the meantime, i will work on
redlining the csa and reviewing some of the open issues in the schedule that
are in my court.  thanks for your help and have a great weekend! <<enron
