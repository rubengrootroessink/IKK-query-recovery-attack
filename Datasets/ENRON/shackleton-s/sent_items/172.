Sara,

Can we get together for an hour or so to discuss:

1.  Multi Branch counterparties--we need to be certain we are covered by Master's for all of this trading.

2.  Training on the ISDA definitions.  I've pulled some confirms together for a group review.  I'd like to get together with you to go over where I see our weaknesses.  

Hope the legal conference was fun.  Give me a call and let's set up a time.  thanks!!
