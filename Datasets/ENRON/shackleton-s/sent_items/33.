Sorry for the delay (meetings).  The authorized signers (for both the authorization letter and the Waiver and Release) are:

	Managing Director

(2)	ECT Investments, Inc.
	Gary J. Hickerson
	President

(3)	Enron Credit Limited
	Bryan R. Seyfried

Please note proper spelling of the company names.

Hope this does it.  I'll see Gary at a 1:30 meeting (Houston time) and can secure his signature; will have someone locate the remaining signer.  Please email to London as well for the Enron Credit Limited signature.

Thanks.  Sara
