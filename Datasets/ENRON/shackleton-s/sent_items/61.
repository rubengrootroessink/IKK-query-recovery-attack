Pamela:

On May 22, 2001, I sent an email to you regarding the aforementioned account assignment.  I also copied Nikki Kroll on that email.  ENA and ECI are anxious to have this assignment executed but we have not had any response.  I am reattaching a copy of the assignment for your convenience.  I will need your assistance in identifying the ECI account with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GS").  Stephanie Panus sent Nikki Kroll the ECI account documentation via overnight delivery on May 18, 2001.

Please direct your attention to the following:

(1)  Please execute and return to ECI an original Corporate Account Agreement with GS.  Also, please provide ECI with the account number.

(2)  Please review the attached Assignment and Assumption Agreement and advise if we can execute and forward to GS for execution.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.
