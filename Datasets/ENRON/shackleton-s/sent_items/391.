Dear Mr. Taylor-Brill:

I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.  Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).

For example:

USAIR #586 departs Houston at 7:50 am and arrives in Charlotte at 11:10 am
[USAIR#1620 departs Houston at 6:30 pm and arrives in Charlotte at 9:46 pm]
USAIR #897 departs Charlotte at 5:10 pm and arrives in Houston at 6:59 pm

I am certainly open to other options.  Please advise if there is anything further that I can do.

Regards.  Sara
