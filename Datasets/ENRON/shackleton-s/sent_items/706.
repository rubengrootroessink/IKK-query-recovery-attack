KEN WRIGHT CELLARS
2001 PINOT NOIR FUTURES
SAVE $90 A CASE BY ORDERING BEFORE DECEMBER 2001
http://www.oregongourmet.com/kenwrightcellars.html

We are offering a special discount on orders of Ken Wright's 2001 Pinot
noir futures through December 1, 2001. Save $90 off our regular $470/case
price. Save now, the 2001 vintage was excellent, and Ken is very happy
with the wines. He told me he is particularly excited about the Carter and
Canary Hill Vineyard wines. Also note, a new vineyard site, Meredith
Mitchell, available from Ken for the first time.
