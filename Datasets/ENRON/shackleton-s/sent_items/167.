   please let me know which provision of the terms of business you think
   should
   be amended in that way.

   Daniel:

   What about the limitation of liability language which you suggested
   could
   be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

         Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
         amending
         the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

         Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
      the
         language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

         I trust this will now close the open issues.

         I look forward to hearing from you

         Kind regards

         Daniel

         Daniel:

         Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding
   issues
         relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate
   policy.
         If
         you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
      and
         we
         can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
   Chamber
      of
         Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
   non-prime
         brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
   therefore,
         are
         not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do
   have
         other
         business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
         limitation
         of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

         "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter
   or
      from
         any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
      special,
         punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

         Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out
   of
      the
         office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

         All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
         executed
         together with the terms of business letter.

         Regards.  Sara

            The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
         relationship
            with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues
   that
         relate
            to
            the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects
   with
      the
         PB
            relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

            Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are
   adequately
            addressed
            in the documentation as drafted.

            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
      possible
         so
            we
            can try to get this wrapped up today.

            Kind regards

            Daniel

            Daniel:

            Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the
   PB
            conflict
            because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
      Par.8
            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to
   the
         Terms
            of
            Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
      prevail.
            Are
            you agreeing with this analysis?

            Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
      conflict
            with
            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to
   the
      PB
            (except
            for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It
   is
         Enron
            Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
      the
            Terms
            of Business in the same manner.

            Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
         suggest a
            different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the
   the
            remaining
            documents.

            Thanks.

               Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
      Arbitration -
            more
               appropriate to general terms of business which principally
            contemplate
               the
               regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
      event
         of
               inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
      A3).

               I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

               Kind regards

               Daniel:

               Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
         "Agreement")
               with my colleague Angela Davis.

               I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business
   Letter
            relating
               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
      discussed
         but
               were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

               (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,
   Par.
      14
         of
               the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the
   possible
      use
         of
               arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration
   in
      the
            OSLA)
               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph
   of
         the
               Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
      English
            courts,
               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter
   which
      will
               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

               (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
         manner
            as
               Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
      that
         you
               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
         shouldn't
               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest
   of
      the
               account documentation.  Regards.
