ENA has ITM terminated positions with six bank counterparties (identified below).  Settlement is part of the ongoing EGM liquidation.

We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather. We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.  This is the most urgent matter.

With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.

Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?  PWC will also need.

Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?

I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.  Thanks.  Sara
