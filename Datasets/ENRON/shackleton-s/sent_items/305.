All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya
