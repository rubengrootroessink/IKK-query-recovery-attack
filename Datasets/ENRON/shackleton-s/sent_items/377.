His consulting clients have included such elite California labels as Araujo Estate, Niebaum-Coppola, Dalla Valle, Moraga Vineyards, Spottswoode, and Viader Vineyard-not to mention his own Pinot noir-focused creation, Etude Winery (recently sold to Beringer Blass).

 NW Wine of the Week from Andy Perdue: Powers Parallel 46
 This affordable red blend was ranked No. 1 last week at the annual Pacific Northwest Wine Fair in Toronto. Other wines in the judging included 97 Ridge Montebello, 1998 Hedges Red Mountain Reserve, Gordon Brothers Tradition, and pepper Bridge Cabernet Sauvignon. At $30, the Powers wine was the least expensive of the entrants! Gorgeous bottle, too.

NEW RELEASES
 http://www.oregongourmet.com/northwestwine.html-        the whole list
=====================================
Highlights:
 Andrew Will 2000 Merlots- Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills, Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval, Sheridan
 Chris Camarda's delicious and hard to get Merlots- 2000 vintage is  made from "his best fruit ever".
Robert Parker says of Chris's wines: "Andrew Will's wines have virtually perfect tannins. They are present but buffered by the loads of dominating sweet fruit. Furthermore, what is amazing about Chris Camarda's wines is that they are concentrated yet grateful. Camarda's (wines) blend power with elegance, concentration with finesse, and supersweet fruit with definition. Chris Camarda is a brilliant winemaker."
