Bob and Tanya:

ENA received a termination notice dated December 11, 2001 from Tribune of the 8/21/97 ISDA Master Agreement and all outstanding transactions.  The Early Termination Date is December 12, 2001.

The Tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $34,000,000 in "damages."

We need to identify all trades and identify the Settlement Amount for our response to them.  Are we holding any margin? 

Please call to discuss.
