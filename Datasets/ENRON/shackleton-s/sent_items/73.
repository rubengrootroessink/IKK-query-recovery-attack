Rudwell:

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up? 

Thanks.
