I'm sure this is not new to you but Cindy Ma just called.  I guess Raj was trying to schedule a meeting today for lawyers (in/out) to meet for several hours with these guys who are only here today.  I punted to you guys.  She's asking specifically about strategies for terminated/nonterminated positions and other time sensitive issues.  Also wants people like Sager, Hodge, etc.
