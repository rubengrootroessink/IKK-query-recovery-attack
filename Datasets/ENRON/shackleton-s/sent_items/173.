We provided CSFB puts just like Lehman.  We did that the last time we had to move the trigger price since our stock price was declining.  As a result of us giving them puts, they took the trigger price out which means that we don't have to renegotiate the confirms every time our stock heads south.  Jeff, would you please get the details of the puts to Sara.  Thanks.
CF

Sara-

We will prepare execution copies of the confirmations for the various
transactions and send them to you.  Before we do that, though, do you know
the status of the puts [Shackleton, Sara]   I never heard mention of the puts ?

Regards,

Mike
