Sara,
I had a message from Thay Bishop that they sent the agreement back to us in Nov.  She is trying to locate a copy to send to us.  I will follow back up with her and see who they sent the agreement to.

Will you please call Ty (whatever her name is)?  The reason being that their termination notice relates to the ISDA (I believe) which we do not have.  Thanks.

Did we ever receive the executed ISDA from MARTA?
