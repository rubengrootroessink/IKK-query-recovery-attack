RE:		EFP/EFS PROCEDURES FOR NYMEX ACCESS
 CONTRACTS

Please be advised that the following procedures should be followed when
executing an EFP or EFS trade for any futures contract that trades
exclusively on NYMEX ACCESS
.

Orders should be sent to the floor and pitcards should be submitted to the
Late Pit-Card submission area.

Pitcards should be marked appropriately indicating that the trade is an EFP
(marked with and E) or an EFS (marked with an F).
