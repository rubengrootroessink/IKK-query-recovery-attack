Hi guys,

This is an article that ran yesterday in the L.A. Times, and I believe on
Sunday in the New York Times by Rod Smith on Chardonnay.  D-G gets a nice
mention so I thought I'd try to pass it along.

Let me know if this comes through since it's the first time I've attempted
to forward an aritcle.

Dan

my motto. I was simply bored with the sameness of the oak-flavored grape
syrups so many California vintners were producing from the state's two
predominant varieties.
