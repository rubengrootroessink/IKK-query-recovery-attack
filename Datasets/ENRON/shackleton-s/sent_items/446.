This appears to be an open position since neither party has terminated on the Master Log.

(1)  Any reason why one party cannot terminate?
(2)  Is this a single swap or several?
(3)  I think PWC ought to reveiw our "valuation" (and Bob's curve) since it becomes a matter of public record when the claim is filed in the bankruptcy.  Any valuation ought to be documented.

Carlos Ruiz is asking for the value of the ENA/Garden State Paper (GSP) swap to be included as a creditor in the GSP bankruptcy.  GSP is a bankrupt affiliate and the purpose of the valuation is not to settle but merely to show the claim that ENA has against GSP.  Can I provide him a MTM on the position?  

The internal attorney involved is Cheryl Lindeman.

Thanks
