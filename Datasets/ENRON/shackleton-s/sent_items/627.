Sara,

Further to my voicemail message of this afternoon, attached is the "merger
letter".  As it happens, both Chase and Morgan had ISDA agreements in
place.  The letter selects the Chase agreement (which, as you know, we
amended earlier this week), as the preferred agreement, and terminates the
Morgan agreement.

Please review and call me (212-270-2673) if you have any questions.  If the
letter is acceptable, please call me and I'll arrange for execution copies
to be sent to your attention.

Thankyou again for you help.

Maureen.
