That's always been an issue.  I don't think that Angelo handles all commodities.  ENA also books financial weather, paper/pulp, rate/currency, crude, steel, plastics, etc.  Credit Ag can pick up all products so Beth Apollo should be able to verify.  Sara

Ed made the point that we need to make sure we have picked up all commodities associated with the contracts we send demand letter for.  I'll talk to Angelo to see if he picked up all commodities.  If not we may need to slow down (unfortunately) in order to sweep the landscape for other commodity unpaid invoices (besides gas).  

See you in the morning.
