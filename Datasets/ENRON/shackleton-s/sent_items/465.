=09=09March 13, 2002  ---------BEAUX FRERES AND BROADLEY SALES ALMOST OVER!=
!!=09
[IMAGE]=09   Dear Wine lover  We've been offering  Broadley and Beaux Frere=
s' new 2000 vintage Pinot noirs at a pretty big discount, and they are abou=
t to raise their prices by $10  a bottle. This is a great last minute chanc=
e to save a lot of  money (save about $120 a case!). And we are still offer=
ing a 10% discount off the sale price on a full case when you  use 3 day ai=
r to ship.   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]               [IMAGE]  Beaux Freres winemake=
r Mike Etzel Trying the 2002 vintage   Beaux Freres  Pinot Noir 2000 $56.99=
 SALE  will be  $68.99 after Friday This is their standard bearer- their  f=
lagship wine that gets such high ratings each year. The 99 was one of two O=
regon wines on the "2001 Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines  of the World" list. =
This wine should do at least as well.   An excellent vintage from Ribbon Ri=
dge, the 2000 has a deep  saturated ruby/purple color. Ripe black cherry, c=
ola, and blackberry fruit dominate the bouquet. In the background a hint of=
 spicy  oak can be discerned. Still youthful, this medium to full-bodied wi=
ne has a layered palate, moderate tannin and a sweet, long  finish. It is a=
lways difficult to compare one vintage to another, but 2000 may represent a=
 hypothetical blend of 1998 and 1999. It  is not as powerful, muscular or t=
annic as the 1998 nor as forward, charming and accessible as the 1999. It i=
s a big wine and  certainly ranks with our finest vintages to date: 1993, 1=
994, 1998, and 1999.   JEAN SAYS; THIS IS GREAT WINE! 4-12 YEAR CELLARING, =

eyard 2000 $44.99  SALE  will be $56.99 after Friday    Their finest Shea V=
ineyard offering to date. It displays a healthy  saturated dark ruby color =
with purple nuances. Shea tends to be a seductive, open-knit effort, even i=
n a more tannic year such as  2000. Copious sweet, creamy, black cherry and=
 berry fruit intermixed with toasty wood emerge from the wine's aromas. Med=
ium to  full-bodied and fleshy, with more structure than previous vintages,=
 the 2000 offers the vineyard's hallmark black fruit and a  silky, lusty, h=
edonistic personality. It should drink well young , and evolve nicely for a=
 decade. Vineyard Manager: Dick  Shea.  Beaux Freres  Belle Soeurs Temperan=
ce Hill Vineyard  2000 $44.99 SALE will be $56.99 after Friday   Their firs=
t offering from Temperance Hill Vineyard, located in the Eola  Hills of the=
 Willamette Valley. This dynamic wine possesses a saturated dark ruby color=
 and a sweet nose of cranberry, strawberry  and black cherry fruit. An impr=
essive attack is followed by moderate yet ripe tannin. The wine reveals sed=
uctive aromatics, fine  density, medium to full body, and plenty of materia=
l, but it will require a year or two of cellaring in order to shed its tann=
in.  At its best between 2004-2012. Vineyard Manager: Dai Crisp       Just =
