I have verified that ECI, although a non-debtor entity, must have all proposed dispositions of assets or liquidation of positions approved by Ernst & Young ("E&Y").  Brent Hendry's memo of December 20, 2001 contains the phone/fax numbers for Cindy Ma who is our contact person.  Cindy's email address is:   cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 917-680-7810.

Cindy Ma is currently in transit back to New York.  Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.  You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.  I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from Tony Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.  I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their "approval" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your "value" evaporates.  There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.  In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.  By the way, I was unable to return Tony's message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K.

Just copy me in case I receive a call.
