Clint:

Lehman called to discuss the two (2) forwards on 9/28/01 (2,245,761 shares at $56.7925 and 2,434,339 shares at $67.5243, respectively) and roll of the 9/18/01 400,000 share forward into the new forwards.  It appears that you also rolled all of the five (5) remaining forwards which terminated on 10/3/01 into the two new forwards.

Lehman is sending three new confirmations for the foregoing transactions.

Please verify with deal tickets.  I have the ticket for the 400,000 share trade.

Also, can you please verify final confirm format (i.e., blackline sent noon on 9/26/01).  I have Jim's comment for "material information".

Thanks.
