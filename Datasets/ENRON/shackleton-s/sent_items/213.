Ed and Rob:  the ISDA Schedule markup by Con Ed is attached; the CSA will follow.  

Ed:  Can you resolve credit issues with Triche before the end of next week?  I think credit will drive a major part of the agreement.  

Do you guys want to meet early next week?

Sara

sara,
as discussed attached is a cleaned up redlined version of the schedule.  as
you know, there are still several open issues, but hopefully, it will be
easier to work from this document.  in the meantime, i will work on
redlining the csa and reviewing some of the open issues in the schedule that
are in my court.  thanks for your help and have a great weekend! <<enron
