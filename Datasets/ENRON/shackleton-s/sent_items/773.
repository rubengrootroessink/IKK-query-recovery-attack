Hi Sara:

Happy Birthday. I had a great time in New Orleans but was unable to hook
up with Monty. Hopefully, I was able to succesfully forward to you my
reply to Donna's email about getting together this Thursday. I can not
wait to see you both. My cell number is 281-435-3672 if our plans need
to be changed. I will be out of town tomorrow and Wednesday, but back
Thursday. You can email me or leave a message at my office or call me on
my cell.

Take Care and see you Thursday,

Carson
