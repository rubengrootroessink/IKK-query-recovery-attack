Sara,
	I was just following up on what the status of our review of the "Three-way" agreement and referral agreement contracts that we are pursuing with Plains Resources, in order to facilitate small producer hedging.  If you could give me a call or reply with where we stand, I would appreciate it.  Thanks

Mark
