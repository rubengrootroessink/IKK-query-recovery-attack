Thanks for the notice.

Do you have the referenced process in electronic format?  If so, please forward.  Otherwise, can you have a hardcopies made and forward to Mike and I?

Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.  You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.

I have copies of "processes" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.

Mike:  the "teaser letter" has not been approved by Weil and we will need approvals before we can go forward.
