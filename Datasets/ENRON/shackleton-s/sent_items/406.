When Sheila left the company, the check had not been received.  Laurel is now on ECS, 4th floor, and is checking for receipt of the check.

Joe,

I faxed the Cleary, Gottlieb letter to you.  

Please forward the Enron North America Corp. check to Laurel Adams, ECS 04487.  

Many thanks for all your assistance.

Sheila
