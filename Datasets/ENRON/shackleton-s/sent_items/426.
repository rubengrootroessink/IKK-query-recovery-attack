Sorry, I was on the phone.  
Financial contracts are all 2-way.  Ignore my prior email

I thought you've been saying Financial are largely 2-way but a few are 1-way and we would need to check for those.  Now "financial contracts are 1-way."  I'm confused.

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?
