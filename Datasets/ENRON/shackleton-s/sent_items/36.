Hey, Lynn:
 
I'm a survivor!  But, one never knows from day to day.  When you return I'll fill you in on the details.  Hope you have a successful trip.  When do you return?
 
Sara

Sara  I have been concerned about your status and wanted to check and see if you were still around.  (I do not know many people in the ENA/EWS but like the few I know!) 
 
I am in Brazil this week straighterning out the mess.  
 
FYI, they are actually doing financial derivatives.  The government does not recognize them as such but that is clearly what they are.
 
Talk to you when I return to Houston.
