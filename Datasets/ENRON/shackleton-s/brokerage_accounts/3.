Sara,
In response to your request to Michael Brown et al for a copy of all 
brokerage agreements I attach the only other brokerage agreement that our 
archive department could find.  The other recipients of your email have let 
me know that they do not have any brokerage agreements. 


Let me know if you need anything else.
Many thanks
Lorna
