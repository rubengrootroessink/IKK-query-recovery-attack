Marie:  Who are the people you normally appoint to sign, etc., on brokerage 
accounts?  Should Enron South America consider using the same people in order 
set up this account?  We could then appoint Enron South America people 
later.  Thanks.  Nancy

I spoke with Ted Murphy regarding setting up the brokerage account for the 
Copel shares.  He indicated that the easiest thing to do is coordiante with 
Sara Shackelton (ECT finance lawyer).  Typically, she sets up the paperwork 
and Ted (or Rick) signs off on setting up the account (she has done this many 
times).  Robert may have already done this or it may not be necessary in this 
case - I will leave that up to him.  Regardless, Ted (or Rick) does need to 
be one of the people who sign the documents.  Sorry for the delay.

Patrick
