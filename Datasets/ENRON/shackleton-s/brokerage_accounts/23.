The company you mention is run by the ESA group.  I think based on your email 
we would need Joe Kishkill and perhaps one or two others who are officers of 
the company (and are also management of ESA) together with Ted Murphy.  If 
you only need one officer of the company, I suggest Joe Kishkill but Robert 
should make final decision.  I apologize if there was confusion on this.

Thanks,  Bruce

Nancy,

I am confused by your e-mail.  I thought the brokerage account was going to 
be opened for Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd., not Enron South America.  
We typically require any one of the President, any Managing Director or the 
Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, together with any one of the Managing 
Director, Legal, Rick Buy or Ted Murphy.  Of course, the level of officers 
may vary from entity to entity. 

Marie

Marie:  Who are the people you normally appoint to sign, etc., on brokerage 
accounts?  Should Enron South America consider using the same people in order 
set up this account?  We could then appoint Enron South America people 
later.  Thanks.  Nancy

I spoke with Ted Murphy regarding setting up the brokerage account for the 
Copel shares.  He indicated that the easiest thing to do is coordiante with 
Sara Shackelton (ECT finance lawyer).  Typically, she sets up the paperwork 
and Ted (or Rick) signs off on setting up the account (she has done this many 
times).  Robert may have already done this or it may not be necessary in this 
case - I will leave that up to him.  Regardless, Ted (or Rick) does need to 
be one of the people who sign the documents.  Sorry for the delay.

Patrick
