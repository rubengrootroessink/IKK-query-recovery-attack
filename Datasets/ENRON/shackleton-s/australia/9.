Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.
