I am pleased to announce that as detailed below, we now have an ISDA in place 
between Westpac and ENA. Trading between these parties can resume as far as 
Legal is concerned.

David Minns is working on finalizing the ISDA between Enron Australia and 
Westpac based on the above agreement. I would expect that to be concluded 
shortly.
