David,

I am attaching my September 9, 1999 memo on the tax issues associated with 
the financial trader in Sydney.  It clearly summarizes not only our internal 
discussions at that time but also the advice that PWC-Sydney gave regarding 
using a mark-up.  Please let me know when you and Heidi would be available to 
discuss the mark-up in more detail so that we can quickly resolve this issue 
and execute the agreement.

Best regards,
Susan

I've checked my notes and spoken to Heidi and it appears the delay was 
settling the mark up (107.5%) in the Agreement. Heidi believes that this 
figure can be reduced to 100% (which is current practice). If everyone is 
agreeable I will arrange execution.

Subject: Revised Australian Services Agreement

Attached please find my mark-up of the Australian Services Agreement. I have 
attached a blacklined version for ease of reference. 

Apart from changing the name from ECT to ENA, I have modified clause 1 in 
Schedule 1 to more accurately reflect the intended products.



Please call me if any questions. 

Many thanks, 

Shari
