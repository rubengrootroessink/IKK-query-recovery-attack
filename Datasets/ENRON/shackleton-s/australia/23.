Shari,

Thought I might just touch base to see if you received the documents that I 
sent
to you.
If by chance you haven't received them, then please let me  know and I will 
see
what happened to them.
Talk to you soon.

Regards
Dave

Hello David - Nice to hear from you. We would be happy to have a futures
agreement with ABN in Sydney and we will be dealing in the name of Enron North
America Corp.

As you know we have a futures agreement in place with ABN AMRO Inc. and it was
heavily negotiated. I would appreciate it if you could have a look at that
agreement since we will be asking for substantially the same changes in the 
ABN
AMRO Sydney Agreement. I negotiated it with Maureen Guilfoyle who is a Sr. VP 
in
your Chicago office. Her fax no is 312-855-5284. Tel: 312-855-3772.

My contact details are: tel: 713-853-9477/fax: 713-646-3490 and you already 
know
my email address. You are welcome to send me the document either by fax or ny
email.

Kind regards,

Shari Stack

Shari,

Hello, my name is David Kennedy of ABN AMRO Futures in Sydney. I met with 
Shane
Dallman of your Sydney branch and had discussions regarding doing some 
execution
into the Australian market. He seems comfortable with us doing this, and
therefore has asked me to make contact with you, in regards to documentation.
We presently have documents in place for the U.S, but for Shane to be able to
trade in the Australian market we require new documents for the Sydney branch.
If possible, it would help if you could supply me with the correct name that
need to be on the documents.
Once I have received this info I will send the documents to you for signing.

Please feel free to email me with any questions you have regarding this 
process,
or call on 612 9259 5886.

Yours faithfully

David Kennedy
Director
Head of Futures
