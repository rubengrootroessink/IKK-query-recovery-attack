Sara,

When I sent you the following message on April 12th, I thought it was clear 
that Enron Australia Finance Pty Limited should not act as principal for 
entering into the non-power futures agreement with ABN AMRO.  Sorry for the 
confusion.  Rather, ABN AMRO should enter into the agreement with ENA.  
(Shane should only enter into trades under the futures agreement acting 
pursuant to the services agreement.  Of course, based on David's e-mail 
messages, it appears that the services agreement needs to be executed 
following resolution of the questions regarding the mark-up.)

Note further that as stated in my September 9, 1999 memo that I sent you in 
the April 12th e-mail (and that is re-attached below), our Australian tax 
advisor advised that if a master contract must be executed in Australia, it 
should be executed by an independent agent (such as a lawyer) having a power 
of attorney from ENA.

Hope this helps.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further 
questions.

Best regards,
Susan

Subject: Australian Financial Trader Tax Issues - Revised Memo

Sara,

As we discussed, attached is the memo that I wrote last September on the tax 
implications of having a financial trader in Sydney.  As you will note, we 
followed a service fee approach to reimburse the Sydney office on a cost-plus 
basis for the costs incurred by the financial trader (including his 
remuneration).  Important in this arrangement is that the Sydney financial 
trader is not the principal in the trades but is only acting in a preparatory 
or auxiliary manner for the ENA financial trades.

As we discussed yesterday, I will forward the latest draft of the service 
agreement to you by e-mail.  David, could you send Sara and me conforming 
copies of the executed agreement?

Also, we should probably also discuss the status of the documentation 
relating to these trades.

I will be happy to discuss this memo with you in more detail at your 
convenience.

Best regards,
Susan

Susan:  You were going to verify whether the ABN AMRO futures agreement 
should be executed by Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. (or ENA with Shane 
acting pursuant to the Services Agreement).  Please let me know so that 
either David or I can move forward on the futures agreement.  Thanks.  Sara

I've checked my notes and spoken to Heidi and it appears the delay was 
settling the mark up (107.5%) in the Agreement. Heidi believes that this 
figure can be reduced to 100% (which is current practice). If everyone is 
agreeable I will arrange execution.

Subject: Revised Australian Services Agreement

Attached please find my mark-up of the Australian Services Agreement. I have 
attached a blacklined version for ease of reference. 

Apart from changing the name from ECT to ENA, I have modified clause 1 in 
Schedule 1 to more accurately reflect the intended products.



Please call me if any questions. 

Many thanks, 

Shari
