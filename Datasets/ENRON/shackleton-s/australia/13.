Shari see attached. Paul Quilkey is going to arrange a phone hook up to see 
if we can finalise this matter.

Subject: Financial Trading in Australia

We met with Gary Hickerson and Paul Quilkey late last week and explained our 
findings. It now appears that whilst the primary purpose for transacting is 
to hedge existing risks (as explained in my memo of 7/29), Gary wants to be 
able to enter into Transactions (also as defined in my memo) - particularly 
the purchase and sale of equities - on a more proprietary/speculative basis.

Therefore, he has asked that we look into what it would take for us to obtain 
a Securities Dealer's License. I would be grateful if you could please 
prepare a short memo and set forth what the capital requirements, reporting 
requirements, monitoring, experience and education level of staff, 
performance bond, exact level of "surplus liquid funds", length of time for 
application to be processed, ongoing obligations, etc... would realistically 
be.

I know these topics were generally addressed in Scott's fax of July 14th but 
I would be grateful if one of you could please condense this and give us 
specifics that we can present to Gary. Please call me if you want to discuss.

Many thanks, 

Shari
