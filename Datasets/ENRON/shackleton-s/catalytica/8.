Thanks for sending me the document I requested.

I spoke with Locke Liddell & Sapp. As of 5:30 Houston time they had not
spoken live with ENA legal, but had exchanged non-substantive messages. Chip
Rainey is available tomorrow and will continue to try to reach ENA.

We did discuss Locke Liddell & Sapp's markup in more detail. I now believe
the upshot of their conversation with ENA legal will be that any issues are
minor.
