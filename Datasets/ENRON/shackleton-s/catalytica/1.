CATALYTICA COMBUSTION SYSTEMS EARNS ISO 9001 REGISTRATION


MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA (January 12, 2000) - Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc.,
a subsidiary of Catalytica, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTAL), today announced that it has
earned ISO 9001 Registration from Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL) for
the production of Xonon,  a product used for pollution control in gas
turbines.  The ISO series standards are internationally recognized quality
management system requirements developed by the International Organization
of Standardization (ISO).  ISO 9001 is the most comprehensive standard in
the ISO 9000 series.  It covers design, manufacture, installation, and
servicing systems.

"ISO 9001 registration of Catalytica Combustion Systems underscores our
commitment to consistently high manufacturing quality and demonstrates that
we are prepared to meet the requirements and expectations of gas turbine
manufacturers offering Xonon to their customers," stated Steve Oliva,
Catalytica Combustion Systems vice president of manufacturing.

The Xonon Cool Combustion system achieves stable combustion required for
optimal gas turbine performance at temperatures low enough to essentially
avoid the formation of NOx, a primary contributor to smog.  Xonon has
demonstrated the lowest combustion emissions observed in gas turbine
operation.

Catalytica has signed agreements with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney
Canada and is in discussions with several other leading turbine
manufacturers for the adaptation of the Xonon Combustion System for gas
turbines in their product lines.  These gas turbines are used in large-scale
and distributed power generation as well as mechanical drive applications.
In December 1999, Catalytica announced that Enron North America ordered GE
Frame 7FA gas turbines equipped with Xonon for its Pastoria project under
development in Southern California.

Catalytica, Inc. builds businesses in high growth industries where the
Company's technologies optimize manufacturing and solve environmental
problems. Catalytica Pharmaceuticals, Inc. provides drug development and
manufacturing products and services to the pharmaceutical industry;
Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. has developed and is producing Xonon
Cool Combustion for pollution prevention in gas turbines for power
production and mechanical drive applications; and Catalytica Advanced
Technologies, Inc. serves as the incubator for new catalytic technologies
for industrial applications.  Catalytica, Inc. employs over 1600 people and
had 1998 revenues of $406 million.   Find Catalytica on the World Wide Web
