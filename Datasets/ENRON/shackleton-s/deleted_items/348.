Argyle Pinot Noir 2000 $17.59 SALE! Regular $19.99
Argyle's 2000 vintage Pinot Noir is available now and it's time to stock up on this excellent value before
the reviews come out. The 2000 Pinot Noir is a bright, deep ruby red. The aromas are of a complex combination of spices (cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla), black fruits, and earth. Flavors lean toward black fruits; black cherries and blackberries with a small earthy and seasoned cedar component.. Medium-bodied, this wine is unctuous with big fruit and a firm tannin finish sanded by sweetness from the fruit flavors.. The finish is long with a nice balance between sweet, ripe fruit and soft, chewy tannins. Drink now or cellar three to four years.

 Reininger Walla Walla Valley Winery
http://www.avalonwine.com/reininger.htm 
 Merlot 99 $29.99 - A very fruit forward, well-balanced wine displaying tantalizing flavors. The nose greets you with black fruits, hints of tobacco, and whispers of coconut and vanillin. The mouth bursts with bing cherries, while the finish suggests essences of Russian olive and light oak. Elegant structure gives this wine moderate aging ability though is very enjoyable now.
Cabernet Sauvignon 99 $32.99- A very rich and complex wine, dark red in color. Flavors of ripe plum and vanillin lead off the nose with hints of spice, mocha and black fruits in the mouth. The well-rounded tannins make the expansive mouth feel soft yet structured. A big, lingering finish completes this gorgeous wine. 92 Points Wine Enthusiast
 Syrah 99  $29.99- A wine possessing deep, rich color. The nose reflects aromas of baking spices and blueberries while the mouth hints of raspberries and apricots. The very light influence of oak allows the true essence of the fruit be revealed. The wine is very soft in the mouth with well-integrated tannins that define a very balanced wine with an elegant, seamless finish.

Seven Hills Winery
http://www.avalonwine.com/seven-hills-winery.htm 
There's a new article by our staff writer Christina Kelly 
on the Seven Hills Winery here:http://www.avalonwine.com/seven-hills-winery.htm 
Syrah 99- very limited Softer tannins and very broad, full mid-palate flavors characterize this wine. The aroma is of red fruits and smoky Syrah varietal character, surrounded by complex oak tones of spice and vanilla. There's a great balance on the palate, with a natural harmony and brightness between fruit, acidity and tannins.

Jean's Choices this month
I don't usually put my own preferences out, but this month, there are some great "sleeper" wines and some excellent prices that you might miss while wandering through the 3600+ pages that are the Avalon site (Argh!! How did I do that!!)  I've been tasting wines like crazy for the last month, and some of these are really lovely, but they haven't been reviewed yet, or they are too obscure to hit the press.  So here, for what it's worth, are the wines that, as work on the website,  I type in and say to myself "I hope they find this, it's a good one!"
 
Andrew Rich Cuvee B Pinot Noir 99 $15.99
Cuvee B Pinot Noir is made from the same grapes as his regular 99 Pinot Noir, but from younger vines or graes that did not quite make the cut for his 99 blend. This is a happy mood making, easy drinking Pinot with lots of spice and soft red cherry fruit. A GREAT DEAL!http://www.oregongourmet.com/andrew-rich-cuvee-b.html 
Beaux Freres Belles Soeurs Shea 2000 $44.99 regular $49.99
The best wine from Shea Vineyard I've ever had. Incredibalievable!   A yumm bucket.
http://www.oregongourmet.com/beaux-freres-belles-soeurs-shea-2000.html 
 
Broadley Marcile Loraine 2000 $49.99
Morgan Broadley told me a restaurant's staff  that came to the winery to taste drank up his whole tasting bottle in a jiffy and I can tell you they had good reason to. This is stellar Pinot Noir in the Broadley tradition. VERY VERY LIMITED. The nose was full of truffles and bitter chocolate and a hint of licorice that I find in most of the Broadley estate wines. The flavors were layered and complex, with every kind of spice and seasoning entwined with big black fruit, cassis, plum, and blackberry. The finish went on for 5 minutes, I think. The Claudia's Choice 2000 is just as good in its own way.http://www.oregongourmet.com/Broadley-Marcile-Loraine.html 
 
Fiddlehead Pinot Noir 96 $33.99
Kathy Josephs is one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet, and she makes wonderful Pinot Noir. Based in Santa Barbara, she is better known in CA. In 1996 she started making a limited bottling of Oregon Pinot Noir, and we are so fortunate to have a supply of this wonderful wine. I tried it and it is drinking beautifully, and showing all the complexity and intriguing mystery of well made, well aged Pinot Noir. The wine has been perfectly cellared since bottling with no exposure to heat or shipping trauma.
I suggest a vertical tasting of her wines- we have the 96, 97, and 98 available. This wine is well worth a try, if only to see what well made Oregon Pinot Noir is capable of five years out.http://www.avalonwine.com/fiddlehead.htm 
 
High Pass Pinot Noir Walnut Ridge Vineyard 99 $35.99
High Pass Scheurbe Late Harvest 2000 375 ml $22.99
Dieter Boehm's vineyards are a stone's throw from Big Pink (Avalon's farm and web office) and as with Broadley (a stone's throw in a different direction), there's world class wine in the hills of the Monroe and Junction City! High Pass is the classic sleeper winery, making wines that the most experienced wine judges I know are ranking at the top of the list. Both of these wines are outstanding examples of their type. I wish I could afford to take home more of the late harvest wine- I can't pronounce it, but I sure like it. I thought is was as good as some of the $80 ice wines from Canada. And the Pinot is rich, almost buttery, with a meaty hit that would stand up well to roast leg of lamb. This could be a great choice for Easter dinner.http://www.avalonwine.com/highpass.htm 
 
Patricia Green Cellars Pinot Noir Estate 2000 $29.99
This wine tastes a lot like Beaux Freres' signature Pinot Noir, their Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir. The vineyard is right next to Beaux Freres' vineyard, so it makes sense, and Patricia is already pulling great fruit from it. In a few years, this will be the wine she is best known for. Or so I think. Huge Patty Green nose with warm, luscious black cherry and cassis hits along with a dense, earthy undertone that is rich and pleasant. The flavors are of dark blak fruits, spices like cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, a hint of violets and roses, and elegant complexity. The finish is long and silky. Patty is one of my favorite winemakers- her jolly disposition and passion for wine show through in all of her delicious wines. http://www.oregongourmet.com/product1939.html 
 
Thomas Pinot Noir 99 $29.99
He makes very little wine, and some vintages there is no wine as he does not find the grapes up to his standards. When he does drop by with wine, we dance in delight. A wine made with passion and great finesse, age for up to 10 years, classicly Burgundian, with layers and layers of fruit, spice, char and oak, and exotic hints of rose, cinnamon and incense.
