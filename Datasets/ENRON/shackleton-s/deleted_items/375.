> We are well aware that the current situation in Israel may be triggering
> anxiety and concern for you and/or your family as we are about to embark
> on our journey. As a result, we want to take this opportunity to review
> our safety and security measures.
>
> As with all UJC Missions, we will not, under any circumstance, jeopardize
> your safety. And if need be, we will have the flexibility to alter our
> itinerary. Our collective well-being is our first priority.
>
> As we believe you already know, we have an expert security team, involving
> members of the Israeli police force, secret service and private
> contractors, who have already reviewed our itinerary, and on a daily
> basis, once the meeting begins, will monitor us and/our activities. In
> addition, as with all UJC missions, we will have ongoing security on all
> aspects of our meeting, including our "scheduled" free time. And of
> course, we would not leave home without UJC's head of security, Yehuda
> Gershonovitz, our trusted colleague, friend and "family member."
>
> In short, we designed this security plan with the hope that you would be
> able to park whatever concerns you may have with us and the security team,
> freeing you up to get the most out of what promises to be one of the most
> transformative Israel experiences you will ever have.
>
> The program is coming together beautifully. Just yesterday we received
> final confirmation that 31 Israeli women will joining us at different
> points of our experience.
>
> We are looking forward to spending this time with you. Please do not
> hesitate to call us with your questions and/or concerns. Or if you would
> like more information, please visit the UJC Mission's website, www.ujc.org

> See you in a few !!!
