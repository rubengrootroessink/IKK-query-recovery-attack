Dear Forex Trader,

MG Financial Group is building an enhanced Alert!FX system (www.alertfx.com) that will deliver Alerts, according to your specifications, for the Technical Indicators you use on Charts & News v.1.35.

Since it is nearly impossible to monitor the Charts 24 hours a day, you are probably missing important buy or sell indications while away from your computer screen.  Therefore, we'd like to help you stay even closer to the market by developing Technical Alerts, which can be sent to your email address or wireless device.

Please take a few moments to fill out the attached survey questions and you will be assisting our goal of providing the most resourceful tools to facilitate your trading.

By filling out this survey by noon EST on Wednesday, October 24th, 2001, you will automatically receive free access to all three of Forexnews.com's Technical Analysts' Market Services for 1 week:  Cornelius Luca's FX Technical Analysis, J.P. Chorek's Market Chronicles, and Technical Research Limited's Daily Forecast.

The survey can be accessed by going to: http://www.mgforex.com/survey/alertfx20011012.asp

Note: All information received will be kept in the strictest of confidences and will not be disclosed to anyone outside of MGFG personnel.

Thank you for answering this survey.  For additional comments, you can contact us at info@forex-mg.com or by phone at 212-363-5539.

Best Trading Wishes,

MG Financial Group
