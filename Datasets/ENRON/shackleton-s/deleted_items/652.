August. Due to the accounting treatment of foreign insurance payments relat=
ed to the WTC attacks, the deficit could shrink to around $14-15 billion co=
mpared to the $24-25 billion that is expected. The $11 billion in insurance=
 payments would have a positive impact on nominal GDP for Q3 GDP due on Nov=

is completely offset in the deflator and does not affect real GDP, which is=

owing the 9/11 attacks and reduced both imports and exports, but according =
to the commerce department, every $1 billion decrease in the September defi=

hile, the leading indicators index appears to have risen in October by a sl=
ight 0.1% after falling 0.5% in September. However, this figure could be di=
storted upwards due to an irregularity in delivery times.   EUR/USD rose to=
 a session high of 88.38 in European trade, but after its inability to hold=
 onto gains above 88.40 last week, the pair is expected to edge back toward=
s the 88-cent level. On Monday, the euro reached a 3-month low of 87.67 but=
 maintained above key resistance around 87.45. Weighing on the single curre=
ncy was the Bundesbank's November monthly report which indicated as expecte=
d that Q3 growth was flat to negative for the Eurozone's number one economy=
. No growth in Q2 (-0.003%) also contributed to a year on year growth rate =
of around 0.25%, down from 0.6% reported in Q2, thus showing that German gr=
owth rapidly deteriorated towards a technical recession.   GBP/USD rose to =
a session high of 1.4190 after trade data came in largely as expected with =
a September trade deficit of 2.25 billion pounds. Expectations were for a f=
all to 2.1 billion after August's 3.3 billion deficit. The fall in the Sept=
ember trade deficit was helped by a larger than expected surplus with the U=
S. The figure alleviated some concern in the market since last week's comme=
nt by Bank of England member King who pointed out that the current account =
imbalances might lead to a weaker pound.   Nevertheless, cable continues to=
 suffer from this comment as well as last Wednesday's inflation report by t=
he Bank of England, which signaled a shift in market sentiment towards the =
pound. The market is now more aware of the weaknesses the UK faces due to t=
he internal and external imbalances in the economy. Moreover, the market fe=
ars the Bank is more concerned about future inflationary pressures given th=
at interest rates are now at a 40-year low. Therefore, with interest rates =
likely to be left on hold just as the labor market is showing its first sig=
ns of weakness, the pound has slipped from last week's high around 1.46 to =
yesterday's 3-1/2 month lows around 1.41. Dealers say cable's break of supp=
ort at 1.4195 is bearish, and is now targeting the 1.4000 level. Resistance=
 now stands at 1.4195 followed by 1.4220.  Meanwhile, USD/JPY edged back to=
 key support around 122.75 after reaching a fresh 3-month high of 123.45 on=
 Monday. This correction was expected after recent gains, but any selling b=
ack towards 122.50 or 122.00 sould not be enough to offset the overall bull=
ish trend. Sentiment continues to underpin USD because of the renewed momen=
tum in US equities as investors show an increasing appetite for risk. The y=
en also came under additional pressure from mounting worries about the Japa=
nese banking sector ahead of a slew of earnings reports by major Japanese b=
anks later this week. However, it is worth noting that Japanese banking pro=
