RE:		EXCHANGE TO WAIVE LOX SURCHARGES
________________________________________________________

The executive committee of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today
announced that it would, until further notice, waive the surcharges
associated with large order execution (LOX) in natural gas futures.

Under the program, introduced on November 30, there was a $2.50 per contract
surcharge for receiving a response to a request for a quote on simultaneous
execution of a transaction of between 250 and 5,000 contracts, reduced to
$1.50 per contract if the trade was executed.

This move is being made to stimulate activity in this new instrument, which
we are confident will prove useful to both commercial sector participants
and major funds.
