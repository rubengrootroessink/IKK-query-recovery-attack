Hi, Sara.

Brent said that you told him you gave me a copy of the Credit Review Sheet (or Credit Worksheet).  I haven't seen one from you.  Did you give it to someone else to forward to him?

Signed,
"Confused at Enron"

Sara,

I talked with Brent Hendry late yesterday.  He would like to be e-mailed a form template called "Credit Review Sheet" because he is implementing something at his new job similar to what we have.  Who would I call to get such a form?

Thanks!
Becky
