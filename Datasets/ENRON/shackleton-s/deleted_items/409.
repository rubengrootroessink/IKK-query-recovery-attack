NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(P) Concurrent Futures Positions

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may
not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other
bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor
transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a
clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the
concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that
the offset memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing
member filing such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request
that the delay in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the
filing of its clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that
a clearing member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also
files with the clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest
Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract,
including the termination date. The current delivery month in platinum and
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first
business day of the delivery month.

COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may
not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other
bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor
transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a
clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the
concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that
the open positions are filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth
