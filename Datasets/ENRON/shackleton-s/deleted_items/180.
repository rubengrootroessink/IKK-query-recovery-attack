Air Quality Update
 
 
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been  and will continue to be the first priority for the management of this  exchange.  The Exchange has engaged  Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent laboratory specializing  in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality including tests for  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons,  Acenaphthene, Acenaphthylene, Anthracene, Benz (a) anthracene, Benzo (a) pyrene,  Benzo (b) fluorathene, Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene,  Dibenz (a,h) anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene,  Napthalene, Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead,  Manganese, Nickel, Silica, and Zinc.   Air quality tests were performed on September 14th, 20  th, 26 th, October 4 th, 9 th, 12  th, 16 th, 18 th, 23 rd, and  26th, and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA, OSHA,  ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.
 
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on  testing for dangerous chemicals outside the building, as a result of the tragic  events that have occurred in the past six weeks.  Ambient Group, Inc. has secured a  high-volume air sampling monitor (one of only four available to commercial  buildings in New York City) that tests for Benzene, Dioxin, P.C.B.s, as well a  large variety of other air borne chemicals and is based on EPA guidelines.  The Exchange has been testing for these  chemicals for the past few weeks and the first results will be available by next  week.  
 
Going forward, all test results will be posted and made  available to all building occupants on a weekly  basis.
 
Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to  contact Elliot Zuckerman, property manager, at (212)  299-2242.
