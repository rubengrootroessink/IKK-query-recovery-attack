d Japan by Jes Black  At 10:00:00 AM US Jan Existing Homes (exp 5.2 mln, pr=

 euro and sterling but remained mired in recent ranges ahead of this week's=
 key policy meetings and economic data. Fed chairman Greenspan is set to sp=
eak on Wednesday and upbeat US data are expected to allow the chairman to t=
ake an optimistic tone. But accounting concerns have so far constrained the=
 dollar despite signs of a nascent recovery.   EUR/USD fell to a day's low =
of 87.33 but maintained above support at 87.35/40. A break of 87.40 targets=
 87.00/10 followed by 86.50. But the dollar could come under further pressu=
re if investors were seen to be avoiding the US market. Therefore, a key fa=
ctor for EUR/USD this week is corporate sentiment and the direction of US e=
quities. Dealers will closely scrutinize capital flow data to the US and Eu=
rozone. Worries could send the dollar lower across the board and possibly t=
oward 88.80 against the euro in the near term, despite positive economic da=
ta from the US. Resistance is seen at 88.00, 88.60 and even 88.80. But if t=
he pair was to fail breaking the last resistance zone, it could resume its =
downtrend from there. This reflects the view that US equity losses are also=
 a temporary phenomenon and that a rise in the euro is not a reflection of =
its own strength.   Tuesday's German Ifo business survey will also be key t=
o the euro's near term direction as markets expect a rise to 87.3 in Februa=
ry from 86.3. Business confidence probably improved again but has yet to re=
ach the pre-September 11 level of 89.3. However, expectations have greatly =
improved, as evidenced by last week's surge in the German ZEW sentiment sur=
vey to 50.2 from 35.9 in January, which foretells a significant improvement=
 over the next 6 months.  GBP/USD fell to a day's low of 1.4284 as it came =
under increasing pressure against both the euro and dollar. GBP/USD fell ha=
lf a cent to a day's low of 1.4287, while sterling also fell to a low of 61=
.25 pence agaisnt the euro. GBP/USD support seen at at 1.4285, 1.4235, 1.42=
00 and 1.4150. Upside capped at 1.4340, 1.4365 and 1.440. Sterling remains =
weak after back-to-back surprise declines in UK retail sales were seen as a=
 sign that the UK's two-speed economy may be converging finally. With consu=
mer spending falling and manufacturing slowly rising, it stands in sharp co=
ntrast with the upbeat outlook for the US. GBP also likely to remain under =
pressure after PM Blair has stepped up the EMU propaganda machine, which ca=
n weigh on the pound because markets anticipate the pound to join at a lowe=
r value. Moreover, fears of pension reform that could divert asset away fro=
m UK investments, and a possible tax hike to pay for health care reform are=
 two other factors weighing on sterling.  Meanwhile, the yen rose on short =
covering today ahead of this week's two key events in Japan. First, the Jap=
anese government is expected to finally release its anti-deflation package =
on Wednesday, along with proposals for dealing with non-performing loan dis=
posal. Dealers will look for any new easing measures taken by the Japanese =
to tackle deflation. But Should Japanese officials think that the coming gl=
obal recovery will allow them to muddle through and not enact tough love re=
forms, then the market is likely to be disappointed and sell the yen.  Then=
, the Bank of Japan meets on Thursday to set monetary policy, and dealers t=
hink the central bank may increase its purchases of Japanese government bon=
ds to 1 trillion from 800 million. However, this is not expected to satisfy=
 the FX market, which has come to view liquidity as more or less a mute poi=
nt amid rampant deflation and lack of demand. Therefore, the yen is in a lo=
se-lose situation because if the BoJ takes no action the yen is likely to w=
eaken on disappointment. Or, if the BoJ does inject more liquidity, the yen=
 could, as in the past, weaken in reaction. Upside capped at 134.50, follow=
ed by 134.85 and strong resistance at 135.15. Support holds at 133.20, 133.=
0 and 132.50.  Meanwhile, the dollar will continue to trade hesitantly amid=
