Re:       2002 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo

________________________________________________________________________


The Marketing Department has been able to procure a limited number of
tickets to each performance of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo which
starts Tuesday, February 12th and runs through Sunday March 3rd (see
attached performance schedule for detail of dates, times and featured
entertainers).  Each performance includes a variety of rodeo events, e.g.
calf roping, bronco riding, bull riding, barrel racing, etc.   The only
difference between shows is the featured entertainer.

These tickets are available to the entire NYMEX division members on a first
come, first served basis and can be obtained by sending a written request
(see attached application) to the Exchange's Houston office (see
instructions below).  However, in order to ensure fairness, it is requested
that requests for tickets be limited to four tickets per member or eight per
firm.  Requests above eight tickets will be considered on an availability
basis.

REQUEST FOR TICKETS PROCEDURE:

1.	All requests should be submitted to the Houston office in writing
(fax acceptable).  See attached application.

2.	All requests will be handled on a first come, first served basis and
all requests will be handled on a best effort basis.

3.	Please be sure to indicate your first and second choice.  If tickets
are unavailable for both first and second choice or no second choice is
indicated and first choice is unavailable, then NYMEX staff will attempt to
contact the member requesting tickets for instructions.  If unable to
contact member, then the order will be returned unfilled.




4.	All sections of the order form must be completed for processing.  If
the form is not completed correctly, NYMEX staff will attempt to contact the
requesting party for further instructions.  If the party cannot be reached,
then the request will be returned unfilled.

5.	The NYMEX Houston office must receive your order request by February
8th in order to allow for processing.  NYMEX staff will attempt to fill any
late orders on a best effort basis, but NYMEX is not responsible for
unfilled requests or other problems associated with late requests.

6.	Order forms must be legible and correct.  NYMEX staff will attempt
to contact the requesting party in the event of illegible or incorrect
information on the order form, but if unsuccessful, then the request will be
returned unfilled.

7.	Please limit requests to four tickets per member or eight per firm
as referenced earlier, however, NYMEX staff will attempt to accommodate all
requests as indicated in item #2 above.
