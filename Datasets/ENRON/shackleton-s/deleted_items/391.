President Bush this week declared that a new "axis of evil" - Iraq, Iran,
and North Korea - pose a deadly and unacceptable threat to the United
States. The statement was a significant expansion of the scope of the war
on terror, but there have been few details about how the United States
will deal with these nations.

Plus, documents found in the home of Osama bin Laden's military chief,
Mohammed Atef, spotlight specific U.S. sites, including the Capitol and
Seattle's Space Needle, sources tell ABCNEWS. Were these potential terror
targets?
