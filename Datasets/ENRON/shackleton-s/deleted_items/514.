ovoke a break of key support at 1.4140. Follow up support is viewed at 1.41=
0 and 1.4075. Upside capped at 1.4260, 1.430 and 1.4345.  Meanwhile, USD/JP=

m 800 billion also had an initial supportive effect as it was seen easing f=
unding pressures next month. But the yen's gains evaporated as markets saw =
little hope in the Japanese government's anti-deflation package.  The yen s=
hould not fall too much from the increase in liquidity even though it is su=
pposed to mean a weaker yen because there is more of the currency circulati=
ng. Instead, since increasing liquidity in Japan is ineffectual amid struct=
ural barriers causing rampant deflation and lack of demand the yen has resp=

 public funds into the troubled banking sector. Whether there was a quid pr=
o quo agreement remains to be seen. PM Koizumi's anti-deflation package avo=
ided any concrete plan to rescue banks but Hayami worries that without a re=
capitalization Japanese banks will be threatened with losing international =
banking licenses because their capital ratios have fallen to below internat=
ional standards.  Government has tried to avoid a publicly unappealing tax =
payer fund injection, instead opting for creating a floor under asset price=
s which will keep banks capital adequacy ratios above the 8% limit set by t=
he BIS. But an injection of funds would allow banks to write off non-perfor=
