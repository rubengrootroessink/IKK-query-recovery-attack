It is apparent after several conversations last week that we need to come to some agreement on the termination criteria for the financial contracts.  Can we all meet at 11:00 am on the 5th floor in ECS.  I will come back to you all with a room number.

Sara - will you please bring the most recent copy of your list of all counterparties and expected terminations.

Thanks,

Don
