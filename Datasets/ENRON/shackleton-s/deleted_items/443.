Sara:

I think we should get w/ R Baumfield and M Ellenberg to complete the decision tree on trading contracts analysis we started last week.

Per a dicussion I had with Sheila last night, I am setting up a meeting with the participants last week to finish the decision tree tomorrow when Mark is back here in Houston.

In the meantime, I am happy to discuss the topic with you today with Richard Baumfield.

Alan

Can we have a short meeting to identify our immediate path for trade termination?  I'm not certain of the critical steps required before we can begin to respond.  

I have a short list of questions.

I apologize if you covered this in yesterday's meeting.  Thanks.
