Hi Sara--

Enclosed is revised form. I made your changes and changed the signatore lines.  I also added a counterparts sentence (second to last sentence).  Please have it signed and faxed back to me.  Also, as discussed, any help in having the collateral delivery made today would be greatly appreciated.
