SUBJECT:	REVISED: Delisting the FTSE Eurotop 100
 Contract


The COMEX Governors Committee and the NYMEX Board of Directors have voted to
delist the FTSE Eurotop 100
 Contract.  There has been no recent trading in
this contract; and there is no expectation that there will be interest in
the future.

The FTSE Eurotop 100
 Contract Terms and Conditions affect a "Special
Matter" under the terms of the COMEX By-Laws.  Accordingly, COMEX Division
Members have ten (10) days to submit a petition signed by owners of at least
155 COMEX Division Memberships requesting a vote for the COMEX Division
Members to disapprove the amendments, pursuant to the procedures set forth
under COMEX By-Law 205(D).  Following this 10-day period, if a petition is
not received, or if the amendment is not disapproved, the Proposed Contract
Terms and Conditions and the Rule Amendments will be submitted to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
