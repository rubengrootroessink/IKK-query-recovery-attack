Dear Sara,
Our upcoming exhibition of Kirk Hayes' wonderful paintings 
(his first show in Houston) will mark our 25th anniversary, 
and it will also be our final exhibition in Houston ! 
 
Early this summer, Gary and I will move the gallery and our residence 
to southern Arizona.  We've had a wonderful 25+ year run in Houston 
and we're sad to be leaving our many friends and supporters, 
but new adventures beckon.  We're looking forward to many visitors 
once we get settled.  More details to follow regarding our new location, etc.... 
Our final schedule is as follows-
14 Artists  through February 23
FotoFest: Doherty, Sparagana & Stautberg  March 1-30
Our 25th anniversary Swansong event- 
Kirk Hayes: new paintings  April 5-May 4
6! 
Let me know if there's anything you can't (or shouldn't) live without.    
Best, Kathleen
