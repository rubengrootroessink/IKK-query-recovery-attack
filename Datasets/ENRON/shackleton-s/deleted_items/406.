Sara,

I will be out of the office Tuesday through Friday, returning Monday the 11th.  If you need assistance from my group, please contact Ana Rizvi on 853-3552 or Melissa Rodriguez at 345-7679.  

I have requested the missing confirm from RBC, and have obtained the missing confirm from West LB.  We have put in the request to have the 2 Goldman confirms retrieved from archives, and hope to have them tomorrow.  I will review the J. Aron file and see if we have their confirmations.  I'll let you know what I find.
