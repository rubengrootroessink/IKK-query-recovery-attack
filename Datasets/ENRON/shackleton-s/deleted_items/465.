to mind Germany's dilemma of needing a boost from either lower interest rat=

Min Eichel's promise to the EU that the government would bring the budget c=

and that they may indeed face a fine from the EU this year if their growth =
projections are too high and revenue therefore too low, which would push th=

urrency market. At Japan's news conference President Bush and PM Koizumi sp=

 in only one year.   However, the market was disappointed by Japan's shying=
