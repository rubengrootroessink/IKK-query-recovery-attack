Happy Holidays to you and Welcome to Flowers Mail Order Group.   We have
received your request and will add you to our Waiting List.  We plan to send
out two Newsletters during the year, our Spring Offer mails in February, our
Fall Offer mails in August.
We have just completed our Fall 2001 Offer, the wines sold out quickly.
Currently there is no wine available for purchase.
We hope to be able to include you in our Spring 2002 offer.   We will do our
best.  Our wines are offered on a first come, first served basis.  When you
receive an offer and you decide to order, fax it back immediately to avoid
disappointment.  Until then, please keep us informed of any address changes.
Your patience is appreciated.
We invite your to visit our website at www.flowerswinery.com for more
information on all of our releases.
For special questions or observations about the wines, send us an e-mail us
for the quickest response. Thanks for your interest in Flowers wines.  We
look forward to hearing from you.
Regards, Michelle

P.S.  We are located in such a remote area of the Sonoma Coast that our
County Permit does not allow us visitors.  Once our wine is bottled, it is
shipped off premise to the warehouse until release.  We have no bottled wine
on premise and no tasting facility.  We respect these conditions of our
permit to enable us to continue to grow great wine in this area.  The best
way to visit is through our website.  Thanks.
