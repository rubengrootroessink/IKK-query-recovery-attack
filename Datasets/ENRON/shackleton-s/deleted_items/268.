knowledgeable of futures trading or financial regulation or otherwise
capable of contributing to the deliberations of the Board of Directors and
may not be a member of the Exchange or affiliated with any member of the
Exchange or an employee of the Exchange.

After January 22, 2002, the Subcommittee will convene to make its
determination as to the eligibility of the proposed nominees to run in the
category for which he was proposed or otherwise.   Such determination will
be immediately posted.  Should the Subcommittee determine that a proposed
candidate is ineligible to run in the category for which he was recommended,
written notice thereof shall immediately be submitted to that person.  To

Subcommittee's categorization.  Such appeal must be made by 5:00 p.m. on

final ruling no later than February 5, 2002.  At that time, the Subcommittee
will assign the proposed nominees to the proper categories, regardless of

however, only persons who were recommended to be candidates for Vice
