What is Inflation [IMAGE]     Inflation is the rising costs of goods and se=

lanBuilder     [IMAGE]    Lesson 1 of 6: Are you ready to start investing i=
n stocks?   by Douglas Gerlach   Are you ready to start investing in stocks=
? Congratulations. Before you get going, however, there are a few essential=
 concepts you should understand first. Working with these basic concepts is=
 the key to becoming a successful investor. Once you understand the potenti=
al risks, rewards, and how to balance your choices in the market, you'll ha=
ve the right foundation to continue your education and pick stocks for your=
 portfolio.   [IMAGE] There Are No Guarantees  The first thing you need to =
know about investing is this: Whenever you invest, whether in stocks, bonds=
, or even if you simply keep your dollars in a money market fund, there is =
no guarantee you'll make a profit. With some investments, you could even lo=
se money, ending up with less than you started with. Armed with the right k=
nowledge, however, you can improve your odds of success significantly, bala=
ncing the risks of investing with the potential rewards.   [IMAGE] Balancin=
g Risk and Reward  Whenever you invest, you expose your money to some level=
 of risk. You might not think about it, but there is risk involved no matte=
r what you do with your money. Most people recognize that stashing their li=
fe savings under a mattress or in a cookie jar comes with the risk that the=
ir money could be stolen (where do you think burglars look first when they =
rob a house?) or destroyed (you might be able to find a fire-proof cookie j=
ar, but your bed is definitely not safe in that department).  Investing in =
the stock market has its own kinds of risks. A stock you purchase might go =
up or down in price (what's known as "fluctuation"). Stocks are volatile by=
 their very nature, and that's part of the inherent risk of investing in st=
ocks. In the worst case, a stock could even become worthless and cause you =
to lose 100% of your investment. However, it's important to recognize that =
there are different kinds of stocks, and some stocks are riskier than other=
s. You can't ever eliminate the risk associated with investing in stocks-bu=
t you can certainly tame it and even put some of those volatile tendencies =
to work for your benefit.   Keeping Up with Inflation  There is another imp=
ortant kind of risk to consider-- even if you're investing in bonds or just=
 keeping your money in the bank. There's the risk that your investment won'=
t grow fast enough to keep up with the effects of inflation. Over the years=
, inflation has grown at about three to four percent a year on average. If =
your money is sitting in a bank collecting interest at less than the rate o=
f inflation, then that money will actually be worth less when you withdraw =
it at some point down the road.   Not Being Afraid of Risk Whenever you see=
k higher returns, you must accept higher risk. The key is to balance the am=
ount of risk appropriate for your circumstances (what experts call your ris=
k tolerance) with the amount of reward you want to achieve. Every person ha=
s a different tolerance for risk, and it's up to you to decide for yourself=
 how to build a portfolio that will serve you best.  Historically, investin=
g in stocks offers the chance to earn higher returns than investing in bond=
s or keeping your money in the bank, but that opportunity comes with higher=
 risk. The essence of successful investing, though, is understanding and ac=
cepting the fact that risk is unavoidable -- and managing that risk so you =
can still sleep soundly at night.   [IMAGE]Investing, Dollar by Dollar   An=
 important concept that you can put to work when you use ShareBuilder  to i=
nvest in stocks is dollar-cost averaging. While this may sound like some co=
mplicated strategy, it's really not so difficult to understand. When you us=
e dollar-cost averaging, you automatically invest a fixed amount each week =
or month in the purchase of a single security. That's all there is to it!  =
Why is dollar-cost averaging such a good long-term strategy? Stock prices c=
an be volatile, rising and falling from week to week and month to month. Wh=
en you make a weekly or monthly purchase, the price of the stock may be hig=
her or lower than it was the month before. If you invest $100 a month, for =
example, then your $100 will buy fewer shares when the price is high and mo=
re shares when the price is low -- automatically. While dollar-cost averagi=
ng doesn't assure a profit, over time the average cost of your shares will =
generally tend to be lower than if you had made a single one-time investmen=
t of the same amount.   You might be using dollar-cost averaging right now =
without even knowing it. If you invest in a 401(k) or other retirement plan=
 at work, you contribute a fixed amount each pay period to your account, wh=
ich is then used to buy shares in one or more mutual funds. Over time, your=
 regular purchases will probably reduce the average cost you pay for all yo=
ur shares -- and that can help increase your returns.   You should recogniz=
e that dollar-cost averaging doesn't protect you from investment losses. An=
d a stock can decline until it's worthless -- so don't count on dollar-cost=
 averaging to protect you from the damage caused by buying a bad stock.  Sh=
areBuilder is designed to make dollar-cost averaging easy by allowing you t=
o buy in dollar amounts - dollar-based investing. When you buy stocks at a =
typical brokerage, you can only buy whole shares. If your chosen stock sell=
s for $70 a share, and you have $200 to invest, then you can only buy two s=
hares for $140 (plus commissions). The remaining $60 has to sit on the side=
lines until the next month (which means it can't be working for you in your=
 portfolio).   If you have $50 a month to invest at a typical brokerage, an=
d the stock you've selected currently sells for $85 a share, what do you do=
? Either you wait until you scrape together the remaining $35 (and hope the=
 price doesn't go higher), or you find another stock.  With ShareBuilder, d=
ollar-based investing means you can purchase fractional shares with the ent=
ire amount of your investment dollars. Your $200 will buy you 2.857 shares =
of your $70 stock (without commissions). Or your $50 will buy you 0.588 sha=
res of your $85 stock, so you don't have to put off investing until tomorro=
w.   [IMAGE] Putting It All Together  Understanding these three basic conce=
pts is key to becoming a successful investor.   You must be aware of the ri=
sks of investing. Understand how you can use strategies like dollar- cost a=
veraging to invest in stocks. If you invest with your eye on the long-term,=
 you can often ride out bumpy times in the market.  [IMAGE] Tomorrow:  Lear=
