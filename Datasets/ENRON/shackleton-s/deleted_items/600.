Notice to Members #02-73
March 14, 2002


To:	All NYMEX Division Members, Member Firms and Floor Clerks
	All NYMEX Division Clearing Members

From:	J. Robert Collins, President

Re:	REMINDER -- Timely Allocation of Trades



	Please be reminded that, pursuant to NYMEX Rule 9.04(M)(2), Clearing
Procedure, all trades executed on the NYMEX Division Trading Floor must be
allocated within one hour after the Exchange supplies the initial transfer
information.  A Floor Member is required to submit all transfer information,
including a customer account number, clearing member number and customer
type indicator code to the Clearing Member within this time period.  Timely
trade transfer information is extremely relevant for all Clearing Members
for the purpose of risk management.

Floor Members

	The Compliance Review Committee has been working with the Compliance
Depart-ment on a program for attaining compliance with this requirement.
Commencing on Monday, March 18, for the week ending March 15, 2002,
Compliance Staff will be issuing weekly advisory notices to Floor Members
who fail to allocate at least 75% of their transactions within one hour, as
required by Rule 9.04(M)(2).  We hope that this program, utilizing the
advisories, will alert Floor Members to allocation problems and effectively
achieve acceptable timely allocations prior to the formal implementation of
any other disciplinary action.

Clearing Members

	Floor Members have pointed out that trades cannot be allocated in a
timely fashion if incomplete information is relayed by the customer at the
time of order placement.  We are, therefore, requesting that Clearing
Members remind their customers that account information must be supplied to
the Floor Member promptly in order to ensure that trades are allocated in a
timely fashion.
