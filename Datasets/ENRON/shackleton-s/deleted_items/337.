uroda also said Japan, "needs to tackle structural reform in three areas: i=

aying, "...after the financial crises in the region in 1997-98, most Asian =
countries have adopted more flexible exchange rate policies and significant=
ly strengthened their foreign reserve positions. Therefore it is highly unl=
ikely that the yen's recent depreciation will have a significantly negative=
 impact on other Asian economies. Neither is it likely to lead to speculati=
