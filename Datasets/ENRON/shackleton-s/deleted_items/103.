 Weakness in the other major currencies can be attributed to the underlying=
 market perception that aggressive fiscal and monetary policy will pay off =
for investors who bet on the US recovery. Last Friday's German Ifo survey a=
dded weight to that view. The September survey posted the worst figure in 8=
 years and the biggest point decline in 28 years, as it fell to 85.0 from 8=
9.5. This put the market on recession watch, as it reinforced fears of a po=
ssible contraction in German growth for Q4, which would put even Finance Mi=
nister Eichel's 0.75% 2001 growth target at risk. The Ifo report has also s=
haken confidence that the Eurozone economy would outpace the US over the ne=

though a technical recession is still unlikely. According to the Organizati=

own to 1.3% from the earlier 3.1%, while EU 2002 growth forecast was revise=
d to 1.5% from 2.7%.   Falling economic growth has led to rising budget def=
icits and higher unemployment in the Eurozone. This has put the European Ce=
ntral Bank under intense pressure to lower rates, and it will again be at t=
he forefront of investor thought when it meets this Thursday. But even thou=

 calm investors' nerves last week. This will likely keep pressure on the eu=

, the market reaction could be muted because it has already been priced in =
for some time now. Therefore, the euro again finds itself in a lose/lose si=

naged to recover most of Friday's losses, to regain the 109 level. Strong r=
esistance is still seen at 109.50 but further weakness in the Japanese econ=
omy will help to push EUR/JPY higher.   The yen also fell against the dolla=
r to a day's low of 121.70. A sharp year-on-year decline in Japan's trade s=
urplus in September and a further drop of 0.1% in the MITI tertiary sector =
index sent the yen tumbling across the board. However, dealers say that the=
 market has grown resistant to trading the yen lower because the constant s=
