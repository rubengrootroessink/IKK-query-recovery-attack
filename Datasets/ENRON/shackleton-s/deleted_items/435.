Dear Ms. Shackleton,

You very recently requested that your name be added to the Kistler Vineyards
mailing list. Fortunately, we were able to add you starting with the current
Spring 2002 release. Your newsletter and order form are being mailed today.
Please read the introductory letter and newsletter carefully, then respond
as quickly as possible, preferably via an overnight service. We do need a
check and an order of 12 bottles or more within your allocation to process
your order. Before you return your order, please fill in any information
that is not included on your form. Please include a shipping address and
telephone, even if it is the same as your mailing address.

We are mailing your offer to:

SARA SHACKLETON
3915 COLERIDGE
HOUSTON, TX  77005

I look forward to receiving your order and welcome you as a Kistler
Vineyards Mailing List member.

Best regards,

Bill Lewis
Kistler Vineyards
