 1.6350-1.7229 rally, which should hold dealers say. Resistance is seen at =
1.6880.  Economic data on Monday showed the Swiss January jobless rate rose=
 to 2.6% from 2.4% in December, as expected. Recent comments from the Swiss=
 National Bank show they are still concerned by the strong Swiss franc agai=
nst the euro due to the pressure on trade. Blattner also rejected an exchan=
