ORIGINAL MESSAGE - IF YOU DIDN'T RECEIVE IT
 Please mark your calendars for the swap group's "Attorney Roundtable" to meet on the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month from 12 pm until 1pm  (or 1:30 pm) in Conference Room 3824.  Box lunches will be available. The meetings will provide an informal forum for the exchange of ideas and discussion of topics of interest and importance to the swap lawyers.  We presently have no format.  Should we decide that an agenda is necessary, I will be glad to keep a current agenda, log of potential topics, etc.  These lunches are strictly voluntary.  Please let my assistant, Joanne Rozycki, know if you cannot attend (head count for lunches).
