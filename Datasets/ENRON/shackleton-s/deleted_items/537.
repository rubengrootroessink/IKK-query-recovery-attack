Dear Ms Shackleton

The launch date of the 2002 Euromoney Capital Markets Directory is approaching fast and I am taking this opportunity to invite you to reserve your copy of the directory.

The Euromoney Capital Markets Directory has been the definitive contact resource for the financial markets over the past 30 years.  The directory is the best way to find the names and contact details of CEO's, Heads of Departments, Traders, Compliance Officer and Marketing Manager in financial institutions around the world.

Now, for the first time you can purchase The Euromoney Capital Markets Directory separately, or as part of The Euromoney Financial Markets Box Set. New for 2002 the box set extends coverage to include the Capital Markets and Commercial and Private Banking.

The Financial Markets Box Set includes:

1)	The Euromoney Capital Markets Directory both in print and on the Internet, remains the
definitive contact resource for the capital markets covering some 60,000 people. It provides you with telephone and fax numbers, email and postal addresses.

2) The Euromoney Directory of Commercial & Private Banking completes the picture of global wholesale banking.  Coverage extends from senior banking executives to heads of corporate banking, loan officers, trade finance as well as administrative roles.

3) The Financial Markets Index is a reference resource that enables you to locate the contacts in the first two volumes quickly and easily, along with a guide to services offered by banks by country.
