Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 3 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, January 10, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $2,500)
=			$2,500
One Short Tier 3 NG or NN	(1 * $2,000)
=		- 	$2,000
Net Scan Risk		($2,500-$2,000)
=			$   500
Spread Rate		(1* $500)
=		+	$   500
Total Requirement
=			$1,000
