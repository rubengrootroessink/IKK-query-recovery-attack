Since TXU terminated (effective 2/26/02) should we still send the demand letter?  I'm thinking not.  The goal of moving the contract to terminated status has been accomplished and I doubt they will pay anything now considering we have agreed to begin settlement discussion.  Furthermore, I don't want to irritate the situation with them.

What do you think?
