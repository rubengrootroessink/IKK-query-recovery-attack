the USD index is again trading near 15-year highs.  In fact, recent dollar =
strength gave way to corrective yen buying on Monday as USD/JPY fell 1.5% f=

ed worse and have fallen 3.75% and 2.5% respectively, since peaking at 2-ye=

llowing a break in the usual weak yen rhetoric by MoF officials. Hayami rei=
terated his opposition to a weaker yen, arguing that a softer currency is n=
ot a solution to Japan's problems and that manipulating the yen lower would=
 undermine Japan's credibility. However, Hayami's comments are not seen as =
carrying that much weight because it is widely known that the MoF conducts =
FX policy, not the BoJ.  Nevertheless, given the rapid fall in JPY over the=
 past 2 months and the subsequent consolidation, some dealers warn of furth=
er corrective buying in the yen before a renewed fall will push JPY below r=
ecent lows. Some dealers expect a reversal in USD/JPY back as far as the 13=
0 mark. But before that happens, current support at 132.80 and 132.40 will =
have to give. Meanwhile, the upside is capped at 134.00, 134.50, and 134.90=
.  Despite any technical correction in the JPY bear trend, the currency is =

 one-month lows of 187.00. Sterling has now dropped over 2.5% against the y=
