Dear Charts & News Subscribers,

We are pleased to announce that on April 15, 2002, Forexnews.com will begin offering Standard & Poor's MMS' Foreign Exchange "Market Pulse Highlights and Top Stories" to our Charts & News package, version 1.40.

Foreign Exchange Market Pulse Highlights and Top Stories provide real-time intraday commentary on the critical factors driving the global forex market.  Updated around the clock from the three major banking centers of the world, "Market Pulse Highlights and Top Stories" delivers insight into market flows, events, and the latest stories about the economic and political factors moving the forex market.

Over the past 12 months, we have added numerous features to the Charting application including the MACD Alert, Weekly Charts, the DMI and ADX indicators, and Improved Fibonacci & Stochastic Tools.  Diagonal lines have been added to cross through all studies, a Floating Information Box has been incorporated to show the date, high & low, open & close values, and the ability to save lines on indicators into your favorite workspace is one of the latest additions to the system. In version 1.40, Subscribers can use the DDE, which provides MG's real-time rates and data history for various charting software, including MetaStock and TradeStation.

Effective April 15, 2002, Forexnews.com will be increasing the per-month subscription fee from $34.95 to $44.95 for new and renewing subscribers.  As in the past, LIVE & DEMO Account Holders with MG Financial Group will automatically receive access to Charts & News v.1.40 with its new features AT NO ADDITIONAL COST.

CURRENT SUBSCRIBERS to Charts & News will need to submit a new application form, available on our website, at http://www.forexnews.com/external/sp/default.asp.  Clients must submit a new application form on or after April 15, 2002 to begin receiving the enhanced version of the Charts; otherwise their existing subscriptions will be automatically terminated on that date.

Note: **Subscriptions that are purchased or renewed in March or during the first 2 weeks of April will be charged on a pro-rated basis.  If you submit an application form on April 5, for example, your credit card will be charged $11.27, or ($34.95/31days) x 10 days remaining until April 15.

Forexnews.com is glad to continue providing you with the resources to help you make better-educated trading decisions.  For questions or comments, please contact us at (212) 835-0100 or by email at info@forexnews.com.
