the unemployment rate is on its way to hitting 5%. The US Philly Fed survey=

and the market will also look to its new orders component, which is seen as=
 a leading indicator.   The dollar steadied on Thursday after an extremely =

 euro and yen back down amid sentiment that the US would fare better than J=
apan and the Eurozone because of more fiscal and monetary stimulus in the U=
S.  Indeed that sentiment was reinforced by today's cut in the German growt=

nd 0.75% this year and by 1.0-1.5% in 2002. Markets have long been weary ab=
out European nation growth forecasts and this week even the European Union =
warned against what it saw to be over inflated expectations. Therefore, the=
 market has been very reluctant to buy the euro, even amid the US war in Af=
ghanistan (with ground troops now) and increasing occurrences of bio-terror=
ism on US soil.   The short-term outlook for the euro was not helped by the=
 European Central Bank's bulletin which echoed statements from last Thursda=
y when it kept interest rates on hold. The ECB said that despite the fact t=
hat the September 11 attacks could delay a rebound in the euro zone's slugg=
ish economy, it felt that monetary policy was appropriate at the moment. De=
alers were less sure, and kept EUR/USD near day lows around 90 cents. EUR/U=
SD hit a session high of 90.40 but remains in its downward channel since pe=
aking at 93.38 on September 17, and was further weakened by its inability t=
o maintain gains above 90.85 last week, which led to a net reduction in lon=
g positions. Therefore, the technical outlook for the euro remains bearish =
as it targets last week's lows of 89.87. Near-term resistance is seen at 90=
.40 followed by 90.85. Meanwhile, USD/CHF also traded rangebound around the=
 key 1.6400 mark.  The biggest mover was sterling which broke lower out of =
its consolidation pattern. GBP/USD hit a session low of 1.4423 after testin=
g upside resistance at 1.4500. Cable continues to trade in a range from 1.4=
400 to 1.4550 since last Thursday. Resistance is now seen at 1.4450, the 61=
.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.4395-1.4540. If sterling canno=

tracement of the move from 1.37 to last Monday's 8-1/2 month high of 1.4836=
.   Today's mixed retail sales data had little effect on the pound. Monthly=
 retail sales were lower than expected but the August figures were revised =
up. Retail sales growth is still very strong and this is a positive for ste=
rling because it shows a resilient consumer. And, since the BoE has left th=
e door open for more rate cuts, any fall in consumer confidence would likel=
y be met by further rate cuts, thus supporting sterling.  Meanwhile, USD/JP=
Y traded around the 121 figure. A minor setback in USD/JPY came following c=
omments by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who was reported as=
 saying it was harmful to think a weak yen would solve Japan's economic pro=
blems. But, the dollar continues to find support on hopes the U.S. economy =
will improve in the long term. Today, Finance Minister Shiokawa said he cou=
ld not assure that the Japanese economy would not contract. But this was no=
t a surprise to the markets considering Japan's GDP fell 0.8 percent in Apr=
il-June from the previous quarter, and many economists expect full-year con=
traction for the current fiscal year ending in March 2002. USD/JPY now hove=
ring above support at 120.85 after failing to break resistance around the 1=
22 level on Wednesday. For now, bull trend remains in doubt unless it can r=
egain the 121.00 level. If not, USD/JPY expected to trade in a range of 120=
 to 122.  European bourses are down around 2% this morning, following techs=
 lower after yesterday's slide in the Nasdaq. The tech sector is under heav=
y pressure and 4 key tech companies report today. Those are Sun, Ebay and G=
ateway. But Microsoft's announcement is not seen to be key because the rele=
ase of Windows XP later this month will put that revenue in next quarter's =
release. GM's earnings will be watched for a positive surprise considering =
their large gains in market share through 0% financing in the later part of=
