.75 to a session high of 128.95, but offers from Japanese exporters and spe=
culators capped gains and held the pair below Monday's high of 129.15. USD/=
JPY rose to a day's high as profit-taking in the Nikkei's four-day rally of=

s to whether the Nikkei can maintain its recent gains after the March 31 fi=
scal year end and whether the spectacular rise in yen on speculative tradin=
g will come undone over the next few weeks. BoJ Governor Hayami alluded to =
this on Friday when he said he expected the market to be stable through the=
 end of March, but did not say what could happen afterwards.  USD/JPY was a=
lso supported by further indications from Japanese officials that the yen's=
 sharp rise last week was problematic for the Ministry of Finance which pre=
fers a stable currency. Economics Minister Takenaka reiterated today that t=
he yen's recent rise was too rapid and his comments were expected to keep s=
peculators at bay. This followed Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the finance mini=
stry's international bureau, who warned on Monday the authorities were prep=
ared to take intervene in the markets if necessary.  This morning's announc=
ement by the Japanese Government Pension Investment Fund had little effect =
on the yen despite it showing the fund would shift its weighting to 8% fore=
ign bonds from 6% and reduce its holding of domestic stocks and bonds in re=
sponse. Dealers say the 9 trillion yen in new money will likely be put in f=
oreign assets too.  USD/JPY is now supported at 127.75, which marks the 38.=
2% retracement of the 115.75-135.15 move. On Monday, it provided a solid ba=
se for a corrective rally in the pair to a high of 129.15. However, specula=
