>>Here is a great story that one of my Veteran buddies sent me this 
>>morning..... thought I would pass this along... 
>>One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my 
>>class 
>>was walking home from school. His name was Kyle. It looked like 
>>he was 
>>carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, "Why would anyone 
>>bring 
>>home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd." 
>> 
>>I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my 
>>friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went 
>>on. 
>> 
>>As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They 
>>ran at 
>>him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he 
>>landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land 
>>in the 
>>grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this 
>>terrible 
>>sadness in his eyes. 
>> 
>>My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and as he 
>>crawled 
>>around looking for his glasses, and I saw a tear in his eye. As I 
>>handed 
>> him his glasses, I said, "Those guys are jerks. They really 
>>should get 
>>lives." 
>>He looked at me and said, "Hey thanks!" There was a big smile on 
>>his 
>>face. 
>>It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude. > 
>>I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As 
>>it 
>>turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen 
>>him 
>>before. He said he had gone to private school before now. 
>>I would have never hung out with a private school kid before. We 
>>talked 
>>all the way home, and I carried some of his books. He turned out 
>>to be a 
>>pretty cool kid. I asked him if he wanted to play a little 
>>football with 
>>my friends. He said yes. We hung out all weekend and the more I 
>>got to 
>>know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of 
>>him. 
>>Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of 
>>books 
>>again. 
>>I stopped him and said, "Boy, you are gonna really build some 
>>serious 
>>muscles with this pile of books everyday!" He just laughed and 
>>handed 
>>me half the books. 
>>Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we 
>>were 
>>seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on 
>>Georgetown, 
>>and I was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be friends, 
>>that 
>>the miles would never be a problem. He was going to be a doctor, 
>>and I 
>>was going for business on a football scholarship. Kyle was 
>>valedictorian of our class. 
>>I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He had to prepare a 
>>speech 
>>for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there 
>>and 
>>speak. Graduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He was one 
>>of 
>>those guys that really found himself during high school. He filled 
>>out 
>>and actually looked good in glasses. He had more dates than I had 
>>and 
>>all the girls loved him. Boy, sometimes I was jealous. 
>>Today was one of those days. I could see that he was nervous about 
>>his 
>>speech. So, I smacked him on the back and said, "Hey, big guy, 
>>you'll 
>>be great!" He looked at me with one of those looks (the really 
>>grateful 
>>one) and smiled. "Thanks," he said. 
>>As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began. 
>>"Graduation 
>>is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough 
>>years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a 
>>coach...but 
>>mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of you that being a 
>>friend to 
>>someone is the best gift you can give them. I am going to tell 
>>you a 
>>story." 
>>I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of 
>>the 
>>first day we met. He had planned to kill himself over the weekend. 
>> He 
>>talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't 
>>have to 
>>do it later and was carrying his stuff home. He looked hard at me 
>>and 
>>gave me a little smile. 
>>"Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from doing the 
>>unspeakable." I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this 
>>handsome, 
>>popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I saw his Mom 
>>and dad 
>>looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not until that 
>>moment did I realize it's depth. 
>>Never underestimate the power of your actions. With one small 
>>gesture 
>>you can change a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts 
>>us 
>>all in each other's lives to impact one another in some way.
