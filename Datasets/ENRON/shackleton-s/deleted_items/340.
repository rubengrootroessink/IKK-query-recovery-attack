Veronica,

Attached is a schedule of l/c's that will be expiring over the next 3 weeks.  Please coordinate with Sara to see specifically, which Enron entities and l/c's that we need to pursue.

Tom:

Time is running out for the month of January and we need your list and copies of LC's expiring at the end of the month as well as positions to determine possible draws.  Are you handling this?
