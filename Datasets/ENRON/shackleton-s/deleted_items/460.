To:		NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Members

From:		Barry Loyal
		Human Resources Department

Subject:	Members' Group Long Term Disability Renewal


Effective March 1, 2002 the Members' Group Long -Term Disability plan will
be renewed with UNUM insurance company. As a result of poor claims
experience, the cost to maintain disability coverage for the membership has
increased dramatically. As a result, changes had to be made in order to
maintain this program for our Members.

The changes that will take effect March 1, 2002 are set forth below:

_ Mental/Nervous Disorder or Alcohol/Drug related disabilities would be
covered for 12 months instead of 24 months.

? The Elimination/Waiting period before one starts to receive benefits will
increase from 90 to 180 days.

? The final change relates to the offset of payments under the members'
disability policy should a member have other Group Disability insurance
policies. Commencing March 1, 2002 the policy will provide that if a Member
begins to receive benefits and has another Group Disability policy, payments
received under such other Group Disability policies would reduce benefits
received under the NYMEX policy. Please note that if you own an individual
policy that is not issued through a group or association it will not be
effected or reduced by any group policy.

These changes were necessary in order to keep our program in place for the
future. The rates that we were able to negotiate are only guaranteed for one
year and we hope that our claims experience improves so that we can maintain
this program at a competitive price for years to come.

For your information a summary sheet on the benefits offered members is
attached.

If you have any questions regarding these plan changes and how they might
affect you, please contact Warren Rosen at 212.949-9200. You may also call
me at 212-299-2203.
