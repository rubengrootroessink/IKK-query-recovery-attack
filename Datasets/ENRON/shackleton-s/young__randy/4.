Subject: ESA Legal Management

We continue to explore ways to improve communication of legal issues and 
activities within Enron South America's regional organization.  Pursuant to 
ESA's effort to more fully integrate its regional operations with the 
operations of companies (such as TGS, Transredes, EPE, and the various 
elements of the ESA Gas Business Unit) not controlled by Enron but in which 
Enron has substantial investments, we are particularly interested in 
improving the quality and quantity of information being received from the 
legal departments of these jointly-owned companies. 

To facilitate greater communication, I have formed two standing committees:  
a legal management committee for ESA and a regional general counsels 
committee. Each will meet once a week, for no more than one hour and 15 
minutes.  Their purposes will be to provide forums for the reporting and 
discussion of significant legal issues and activities affecting ESA's 
regional operations and investments. 

The Legal Management Meeting will be comprised of the subgroup leaders within 
ESA's regional legal organization.  This committee will meet at 10 o'clock am 
Sao Paulo time on Tuesdays (other than on Brazilian holidays).  Either John 
Novak or Robert George will lead these meetings in my absence. The following 
attorneys should attend:

 John Novak, asset development & regional gas business activities
 Sami Arap, integrated projects & communications/fiber optics
 Robert George and Andrea Bertone, M&A / financial & physical originations
 George Frumkin, regional corporate
 Vasco de Castro Ferraz, Elektro
  
The Regional General Counsels Meeting will be comprised of the chief lawyers 
for TGS, Transredes, EPE and ESA's Gas Business Unit.  This committee will 
meet at 5 o'clock pm Sao Paulo time on Wednesdays (other than on Brazilian 
holidays).  George Frumkin will lead these meetings in my absence. The 
following attorneys should attend:

 Cristian Dougall, TGS
 Fernando Gonzalez, Transredes
 Ann Birosel, EPE
 Vicky Martinez, Gas Business Unit
 George Frumkin, ESA

Since we intend to discuss matters relating to tax, trading and litigation, I 
believe it would be very helpful to have Rick Hopkinson (ESA Tax), Brent 
Hendry (Enron North America, BA Office) and Bob Williams (Enron Litigation), 
or their designees, to attend these two meetings as well. 

Particularly in the Regional General Counsels Meeting, if there are matters 
which should be reported but which are not appropriate (for confidentiality, 
privilege or other reasons) for discussion in front of the group, please let 
me know that you need to have an offline discussion, and I will call you back.

Members of the two committees will be receiving AT&T conference call numbers 
by separate e-mails.
