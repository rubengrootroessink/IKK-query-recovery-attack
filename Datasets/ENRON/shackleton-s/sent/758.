Just to be certain that the EES entity that might enter into the swap is 
eligible, you should verify that it (1) has total assets in excess of $10 
million or (2) has a net worth of $1 million and enters into the swap 
agreement in connection with the conduct of its business or to manage the 
risk of an asset or liability owned or incurred in the conduct of its 
business or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred in the conduct of its 
business.
