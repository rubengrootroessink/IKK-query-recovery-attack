We recently did about 20 weather trades with Vitol and I "confirmed" these 
under the 1995 energy price swap master (bad for weather) but incorporated 
ISDA definitions.  I think we should work toward replacing this master with 
an ISDA to eliminate the problem.  We did the same with Aquila which solved 
the weather problem (and I realize the Aquila is a bigger trading partner 
than Vitol).  Can someone generate credit?  Thanks.  Sara
