Regarding the contract Clara Currington is currently working on a new 
arrangement to hedge 100% instead of 90 %.

All:  

To whom should Risk Management & Trading Corp. ("RMT") direct the swap 
confirmation related to RMT's hedge management fee with Enron Nordic Energy 
(Norwegian branch of Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.)?  
The previous transaction was dated February 24, 1999 and requires amendment.

Please let me know. 

Sara
