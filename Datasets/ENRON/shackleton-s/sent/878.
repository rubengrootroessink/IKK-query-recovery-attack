Felix came by to do the replication on your think pad.  He said it will take 
at least 1 1/2 hr. to do it.  Is it OK if he does it Thurs or Fri?  Your 
schedule is pretty busy tomorrow.  The only time I see available tomorrow is 
maybe 9:30a - 11a.  I'm sure it will be hard for you to talk on the phone 
even for 30 min. with Felix in your office.

All he needs is your passwords.
