Thanks so much for your good wishes.  I really value your opinion and 
consider you a major asset to the swap group (I actually give myself a "pat 
on the head" for being able to entice you to join the group).  I look forward 
to lunch next week.

I just wanted to finally congratulate you on your well-deserved promotion to 
AGC!  I am really, really happy for you, as you are one of the primary 
reasons why I have chosen to stay in this group.  I would like to take you 
out to lunch to celebrate and will ask Suzanne to get in touch with Kay to 
get a date that is good for both of us.  Again, congrats on a tremendous 
accomplishment.
