I am still waiting verification from EI (which still exists as a legal 
entitiy).  It is likely that ENA will continue to deal directly with ENA 
(RMT) and that EI will handle the accounting internally.  I'll let you know 
as soon as I can.  Sara

Sara,

Any news on Enron S.A.?  Are we to confirm our new Non-Deliverable forward 
deals under the name Enron South America, or should we use Enron 
International?  Our counterparty is Bruce Harris.  Also, are we putting a 
master agreement in place--will it be dated September 1, 1999?  Please let me 
know how we should handle these, as we have a few deals we need to confirm 
for EI/ESA.  

Thanks.
