We have been asked to assist in the setting up of an account with Morgan for 
the sale of this stock (through John Greene) held in the name of "Enron 
Communications Investments Corp.".  Restrictions (technically expired on 
3/12/00) on the shares are in the process of being lifted by the transfer 
agent.  Let me know if you need further information. We are working with Mike 
Deville and Gill Melman (ECI legal).  Thanks.  Sara
