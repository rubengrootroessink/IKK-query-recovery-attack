The Energy Regulatory Commission (Comisi?n Reguladora de Energ?a) (=01&CRE=
=018),=20
published last Wednesday in the Federal Register a resolution by means of=
=20
which the CRE encourages the use of financially settled commodity derivativ=
es=20
transactions (=01&Financial Instruments=018) to hedge the risk of the natur=
al gas=20
price variations in Mexico (the =01&CRE Resolution=018). Over-the-counter F=
inancial=20
Instruments transactions are being enticed by the CRE in light of the surge=
=20
of natural gas prices[1]. It is expected that such derivatives market will =
be=20
expanded to other type of energy commodities, such as electric power.

?

Essentially, the CRE is encouraging the use of Financial Instruments by=20
giving a discount of the price index applicable for the month of August, 20=
00.

?

The CRE Resolution provides in general terms that:

?

1. The Mexican Users[2] that are able to sign a Financial Instrument with=
=20
Pemex-Gas y Petroqu?mica B?sica (=01&PGPB=018), or with any third party, be=
fore=20
September 1, 2000, covering commodity prices fluctuations for the period of=
=20
September 2000 thru February 2001, will benefit from a factor of at least=
=20
0.75, which will be applied to the price of reference (i.e. $3.705 U.S.=20
Dollars per MMBtu), which results in a price of $2.7788 U.S. Dollars per=20
MMBtu, only during the month of August, 2000 (the =01&Discount Factor=018).

?

??????????? 2.Mexico=01,s Local Distribution Companies (=01&LDCs=018), that=
 have=20
contracted Financial Instruments for their clients, shall passthrough to th=
e=20
Users the benefits resulting from the Discount Factor, only if such end use=
rs=20
have previously agreed upon the rendering of such services.

?

??????????? 3. Needless to say, the price determination for the period of=
=20
September 2000, thru February 2001, will be freely agreed upon between sell=
er=20
of the Financial Instruments, and the User or the LDC, as the case may be.
