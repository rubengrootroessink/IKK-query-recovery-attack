You can copy me with a blind copy.  Do not reference this office in any cover 
letters or emails to the customer.  I will not distribute the copy to the 
commercial guys here so that I can ensure that all documentation that goes to 
the customer comes from Houston.  Thanks.

The draft is ready to go but we need one (1) item from credit. Hopefully, 
this should be resolved within the hour!  Do you want a copy?  SS

Are we any closer to having a draft ready?  The business guys lost an 
opportunity to trade a couple of weeks ago when power prices shot upward. 
Prices are now coming back down and they would like to be able to transact 
soon.
