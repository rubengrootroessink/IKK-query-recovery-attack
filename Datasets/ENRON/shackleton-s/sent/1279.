Here's the comparison chart. We've gone as far as we can with SSB. The ball 
is in the traders' court to look at, and approve, the numbers. I don't know 
when, if ever, they'll do that. They don't seem as interested as they once 
were. I think we're more or less on hold waiting for them. SSB is aware of 
the development and said they will push the traders independently.

My schedule is fairly flexible so let me know when you'd like to meet.
