Steve:

I know that Tana has already answered your immediate question.
I am responding because Enron Corp. is also asking for an ISDA.  I am the 
Enron Corp. lawyer.  Can you also send a draft master to me?
Thanks.  Sara

Hi Sara/Tana--

I've been told to get started on Enron Capital & Trade Resources 
International Corp. ISDA.  Is this handled out of Houston or in UK (or 
otherwise)?

Thanks and regards,

Steve
