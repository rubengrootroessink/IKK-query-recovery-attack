Below is a document containing "General Terms and Conditions" which is ALWAYS 
attached to a financial confirmation when the parties have no executed master 
agreement.  If Ed, Tracy or someone in credit needs to add credit to the 
transaction, then we ALSO attach an Annex B (counterparty specific credit 
provisions),  Annex B-1(collateral and exposure provisions) and a letter of 
credit format. 

I am only attaching the General Terms and Conditions.



Let me know if you still want to see the ISDA Master Agreement (preprinted 
boilerplate consisting of an agreement and Credit Support Annex which I 
cannot email) together with a sample Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit 
Support Annex (which are the two "customized" pieces negotiated by legal) .

Thanks.  Sara
