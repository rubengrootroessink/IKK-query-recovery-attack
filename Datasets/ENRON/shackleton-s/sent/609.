ENA sent a Notice of Termination letter to Southern on November 1, 1999 and 
set that date as the Early Termination Date.  There is only one existing 
Transaction:  a second quarter 2000 collar.   We have obtained a third party 
quotation for the value of the call (at $.928) which when multiplied by the 
total notional and days, is equivalent to $25,334.40.  Please let me know if 
you have any comments to the letter.  

Lisa:  Is there a protocol for a non-lawyer to sign the calculation notice 
letter?  Should it come from settlements which would be tracking any payments 
(if ever received in whole or part)?

Thanks.  Sara
