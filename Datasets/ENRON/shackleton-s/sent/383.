I will initiate the call and I will also conference in Andrea Bertone.  
Attached is a short list illustrating the types of financial products about  
which our commercial people are inquiring.  My goal is to discuss parameters 
for further legal/tax research required to assist Enron in deciding how to 
trade these products.  I look forward to our conversation.  Sara
