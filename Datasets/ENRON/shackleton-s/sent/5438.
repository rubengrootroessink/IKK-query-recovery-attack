A few items to consider for the paralegals:

(1)  We need to organize the various country opinions (ISDA closeout netting, 
ENA jurisdictional survey, others) so that they are accessible to the group.  
We should also have a checkout process for the opinions.  We should have 
access to the ECTRIC opinion database (which I believe is organized online).  
I know that I can look in a particular file cabinet located near Susan for 
the various volumes of opinions, but where can I find an updated listing of 
all of the above?

(2)  Impress upon everyone the importance of entering information into Lotus 
Notes (for ALL types of agreements).

(3) I believe that Sam is in charge of the unanimous consents (for all Enron 
affiliates).  I for one would like an UPDATED book of the consents (kept 
updated).  These consents must be maintained and kept current.  If Sam is out 
of the office, we need access to the book.

(4)  We should create a "paralegal manual" as we go.  Each person could be 
responsible for drafting sections (and you could review their drafting 
skills!).  Given some time, I could probably help to identify relevant 
sections.

(5)  Agreement checkout.  We need to create a "checkout card" for each file 
so that when files are returned to the file cabinet, the checkout card is 
retired and placed inside the file for the next checkout.  I will volunteer 
my assistant to help out but I don't want to step out of turn here so I'll 
wait to hear from you.

(6)  I have the sense from some of the legal-credit meetings that everyone 
needs to be reminded to follow up on outstanding ISDA's (mainly the Top Ten 
and high priority items). 

I'll send additional items as they occur to me.  Thanks.  Sara
