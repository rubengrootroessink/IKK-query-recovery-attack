Marie:  Sutton Bridge was sold.  That is all I know.  Following is the 
situation regarding outstanding swaps.  We need to keep a record somewhere.

John and Sara

In reply to your enquires:

Infinity number 10300 is a hedge that was put on with SBPL.  This is to 
remain in place
Infinity number 25556 is a hedge that was put on for SBFL.  This is to remain 
in place.


The other deal that you enquired about was a simple passthrough of cash.  
This was a spot deal and has matured.
