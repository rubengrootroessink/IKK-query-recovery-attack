Wendi/Sara-

This is a Power of Attorney agreement for Global Advisors.. The mentioned 
traders will be executing on behalf of Cargill Incorporated...

Can you please go through this ASAP and let me know if anything in here is 
problematic...

They would also like this to govern EOL transactions... will this be a 
problem?

Thanks very much.

Regards,
Caroline Abramo
