Cheryl,
Gary Hickerson has requested so I would ID as high.  Sara has the agreement 
as Gary had sent directly to her.

I would not have included everyone in the CC regarding this question which 
relates more to Logistics between Legal and me.
Many Thanks. Sheila

Sheila, should this account be placed on the high priority list?  Also, to 
whom in legal did you send the info?

Cassandra, Bill and Cheryl,
We have sent to legal a request to open a new Futures Clearing Agreement with 
JP Morgan Chase.  Gary is requesting that we establish this account to 
provide additional coverage for Rate & Currency  and Equity Products.  Carr 
and Pru have lost some key persons and service levels are not deemed to be as 
good as previously.
Thanks. 
Sheila
