Susan:  Would you please handle this?  I'll also send Elliott Bonner's 
request with an address.  It should match (we'll need to check) the master 
agreement address.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Hello Elliot, 
Sorry I couldn't get back with you until now.  Either I am out of the office 
or in meetings all day.  Last we spoke you were going to send me a copy of 
the previous agreed upon ISDA between Heinz and Enron.  I believe you wanted 
our legal contact but is there anyway you can send the copy to my attention.  
I would like to have a copy for my files.  
We have not made a decision yet on linerboard swaps.  I have a meeting with 
my General Manager on Monday PM and hope to know more.  
Can you please send me a copy of the ISDA prior to Monday PM? 
Thanks, 
Dewann Weltmer

   Hi Elliott, 
   I talked with Corby and today we have an offer around $428/ton for 2 
   years 5,000 tons.  Can you provide a better offer that we could discuss? 
   Thanks,
