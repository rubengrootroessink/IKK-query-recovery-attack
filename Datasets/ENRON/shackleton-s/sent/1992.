Bill:  I couldn't recall if I mentioned the above entity (35% Enron owned and 
65% Burlington owned, I understand) but I was contacted by Ranabir Dutt 
(X35274) to review an ISDA and 10 year rate swap for Lost Creek and Barclays 
Bank PLC..  I told Ranabir to contact credit.  He said that was Enron was 
immediately selling its interest.  The swap becomes effective 9/15/00.
