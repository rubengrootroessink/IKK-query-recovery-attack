Agreement


Sara,
I have reviewed this briefly and have a couple of issues/comments.
I am concerned about the references to cash accounts.  I need to discuss
with the group.  ENA is not authorized to operate cash accounts.
Overdrafts and advances should not be permitted (sections 2Ciii and 4A)
I need to discuss FX with Laurel.  Again, ENA should not be operating cash
accounts.
Any verbal or fax instruction must be confirmed with callback or other
security procedures.  We have some sample call back procedures, test keys
are mentioned but are messy.  Need to discuss.  3C-authority to act should
be predicated on following the agreed procedures.  Maybe this is implied.
In 2, it is mentioned that info can be given.  I think it should be only if
required by law.
5A, generally, we don't allow fees to be debited.
5C I agree with you 5C is ugly.  I think this must be limited to the assets
in the specific accounts related to the agreement.
My number is 713 355 3814
Mary
