I have scheduled a conference call with Antonio Felix on Thursday Sept  16 at 
3pm Sao Paulo time.  I am initiating the call.  I will discuss the types of 
products which the Enron "family" is primarily interested in analyzing with 
respect to legality (in general), taxation, type of entity appropriate for 
conducting business and procedure for implementation.  I hope to narrow the 
focus of the legal review, identify other issues and will ask that legal fees 
be broken out by product.  On Tuesday, Sept 21, I will meet with Antonio 
Felix at Enron's offices in Sao Paulo at 9 am.  Everyone is welcome to join 
me for both the conference call and meeting in Sao Paulo.  Please let me know 
if you would like to participate.  Thanks.  Sara
