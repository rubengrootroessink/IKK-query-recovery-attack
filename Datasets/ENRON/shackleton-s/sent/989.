I hope you are doing well.  I finally have my laptop so I can at least read 
email during the day.  The weather here is gorgeous.  It's about 72 during 
the day and cooler at night.  We went to a restaurant that had a "tunnel of 
fudge" por d'creme.  Someone at the table said there is a similar recipe in 
the Charlie Trotter cookbook.  Do you have that cookbook?  I know you have a 
lot of them.  I fly hime Friday night and arrive in Houston on Saturday 
morning at 6:30 am.  Mike should be waiting for me at my house and I can't 
wait to see the Phoebe and sports dog a/k/a Chloe.  How's mother and daddy?  
I can't send mother email because she may pick it up on her voice mail. Love, 
sas

PS  Are you working on Friday?
