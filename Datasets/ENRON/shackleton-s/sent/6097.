I look forward to meeting with you both on Tuesday.  Here's a list of the

(Bermuda)- dealing regularly..

from all the deals we have done have been returned to Carol.  They are set up 
in the system; we hold margin.

4. AIG (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- need to get documents out to them- 
credit work sheet in legal.. still have not gotten out a confirm to them on
