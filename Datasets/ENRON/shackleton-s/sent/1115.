We have to respond to comments on the Credit Support Annex and a few items in 
the Schedule..  We are waiting for copies of standing  PUC orders from PG&E 
(addressing derivatives issues) as well as a blackline of the Schedule since 
PG&E controls the drafting.  Sara

Our client says he gave everything to you.
