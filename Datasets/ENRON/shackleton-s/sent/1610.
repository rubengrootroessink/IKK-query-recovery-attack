The documents are fine except that we agreed that the following language 
would appear at the end of the sentence in the Cross Default section (part 
1(b) of the Schedule to the Master Agreement):

; provided, however, the words ", or becoming capable at such time of being 
declared," as they appear in Section 5(a)(vi) are hereby deleted.
