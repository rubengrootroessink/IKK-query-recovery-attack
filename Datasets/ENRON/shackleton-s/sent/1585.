Prior to our meeting last Friday, I had provided the guaranty template 
(below) to Western Resources, Inc.  The counterparty has approved the 
languange without any changes.  The request is for a $15,000,000 outgoing 
guaranty to cover both financial derivatives (gas and power) as well as 
physical gas.  Please advise on how we should proceed on the guaranty 
issuance.  FYI-On 6/15/00, I forwarded to Susan Flynn's attention a credit 
worksheet so that we can prepare ISDA docs.

Regards, 
Ed Sacks
