No, we insist that the trader make credit aware of new counterparties or 
unusual trades or opportunities prior to transacting.  Credit reviews trades 
each morning and they know what's going on.  ss

Sara,  Do you usually do guidelines relating to credit approval, size of 
transaction a trader can effectuate and internal approval process?

I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading.  It's 
a good starting point.  I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina 
which will address both physical and financial trading.  Other "guidelines" 
exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia.  I 
am checking on London.
I'm not exactly certain as to what you are looking for.  Obviously the 
foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US (although LA. is 
about as close as you can get to a third world country).  One thing that 
doesn't show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue.   Let me 
know how I can help further.  Sara

Here it is -- we printed this 2-sided and laminated it.  Becky will bring you 
the hard copy version.  Lunch date later.
