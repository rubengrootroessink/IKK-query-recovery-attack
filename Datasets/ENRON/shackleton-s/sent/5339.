Frank and Francisco:

Haven't seen you two in awhile!

ENA is considering a financial deal with an offshore entity located in 
Panama.  We have no research for this jurisdiction.  I will need to hire 
local counsel and send a deriviatives questionnaire for response.  Have you 
used Panamanian counsel before?  Please send info.
