Hi,
Do you know the current status of the Bank One account for NG?
Jim has been inquiring about this.

Many thanks
David

Hello David,

I didn't want to bother you - you're probably more than busy right now.

In my continuing effort to get your account going, specifically,
completing the margin line of credit, I thought the following might
help:

When Jeff Shankman first told me of Enron's requirement to have a line
of credit for margining, nat gas initial margin was $2750 per contract.
It is now $3850 and likely to rise again.  The 'cheap financing' that
our line represents to John Arnold may be even more appealing now (if he
has a second to convince Sara Shackleton to work on the documentation).

Otherwise, thanks for the intro to Bill White.  We've only spoken
briefly so far, but he did say he was trying to free up some time to get
something going.

I'll be in Houston in about two weeks, but I hope to talk to you before
then.

Regards,
Jim Naughton
