Yes, I have received your message.  I had lunch with Monty, Keith and my dad 
at the Big G and it was wonderful.  Then I dragged Lawyers Daigle and 
Burlingame to the offices of Gordon, Arata, et al to say hello to Guy Wall.  
We only stayed for a few minutes and the old firm sure looked the same.  The 
weather in N.O. was perfect and I also had dinner at Emeril's and a catered 
meal by P. Prudhomme, both of which were excellent.  Things are rocking along 
here.  I am actually going to have that eye surgery next Friday (I'm 85% 
convinced to do it).  It only takes a short time and I can't drive to the 
clinic myself but I can drive the following day.  Maybe they'll come up with 
something to help my brain.

Back to N.O., I also had drinks with Paul Dubroc.  I guess you heard that 
Neel Roberts has been receiving treatments at M.D. Anderson.  (So is Julia 
Heintz's mother, by the way).  Robert Soniat (a lawyer in N.O.) recently died 
of liver cancer.  

I have been for long weekends to Phoenix and N.Y.  It snowed in Phoenix (it 
was supposed to be 80 degrees) and I caught the 24-hour bug in N.Y.

So, Carson, what's new with you???????????????????????????
