Frank:

Did I hear you mention that you were going to work on the "EOL no written 
confirmation" letter?  Or is Mark?  Please let me know.   Thanks.

Mark/Sara,

We are attempting to get two amendments to the ISDA with AEP right now.  
Mark, you are working on the Amendment allowing for EOL Transactions to not 
need written Confirmations and Sara is working on an amendment that will 
change the Confirming Party to ENA (for some reason, AEP was allowed to be 
the Confirming Party when the Master was drafted.)   At any rate, is it 
possible that we send both of these amendments to AEP at the same time?  We 
want to make sure that AEP views these amendments together and sign off on 
both.  We think they'll be more comfortable signing them both at once rather 
than a couple of weeks apart.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter
