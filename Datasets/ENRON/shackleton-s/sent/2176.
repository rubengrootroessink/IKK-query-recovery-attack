Assuming that this relates to a request from one of the online trading sites 
(Buy Side Direct, Trading Edge or LIMITrader), Sara is correct that we intend 
to use Morgan Stanley as our prime broker to clear our trades through the 
site's clearing broker.

I'd stick with Anthony.  I didn't think that Prudential was one of our 
clearing brokers (remember, the letter must come from our clearing broker).  
Please keep Mike Fowler and Paul Radous informed.  Thanks.  Sara
