Trena:  In the next week or so, I will be devoting most of my time and 
attention to Gary's world.  I met with Gary last week, and he suggested that 
I give you a call to see if you needed any legal assistance.  I am available 
for whatever you might need me for.  My number in Houston is 713/853-5620.  
I'm looking forward to working with you.  Regards.  Sara
