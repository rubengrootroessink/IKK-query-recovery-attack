Tracy:  Netting (payment or closeout) only applies between the parties under 
a single master agreement.
Are you asking about the right of setoff in the event of an early termination 
under one of the masters?

Susan, Thanks for your prompt response to Waste Management!

Sara, per my voice message, I wanted to check with you re. our "netting 
rights" btw the Waste Management ISDA and a potential ISDA between ENA and a 
sub of Waste Management, Wheelabrator Shasta Energy Company Inc. (ENA to get 
a gty from Waste Management)...however, I told Chris Foster to try and have 
the cp do an intracompany swap transfer.

Thanks!
Tracy

Tracy,

Per your request, attached is the excerpt from the ISDA Master Agreement 
dated February 2, 1999, between ENA and Waste Management, Inc., which 
provides notice information. 

Hope this is sufficient.
