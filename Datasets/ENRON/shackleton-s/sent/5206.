Sara:

I am attaching the latest draft of the confirmation prepared by my colleague, 
Mark Skinner, together with a clean copy (without the line numbers).  The 
attached should reflect our discussions of last week, except for the 
jurisdiction issue on which I have not heard anything further.

If you have any additional comments or questions, please contact me.

Regards,
