Clem:

I know that you sent Sheila Glover a form of ENE guaranty a few weeks ago.  
Sheila forwarded it to Bear and we received Bear's form which is 
unacceptable.  However, if ENE has outstanding guaranties in favor of Bear, I 
would need to know since we may be able to use a previously negotiated form.

Can you let me know if ENE has ever issued such a guaranty?

Thanks.  SS
