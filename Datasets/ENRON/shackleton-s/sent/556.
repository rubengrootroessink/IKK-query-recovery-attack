4. ClearStation's Three-Point Approach to Investing
------------------------------------------------------------

The following article is courtesy of ClearStation, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of E*TRADE and one of the leading
investment communities on the Web.(5)

Investing can be hard work. Witness the fact that nearly
two-thirds of professionally managed mutual funds failed to
beat the S&P 500 last year. So why bother? Because if you
take a little time to learn the basics, you can put yourself
in a position to win.

ClearStation's Three-Point Investment Approach(TM) helps you
take your best shot. Simply put, we believe that there are
really only three ways to find, evaluate, and track stocks:
fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and "community"
idea sharing.

5. Investing Tips from the Masters
------------------------------------------------------------

Introducing the E*TRADE Knowledge Center(TM), a new place where
you can learn the what, why, and when of investing. What do
growth investors look for in a stock? How do you evaluate a
company for investment purposes? The Knowledge Center can
tell you all this and more.

And the best part is, in many cases you can learn directly
from the masters. Want to learn about value investing? Read
what Wall Street legend Ben Graham has to say. Interested in
high-tech stocks? Learn about the dynamics of the high-tech
marketplace from Geoffrey Moore, author of the acclaimed
"The Gorilla Game."

The Knowledge Center is waiting for you! It's like having
your own personal bookshelf of investing classics--only you
don't have to go to the library, you don't have to park,
and we're open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

your IRA. You can choose from over 5,000 mutual funds, including
more than 1,250 with no loads or  transaction fees.(6) You can

And to help you make wise investment decisions, we offer free
research and online screening tools that can be customized to
your exact requirements.

fees, no  minimum initial investment, and no annual maintenance
fees. Which means more of your money works for you.

(5) E*TRADE does not recommend any security, financial

E*TRADE will assess a transaction fee upon the sale or
redemption of a no-transaction-fee position held less
than 30 days. It is possible that this transaction fee
may be avoided by transferring the position to an account
held directly at the fund, though the transfer process
could be lengthy. E*TRADE receives compensation from the
fund companies participating in the no-transaction-fee
program.

part of the no-transaction-fee program, though without
the 30-day holding period.

risks may include greater price volatility, less liquidity,
and wider bid/ask spreads than during regular market hours.
E*TRADE cannot guarantee that After Hours Trading will
provide the best prices for any given stocks nor can it
guarantee that all After Hours orders will be executed.
