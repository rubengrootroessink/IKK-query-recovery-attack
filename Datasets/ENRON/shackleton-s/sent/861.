Sara:

I have a copy of the draft of the Argentine Master Derivative Agreement.
The person who gave it to me mentioned that they are still working on the
definitive draft.

What do you want me to do?  Shall I review the text and/or get more involved
in its drafting?
Can you inquiry what exactly was what they said to your people down here
about the use of the draft?

The text is in Spanish, are you interested in an English translation or
shall we wait?

I look forward to your instructions.
Best regards

Patricia L?pez Aufranc
