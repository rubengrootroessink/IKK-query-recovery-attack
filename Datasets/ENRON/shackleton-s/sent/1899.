Robert:  The executed "Representative Agreement" was executed by  both ENA 
and Enron Australia; it was sent to David Minns via Federal Express on July 
6, 2000.  Let me know if you need anything further.  Sara

Hi Sara,
I work with David Minns in Enron's Australian office.  Just a quick query - 
can you tell me whether the agreement referred to below has been executed by 
ENA?
Regards,
Robert.
