Hi Nancy!  I left a voice mail for you in Sao Paulo since Lynn told me you 
were there.  We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on 
behalf of ESA.  Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha 
Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized).  
Please give me or Brent a call. We're trying to get this done next week since 
TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm. 
Also, let's have lunch.  Sara
