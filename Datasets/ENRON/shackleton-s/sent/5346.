Subject: Ag's Recurring Staff Meeting Notification for 2001

Due too the upcoming holidays/vacation schedules, we will not have another 
staff meeting until January 2001.  The meetings will still occur every other 
Monday, from 1:30 to 2:30 in EB30c2 (pls. note the first meeting is scheduled 
for Monday, January 8th).

New York participants/traveller's will be connected via bridge line.  To 
access the bridge line dial 888-476-3757, listen for the beep then dial the 
six digit pass-code number, 934 803. You will automatically be connected into 
the conference.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at (713) 853-5879.

Thanks,
Carmella
