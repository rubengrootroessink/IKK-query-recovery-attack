Sara/Mary,

Koch Energy Trading, Inc. has contacted me several times over the past couple 
of weeks in order to request that we change our Confirmation procedures.  
Currently, per the Master Agreement, we send our form of Confirmation and 
they sign and return those to us.  With the volume being well over 50 deals 
per day with Koch, they are now seeing this as cost prohibitive on their end, 
as they are doing all of the work related to Confirmations (Comparing details 
to their system and return faxing).  Now, Koch would like to go to both 
Counterparties sending confirms, comparing each other's paper to the system 
and notifying only in the case of discrepancies.  I suggested to Koch that we 
might try using a system similar to Sempra's in which we send our Confirms 
and they return a one-page fax which lists our deal numbers and their 
agreement or disagreement with those deals.  Still, they considered this to 
be very manual on their end and leaves them responsible for notifying of any 
discrepancies.  I'm sure the legal departments will be getting involved soon, 
so I wanted to get your thoughts on changing our current process before it 
comes to that.

Thanks,
Joe
