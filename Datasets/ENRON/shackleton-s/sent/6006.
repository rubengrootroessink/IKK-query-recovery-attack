Good Morning Sara,

Thanks for the e-mail. Have you had an opportunity to review the optional 
termination language for the West LB Interest Rate Swap Confirmation? 

Please advise.

Enjoy your day!

Jorge

Jorge:  The attached confirmation looks fine.  However, you did not attach 
Annex II which is referenced all over the confirmation. 
For future reference, "Calculation Period(s)" should be used for multiple 
periods.

There were a couple of cosmetic changes. This is it! Disregard the previous 
attachment.
