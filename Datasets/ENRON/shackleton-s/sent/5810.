BEWARE!  This ISDA was almost finalized but for disagreement about assignment 
and arbitration (so there's not much in the Annex A to dispute).  Check Lotus 
Notes first and add to this file.

Hi Sara, Maria Gelnett from New York State Electric & Gas called me.  She 
would like to talk to an attorney about annex A that is attached to the 
financial confirmation letters that we send them.  I have attached the 
confirmation letter that she is reviewing.



Maria's phone number is (607) 762-7688.

Thanks,
Melissa
