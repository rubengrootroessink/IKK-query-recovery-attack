I assume everything went fine with the last financial swap we did with El 
Paso Electric.  I just sold them another swap for 28 Mws in June.  Could we 
follow the same procedure.

Thanks,

Paul Choi

Melissa,

I just sold a swap to EPE and I have forwarded a copy of the attachment below 
to them.  They have agreed with the terms in the attachment.  Could you 
coordinate with Sara Shackleton to include the necessary attachment in our 
confirm.

Thanks,

Paul Choi
