attached tracks the changes between the 11/3/2000 draft presented by EWEB, 
with that of the 11/10/2000, being presented here for review.

If you have any questions, you may call me at the number set for below or you

Further, attached is a draft of the proposed resolution language for 
derivative transactions, which EWEB's board must adopt.
