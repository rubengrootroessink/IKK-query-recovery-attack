I'm not sure who Philip Levy is, but yes, I did have my questions answered.  
Bob
Bruce was able to help me set up the notification for Chase, and before I even
sent it, I had confirmed the changes verbally with Chase.    

Thanks,
Diane

Did you have your questions answered?  I have a voice mail from Philip Levy
