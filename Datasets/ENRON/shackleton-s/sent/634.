Hey Sam, that has to be one of the "cheeriest" cards I've ever received.  
Please thank Leica for her birthday wishes (and how is the old girl doing?).  
Do you remember my 39th at Andrea's with Pat and Dee (I think) and Ron and 
his wife (I've forgotten her name but I remember what she looks like)?  I 
remember your 40th with Beverly and Helen and the walker (you probably 
remember the stripper).  I need your MAILING address so that Phoebe, Chloe 
and I can send you a holiday card.  Are you a bi-city resident?  Do you still 
own Corky's?  Do you have a different venture(s)?  How is Mr. Casey?  How are 
Helen and Beverly?  Do you see them often?  Do you love Atlanta?  You know 
that at my age (it's actually been any my ages) I write in stream of 
consciousness.  I hope this makes sense.  Sara

P.S.  Ain't life grand?
