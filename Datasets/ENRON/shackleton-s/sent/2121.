Folks,

National Bank of Canada has forwarded the attached draft documents for our 
review.  I asked if they had electronic versions of the ENA - NBC  documents 
and they have apparently gone a step further and actually generated the draft 
Garden State - NBC documentation without the confirms.  Finley will continue 
to drive forward on the confirms.  I would appreciate any comments on the 
attached documents by mid-day tomorrow so that we can possibly get this in 
place.

Thanks,
Rodney
