		 Subject: Revised Assignments from Jim Piccone


Attached are revised forms of Assignments for both the HSES to Enron (J. Aron 
trades) and HS Resources to HSES (Enron trades).  These are redlined versions.

The main changes to the HSES to Enron (J. Aron trades) assignment are 
completion of the Effective Date (June 28), the date of the J. Aron/Enron 
ISDA and the addition of counterpart and fax signature language.

The HS Resources to HSES assignment has been structurally revised to assign 
all HS Resources/Enron trades to HSES except those shown on Appendix A.  
Since the HS Resources/Enron trades continue to change every day until the 
HSES/Enron ISDA is in place, this new structure of the assignment will be 
much simpler and will pick up all HS Resources/Enron transactions through 
Friday, June 30.  Hopefully, by then the HSES/Enron ISDA will be in place.

Please let me know as soon as you believe these documents are ready for 
Enron's signature.  As soon as I have sign off by the other parties to the 
documents, I will advise you.  We can then have everyone print finals, get 
signatures and fax all counterparts to me.  I will act as a clearinghouse and 
get counterparts back out to everyone.
