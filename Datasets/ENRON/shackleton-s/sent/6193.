Laurel:

I have a lot of time tomorrow (5/15) to discuss all related issues.
I am attaching my most recent draft of the confirmation provisions for use in 
the EOL FX product confirmations.  The first is for the Apr-Oct product and 
the second for the single day product.  We need to compare the terminology 
against the EOL description.  You will recall that this was based upon 
Stuart's preference for the CIBC format.
