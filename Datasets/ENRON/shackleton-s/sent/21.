Attached is a redraft of your letter.  RMT knows nothing about the execution 
or termination of any collar between Elektro and WestLB (since RMT was not a 
party to that transaction). Also, we have been unable to internally trace the 
source of the $387,250.00 received by RMT.  We are trying to trace this 
through Chase and expect an answer on Thursday (if we're lucky).  Otherwise, 
call me about the letter.  Sara
