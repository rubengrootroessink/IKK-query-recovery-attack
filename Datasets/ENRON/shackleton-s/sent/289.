Attached is the first report identifying financial master trading agreements 
generated by ECT's derivatives legal group.  This report will be updated and 
distributed weekly.  It only reflects documentation originated by Houston's 
legal department and the status of negotiations.  If you have any questions, 
please call me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.  Thanks.  Sara
