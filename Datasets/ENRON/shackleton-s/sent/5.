Julian,

let's leave it for Barclays to request the guarantee which they no doubt will.

Treasa and David will need to discuss with the currency swaps desk in Houston 
the issue of euro conversion.

Barclays call on the guarantee. If they think about it then they probably
will want the Corp. guarantee. And of course the precedent swap was
guaranteed....we could send out the first draft though and see if they raise
the issue of the guarantee. Do you want to raise the question of
re-denomination into euro with them?

Sara,

I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to
put
together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be providing
to
either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that company. The
subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and paying pounds
out (a
spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds income which it
will
need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.

The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.

Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing
for
issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.

The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal
opinions
from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and from V&E
(Terry
Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap will not be
guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).

Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171
456
2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details.
Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke
opinion and to send it out to you Sara.

Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.


                         Mark
