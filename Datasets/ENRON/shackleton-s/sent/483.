I know that you were in the Rio office during the latter part of last week.  
I sent you an e-mail last week to see how you were doing with the 
research/memo.  I also called Marcelo Rodrigues and left a message.  I have 
not heard from either you or Marcelo and I am anxious to continue our 
dialogue.  Please e-mail or call at your earliest convenience.  Thanks.  Sara
