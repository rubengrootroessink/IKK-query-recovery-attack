Without having more detail, I do know that Gary is interested in trading from 
Houson (if at all possible).  ss

Is Mark Taylor aware of Gary's plans?  I know from my conversations with Mark 
about support for trading in South America that very few people in Enron, 
other than Don and a few commercial guys in Brazil, believe that there will 
be any action to speak of on the trading side in South America.  If Gary does 
anything other than trade from ECT on exchange or through swaps that he will 
have to take into consideration who will provide legal and administrative 
support and from where.

Andrea has not confirmed any meetings with me yet.  But I would not wait too 
long to make the reservations.

Importance:  High
---------------------------------
Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority 
trading.  He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for 
the S. Cone.  The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a 
sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) 
trading offshore.  They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have 
had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.  There appears to be little 
communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo 
next week.  I'll be more specific in a day or so.  I'm still having problems 
tying into the database (this is ridiculous!).  Did you receive my voice 
mail?  SS

Have you been able to get a better handle on what it is that Gary wants to do?
