I don't even know what they're doing to this area!  Maybe this is for new 
offices.  SS

 During   the  construction of the clerical area the clerks will do their 
best to continue to function in a normal manner.  The fax machines will be 
located in EB3837A  (cubicle area in front of Suzanne Adams).    There should 
be no interruptions in the fax lines per the Telephony Services.  Office 
supplies will also be boxed and stored in various areas throughout the 
floor.  There will be 2  phones  and computers available to the clerks.  
Reginald will be located at EB3808B x39288 and Tim and Kenneth will be 
located at EB3808B x31459.

 This may  cause time delays on various functions of the clerks:

Faxes being sent, received, copied and delivered in a timely manner;
ASAP deliveries/pickups/courier outgoing/incoming/scheduled and unscheduled 
daily runs to Allen Center;
Telephone accessibility will be limited;
Space preparation for large ASAP copy jobs;
Availability of clerks when needed;
Accessibility/ordering of office supplies; 
Mail being sorted and distributed in a timely manner.


 This will begin today Wednesday,  August 24th, and probably will not be 
finished until Wednesday,  September 1st.   We apologize for  any  
inconvenience this may cause.
