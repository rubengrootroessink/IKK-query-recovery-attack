Attached is a first draft of the swap for the Raptor 2 structure.  Please 
consider the following questions and I will amend the confirmation 
accordingly:

1.  I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple 
partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.  Before we 
eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in 
agreement as to how this swap will terminate.  [Do we want partial 
terminations based upon partial asset sales?]

2.  Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need 
to be sure that the word "sale" is sufficient.  Should we use "financial 
close" or some other term of art?  I have concerns that a sale may be 
contingent or subject to some waiting period.
