Richard:

I don't know if you were copied separately on this message.  Can you send a 
letter after Thanksgiving?  The first payment should come due the first week 
in December.  Thanks.  Sara

Looks like 2/3 of the way down on pg. 2 he clearly says we have a deal 
pending the LC, a requirement which we later waved.

Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly 
inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please 
comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, 
as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and 
haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next 
steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message 
in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit).



Thanks,
Alan
