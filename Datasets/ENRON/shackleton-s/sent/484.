Sara, here's the language. Call me if you have any questions or comments.  
Clem

EXPENSES. The Guarantor agrees to pay on demand all reasonable out of pocket
expenses ( including reasonable fees and expenses of Counterparty?s counsel) 
in
any way relating to the enforcement or protection of the rights of the
Counterparty hereunder, provided that the Guarantor shall not be liable for 
any
expenses of Counterparty if no payment under this Guaranty is due.
