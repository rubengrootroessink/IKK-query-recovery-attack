		 Subject: FLORIDA JUDGE HOLDS NOON HEARING


A Florida judge will hold a televised hearing at Noon ET on a Democratic
legal challenge to uphold hand recounts of presidential votes in several
Florida counties. The move is a challenge to Florida Secretary of State
Katherine Harris' decision Wednesday not to allow counties to modify their
vote totals.

Go to ABCNEWS.com to follow all the ongoing legal moves -- and political
jostling -- throughout the day.
