(1) I have a message into Mark Seffinger at ING Barings with respect to item 
1.

(2) I left a message with Mark Elliott.  I still have not heard from him.

Jason:  (1)  You were going to verify whether or not arbitration (for the
executing brokers) is mandatory.  Have you heard anything?

(2)  Did you ever speak with Mark Elliott about ITG?  Are you still having
problems connecting with him?
