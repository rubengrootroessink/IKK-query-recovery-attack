Susan:  Based on Tanya's message, we should pursue the Morgan Cap Services 
agreement.  Let's talk when you have a chance. I've put this on our 
legal.credit list.  SS

Sara,

After looking at the list, we are on top of most of it:

aquila risk - we should be assigning all the trades to the new Utilicorp ISDA 
and terminating Aquila Risk master
jaron - we have a new ISDA; Jeff probably just isn't reflecting it yet
el paso - Brant is currently negotiating the new ISDA

The following are in negotiation and are Top 10s:
- idacorp
- wps
-pancanadian
-duke energy mktg ltd (i think this one is all but signed)
- mieco
-dynegy canada

I know you have had initial discussions with the counterparties and have 
discussed the need to put new documentation in place with:
- morgan
- vitol

Lastly, we were waiting on Reliant to give us an updated draft ISDA; however, 
now that Randy Baker has left Reliant, they are not likely to address for 
awhile.  Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place.

The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy 
and Sempra are probably the most important of those left.  Dynegy should not 
be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be 
more problematic.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

FYI - the following list reflects old ECT master and no master counterparties 
by volume (not necessarily exposure).  Sara

Tanya:  do you want all of these names on the legal/credit list?
