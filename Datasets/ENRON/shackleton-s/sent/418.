Your switchboard does not answer and I'd like to speak with you.  Please call 
me at 713/853-5620.

We'll e-mail two identical Schedules to you in word.  Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources entered into an ISDA with Barclays in 1995 and that Schedule was 
virtually identical to the one we're sending.  We therefore do not expect 
there to be many issues.  The banks should serve as Calculation Agents and 
confirming agents so we will look to them for the confirmations.  Look 
forward to finalizing these documents with you.  Thanks.  Sara
