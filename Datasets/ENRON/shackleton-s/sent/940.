Dear Sara,

I want to update you on what we've added to the Netstock Direct site.  We 
continue to work hard to provide you with more online direct investment 
plans, added functionality through our Mutual Funds Direct Center, as well as 
our new long-term investment service ShareBuilder.  Here are just a few of 
the most recent enhancements to the site.

? On the direct investing side, we recently announced a partnership with 
Citibank and added over 30 direct investment plans including Nokia, Toyota, 
Duke Energy and Marriott International.  Efforts like this have led to record 
use of our service in January.  Direct investment plans are located at 
http://www.netstockdirect.com/search.

? Netstock Investment Corporation recently added seven GE Funds to the Mutual 
Funds Direct Center.  To view the complete list of over 200 mutual funds 
currently available go to http://www.netstockdirect.com/mutfunds.

? ShareBuilder - We first invited you to visit our new long-term investing 
service at http://www.sharebuilder.com last month, and already thousands of 
investors have opened accounts, recognizing the value of becoming a 
ShareBuilder.  We are delighted by the reaction so far as many of you have 
been able to set up ShareBuilder Plans, primarily with stocks that do not 
maintain a direct investment option.  Take a look at a recent list of our 10 
most popular ShareBuilder choices.

1.Cisco  2.Microsoft  3.AOL  4.QUALCOMM  5.Intel  6.Lucent  7.Wal-Mart  
8.Home Depot  9.Yahoo  10.General Electric

ShareBuilder, offered through Netstock Investment Corporation, expands your 
opportunities for investing small dollar amounts by giving you access to over 
2,000 stocks and 32 index securities using dollar-based, automatic investing 
methods.  Low $2 fees make it inexpensive and many customers have opened 
custodial accounts for their children or grandchildren, where the transaction 
fee is only $1.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please don't hesitate to 
email Customer Care at mailto:customercare@netstock.com or call us directly 
at 1-888-NET-STOK between the hours of 6 AM and 6 PM Pacific Time.


Best Regards,

Jeff Seely
President & CEO
Netstock Direct Corporation
