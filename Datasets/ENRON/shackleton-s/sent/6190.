Mary:

Remember, this is the swap that you finally decided to go ahead and terminate 
yourself.  There was much confusion about how many S.A. swaps actually 
exsited (only one) and after sorting through the mess, when I asked if you 
had estabished a Raptor "format for termination", you decided to do the 
drafting.  Let me know if there is a problem.

Maricela has requested a copy of the termination notice for the referenced 
swap.  I advised her that you would have done the document in relation to the 
swap (of which I think there was only one).  I cannot remember if it was ever 
terminated.  Can you coordinate this matter with Maricela.  I am covering the 
rest of the Raptor requests.

Cordially,
