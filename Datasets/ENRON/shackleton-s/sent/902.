Hi!  I'm the ENA lawyer with whom you will be speaking with respect to this 
Master Agreement.  I know that Marie Heard has called you regarding your 
review of this document and I was hoping to facilitate that discussion.  
Please let me know if you have specific questions and/or if we can schedule a 
conference call.  You can reach me via email of (713) 853-5620.  Thanks.  
Sara
