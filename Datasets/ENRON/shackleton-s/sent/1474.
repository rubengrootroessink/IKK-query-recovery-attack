Paul:  I finally got your address right!  Why are YOU listed in the Enron 
Corp. address book?  Tanya and Rod can be accessed through the ECT 
directory!  I spoke with David Mitchell this morning.  He will prepare a 
short memo summarizing our recent discussion (NYMEX), probably by the end of 
this week or early next week.  Then we can decide whether additional 
conversations are necessary and how to proceed in general.  Also, please send 
credit worksheets to BOTH Susan Bailey and Susan Flynn.  They divide up the 
booty.  We have a new paralegal starting on Monday named Samantha Boyd.  She 
will eventually be thrown into the fray.  We'll be sending a new message to 
everyone in credit soon.  Thanks for your help.  Sara
