Susan,

Can you forward this to the appropriate legal person:

BP Amoco Corporation - still marks up Annex A, Setoff paragraph so that the 
word "derivative" is added (see attached - change in red, Section 5) We have 
recieved prior approval to "Execute" the EOL deals in which this change is 
made, but not the non-EOL deals.  Is this still correct?




Aquila Canada Corp. - marks up Annex A as attached (see markups in red)  (All 
are EOL deals)
