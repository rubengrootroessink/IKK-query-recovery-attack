Willie received a call from Mike Billings, the trader at Dow,
and he requested that deal #EY0963.1 from 6/15/99 be revised
from Dow Hydrocarbons to Dow Chemical.

He is currently signing and sending back the other trades that were
changed.  

Is it okay to change this deal also, and on a "going forward" basis, all
trades must be through Dow Hydrocarbons...

let me know...thanks...mgg
