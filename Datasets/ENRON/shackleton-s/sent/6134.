As you know, Carol is working on your template; then Frank, Carol and I  will

Caroline:

No Deemed ISDA, we decided that yesterday for the long-dated deal.

We are working on the draft masters for emailing.  Please send me the 
information about your counterparties' lawyers so we can begin negotiating.
