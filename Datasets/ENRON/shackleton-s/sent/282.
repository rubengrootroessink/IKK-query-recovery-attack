Subject: MSA with TGS

Sara:

I just spoke with Rolo and he advised the ownership structure of 
Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS):

70% of TGS is owned by Compania de Inversiones de Energia S.A. (CIESA)
CIESA is owned 50% by Enron and 50% by Perez Companc.
In the corporate workbook the ownership structure of CIESA is outlined.  

The ownership structure of CIESA is somewhat complex and it appears that 
Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A. is the legal entity that owns the 
shares in CIESA.  

I am assuming the best way to structure the event of default is to say if 
Enron Corp. through its wholly-owned subsidiaries no longer owns 50% of CIESA 
and/or if CIESA no longer owns 70% of TGS then, a Change in Ownership Event 
of Default will have occurred.

Please let me know what you think of this.

Regards,

Pat

Pat,

Yetserday we had a meeting with TGS. We agreed to put an MSA in place to 
start hedging LPG. They are very interested in doing business with us, so I 
suggest we go ahead preparing the MSA.
Do you need TGS financial's or you already have them? Do you need anything 
else?

Regards,

Rolo
