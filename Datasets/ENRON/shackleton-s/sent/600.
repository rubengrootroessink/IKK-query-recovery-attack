If the guaranty is capped at $15million and payment demands are  made by HPL 
and ENA that exceed the cap, full payment cannot be made.  Should the 
payments be allocated proportionately or according to receipt of demand, or 
do we care?  I hope this helps.  SS

I'm not sure what this means.

Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It 
still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending 
their guaranty.  Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and 
ENA?  At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.
