Please take a look at the proposed language.  You will need to consider the 
time period before which a Market Disruption Event will kick in.:

Postponement:  For the purposes of the definition of "Price Source 
Disruption," as set forth in Section 7.4(c)(i) of the Commodity Definitions,
   the Maximum Days of Disruption shall be [thirty-two/sixty-four] days after 
the last date of publication of World Pulp Monthly,
   or any successor publication, published by Resource Information Systems, 
Inc. or its successor for the applicable 
   Calculation Period.
