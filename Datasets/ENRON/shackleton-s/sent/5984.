thanks.  I only asked Keegan for the most recent version since I misplaced 
it.   She misread my message.  In any event, I told her I'd wait for the 
updated version.

Also, you know Stephanie is on vacation this week.

Hello Sara, 

Keegan told me that you had asked her today to send to you an updated 
Brokerage Agreement Status Report.   We (the legal eagles) and the business 
folks agreed at the last meeting on 3/28 that I would distribute the report 
every two weeks - every other Thursday.  This works best for me and Keegan.  
Under that schedule, Keegan and I have planned that the report would be ready 
for group-wide distribution this Thursday.
