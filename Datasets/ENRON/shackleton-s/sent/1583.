I guess you know that Mark was inquiring as to who had ordered these.  I'd 
like a copy of the Japanese materials.  thanks.  Sara

I had to order a set of the ISDA Japanese documents for John Viverito, who 
will be leaving for Japan soon, so if anyone needs a copy I have them.  Also, 
London sent me a copy of the Amsterdam Power Exchange Rules, which I don't 
think anyone will need, but if you do, I have those too.
