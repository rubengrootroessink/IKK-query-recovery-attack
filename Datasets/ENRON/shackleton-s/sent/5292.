Hi Aneela & Eddy:

Attached please find the current Checklist of Information required to open 
such accounts.

I have replaced Sara as the attorney coordinating the opening of brokerage 
aggrements.  Thus, you can address all questions and correspondence to me, 
instead of Sara.    You can call me at x5-4693.
