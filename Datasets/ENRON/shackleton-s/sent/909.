1.  Wednesday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Jones Industrials         -258.44     -2.36%   10699.16
S&P 500                        -30.03     -2.08%    1411.69
Nasdaq                         -64.26     -1.45%    4363.24
Internet Stock Index            -2.00     -0.22%     922.33

The Dow sold off this afternoon while the Nasdaq reversed strong gains
from earlier in the day, as investors chose to take a portion of their
profits and run amid increasing investor concern surrounding Internet
security (see "Tech and Internet Stocks" below for more information).

The bond markets reacted strongly to comments from U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, who said the U.S. government would buy
back securities on all parts of the yield curve (both short-term and
long-term), not just the 30-year bond, to pay down government debt.
The statements caused long bond rates to jump considerably, which
contributed to a sell off in stocks.  The financial sector was
particularly weak, with American Express (NYSE:AXP) off 6 7/16 (-
3.95%) to 156 9/16, Citigroup (NYSE:C) down 1 13/16 (-3.24%) to 54
3/16, JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) lower by 2 15/16 (-2.46%) to 116 9/16,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (NYSE:MWD) declining 5/8 (-0.92%) to 67
3/16.

Shares of Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) bolted early in the day but then
gave up some of its gains, closing up 3 (+2.38%) to 128 13/16.  The
networking equipment giant announced fourth quarter earnings of 25
cents per share late yesterday, beating First Call consensus estimates
of 24 cents per share.  The company also set a 2-for-1 stock split,
its ninth split since Cisco first became a public company in February
1990.  The jump in Cisco's stock price catapulted the company to the
second-largest market capitalization position, ahead of General
Electric (NYSE:GE) and behind only Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT).
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Paul Weinstein speculated that
Cisco could become the first trillion-dollar company.

In leading Dow action, Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell 1 13/16 (-4.44%)
to 39 after thousands of the aerospace giant's engineers and technical
workers struck on Wednesday, IBM (NYSE:IBM) shares gave in to tech
sector profit taking, falling 1 7/16 (-1.21%) to 117 3/8; and
International Paper (NYSE:IP) shares sank 1 7/8 (-4.17%) to 43 1/8.
On the positive side, Philip Morris (NYSE:MO) shares bounced back 1/8
(+0.64%) to 19 5/8 today and SBC Communications (NYSE:SBC) shares
edged up 3/4 (+1.78%) to 42 13/16.

2. Internet and Tech Stocks

The tech sector succumbed to profit taking, with Intel Corp.
(Nasdaq:INTC) down 4 3/16 (-3.85%) to 104 5/8, Motorola (NYSE:MOT) off
6 7/8 (-4.30%) to 153, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP) edging lower by 3/16
(-0.15%) to 124, and Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) down 1 3/8 (-2.54%)
to 52 13/16.  However, several big tech names bucked the downward
trend.  One notable exception was Cisco Systems (discussed above), but
another strong performer was Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:SUNW), whose
shares climbed 4 9/16 (+5.24%) to 91 9/16 after the company's Chief
Financial Officer told an analyst meeting that Sun is looking to
bolster is revenues substantially.

The Internet world was rattled again today by continued attacks from
hackers on leading Web sites.  In recent days, the Web sites of Yahoo!
(Nasdaq:YHOO), Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN), and eBay (Nasdaq:EBAY) were
disrupted by hackers, who were apparently also the culprits for the
embarrassing outage on Buy.com's (Nasdaq:BUYX) site on the day of its
initial public offering.  Today, online brokers were the targets, as
the sites of Etrade (Nasdaq:EGRP), the #2 U.S. online broker, and
Datek Online, the #4 U.S. online broker, were impacted for a period of
time.  The companies involved were victims of "denial of service
attacks", whereby their sites became overwhelmed by traffic.  Yahoo's
site, for instance, was flooded when it received one gigabit, or one
million bits of information, per second.  The Federal Bureau of
Investigation, along with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, held a
press conference to calm the public and announce a criminal
investigation.

Investors did not react well to news of continued hacker activity,
with Amazon.com shares falling 2 7/8 (-3.46%) to 80 1/4, Yahoo! shares
losing 10 13/16 (-2.90%) to 362 5/16, eBay shares off 5 3/4 (-3.39%)
to 164, and Etrade shares losing 1 1/8 (-4.89%) to 21 7/8.  Meanwhile,
stocks of companies that provide Internet security services benefited
from the news, as Check Point Software Technologies (Nasdaq:CHKP) rose
7 15/16 (+5.67%) to 148, ISS Group (Nasdaq:ISSX) gained 7 7/8
(+10.66%) to 81 3/4, Watchguard Technologies (Nasdaq:WGRD) surged
46.10% (up 15 1/2) to 49 1/8, AXENT Technologies (Nasdaq:AXNT) bolted
21.51% (up 5) to 28 1/4, and Sonic WALL (Nasdaq:SNWL) jumped 16.87%
(up 10 1/2) to 72 3/4.

Shares of SoftNet Systems (Nasdaq:SOFN) fell 2 5/16 (-5.20%) to 42
3/16 despite the company's announcement of a major alliance with
several leading Internet companies.  SoftNet, which is a leading
broadband services provider, said it has joined forces with CMGI
(Nasdaq:CMGI), Compaq Computer (NYSE:CPQ), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Cisco
Systems to create SoftNet Zone, which is aimed at providing fast, easy
and secure mobile computing and Internet services to business
travelers.

Other big movers in the tech sector included AT&T (NYSE:T), down 1
9/16 (-3.10%) to 48 13/16, Informix Corp. (Nasdaq:IFMX), up 8.62% (up
1 1/4) to 15 3/4, Juniper Networks (Nasdaq:JNPR), up 10.83% (up 18
3/8) to 188, and Nortel Networks (NYSE:NT), up 3/4 (+0.62%) to 121 3/4
on heavy volume.

Leading Internet and tech stocks performed as follows:

Amazon (Nasdaq:AMZN)           -2 7/8     -3.46%     80 1/4
