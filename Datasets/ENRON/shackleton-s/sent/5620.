requested anything different?

Sara,

As you know I am the paralegal incharge of RMT masters.   I will prepare a 
master agreement for each of the Enron affiliates listed below.  I will 
submit such documents to you for review.

Before preparing such masters, please advise if Credit needs to advise us of 
any creit matters.

I look forward to your response.

Cordially,

Sara,

Below is a list (hopefully comprehensive) of intercompany counterparties we 
trade with, but do not have an RMT master agreement in place with:

Enron Metals Limited
Enron Metals Recycling
Enron Netherlands Holdings BV
Enron Development Funding limited
Enron Metals & Commodity Limited

LEt me know if  you need any more info.  

Recycling & Metals & Commodity Limited have very little trade activity.
