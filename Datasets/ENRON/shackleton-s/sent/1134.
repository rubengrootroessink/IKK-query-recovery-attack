      Attached for your review are (i) an execution copy of the Assignment
of Membership Interest, (ii) a draft of the Swap Termination Agreement, and
(iii) a draft of the Guaranty Termination Agreement.

 I told Michelle Vonderhaar that we would e-mail to her copies of the
Termination Agreements after you have had a chance to review them.  Please
let me know when you would like me to send them to her.  Michelle also
indicated that it would probably take a couple of days to locate someone who
is able to sign on behalf of Bankers Trust International PLC, which means
that we will have to execute those documents as of a date after March 28,
2000.

 Please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions.
