Of course I received this except that it arrived at 9:40pm last night.  The 
mansion was FAB! and we bought a Piero Fornasetti table (that belonged to 
Stanley Marcus) at a neat shop called Collage.  I am currently into Danish 
modern and bought a Poul Kjaareholm chair at the annual Knoll sale (and I 
know that the owner of Collage is Danish [modern!!!]).  Star Canyon was 
outstanding and we had a delicious bottle of pinot from Williams & Selyems 
(which we had been trying to locate).  And, yes, we went to a museum with 
Mike's mother and then for Mexican food.  We also saw "Run, Lola, Run" which 
is a cool German film with English subtitles.  I wish you would show Mother 
how to send e-mail and just get to search engine like Yahoo! so that she 
could check her stock portfolio periodically.  I spoke with Daddy this 
morning but he had to cut me off as usual.  See you soon, dahling!  CALL ME 
when you get this message.  Sass

Dear Sass,

Did you go to Dallas?  Did you have fun in Dallas?  How was your July 4?
Zachary called yesterday from his trip out of camp.  He told me that his
counselor has stolen a bunch of his clothes.  I'm not sure if I believe
him.  I think he may have just lost everything.

Let me know if you get this.

I miss you.

Debba
