To my knowledge, we will trade these instruments via internal broker 
platforms (i.e., ENA traders will trade online rather than over the phone), 
such as Goldman Sachs, or directly over the phone.  All trades will be 
confirmed either online or verbally and ENA will receive a daily statement 
reflecting trades done the previous day.  ENA does not prepare a confirmation 
but will need to check out the broker statements.

I believe that these debt securities are issued in either book-entry form (in 
variable denominations) or as registered certificates (e.g., undivided 
interests in a mortgage pool).

We will trade US agencies and Japanese bonds with Goldman.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sara,  I'm at home sick this morning, but plan to go into work this 
afternoon.  Could you take a look at the email below and give me your 
thoughts?  I'm not at all familiar with these instruments.  Thanks.

Gary has gotten approval to use Governement Agencies as hedging vehicles.  
Per Ellen, they will use Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal Home Loan Bank 
instruments.  What do we need to do to trade, confirm and settle these 
instruments?
We will get together at 4:30 today to discuss the changes required.
Thanks. Sheila
