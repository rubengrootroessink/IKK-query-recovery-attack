Tanya:  the Morgan lawyer called about putting ISDA Master Agreements in 
place with the following Enron entities:

Enron Canada Corp.
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. (trading UK nat gas)
Enron Liquid Fuels Inc.   (trading propane)

She indicated that guaranties were all about to expire in June.
All of Morgan's commodity business is being centralized in the above Morgan 
entity.
Please let me know how you are going to handle this in case Beth Ng calls me 
back.  Thanks.  Sara
