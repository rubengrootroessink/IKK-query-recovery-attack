I think that the reference may be in the setoff clause and the CP was trying 
to exclude "other Transactions" and limit setoff to derivatives only.  
Unfortunately, I don't have the form with me.  SS

I have forwarded to Marie Heard by interoffice mail a copy of deal NA1573.1.  
Whomever is available to review this confirm please check   Annex  A , page 
2, paragraph #5, line #5;  c/p added the word "derivatives" between the words 
"such - amount".  Back on 3/3/1999  legal  did  not  approve  this  same 
request  by these same counterparties.  Has  there been any  change in this 
opinion?  I  am  currently  holding every executed confirm received from 
these counterparties because  of  this  discrepancy.  Please advise asap.  
Thanks,  Willie, 3-9226
