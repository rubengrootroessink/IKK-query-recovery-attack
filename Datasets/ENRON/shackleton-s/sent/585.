AFAC and Marcelo:  We are in the process of reviewing the Comparative Chart 
and
attached memorandum and will soon provide a list of remaining issues which 
Enron
North America and South America would like to have addressed.  We are also
attempting to identify specific types of transactions which may be required to
hedge Enron risk in Brazil before 12/31/99.  For planning purposes, the 
"group"
would like to meet with you in Sao Paulo during the week of November 28.   We
are hoping that you may be able to accomodate us on  November 30 (Tuesday),
December 1 (Wednesday) or December 2 (Thursday).  Please let us hear from you.
Regards.  Sara
