Trading with certain type of metals is regulated. Let us confirm that.

One possibility would be to incorporate TradeCo first the way that we have
recommended, and then amend the corporate purpose once we have ascertained
which metals could be traded without being subject to governmental
concession.

Rogelio, the new corporate purpose looks very good to me...However, as you
know, Enron has recently acquired the largest metals trader in the world
(MG), and as of next september we will be able to trade metals on the
London exchange...I want the new corporate purpose to include "metals" in
its definitiion....

Peggy, let us know if this is O.K. with you so we can proceed....

Thanks and regards.
