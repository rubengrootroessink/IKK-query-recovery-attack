sorry i did not get a chance to revert back to you earlier.  was out in new 
york.
ok -- i will work on getting resources to help.  
however, could you confirm with everyone that you have NO OTHER deals other 
than what jill has listed?  preferably before our meeting this afternoon?
many thanks.

All:  I am comparing this list to mine but Jill's certainly looks more 
comprehensive!  Jill said she may not have signed confirms, etc. but we 
should get copies of all live equity deals.  I don't have paralegal 
capability for this work at the moment.  Sara

Julia:  Could you please call me when you receive this message?
