Yair:

Tracy and I would like to discuss the "Transfer" issue with you tomorrow,
if possible.  We think this should be a short discussion (maybe 10
minutes).  How is 1 pm NY time, tomorrow Wednesday April 25?  This seems to
be the most convenient for both of us, but we will entertain times before 3
pm NY time.

Would you please email your response?

Thanks.
