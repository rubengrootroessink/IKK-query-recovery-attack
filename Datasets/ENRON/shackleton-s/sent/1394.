Mark:  Barbara Gray and Shonnie Daniel worked on a Q1 deal between Enron and 
Texaco to create a JV called BL.  I believe that the ownership is 60/40, 
respectively.  BL has its own employees drawn from both companies and 
elsewhere but is still requiring additional services.  The swap group has 
already opened two futures accounts for BL and drafted resolutions, 
authorized trader lists, etc.  Before the closing, there was an 
"understanding" that Enron would assist BL for a short time (until June, 
2000).  However, credit (through Bill Bradford) negotiated a 3-year services 
agreement for credit services to BL (I believe based upon 1 full-time person 
run through an entire budget).  Randy Curry (BL's president) has requested 
that legal (swaps group) consider a short-term services arrangement (I am 
told by credit this would be for approx. 6-9 months; BL looking for approx. 
20 ISDA's).  By the way, ENA is trying to negotiate an ISDA with BL but we 
have no one to negotiate with!  BL has not yet hired an in-house lawyer.

Are you interested in pursuing this request?  Sara
