There are multiple Goldman files.  I do have the"ENA/GS&Co." online agreement 
only.  I have it only for reference as it has been executed.   The problem 
I'm referring to is the identification of the Lotus Notes Goldman files.  We 
can catch up in our meeting which I have scheduled for Monday.

I believe that Goldman is the file that you took back from me la while ago to 
handle yourself, remember?

Cheryl:

Goldman is one of the brokers "messed up" in Lotus Notes.  I had given you 
the files some time ago with my comments.  I think it would make sense for us 
to sort through Goldman for all affiliated companies.  I don't see an 
agreement in Lotus Notes for ECT Inv. and Goldman Int'l.

Sara/Cheryl,
 ECT Investments Inc has received a faxed document from Goldman Sachs 
International  regarding terms of business for executing equity transactions 
through the London office.  This document is not intended for the purposes of 
opening up a new executing broker accouunt with Goldman Sachs International.  
ECT Investments Inc currently has an existing executing broker agreement with 
Goldman Sachs & Co which should cover trades done in Houston and London since 
we are trading under the same legal entity.  The Terms of Business Letter 
sets forths terms and conditions that would apply to transactions executed by 
ECT Investments in London which is governed under the SFA rules and 
regulations.
 I will forward a copy of the document to Cheryl.  Goldman Sachs 
International is waiting for us to review and sign.  If you have additional 
questions and concerns, I can be reached at extension 31439.


Thanks,
Theresa
