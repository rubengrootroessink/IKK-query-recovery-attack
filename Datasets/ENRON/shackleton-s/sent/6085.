Gail:

Is the attached Master Repurchase Agreement used by both GS&Co as well as 
GSI?  It looks like both Enron companies (U.S and U.K.) will want repos and 
the U.S. company .  What is the difference in the forms used by GS&Co and GSI?

Any word on the consent?

Thanks.

Sara -

I will look at your consent document today.
Attached please find the standard repo documentation used by Goldman.

Gail:

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a
repo agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory,
please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific
consent.  Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron
Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own
form of unanimous consent or resolution.

Thanks for your help.

Gail:

Attached is a form of ECI unanimous consent.  Will you accept fhis for the
purpose of signing a repo agreement and transacting thereunder?  Please let
me know.

Also, you can email repo documents to me.

Thanks.
