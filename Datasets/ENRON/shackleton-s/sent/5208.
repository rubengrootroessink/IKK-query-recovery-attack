Sara/Tana, will you guys be preparing the amended confirms to include the 
language?  Once they are prepared, if you e-mail them to me, I will get them 
executed and sent to Tracy for execution by RBC.

Thanks

Greg

As discussed, the RBC/Enron swap confirmation needs to be amended so that the 
Pricing Dates are subject to the Preceding Business Day Convention.? As the 
original commodity swap confirmation was prepared by Enron therefore, can you 
please send out an amended confirmation which deletes Floating Price and 
Pricing Date(s) in its entirety and replaces it with the attached.? The 
amended confirmation should be sent to Ruth-Ann Marchis for signature.? Her 
fax number is 416-842-4314.

Please call me with and questions or comments.
