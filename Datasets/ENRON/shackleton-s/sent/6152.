Sheila:

Please send the futures and repo agreements to me.  What futures products 
will Gary be trading and which exchanges? 

Please continue to send brokerage agreements to Cheryl.

Thanks.

Cassandra, Cheryl and David,
Gary requested this morning that we add Goldman Sach's Futures Clearing 
capability as well.  I will request  account opening information from them 
and forward to legal.

Subject: New Futures Execution and Clearing Agreements

Cassandra, Cheryl and David,

Gary has requested that we establish new futures execution and clearing 
agreements with Solomon Smith Barney/Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.  I will 
forward the agreements when we receive them to Cheryl Nelson in Legal for 
review.

Prudential is exiting the business and the prior people at Pru have moved to 
SSB.  

Please do not hesitate to call, 3-3210,  if you have any questions.
Sheila
