Clem:

Attached to the end of this string of emails is the Bear, Stearns & Co. 
("Bear") form of guaranty.  My only issue is with Section 1.  Consents, 
Waivers and Renewals of the Bear guaranty which Bear insists upon .  Although 
Bear will agree to the Enron form of guaranty,  our Par. 4 Setoffs and 
Counterclaims problematic in light of Bear's waiver provision.  I'd like to 
discuss with you.  

ENA has agreed to a Securities Lending arrangement with Bear and the ENE 
guaranty (capped at $25million and restricted to ENA's arrangements with 
Bear) is part of that "package".

FYI, several Enron companies have accounts with Bear. 

When do you think we could discuss?

Paul,
I sent our Letter of Guaranttee form to Bear Stearns.  They have forwarded 
theirs to me.  Russ Miron, Bear Stearns, is supposed to call this morning.  I 
will try to conference you in when I receive his call or we will reschedule.
Thanks. Sheila
