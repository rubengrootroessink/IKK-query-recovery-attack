Janine:  I would like to meet with you (and Guenther) regarding two topics:

(1)  softs trading (together with Bob Bruce)

(2)  credit trading (do we need anyone else?)

Either of Tuesday or Friday morning works fine.  Let me propose 9 am Tuesday 
for softs and 10 am for credit (and I am flexible).  Bob and I are located 
only several offices apart on the 38th floor of the Enron building.

We look forward to hearing from you.
