1.  Wednesday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Jones Industrials          -40.64     -0.37%   10866.70

Tech stocks propelled the Nasdaq higher today as tech investors
put yesterday's interest rate hike from the Fed behind them.

Yesterday, the Fed raised two critical short-term interest rates
by 25 basis points (which equals 0.25%) each.  Today, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made positive remarks concerning
the remarkable growth of the U.S. economy.  Greenspan attributed
much of the growth to the substantial increase in labor
productivity.  This is positive news to investors because to the
extent workers are more productive (due to technological
improvements), businesses produce more goods and services
without a commensurate increase in wages.  This, in turn,
suggests that wage inflation is being kept in check,
notwithstanding the nation's strong economic growth, which means
there is less of a reason to raise interest rates.

Large cap tech stocks were the driving force behind today's
rally.  Leading the way was Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO), up 3
33/64 (2.50%) to 144 3/8, Oracle (Nasdaq:ORCL), up 3 3/8
(+4.18%) to 84 1/16, and America Online (NYSE:AOL), up 4 1/8
(+6.12%) to 71 1/2.  Other large non-tech movers today included
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), up 1 1/8 (+2.87%) to 40 5/16, General
Motors (NYSE:GM), up 1 9/16 (+1.95%) to 81 3/4, and Citigroup
(NYSE:C), up 13/16 (+1.40%) to 58 7/8.  On the downside, 3M
(NYSE:MMM) fell 4 7/16 (-4.91%) to 86, SBC Communications
(NYSE:SBC) dropped 2 (-4.42%) to 43 1/4, and Honeywell
(NYSE:HON) declined 3 3/4 (-7.50%) to 46 1/4.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares continued to impress today,
edging up 3/8 (+0.25%) to 150 7/8 on continuing announcement
from the conglomerate's announcement yesterday that its first
quarter earnings would come in "modestly" higher than expected.

The online and offline worlds came together today in another
cross-marketing alliance, this one between Pepsi-Cola (NYSE:PEP)
and Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO).  The companies announced a joint
online and offline promotional campaign called "Pepsi Stuff.com"
that will last 5 months beginning in August.  The program will
enable consumers to earn online awards and discounts from
promotions appearing under the caps of bottled Pepsi products.
A Yahoo! logo will also appear in close to 50,000 retail stores
nationwide where Pepsi products are sold.  Yahoo shares rose 5
7/16 (+2.84%) to 197 3/16 and Pepsi shares declined 13/16 (-
2.37%) to 33 1/2.

Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) led tech news today after
announcing an alliance aimed at establishing its position in the
burgeoning market for wireless handheld devices.  The software
giant will team with Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), the world's
largest developer of semiconductor chips for mobile devices, to
develop improved software for these devices, such as personal
digital assistants (PDAs).  Microsoft will use TI's digital
signal processors (DSPs) to enable its Windows CE operating
system that is used in wireless handheld devices.  Microsoft
shares edged up 1/2 (+0.49%) to 103 1/4.

First Union (NYSE:FTU) shares rose 13/16 (+2.26%) to 36 11/16
after the bank announced plans to build and launch an e-
marketplace for small and mid-sized companies in the third
quarter of 2000.  Among other things, the online service will
aggregate the buying power of participants to lower their
purchasing costs on a host of supplies, products, equipment and
services.  First Union has tapped privately held Intelisys
Electronic Commerce to help set up the service.

PSINet (Nasdaq:PSIX) was also in the news after announcing it
would acquire Metamor Worldwide (Nasdaq:MMWW), a business
software and services company, in a stock deal valued at $1.9
billion.  The move will help PSINet, an Internet access and
services provider, diversify into the e-commerce arena =0F-- as a
result of the deal, PSINet will also gain control over Metamor's
e-commerce software affiliate, Xpedior (Nasdaq:XPDR).  Metamor
shares soared 108.30% (up 17 21/64) to 33 21/64 on the news.
Xpedior shares also impressed, gaining 53.71% (up 7 11/16) to
22, while PSINet shares slipped 16.04% (down 7 15/16) to 41
9/16.

The chip sector performed well today, once again on the heels of
a gain from industry leader Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC), which
closed up 5 5/8 (+4.06%) to another all-time high of 144 1/16.
Meanwhile, Micron Technology (NYSE:MU) shares rallied today,
despite its announcement of lower than expected earnings
yesterday, after numerous brokerage firms came to the company's
defense today and offered positive comments.  Micron shares
surged 20 (+16.77%) to 139 1/4.  Rambus (Nasdaq:RMBS) shares,
which have fallen back in recent sessions, bounced back 31.43%
(up 83 51/64) to 350 3/8 today after a Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter analyst offered positive comments on the company and set
a price target of $500 per share.

Bio-tech stocks were again on the move today, this time to the
upside.  These stocks have been very volatile in recent weeks,
so today's big gains must be viewed in the context of overall
recent declines.  Nonetheless, Protein Design Labs (Nasdaq:PDLI)
gained 9 3/8 (+9.73%) to 105 11/16, Human Genome Sciences
(Nasdaq:HGSI) rose 14.55% (up 13 25/64) to 105 7/16, Affymetrix
(Nasdaq:AFFX) moved up 11 13/16 (+7.47%) to 169 7/8, and
Medimmune (Nasdaq:MEDI) added 15 13/16 (+9.92%) to 175 3/16.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors include:

<> Vignette (Nasdaq:VIGN), jumping 16.32% (up 32 19/64) to 230
15/64 on news the e-business applications provider will join
forces with Breakaway Solutions (Nasdaq:BWAY) to help companies
build successful e-businesses.

<> Microstrategy (Nasdaq:MSTR), bouncing back 22.71% (up 16
27/64) to 88 47/64 after plummeting the first two days of this
week after it announced it would re-state earnings for the last
2 years.

<> Wireless Facilities (Nasdaq:WFII), gaining 20.93% (up 19
29/32) to 115; Sciclone (Nasdaq:SCLN), jumping 52.61% (up 5
63/64) to 17 23/64; and Selectica (Nasdaq:SLTC), surging 58.09%
(up 43 23/32) to 118 63/64.

6. IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF=3D"http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo">AOL users click
here.</A>

Despite the underlying strength in the tech sector today, only
two companies made their public debut and with mixed results.
The big winner on the day was telecommunications chip component
maker inSilicon (Nasdaq:INSN), which surged 79.69%% to 21 9/16.
This company was highlighted in last week's Smat!IPO Report as a
likely winner.

The other IPO on the day -- that of PartsBase.com (Nasdaq:PRTS),
a provider of business-to-business (B2B) services in the airline
industry =0F-- did not perform as well.  The company's shares fell
12.50% to 11 3/8.

Although PartsBase.com did not soar like some of its leading B2B
predecessors, such as Comemrce One (Nasdaq:CMRC), Ariba
(Nasdaq:ARBA), or VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT), this doed not
necessarily signal a shift away from B2B stocks.  Rather, it is
due more to the recent flood of B2B IPOs.  These IPOs should be
judged on their individual merits -- promising ones could still
fly.  SmartPortfolio.Com will be watching.

There are many more very promising IPOs expected to start
trading later this week and next week.  For more information on
