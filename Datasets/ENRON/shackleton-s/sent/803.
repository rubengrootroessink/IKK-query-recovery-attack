I do not know who should buy the shares.  Rick and Glenn, how do you want the 
shares to be purchased and where do you want them owned?  Keep in mind that 
if EPCA buys the shares and then sells them same day EDIDE (for example), we 
will I believe need to open 2 accounts.  In addition, if the shares trade 
over the exchange, I am not sure exactly how we will execute a private sale 
between those 2 companies.  It seems to me that you may want to have the 
ultimate owner actually make the purchase and then try to structure your 
cashflows to accomplish your tax goals, rather than to accomplish those goals 
by moving around the shares.  We can talk about this tomorrow but the sooner 
we have the structure in place the sooner the account(s) can be opened.  We 
will need to coordinate this structure with Corp. Treasury (Cathy Moehlmann 
and Robin Veariel).

Regards,  Bruce

Subject: Brokerage Account/CIESA Transaction

Please let me know which company needs to open a brokerage account in 
connection with the CIESA transaction.  Once you tell me which company it 
should be, we can start the corporate authorization process and I will 
coordinate with Marie Heard of ENA concerning other information she'll need 
in connection with opening the account.

Please bear in mind that it will take some time (I'm not certain exactly how 
long--I will find out) to get all of the proper authorizations and other 
paper work into place, once you have decided on the company.  

Nancy
