Do I have to think?  Well, I say let's do it.  We'll have to monitor and if 
he is ever ineligible, we can cancel the agreement.  Of course, we can always 
decide to not transact.  SS

Tag- your it, 

I let John Arnold know of our trading terms.  I also spoke to Bill Perkins at 
Small Ventures, he is willing to post a $1MM L/C, he also wants to go ahead 
and put an ISDA in place.  What are your thoughts on this?

Russell
