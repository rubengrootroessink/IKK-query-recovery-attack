Mark and Paul:  Have either of you ever reviewed clearinghouse rules with 
respect to clearing members for the exhanges on which we trade (in an effort 
to analyze our risk with respect to our brokers)?  If the answer is yes, 
could I have copies of any memoranda?  Please let me hear from you or 
whomever may have reviewed this issue.  Thank you.  Sara
