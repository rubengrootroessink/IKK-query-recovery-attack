Kate:

Per my voice mail, I suggest the following as paragraph 2 to the Transfer and 
Assumption Agreement:

"WHEREAS, ....options for sale and purchase of physical energy commodities, 
in the case of EPMI (the "EPMI ransactions") or certain financial swaps, 
options or other financially settled derivative transactions, in the case of 
ENAC (the "ENAC Transactions") ..."

Also, am working on the jurisdiction issue.

Please call me at 713-705-1823
email me per below AND :       sshackl@swbell.net

Thanks.  Sara
