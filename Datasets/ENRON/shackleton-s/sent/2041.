I understand that Sara and I will visit with you Monday about this project.  
Attached are two updated forms of the equity swaps we have created thus far 
for warrants and shares with public/private options, and language to cover 
conversions of preferred, or rights to exercise warrants, that are not 1 to 
1.  Additionally, I learned late Friday that the materials I sent to you by 
fax last week are not the most current amendments to the Oconto Falls 
transaction.  You will be receiving another fax Monday morning.
