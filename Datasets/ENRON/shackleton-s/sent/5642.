Sheila:

Just a few questions about this futures agreement:

(1)  Is it OK for JP to combine our orders with orders of other clients and 
JP's affiliates?
(2)  Is it OK (after we deposit property into our account) for JP to return 
"property of like or equivalent kind or amount"?
(3)  Do you want to agree to an interest rate (on customer funds) upfront or 
only "as agreed from time to time"?
