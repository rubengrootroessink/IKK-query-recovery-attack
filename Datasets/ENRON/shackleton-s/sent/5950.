Cheryl:

1.  Check the comments for Ms. Lewis' information.

2.  No, I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were 
essential.  I did not say that accompanying docs were not required.  I 
suggested that someone should verify with Cheryl Lewis.  Often, the broker 
will rely on our relationship and subsequent delivery of accompanying docs.  
This must be determined on an ad hoc basis.

Sara:

1. Ms. Lewis' information does not appear to be in the lotus notes entry for 
ECI-Bear that I have used for the past two weeks.  Re: lotus notes, however, 
I certainly could be wrong. If you are certain, please point out or forward.

2.  You indicated in our meeting in my office that someone represented that 
Bear does not need the standard accompanying documents to open the account.  
As per my email request yesterday evening, can you confirm who determined 
this (if it was not you) so that I know what is going on and what I can 
represent in talking with the people at Bear?


Much thanx,

Cheryl:

1. & 3.    You should verify wtih Cheryl Lewis whose information is in Lotus 
Notes.  I do not have correct spelling of name or her fax number.

2.  Officers need to be confirmed through the Enron Corp. corporate 
secretary's office.  See the separate email I just sent you.

Sara, I have stopped by your office but you are not around.  Please provide 
the following information/clarification in light of your conversations with 
other folks:

1. We do not have to send Bear the Officers/Traders list and other documents 
with the agreements to get things moving?

2.  If we do, then who do I contact or ask Richard Sage to contact to get 
this information re: the correct slate of officers updated?  No one has 
advised me of these steps.  And actually, if we have to do this, I would like 
Stephanie to take the lead on finishing her work on this part of the project.

3. Re: this attorney Cheryl at Bear  that you have talked to -- what is her 
full name, phone, and fax?


Thanx.
