Janelle:  I discussed this earlier with Michael Brown.  We've never heard 
from Con Ed re: the message I sent last night (attached).  Samantha has the

Annex B comments fine except we need your website address for purposes of 
Paragraph 4.  Please note that:

Par. 3 Credit Support Agreements - Guaranty  
this assumes that we have the signed guaranty on the date of the Confirmation

The Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of ConEd was submitted to our Treasury 
group this morning for signature.  As of 5:30 p.m., it had not been returned 
to me.  I have left a message with Treasury and hope that I will receive in 
the morning.  Please advise (1) fax number of person to whom I should fax 
guaranty upon my receipt and (2) person/address for FedExp delivery of 
executed guaranty.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
