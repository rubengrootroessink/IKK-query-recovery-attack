I am finalizing the docs and we should coordinate with Julian.  You may want 
to let Scott Neal know that we will need his signature.  SS

Sara,

I spoke to Kevin Thomas and he gave me the following address and fax.

Address: 1 Jackson Square, Suite 1060, Jackson - Michigan, # 49201
Phone #: 517-768-2003
Fax #: 517-787-4606

How shall we proceed now? I guess we need Scott Neal's signature.

I'll be in a couple of meetings today, but we will definitely send this out 
today.

Thanks, Julian
