Richard:

Further to my message below, after speaking with Sheila, it appears that the 
Securities Loan Agreement that ENA will sign (hopefully tomorrow) is actually 
the same agreement to be used by Enron Credit Inc. ("ECI").   I think we can 
have this assigned from ENA to ECI.  We will have to get a new guaranty from 
Enron Corp.  I still do not know anything about the Bear guaranty that you 
mentioned in your email.  Please advise.

Also, please verify for me which office will prepare confirmations for ECI.  
If it is London, is there a services agreement in place between ENA and EI?

Richard:

Your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties 
are impossible to meet  (2/16/01 was last Friday).  The same agreement with 
ENA has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations.  

Please advise as to who in credit approved the USD25million Enron Corp. 
guaranty on behalf of ECI.  Also, FYI, Bear will not provide a reciprocal 
guaranty for ENA.

All,
So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of 
steps of which I am aware.
I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in
etc

Thanks,
Richard
