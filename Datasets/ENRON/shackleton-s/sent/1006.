I spoke with Rod Nelson about this party and Rod has been waiting to hear 
from you to speak with EDF.  I'm confused by your message as to who is to 
participate in your Thursday meeting.  FYI, there is an ENA meeting in 
Houston on Thursday afternoon.  SS

The people from EDF have confirmed the meeting for Thursday at 5:00 pm.
I think it would be good to have Andrea in the meeting as well.
