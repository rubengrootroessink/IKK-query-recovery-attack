It is time for me to follow up on an initial set of questions I asked 
Bolivian counsel relating to physical trading of natural gas.  I would like 
to use as a starting point the Allen & Overy document that was prepared for 
Financial and Physical trading.  The footer says that it was in your 
sub-directory in 1996\lcmemo.doc.  Is this something you can email me?  
Thanks for your help.
