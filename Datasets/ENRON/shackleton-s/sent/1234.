Mark:  I know that David Minns has been sending copies of executed agreements 
to Alan.  These include ISDA Master Agreements and brokerage (futures) 
agreements executed in the name of Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.  We need 
to incorporate these agreements into Lotus Notes and David Minns needs to 
have access to our database.  Do you want to speak with Alan or should I?  
Also, on a related issue, do we need to keep copies of the ECTRIC Master 
Agreements in Houston?  Would this be necessary in an emergency situation?  
Thanks.  Sara
