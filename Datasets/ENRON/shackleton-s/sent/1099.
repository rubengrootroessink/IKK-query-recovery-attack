That will be fine (for the sole purpose of negotiating the ISDA).  Regards.

Sara:  I am out of town, but receive thed enclosed response from Carol on 
this Western contract.  I assume that you are ok with LeBoeuf doing the work 
on this for Western.  If not, just let me know.  If it is ok with you, I will 
put together a very brief conflict waiver letter like we have done in the 
past.  Because I will be out of town the rest of this week, I might not be 
able to get it to you till the first part of next week, unless I can free 
up.  Let me know if that is any problem.  I hope all is well.  John

John:
I checked with Sara about this and she mentioned that Kevin was supposed to
prepare a waiver letter to address this.  Could you please contact her at
853-5620?  I will be on vacation this week starting on Wednesday and given
your   schedule it might make sense to work this with Sara.  Thanks.
Carol
