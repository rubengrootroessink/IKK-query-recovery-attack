Sara -

Jeff Fuller of PRM is requesting a conference call with you next Wednesday 
May16th.  just to refreash your memory he represents some NW puds - he wants 
to discuss the ISDA process with you now that they are prepared to move 
forward - I believe he will have the opion letter by then.  If this is 
possble can you schedule a time that works for both of you with him?  His 
number is 425-451-9123.  Thanks



Stewart
