Sara,

This morning I spoke to Steve Morus @ Puget Sound.  He was inquiring as to 
the status of the draft ISDA Master Agreement.  As you may recall, on 
February 3rd, I prepared a draft for your review.  I beleive this draft was 
nto sent to the counterparty due to some thoughts you had concerning our IOU 
provisions.  Steve is eager to recieve the draft if such matters have been 
resolved.

Let me know if I may be of further assistance.

Susan
