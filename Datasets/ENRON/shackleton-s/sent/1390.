Susan,
Per our phone discussion, please forward the attached agreement (in two
files) to Sara Shackleton.  As I've previously discussed with Sara, the
executables have been routed upstairs for signature by our executives.  I
will mail them to you as soon as they are signed.  In the meantime, the
attached files are intended to give you all a jump on your review.  Please
call if you have any questions.  I can be reached at 425 462-3688, or on my
pager at 888 731-9937.
Thanks,
-Steve Morus
