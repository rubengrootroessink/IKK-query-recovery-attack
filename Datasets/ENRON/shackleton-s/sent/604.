We have scheduled a meeting with Antonio Felix and Marcelo on Tuesday, 
November 30 at 9 am (Brazil time) in Sao Paulo.  The purpose of the meeting 
will be to discuss the Tozzini memorandum of October 19, address unanswered 
questions and identify issues for further research.  We are attempting to 
identify specific financial products for immediate trading.   For those of 
you in Houston who would like to participate, please let me know and we can 
either revise the meeting time or conference you in  later in the meeting.  
Please confirm your attendance as soon as possible.  Thanks.  Sara
