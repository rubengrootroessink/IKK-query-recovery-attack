Steve:  I don't believe that I have seen a revised forward confirmation since 
our conversations in mid-September.  I have only a "draft" confirmation dated 
May , 2000 which I marked and which served as the basis of further 
discussions.  Also, I thought that CSFB was going to send language addressing 
concerns raised by EITF Issue No. 00-19.  FYI, I have not received comments 
from Mike Enerson.

Is someone in your shop preparing a revised confirmation?  

Thanks.  Sara
