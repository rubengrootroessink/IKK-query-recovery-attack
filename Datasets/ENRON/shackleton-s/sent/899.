The update is posted at approximately 6:00 PM EST every day.

1.  Monday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials                -58.01     -0.53%   10905.79
S&P 500                         -0.16     -0.01%    1424.21
Nasdaq                         +77.63     +1.83%    4321.77
Internet Stock Index           +10.86     +1.22%     902.75

The Nasdaq broke out this afternoon to surge to another record high
while the Dow closed lower on little news concerning Dow components.

The 3-month takeover drama surrounding drug company Warner-Lambert
(NYSE:WLA) has finally come to an end on news that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
will buy Warner-Lambert for roughly $90 billion in stock.  The deal
will create the #1 U.S. drug company and the second largest in the
world, with annual revenues of $28 billion and a research and
development budget of $4.7 billion in 2000.  Pfizer's Chairman and CEO,
William C. Steere, said in a statement: "By combining two world-class
organizations to create the fastest-growing major pharmaceutical
company in the world, we are positioned for global leadership in the
discovery of new medicines that will benefit millions of patients
around the world."

The deal officially kills Warner-Lambert's previous plans to combine
with American Home Products (NYSE:AHP) in a $58 billion merger, but AHP
will receive a $1.8 billion "break-up" fee as a result.  A "break-up"
fee is often used in the merger context to solidify a deal by making it
more expensive for a rival suitor to "break-up" the deal.  In this
case, that is exactly what happened as Pfizer came in to bust the AHP-
Warner-Lambert deal, but as a result Pfizer will have to pay the
largest break-up fee in history.

Pfizer shares rose 15/16 (+2.62%) to 36 11/16 on the news, while
Warner-Lambert shares climbed 2 9/16 (+2.71%) to 97 1/8 and AHP shares
moved up 2 1/2 (+5.49%) to 48.  Other drug stocks finished mixed, with
Merck (NYSE:MRK) edging up 3/16 (+0.25%) to 75 1/4, Johnson & Johnson
(NYSE:JNJ) slipping 11/16 (-0.84%) to 81 7/16, and Schering-Plough
(NYSE:SGP) losing 1/2 (-1.08%) to 45 7/8.

There was also a major deal in the chemicals sector today, with two oil
giants, Phillips Petroleum Company (NYSE:P) and Chevron Corp.
(NYSE:CHV), saying they intend to form a 50-50 joint venture combining
their worldwide chemicals businesses, with assets totaling more than $6
billion.  Phillips shares added 1 (+2.56%) to 40 and Chevron shares
edged up 1/2 (+0.64%) to 79 1/16.

In other large cap action, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP) surged 8.79% (up
10 3/8) to an all-time high of 128 3/8, Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC) rose
3 1/8 (+2.98%) to 107 7/8, Philip Morris (NYSE:MO) ended lower by 1/16
(-0.30%) to 20 9/16, IBM (NYSE:IBM) was off 1 1/2 (-1.30%) to 114 1/8,
Eastman Kodak (NYSE:EK) dropped 1 1/4 (-1.98%) to 62, and Tyco Intl.
(NYSE:TYC) lost 7/8 (-2.19%) to 39 1/8.  In addition, Cisco Systems
(Nasdaq:CSCO), which is set to announce earnings tomorrow, closed up 4
1/16 (+3.35%) to 125 3/16.

Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) shares closed up 1/2 (+0.14%) to 354, reversing

the early afternoon EST today.  Meanwhile, shares of Charles Schwab
(NYSE:SCH), which also reported some problems with its Web site today,
also ended higher, up 7/8 (+2.31%) to 38 13/16.

Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) made a move to enhance its optical
networking business by announcing it will acquire Ortel Corp.
(Nasdaq:ORTL), a developer of opto-electronic components that help
increase the bandwidth (or distribution capacity) of cable television
networks, in a stock deal valued at $2.95 billion.  Shares of the
world's biggest telephone equipment maker fell 1/2 (-0.88%) to 56 1/2
while Ortel shares sank 9 1/16 (-5.12%) to 168 1/16.  In other telecom
news, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Wireless One Network, L.P. today announced they
have reached an agreement for AT&T to buy Wireless One's assets in
Florida for an undisclosed amount.  AT&T said it expects the assets to
fill a strategic gap in its Florida operations.  AT&T shares rose 3/4
(+1.48%) to 51 3/8.

A major deal was announced in the e-business sector, as Kana
Communications (Nasdaq:KANA) said it would acquire Silknet Software
(Nasdaq:SILK) in a $4.2 billion deal.  Kana is a leading provider of
online marketing, sales and service solutions while Silknet provides
customer-focused e-business applications and systems.  Michael
McCloskey, the CEO of Kana, said in a statement: "This combination
enables Kana to expand our leadership by providing a web-architected e-
business platform and a comprehensive suite of customer-facing
applications for marketing, sales and service communications."  Kana
shares lost 18 3/8 (-7.10%) to 240 1/2 while Silknet Software shares
soared 44 13/16 (+32.36%) to 183 5/16.

Shares of Corel Corp. (Nasdaq:CORL) fell 11/16 (-3.44%) to 19 5/16
after the software company, which has recently expanded into the Linux
sector, said it will acquire Inprise/Borland Corporation (Nasdaq:INPR)
in a deal valued at roughly $2.44 billion.  Inprise/Borland provides
Internet access infrastructure and application development tools and
services.  Corel's President Michael Cowpland said in a statement:
"This merger enables us to offer end-to-end product solutions and
global support to all of our shared customers."  Inprise/Borland shares
gained 5/16 (+2.42%) to 13 1/4.

The merger between EarthLink Networks (Nasdaq:ELNKD) and MindSpring
Enterprises took effect today after shareholders of both companies
approved the planned combination.  The merged entity, which retains the
EarthLink name, is the country's 2nd-largest Internet access provider
with close to 3 million subscribers.  EarthLink shares (*Note: new
ticker above) were unchanged at 31 7/16.

The biotech sector had a strong showing on Wall Street today.  Amgen
(Nasdaq:AMGN) rose 7.06% (up 4 9/16) to 69 3/16, Human Genome Sciences
(Nasdaq:HGSI) surged 26 15/16 (+23.40%) to 142 1/16, Medimmune
(Nasdaq:MEDI) gained 12 5/8 (+9.75%) to 142 1/16, Affymetrix
(Nasdaq:AFFX) climbed 17 3/4 (+6.52%) to 289 7/8, and Genentech

application and engineering services for its new CommWorks 5000
networking system.
