Cheryl:

I just finished a conversation with Mara Alexander re:  Cargill-Alliant, 
LLC.  She was inquiring whether we could add the weather rep (for the Trade 
Option Exemption) to that amendment since it was not included in the Master 
Agreement between ENA and Cargill, Incorporated.  I have not actually 
reviewed that master but if she is right, we should not have a problem 
complying with the request.  SS
