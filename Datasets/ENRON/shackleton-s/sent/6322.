Mary:  Thanks for the email.  No, I cannot use Ofelia on June 18 and I do not 
want a substitute while she is gone.

Dear Sara:  Ofelia says that if you like, she can work for you on Monday, 
June 18 since she won't be in town that Thursday, when she's supposed to work 
for you.  Please advise if you'd like her to come on the 18th.  

Please also advise if you'd like a sub while she's gone to Colombia.  

Thanks,
Mary
