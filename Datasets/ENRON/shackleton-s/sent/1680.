Sara and Paul,

I have received a request for a quote from Inforsa CI, and Chilean company.  
They appear to have an excellent balance sheet, but I don't know if we are 
set up to trade with Chilean companies.  Paul, the company's information is 
available on Bloomberg if you type in INFORSA CI and hit the equity key.  We 
are just starting discussions with them, but I wanted to make sure to give 
you both advance notice.  Please let me know if there is any additional 
information that you need from me.

It looks like it will be at least a month before Singapore Press Holdings 
will be ready to do business.  I'll keep you informed as our talks progress.

Thanks,

Jay
