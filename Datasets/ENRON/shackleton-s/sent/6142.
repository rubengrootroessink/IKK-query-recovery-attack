Caroline:

As you know, Carol is working on your template; then Frank, Carol and I  will 
have to review/discuss.  You will have the template soon.  We are all working 
hard to provide you with the necessary documentation.  

Are you preparing the information for us?

No Deemed ISDA, we decided that yesterday for the long-dated deal.

We are working on the draft masters for emailing.  Please send me the 
information about your counterparties' lawyers so we can begin negotiating.
