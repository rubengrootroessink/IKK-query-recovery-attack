Stephanie,

I am following up on the above-referenced Agreement on behalf of Richard
Weiss of this office. Before we can send the execution copies to our Zurich
office for signature, we have to obtain an Apostille for the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws which you provided. Presently we are waiting on
that. The Guarantee has been prepared and the legal opinion is in the
process of being signed. I hope to have everything to you by next week
sometime.

Please feel free to reply with any questions you might have.

Thank you,
Kimberly
