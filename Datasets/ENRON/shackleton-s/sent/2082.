After my discussion with Julia I thought I'd try to clarify the documents 
that need to be generated.

1. Confirmation of the trade between ECT and Citibank under the existing 1992 
Master ISDA Document
2. New Master ISDA Document between Garden State LLC and Citibank with a 
Performance Guarantee from Enron Corp. and confirmation of the trade.
3. Master netting agreement that nets obligations under the Master in 2. 
above with those in 1. above without having to modify the Master in 1. above.

We are trying to target first drafts to have discussions with the Bank on 
Monday afternoon.  Please let me know if this is too aggressive to have a 
first cut.
Thanks,
Rodney
