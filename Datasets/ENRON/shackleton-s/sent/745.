1. Monday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               -113.16     -1.01%   11144.27
S&P 500                         -2.94     -0.21%    1418.09
Nasdaq                         +30.81     +0.82%    3783.87
Internet Stock Index            +8.44     +1.03%     828.66

The Nasdaq surged to another record high while the Dow pulled back from
early gains in moderate trading volume.

Investor focus shifted to Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee, which is the Fed's interest rate policy-making body.
Although few market watchers expect the Fed to raise rates at the
meeting given uneasiness over the Year 2000 issue, speculation has
grown that the Fed may change its "bias" or predisposition towards
future interest rate hikes.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares rose 1 13/16 (+1.19%) to 153 11/16 on
continuing momentum from the company's announcement on Friday of a 3-
for-1 stock split, a 17% increase in its quarterly dividend to 41 cents
per share, and an expansion of its share repurchase program,

In addition to the GE stock split announced on Friday, several
prominent companies announced splits last week and today, including
Oracle Corp. (Nasdaq:ORCL) 2-for-1, Red Hat (Nasdaq:RHAT) 2-for-1,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. (NYSE:MWD) 2-for-1, Check Point
Software (Nasdaq:CHKP) 2-for-1, Novellus Systems (Nasdaq:NVLS) 3-for-1,
and CMGI (Nasdaq:CMGI).  Novellus Systems shareholders were excited
today--the stock closed up 33.36% (up 28 18/32) to 113 9/16!
Our Smart!Splits Report forecasted the GE, Oracle, and CMGI splits.

Merger mania hit the drug sector again today with news that drug giant
Pharmacia & Upjohn (NYSE:PNU) and life sciences company Monsanto
(NYSE:MTC) will combine in a "merger of equals" transaction.  Investors
in both companies reacted negatively to the news, as shares of Monsanto
closed down 5 1/8 (-12.28%) to 36 5/8 and shares of Pharmacia & Upjohn
closed down 3 1/8 (-6.22%) at 47 1/8.  Monsanto shareholders were
particularly disappointed because they have been pushing for an
acquisition involving Monsanto, or at least its agribusiness division,
for some time, but given the merger of equals nature of this
transaction, they will not receive a significant premium for their
shares.  Other drug stocks ended mixed, with Merck (NYSE:MRK) edging up
3/16 (+0.28%) to 66 3/4, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) down 7/16 (-1.32%) to 32
13/16, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) down 3 (-3.16%) to 91 7/8.
