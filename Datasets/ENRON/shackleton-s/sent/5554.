No - I received a single page which is the UBS standard blank form for 
"authorized traders".  No names, no addresses, etc.

Darren,
Did you send anything to legal regarding UBS Warburg?  Someone has sent her 
something for the Tokyo office for  TP Trader, I-Dealer, and TPOL Website.
What are these for?
ENA has an ISDA with UBS Warburg.
Thanks. Sheila
