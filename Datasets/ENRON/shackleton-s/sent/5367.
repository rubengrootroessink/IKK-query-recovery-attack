Sara-

I have left a message with Steven Haratunian asking him for a legal contact 
and their deal numbers for our 2 equity forwards.  I will pass them on as 
soon as I hear from CSFB.

Clint/Jeff:

ENA has an ISDA master agreement with an affiliate of CSFB (but not CSFB).  
Can you provide me with the name of a CSFB lawyer so that I can send over a 
form of ISDA Master Agreement with Enron Corp.?  Thanks.  Sara
