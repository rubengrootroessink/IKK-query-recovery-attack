FYI - I don't know anything about this deal other than the fact that Chris 
Foster asked me a question.  I referred Chris to Christopher who had worked 
on the APEA transaction which had similar issues.  SS

I do not have any information on this tentative deal either.  I would suggest 
that we hold tight unless Sara Shackleton or Chris Foster can give us some 
additional information to go forward with.
