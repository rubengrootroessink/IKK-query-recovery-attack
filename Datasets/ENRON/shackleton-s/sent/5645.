Sam:  There are now two entries for J.P. Morgan Futures, Inc.  I didn't 
realize that you had entered an agreement.  I didn't want to delete your 
entry but I don't understand what you entered.  Is it a futures agreement?  I 
am negotiating the futures agreement.  Also, the email address you entered is 
incorrect.  Please help.
