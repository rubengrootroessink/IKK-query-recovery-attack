Sara,
Is there a Guarantee in place by Enron Corp. for ECT Investments, Inc. 
relating to our prime broker agreements with Goldman Sachs?  
We are talking to Goldman currently about increasing our leverage and a 
guarantee may be beneficial if one does not already exist.  We are unsure if 
one already exists.
Thanks, 
Sheila
