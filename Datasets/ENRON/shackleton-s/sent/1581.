Sara,

Org chart attached.

Per conversation with Jeff Kinneman who was in London this week, London Credt 
Trading will be trading in Bank default swaps .  The name of the entity is 
still to be determined.  Jeff will be authorized to execute trades for the 
entity and the trades will be in the name of the entity and not back-to-back 
with our books.
Sheila
