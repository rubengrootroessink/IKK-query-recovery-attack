Subject: RVI - Portfolio CDS No.1 (Equity Tranche)


Jeff - you should receive in the next day or so a Security Agreement from our 
lawyers in Bermuda (Appleby Spurling) which has to be executed on behalf of 
ENA.  I have approved these docs - in short the agreement grants us security 
in a Reinsurance Contract which supports RVI's obligation under the Credit 
Default Swap.

I would be grateful if you could sign where necessary and forward all copies 
by courier directly to Sharon White at the following address:

Sharon White
Conyers Dill & Perman
Clarendon House
PO Box HM 666
Hamilton 
Bermuda

Sara - I would be grateful if you could provide the requisite legal 
initials.  On a separate point - Sara - can you confirm that Greg Whalley has 
the authority to sign on behalf of ENA - if so can you have someone fax me a 
copy of the signatory authority.
 
If you have any questions give me buzz.

Many tks

Denis


PS - Drop me a mail when the docs have gone so I can chase-up with Sharon.
