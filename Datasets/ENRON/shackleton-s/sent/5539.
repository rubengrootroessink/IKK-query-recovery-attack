Stephanie:  The fax that you gave to me with this file states that the CP 
wants to change jurisdiction "back to New York."  I don't see a prior draft; 
only a blackline against a Weyerhaeuser Company LImited document, the latter 
ISDA having been executed in June, 2000.  Does his question refer to that 
executed master?
If so, please let me know what we agreed to.  Thanks.
