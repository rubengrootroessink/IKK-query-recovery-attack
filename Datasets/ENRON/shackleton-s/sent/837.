1.  Monday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               -243.54     -2.16%   11008.17
S&P 500                        -39.45     -2.74%    1401.91
Nasdaq                        -139.32     -3.29%    4096.08
Internet Stock Index           -40.38     -4.51%     854.24

Markets gave up early gains and spiraled downward today on heavy
volume, as investor fears that the upcoming Fed meeting may lead to an
increase in interest rates contributed to a broad-based sell off in
stocks.

**ALERT:  After the markets closed, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced
fiscal first quarter earnings of 25 cents per share, which beat analyst
estimates of 20 cents, and also announced that it has named Robert Iger
as President & Chief Operating Officer of the entertainment giant, a
move that was expected.

The music industry was rattled by the announcement of a joint venture
between EMI Group plc and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX).  The two companies
will combine their recorded music and music publishing businesses in a
separate company to be called Warner EMI Music.  That company will be
one of the world's leading music companies, with some of the biggest
performing artists on its roster, such as the Rolling Stones, Beatles,
Madonna, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and Spice Girls.  Although the
roughly $20 billion company will be owned equally by Time Warner and
EMI Group, Time Warner will control the entity, which means that
America Online (NYSE:AOL) will ultimately run the company if the
proposed AOL-Time Warner merger is consummated.  Time Warner shares
finished lower by 3 1/4 (-3.57%) to 87 7/8, while stocks of other
companies that are viewed as possible music industry alliance partners
also finished lower, with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) off 1/4 (-0.76%) to 32
1/2, News Corp. (NYSE:NWS) down 1 5/8 (-3.74%) to 41 7/8, and Sony
Corp. (NYSE:SNE), parent of Sony Music, declining 1 5/8 (-0.69%) to 233
3/8.  The stock of another potential partner, Germany's Bertelsmann
(BMG), does not trade in the U.S.

In another music industry deal, Liquid Audio (Nasdaq:LQID) shares
surged 31.64% (up 8 3/16) to 34 1/16 on news the online digital music
provider has joined with Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) to add support
for the distribution of Liquid Audio's extensive catalog of songs and
music previews in Windows Media (WMA) format.  The WMA format, which
Microsoft hopes will become the industry standard, is used to encode
digital music so it can be sent more quickly over the Internet and take
up less space on a hard drive.  Microsoft shares closed down 2 1/2 (-
2.41%) today.

This Wednesday's Smart!Internet Report will highlight the online music
industry, which will include an analysis of the Time Warner-EMI and
Microsoft-Liquid Audio deals.  To gain access to this report, sign up

Recent speculation that Dow component Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was
pursuing a takeover of both Warner-Lambert (NYSE:WLA) and American Home
Products (NYSE:AHP) came to an end today when the consumer products
giant announced it has ended its discussions with the drug companies.
Warner-Lambert then issued a statement saying it was continuing to
explore options, including talks with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which has made
a $78 billion unsolicited bid for Warner-Lambert, that could lead to a
takeover.  Shares of Procter & Gamble, which have plummeted since it
began pursuing a possible deal with the drug companies, bounced back
7/16 (+0.43%) to 103 1/8 today, which was a positive force on the
mostly negative Dow today.  Warner-Lambert shares slipped 4 1/4 (-
4.62%) to 87 3/4 and AHP shares sank 5 3/8 (-11.20%) to 42 5/8, while
other leading drug companies finished lower, with Merck (NYSE:MRK) down
2 3/16 (-3.02%) to 70 1/4, Schering-Plough (NYSE:SGP) off 2 3/4 (-
6.49%) to 39 5/8, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) falling 6 3/16 (-
6.88%) to 83 11/16.

In other Dow news:

-- Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC) shares were sharply higher during the day
but then closed up 7/8 (+0.89%) to 98 13/16 on the heels of positive
comments from respected computer systems analyst Dan Niles of Robertson
Stephens.  Niles reiterated his buy rating and $125 price target on
Intel, saying the world's leading semiconductor company is performing
well in January and should benefit from the expected rebound in PC
demand following the recent Year 2000 slowdown.

-- General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares were a major catalyst for today's
steep decline in the Dow, dropping 6 1/16 (-4.21%) to 138 1/16 after an
article in Barrons over the weekend expressed some concerns regarding
GE's most recent quarterly financial results.

-- AT&T (NYSE:T) shares fell 1 9/16 (-3.00%) to 50 1/2 despite reports
that the telecom giant may cut up to 25% of its executive staff.

Shares of both Healtheon/WebMD (Nasdaq:HLTH) and Quintiles
Transnational (Nasdaq:QTRN) posted big gains today after the two
health-related companies announced an acquisition and strategic
alliance.  First, Healtheon/WebMD will acquire Quintiles' electronic
data interchange unit, ENVOY Corporation, for $2.5 billion, which will
allow Healtheon/WebMD to process close to 2 billion transactions a year
for its healthcare customers.  Second, under terms of the strategic
alliance, Quintiles will invest up to $100 million in Healtheon/WebMD
to develop Web-based products and services targeted at drug
development, physician detailing and direct-to-consumer information
delivery, while Healtheon/WebMD will be the exclusive provider of
Quintiles' Web-enabled services.  Healtheon/WebMD shares rose 9.34% (up
5 9/16) to 65 1/8 and Quintiles shares climbed 12.53% (up 3 1/16) to 27
1/2.

Shares of Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN) and drugstore.com (Nasdaq:DSCM)
stood out in the Internet sector today after the leading online
retailer and online drugstore announced an expansion of their business
relationship.  Under terms of the deal, drugstore.com will be given a
shopping "tab" on Amazon.com's site in exchange for $105 million over 3
years.  In addition, Amazon.com will invest another $30 million in
drugstore.com, which raises its stake in the online drugstore to
roughly 28%.  Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com, said in a
statement: "We're working to make Amazon.com the only place where you
can find anything and everything you might want to buy online -- what
you're seeing today is a completely new component of that strategy."
In separate news concerning Amazon.com, Goldman Sachs upgraded the
online retailer to trading buy from market outperform and reiterated
its $140 price target on the stock.  Amazon.com shares bolted 12.99%
(up 8 1/16) to 70 1/8 and drugstore.com shares surged 20.17% (up 5 7/8)
to 35.

Most other leading Internet stocks started strong but finished lower,
with Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) sinking 26 11/16 (-7.58%) to 325 1/4, CMGI
(Nasdaq:CMGI) down 8 (-6.77%) to 110 1/4, Ebay (Nasdaq:EBAY) off 14 1/8
(-9.39%) to 136 3/8, and priceline.com (Nasdaq:PCLN) declining 5.61%
(down 3 9/16) to 59 15/16.

CompUSA (NYSE:CPU) shares bolted 41.67% (up 2 13/16) to 9 9/16 after
Grupo Sanborns SA de CV, a Mexican retailing company, announced plans
to acquire the U.S. #1 computer retailer for $10.10 per share in a cash
tender offer.  Grupo Sanborns said in a statement that it expected
Telefonos de Mexico (NYSE:TMX), Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) and SBC
Communications (NYSE:SBC) to be minority investors in the company.

Level 3 Communications (Nasdaq:LVLT) announced a major acceleration and
expansion of its business plan, saying it would spend $3.5 billion in
capital expenses in 2000 and $2.5 billion in 2001 to build out its
global fiber-optic networks.  Level 3 shares closed up 2 3/8 (+2.15%)
to 112 7/8.

In a strange trading pattern, shares of Enzo Biochem (NYSE:ENZ) were
all over the map today, rising as high as 139 before ending the day
down 44 (-36.07%) to 78.  Despite the gyrations in stock price, there
was no notable news concerning the bio-tech company.

Other big movers in the tech sector included:

-- MP3.com (Nasdaq:MPPP), down 1/2 (-1.69%) to 29 1/8 on heavy volume
after the online music service provider announced late last week it is
being sued by an industry trade group alleging breach of copyright.

-- Lexmark Intl. (NYSE:LXK), up 12 1/64 (+14.93%) to 92 1/2 after
reporting better than expected fourth quarter earnings and giving a
positive outlook for 2000

-- Avista Corp. (NYSE:AVA), soaring 15.16% (up 7 1/8) to 54 1/8 after
announcing its business-to-business (B2B) affiliate landed contracts
with CVS (NYSE:CVS), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Staples (Nasdaq:SPLS), and
Time Warner (NYSE:TWX);

-- Siliconix (Nasdaq:SILI), rising 56 3/4 (+34.66%) to 220 1/2 after
the electronics component maker reported blow-out earnings and strong
revenue growth.

-- PMR Corp. (Nasdaq:PMRP), surging 109.09% (up 3) to 5 3/4 on news of
a financial restructuring and a venture capital investment that will be
used to finance its new Internet health care information subsidiary.
