Hey Sara -
I think we might be doing a survey (I am not sure).  I ahve been telling 
select cities that Merced irrigation has signed a ISDA.

Tom Kabat, Senior Resource Planner, Resource Management Division for the City 
of Palo Alto, Utilities Department, gave me his card yesterday and said he 
wanted to get an ISDA started for future trading.  He asked if we had ISDA's 
with any other cities, that is, it might make his job easier.  Are you guys 
sending follow-up letters to the attendees?  SS
