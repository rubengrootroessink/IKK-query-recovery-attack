Rick:  With a little luck, I can attach the first page of each of the 
foregoing documents and the signature block for the ISDA Master Agreement (at 
the bottom of the first page of the ISDA Master Agreement).  The full set of 
signature documents comprises four pieces:
(1)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border)
(2)  Schedule to the Master Agreement [previously emailed to you]
(3)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Credit Support Annex  [NOTE:  the document contains 
12 paragraphs]
(4)  Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex [previously emailed to you]

When we are ready to execute documents, we generally send out a complete 
package with all four parts.  The two emails which you previously received 
probably have the word "DRAFT" plastered all over them and we would normally 
remove this wording.  Please call me in the morning so that we can be sure to 
dot the "i's"  and cross the "t's".  Thanks.  Sara
