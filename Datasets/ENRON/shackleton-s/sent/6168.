Sheila:

I want to send legal comments to SSB and Morgan Stanley today.  Since I do 
not have the names of any lawyers, please verify that I should begin with:

(1)  SSB:  Tania Meyer Wilson, VP Investments

(2)  Morgan:  Joseph A. Marovich (his card was attached to the documents) 

Have you received anything from Goldman Sachs?
