Jim and Sara:

Jim, I received your voice mail and apologize for taking so long to get back
to you.  I attach a copy of the last draft we discussed that contains the
new jurisdiction language.  I used some of your suggested language, ISDA's
section 13 wording and then just lifted the rest from the language in the
indemnity to the engagement letter that I faxed to you earlier today.
Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Thanks,
