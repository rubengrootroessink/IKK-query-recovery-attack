Mark:  Thus far, I have uncovered only one "nondocumented" electronic 
agreement.  The equity desk uses the services of POSIT which is an electronic 
trading system which matches orders six times daily for institutions and 
broker dealers.  There is no agreement for this matching service.  I am not 
aware of other "matching services" and whether any agreements are in place.  
Let me know if you have any concerns.  Thanks.  Sara
