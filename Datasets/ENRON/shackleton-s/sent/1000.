I hope you had a safe trip back to Houston.  I found out Friday evening that 
I had the stomach flu and I was out of commission until today.  I hope I did 
not pass it on to you and Lynn.  

I noticed on Susan's report that the Duke master is still missing support 
documents.  Is this something that can be easily followed up on considering 
the possibility of entering into a trade soon?  Did we ever send them the 
documentation they were waiting for from us?  I tried looking at the swaps 
database but I can no longer get access for some reason.  Thanks.
