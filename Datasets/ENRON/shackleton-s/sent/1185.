David:  Attached is an example of the "tainted swaption".  I'd really like to 
focus on the dates (Trade, Effective, Exercise).  Looking forward to call in 
the morning.  Sara

I have attached the Confirmation for Kellogg. Please check the language in 
the additional provisions section to make sure it says what it needs to.

Sara, the expiration date is May 15, 2000 and the effective date is April 1, 
2000. Is that going to present a problem?

Thank you,

Jarrod
