Carson:  I have been pretty awful, haven't I?  I took a short vacation to 
Dallas last Friday but I'm back now.  I'd love to have lunch one day.  Just 
give me a call (713/853-5620) and we can catch up.  Not much news; same old, 
same old.  Sara

Sara:

How have you been? I miss talking to you. I hope you have a great 4th. I
have had a couple of fun trips to New Orleans since we last had lunch.
It would be nice to see you and have lunch together some time.
Carson
