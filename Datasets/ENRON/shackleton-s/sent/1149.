Close.  Credit is considering credit terms for the deal.  If executed today, 
we'll have to do a Deemed ISDA and simultaneously send out a draft ISDA for 
negotiation.  Do you have a deal ticket already?  I understand it's a 7-year 
deal.  SS

Sara,

Pushkar is in the process of doing an Interest Rate Swap with EMP Echo LLC.  
The deal has been approved by credit already.  Davis Thames is involved in 
the transaction and can give you the name of the attorney who is representing 
Echo.  Davis was thinking that his attorney (Gerald something) would prepare 
an ISDA and send it to you to put a Master Agreement in place.  Let me know 
what I need to do, as I will be waiting to find out what form of confirmation 
to use for the transaction.  Thank you very much for your help.
