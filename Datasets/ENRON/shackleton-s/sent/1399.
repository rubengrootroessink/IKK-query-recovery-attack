I have two questions:

(1)  If the ECC financial trading business is to be confirmed in Canada, 
won't Greg Johnston need a "short course" on ISDA/omnibus, etc.?  I was 
thinking of practical issues as well as Tana's more formalized training.

(2)  Have you spoken with Mary Solomson about Anthony?  I'm not sure if Tana 
has organized her lunch with global contracts, but it sounded as though 
Anthony was part of the problem and that Mary should be at the lunch.
