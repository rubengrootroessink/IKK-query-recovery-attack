I am not aware of the nuances of copper trading!  However, I left a message 
earlier this morning to find out from the MG lawyer.  I haven't heard back.  
The deal ticket should provide for the premium payment date and, if not, I 
would use our standard language.  Sara

Sara / Susan,

On copper option trades, do you know when the premium is usually due?  Does 
the standard 2 days rule still applies to this commodity?   
Thanks,
