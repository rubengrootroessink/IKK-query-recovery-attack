Peter:  I know that Gary Rosenblum is out of town until after Labor Day.  
Gary's voice mail directs callers to a gentleman with the last name of 
"McFarber" at Ext. 6128..  I left a voice mail for him this morning and have 
not heard back.  Is there a lawyer to whom I can direct questions about your 
form of equity forward?  Thanks very much.  Sara (713/853-5620)
