Sara,
ECT Investments Inc currently has a service agreement in place with ITG Corp 
for POSIT Trading.  ITG also offers an enhanced platform, known as the 
Quantex  Trading application.   The intent would be to use the enhanced 
platform replacing the POSIT application. 

We are forwarding the trading application agreement onto you for the 
appropriate person's legal review and approval.
Please do not hesitate to call Selena, 3-5168,  if you need additional 
information.   We would appreciate an estimated timeframe for completion.
Many thanks. Sheila
