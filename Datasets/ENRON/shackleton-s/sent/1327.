Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and 
no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) 
replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a 
broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant 
ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even 
though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please 
call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  
Thank you for your help.  Sara
