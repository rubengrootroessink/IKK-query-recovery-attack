Hey, Clem:

Hope you had a great New Year!

I'll try to make this easy so that you can respond "yes" or "no":

(1)  FUNB wants ENE remain liable for payments covering "any other damages, 
costs and attorney's fees".  Do you agree?

(2)  FUNB only wants to make a demand for payment with no strings attached.  
I'll try to whittle the demand period down from five days to three.  Do you 
agree:

(3)  Guaranty to be governed by NY law.  Agreed?

I'm sure you enjoyed this little exercise if I hear back from you.

Thanks.  Sara
