Cheryl:

Can you please forward a copy of the ECI resolution(s) (or consent) which was 
used to establish the Bear account and Securites Loan Agreement?  We need to 
determine all products authorized for ECI trading.  Also, copies of Enron 
Credit Limited authorizations would be useful.  Thanks for your help.
