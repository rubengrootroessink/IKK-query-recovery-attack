Is there any intention of selling off equity in this company?  If so, in the 
near future?

This is where the Daishowa mill assets are held so they are elegible; 
additionally, this is 100% owned Enron sub.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya:

Bob Crane did a deal with the Canadian party identified below.  Sounds like 
he originally told our FX trader that the parties would be EGM (actually ENA) 
and Enron Industrial Markets ("EIM").  In the end, EIM was not the correct 
party but the Canadian party was the correct party.

Is this trade between ENA and Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona authorized by 
credit?  Is the company eligible?

Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Sara,

Are we able to do FX deals with the company shown below?  Also, would this be 
an RMT confirm or an ENA confirm?

The information on the confirm executed (deal no. m439607) between EGM and
