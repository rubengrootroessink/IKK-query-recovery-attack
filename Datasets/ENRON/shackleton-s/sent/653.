Just a follow-up to our conversation of last week to see how you were coming
along.  When would you like to schedule some time to discuss the ISDA?  Please
let me know if you have any questions and/or whether I can assist you in any
way.  I understand that our respective traders are discussing a transaction.
You may contact me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.  Thanks.  Sara
