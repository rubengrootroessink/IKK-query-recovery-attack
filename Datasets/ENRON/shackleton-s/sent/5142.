Kaye:

the attached "Enron forward" document below needs to be compared against the 
"forward template" that you saved in my directory today (confirms/equity).  I 
have an 11 a.m. meeting with Clint et al on Monday.  I'd like to have the 
comparison before the meeting, if possible.  Please let me know if this is 
possible.  Sara
