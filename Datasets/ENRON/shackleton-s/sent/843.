Let's verify that this is an IOU.  The Master should be sent to the attention 
of Dave Brown and you should advise Cary of when it was sent to the 
customer.  He may want a copy.

ps  Remind me to give you both copies of Tana's utility analysis.  Also, 
Marie, let's talk about the utility language and circulate for comment.
