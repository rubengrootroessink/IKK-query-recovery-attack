Sam:  the addressee for the guaranty is :  mmidden@anz.com            (his 
name is Michael Midden)

The message is :  Attached for your immediate review is the form of Enron 
Corp. ("Enron") guaranty which would be utilized to guaranty all financial 
trading obligations pursuant to an ISDA Master Agreement and transactions 
thereunder which would be entered into between Enron North America Corp. and 
ANZ Bank.  Jason Williams (in Enron's risk control group) asked that you 
receive a copy of Enron's form of guaranty if you had not already received 
one.  We are in the process of preparing a draft ISDA Master Agreement  and 
will forward it to you next week.  Please let us know if you have any 
questions.

Please copy Jay Williams and me.  Thanks and sorry for such short notice.
