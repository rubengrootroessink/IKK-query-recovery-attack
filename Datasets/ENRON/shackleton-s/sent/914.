Thanks for your time yesterday.

I am working with General Mills to resolve: 1) cross default provision and 2) 
credit matrix.  

Can you fax them today the revised ISDA schedule and credit support annex and 
Enron and General Mills' parent guarantees?  

General Mills will likely present ISDA and draft confirmation to senior 
executives next week for final approval.  Please let me know when documents 
will go out.  Thanks.

Ed Quinn
