What is a cardio cath?  Was she having problems.  Zach is not a little guy.  
I'm going for an allergy shot.  I'm so tired that I'm getting to be boring.  
I wish Mother had email.  We could have 3-way discussions.  Sas

You just never know with him.  I'll tell him to write you back, but I can't
force the little guy.
Shirley had a cardiac cath today, and she's fine.
Don't forget about Mother's cataract surgery next Monday.

Love and Kisses
Me
