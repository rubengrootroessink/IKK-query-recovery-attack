Here's what happened to the Enron South America LLC master.  You can now 
officially bug Robert George (legal in Sao Paulo) and  Bruce Harris 
(commercial in Houston) and remove Andrea Bertone from any official 
distribution.  Sara

Item 21 is actually a contract being reviewed by Bruce Harris and I.  I have 
already discussed the contract with Bruce, but last time I heard from him on 
the contract he had some questions for tax.  In any event, it is probably 
appropriate to take Andrea off of the list as the "commercial contract" and 
put Bruce Harris on instead.   That way people in Houston can start bothering 
the right person (ie, Bruce) when they wonder where it stands.
