Donna:  Monday is not a good day for me since my 6 p.m. call has been 
arranged.  Wednesday would work best.  Can you talk to Carson?  Sara

Carson,
I've been out of town on business a lot lately.  I'd love to have dinner again
and I've heard great things about Benji's.
Sara has a "special"  birthday coming up on the 17th.  I don't know any of her
friends here since she's gotten out of the
business in Houston.  Wouldn't it be great if you could get her two "birthday
pals" together with us for the occasion!?  Isn't
Monty a mutual friend of yours?  (I've never met him.)  What do you think?
Donna

Hi Donna:

I have not heard from you in a while, so I wanted to touch base. No real
news here. I had a nice lunch with Paul Dunning this week. He is still
very busy and recovering from a back injury but in good spirits as
usual. I still want to go to Benji's one evening if you are available.

Take Care,
Carson
