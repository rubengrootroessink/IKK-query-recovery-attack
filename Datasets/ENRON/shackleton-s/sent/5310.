We are currently in the process of preparing contracts to assign all of our 
financial transactions with Calpine Natural Gas Company to the ISDA with 
Calpine Energy Services, LP.  The following is a listing of the transactions 
by ID:

Bob is in the process of gathering deal date information and will provide 
this to Susan on Friday (tomorrow morning).  As I have mentioned to you, the 
results of this transfer will reduce our exposure by approximately $27MM.  
Comments or questions, please call.
