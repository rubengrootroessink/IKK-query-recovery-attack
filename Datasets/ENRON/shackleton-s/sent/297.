I just spoke with Miriam Radich (Tiger's lawyer) and advised her of ECT's 
name change effective 9/1/99.  She advised that she will revise our docs 
TOMORROW.  Also, we will send a new blackline guaranty to Tiger (terms 
previously agreed) to reflect name change.

Per:  It may take several days to have the guaranties executed by Corp.  You 
need to give Marie advance notice on that front.  SS
