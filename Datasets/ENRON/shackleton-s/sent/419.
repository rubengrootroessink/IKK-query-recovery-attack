I have sent the ISDA schedule to Barclays for their review as there are a few
issues that Barclays needs to respond to before I can forward the document to
Enron (the email is being sent separately by my word processing staff).  I am
confirming whether Credit Lyonnais is handling the schedule themselves since
that was my impression when talking to Daryl Stanley, although that was before
getting this email (however, if MBP is handling the schedule for both banks, 
the
schedules will be identical except as to the Tax representations, so the
negotiation of one schedule will make the other schedule easy to complete).

Daryl or Ricardo, can one of you confirm?

Quan
