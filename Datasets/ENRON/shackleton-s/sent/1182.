Bob:  I haven't commented on preferred guaranty formats, I only asked Kris to 
fax the form of guaranty which Ed Wood had sent originally.  I thought that 
the e-mailed guaranty was the same as Ed Wood had distributed but I hadn't 
verified that item prior to sending.  I have not had a chance to review 
Kris's fax   If you have your own form, please send and we can review.  Sara

Sara, I received your e-mail yesterday and was unsure whether the form of
guaranty you attached was the correct form. I understand you talked to Kris
and agreed that the original form distributed was not the preferred
document. Was the attached guaranty another copy of the first form of
guaranty distributed, or is the updated version?
