Andrea Bertone forwarded the recent memo about the new Brazilian Regulatory 
Affairs' Database.  I can access the index through Enron's intranet but I 
receive the message that Netscape cannot acces the address 
"http://ei-sp-01/regulatory" when I try to access one of the six parts of the 
database.  I am an ECT user (not Enron Development).  Can you help me to 
access the site or tell me what I need to do to view legislation, documents, 
etc.?  Thanks very much.  Sara
