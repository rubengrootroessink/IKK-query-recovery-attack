Tanya:

Carol and I would like to meet with you tomorrow (Wed.) at 11 am.  The credit 
worksheet would be a very timely issue for us.  Does the time work for you?

Sara,

I don't think we ever touched base on the issues surrounding the credit 
worksheet.  Please let me know if we still need to talk.  Thanks.
