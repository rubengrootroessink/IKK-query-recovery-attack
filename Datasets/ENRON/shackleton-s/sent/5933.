Hi, Lauren:

I cannot find the new email address for the Allegheny lawyer for delivery of 
a revised ISDA Schedule.  I left a voice mail for Yair Yaish and for Laurie 
Peddicord
but have not heard back.  Can you provide me with the latest information?  
Are you the lawyer who should receive this Schedule?  Please let me hear from 
you.  Thanks.
