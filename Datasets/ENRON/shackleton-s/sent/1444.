Kaye:  I would like to schedule a meeting for sometime after June 8 (when our 
new paralegal Samantha arrives) with Donna and Samantha.  We will need a 
conference room.  1 hour.  Taffy has Samantha's schedule.  I know she has 
orientation on June 8.  If Tana is "training" on June 9, 10, etc., I could 
borrow 1 hour.  Thanks.  Sara

I  would love it if we could meet.  We have made a little bit of headway in 
this effort, but quite frankly, not much.  In fact, I have seen DASH's that 
is indicating the purchase of public equity and I am trying to find out who 
and how etc these are being transacted.  Can you set something up or do you 
need me to. I will bring somebody from my group to help and learn so we 
probably need a conference room.  Thanks for keeping this issue alive.  
Donna  P.S.  Has Marie moved to EBS or is she still with you?

Donna:  It's been awhile since we last spoke about advising Enron companies 
of existing brokerage accounts.  It has also been determined (in legal) that 
the accounts will remain with ME and not move to Alan A.  I have some 
temporary assistance in that an A&K lawyer, Jason Peters, is working up here 
for another few weeks.  I was hoping that we could all meet and put our 
"project" into action.  Please give me a call and suggest some time when we 
may meet.  Thanks.  Sara
