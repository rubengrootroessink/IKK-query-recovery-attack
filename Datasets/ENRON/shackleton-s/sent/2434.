Mark:

Credit has asked us to pursue trading arrangements on behalf of Enovate.  

At least for the short term, Mark Haedicke told Kay Mann that ENA legal 
should handle Enovate legal work.  That work currently consists of 
establishing documentation for financial trading with third parties.  It is 
not clear what lawyers (ENA or Peoples) will draft/negotiate ISDA masters nor 
have any forms been agreed (but Peoples' lawyers have seen our forms and I 
have seen their forms which are poorly drafted).  Bill Bradford will have the 
final word on Enovate credit.

Credit has asked us to track Enovate masters on our Lotus Notes database.

Do you need to follow up with Mark about us negotiating Enovate's master 
agreements?  Or should we just handle as any other project?
