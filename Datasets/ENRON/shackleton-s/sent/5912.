Thanks for the update.  No need to call back but here are my comments:

Allied Waste North America - please follow up on your own as the paralegals 
don't have the resources right now for handling all of Sam's load

FirstEnergy Services Corp - please have your assistant redline changes since 
this is also one of Sam's items

City of Palo Alto and Macquarie Inc. (or "Bank Ltd") -  neither of these are 
on anyone's radar screen so please proceed as you wish

Proctor & Gamble - please return to me for further handling.  Ed Quinn is 
leaving Enron

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

		 Subject: ISDA files I am working on

Allied Waste North America -- Samantha has this marked "sent for execution" 
as of 2/13; can I get one of the other specialists to follow up on this?

FirstEnergy Services Corp -- Very close to finishing this (I hope); I owe 
them another redline that should reflect agreement on all issues

Select Energy -- this has recently been revived after a long dormancy.  Ed 
Sacks is revisiting credit issues.  Meanwhile, I am plodding through minutiae 
with their very detail-minded attorney

City of Palo Alto -- recently received an e-mail from their assistant city 
attorney stating that they are internally discussing what needs to be done to 
their city code to allow for derivatives trading; he also said they will not 
be ready to discuss this w/ me for a couple of weeks

Macquarie Bank Ltd. -- this is an ag ISDA (although there is no specific 
trade for it at this time).  I am waiting for our meeting to discuss 
ag-related changes to our ISDA forms.  Once that is settled, I will send them 
an updated draft

Proctor & Gamble -- I sent Libby Rutherford a letter in December, outlining 
the issues to be discussed.  I think I also put in a few phone calls to her 
at that time.  I never heard from her.  I haven't heard any pressure for 
movement from the pulp & paper desk since I met w/ Ed Quinn and some other 
people in January (although I did happen to get a call yesterday from an EES 
person working on a deal with them; he was just curious as to what we were 
doing w/ them and the status of things; I put him in touch w/ Ed)

still happy to meet w/ you on these if you wish -- Bob
