Carol:  I missed this deal the other day which was originally assigned to 
Marie.  In our last legal/credit meeting, Brant was going to call Christina 
Tice, the CP credit manager.  Maybe this is a good one for Tana to stay on 
top of Brant.  Your name is on this one.

Also, nothing happened with credit on Friday.  Although Richard inquired 
about Palladium.  I let him know that we drew on the LC's last week 
(according to Tanya).  Sara
