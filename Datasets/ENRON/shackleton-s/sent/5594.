Richard:

The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all 
reside in the U.K.  I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney 
for executing documents in Houston.  

As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) 
on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking  for verification from Janine.

My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement 
and include the usual "affiliates, representatives, etc." who may need to 
know any confidential information.  Your V.P.'s are all in London.  

If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign 
for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have 
a V.P. sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.  At a minimum, though, 
we should try to work from our form of NDA.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Tana,
I guess we need to change the Enron legal entity from Enron Corp?
In our current model the transacting entity will be Enron North America 
(which is a Delaware corporation?)
Can you then arrange a suitable signature (Haedicke?)
Can we get this done by the end of Friday?

Thanks,
Richard

Richard, Craig told me you could review and sign this confidentiality 
agreement, naturally it might need a little editing.

John and Denis--

Here is the proposed confidentiality agreement.  I wasn't sure about the
exact name for you, so I just put in the generic "Enron".  Let me know if
this is okay.

Call me if you have any questions, and I'm looking forward to reaching an
agreement with you.

Thanks.
