Clement: Enclosed in re the Enron/FP&L ISDA agreements is the revised
guaranty we discussed today.  Please let me know if the revisions meet
with your approval so Sara and I can proceed to finalize this and the
related agreements - as well as prepare the corresponding agreements for
Enron and FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc. (the non-regulated FP&L
affiliate we discussed).  Thank you, -Serge
