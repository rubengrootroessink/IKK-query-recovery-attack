Sara and Gareth,

We still need to finish this agreement and have it signed.  To my knowledge, 
it has not been completed and signed.

Sara,

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.

David
