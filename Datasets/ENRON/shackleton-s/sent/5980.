Hi, Michael - hope all is well.

Just curious if London might be interested in a George Washington University 
MBA (International Business) looking for work in London or Europe.  She is a 
family friend.  She is bilingual (Swedish and English) and fluent in French 
and German.  She also has work experience.  I am going to send her resume to 
HR in Houston and suggest her for the analyst/associate program.  However, I 
wasn't certain as to whether the London/European offices worked through a 
different processs.  Please let me know if you think there may be some 
interest.
