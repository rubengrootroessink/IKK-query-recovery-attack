Yes.  I thought you understood as much from our meeting.  I have asked A&K 
repeatedly to add you to the email list.  Also, it was my understanding from 
Mark Taylor that you would be responsible for the "structured" equity 
derivatives (with assistance from the swap group as needed).  Please let me 
know if I'm assuming too much.  Thanks.  Sara

You had these documents forwarded to me.  Is this now my project?
