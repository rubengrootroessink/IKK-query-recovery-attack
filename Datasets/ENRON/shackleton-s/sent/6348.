Mark:

Attached is my current workload report.  I'm beginning to get nervous about 
meeting traders' expectations as I am taking vacation from June 14 - 22 
(seven business days) and I don't know who will be able to pick up my 
emergencies and routine issues.

I have some idea about Mary's and Frank's workload and I have the impression 
that Brent is constantly busy with weather.  I'd like to briefly discuss 
Cheryl's workload  I think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a 
status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is "project" 
oriented vs. routine, specific commodity areas, and volume.

FYI, I am trying to limit Cheryl's activity with Gary's group to brokerage 
agreements only.  The huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was 
apparently the result of a recent audit by AA and effort to "cleanup" the 
agreement status.  It should be winding down.  I have encouraged Cheryl (as 
have Frank and Mary) to provide you  with a workload report since we really 
want her to be trained in the swap basics.

Also, I will try to schedule a conference call with David Mitchell, you and 
me before I leave (topic is online trading of credit derivatives).  
Currently, only ECL is offering the bankruptcy default swap online (and no 
one is hitting the product).
