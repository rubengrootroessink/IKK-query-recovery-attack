Enron is closed on Tuesday 12/26/00.  We can talk on Wednesday 12/27/00, at 
your convenience.  Also, I will be out of the office on Friday 12/29/00.  
Will I have your CSA before 3 pm Houston Time today?
Regards.  Sara

Sara:  Thanks for the revised schedule and comments.  I will be reviewing
and discussing them with EWEB tomorrow (Friday, 12/22).  In the meantime,
attached for your review is our draft form of legal opinion resulting from
our discussion last week.

Perhaps we can arrange time for a conference call on Tuesday, 12/26/00, to
finalize our negotiations?

-Jim

Jim:

Attached is a revised Schedule.  We have accepted most of your changes.  I
believe that the outstanding issues include:

1.  Please note the revised Threshold which we previously discussed.
2.  We accepted Portland as a forum for arbitration.
3.  We need to discuss your invoicing procedure.
4.  We are waiting to comment back on the revised reps pending receipt of
the CSA and legal opinion.
5.  We have added some language to the recording provision to acknowledge
internal recording destruction policies.
6.  We have not revised the Reference Market-maker provision.  Have you had
a chance to consider my email of 12/19/00?

Please let us know when we will receive the remaining documentation so that
we can finalize our negotiations.

Regards.  Sara
