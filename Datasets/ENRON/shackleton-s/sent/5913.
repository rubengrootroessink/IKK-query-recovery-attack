Carol St. Clair is one of the Houston lawyers handling Canadian matters.  She 
will speak with Russell this morning about revising the credit worksheets and 
will be available to answer questions.  Her extension is 33989.  Also, as 
Tana mentioned in her email yesterday, both Susan Bailey and Stephanie Panus 
are the paralegals in Houston who create the omnibus confirms having credit 
and you should always feel free to contact them.

P.S.  Russell is going on vacation this week and I don't know who will handle 
Canadian credit issues in his absence.
