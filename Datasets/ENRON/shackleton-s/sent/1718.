EITF Action on Derivatives on a Company's Own Shares

July 21, 2000

At its July 19, 2000 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)=20
tentatively resolved how certain settlement features affect accounting for=
=20
equity derivative contracts entered into by a company on its own stock.=20
Specifically, the EITF sketched out a model governing how such features=20
affect whether the contract should be treated as (a) an equity instrument a=
nd=20
reported in stockholders=01, equity or (b) an asset or liability at fair va=
lue=20
with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings.

EITF Issue No. 00-19, "Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within=
=20
the Control of the Issuer for Purposes of Applying Issue No. 96-13 ," was=
=20
taken up to address implementation of the EITF's March 16, 2000, consensus =
on=20
EITF Issue No. 00-7, "Application of EITF Issue No. 96-13 to Equity=20
Derivative Transactions That Contain Certain Provisions That Require Cash=
=20
Settlement If Certain Events Occur ." The final consensus in Issue 00-7=20
generally stated that equity derivative contracts that contained provisions=
=20
that implicitly or explicitly required net cash settlement outside of the=
=20
control of the company must be treated as assets and liabilities and carrie=
d=20
at fair value rather than equity instruments carried at original cost and=
=20
reported as part of permanent equity as provided for in EITF Issue No. 96-1=
3,=20
"Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentiall=
y=20
Settled in, a Company's Own Stock ."

The Task Force also tentatively provided an extended transition period for=
=20
existing contracts and contracts entered into before a final consensus is=
=20
reached. The goal is to reach a final consensus at the September 2000 EITF=
=20
meeting.

The Model=20

The model=01,s governing concept is that, for a contract to be accounted as=
=20
permanent equity, the contract's provisions should put the company=01,s=20
counterparty in no better position than the company=01,s common shareholder=
s.=20
Specifically, the EITF tentatively concluded that contracts in a company=01=
,s=20
own stock, such as written puts or forward purchase contracts, that come=20
under the scope of Issue 96-13 and have net share settlement provisions tha=
t=20
keep a contract from being classified as an asset or liability must have th=
e=20
following characteristics =01* otherwise the contract must be treated as an=
=20
asset or liability at fair value with changes in fair value reported=20
currently in earnings.

The contract must permit the company to settle net in shares, at its option=
,=20
in either registered or unregistered shares. (It was determined that the=20
ability to deliver registered shares was outside of the control of a compan=
y.)
The contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of shares to be=20
delivered in a net share settlement. This cap must exist even if the contra=
ct=20
terminates when the stock price reaches a stated price trigger. (The need f=
or=20
a cap was determined to be critical in determining whether a company had=20
sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the contract.)
At contract inception and on an ongoing basis, the company must have=20
sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract=
=20
considering all other claims on authorized shares for stock options,=20
convertibles, and other transactions that may require the issuance of stock=
.=20
(This requirement was deemed critical as the ability to have a request for=
=20
additional authorized shares approved by the shareholders was deemed outsid=
e=20
of the control of the company. In this context, "the company" is defined as=
=20
the company's management rather than its management and shareholders.)
There is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point in=
=20
the contract or for any reason.
There are no required cash payments to the counterparty (true-ups) if the n=
et=20
shares initially delivered are insufficient to provide the counterparty wit=
h=20
full satisfaction of the amount due. However, true-ups may be included in t=
he=20
contract if the company only, not the counterparty, can choose whether to=
=20
satisfy the true-up in shares or cash and the true-up is subject to the=20
explicit cap discussed in item 2.
There is no economic penalty in the contract for net share settlement that=
=20
would economically compel the company to settle in net cash. (The right to=
=20
increase the number of shares delivered based on the fair value differentia=
l=20
between registered shares and unregistered shares was not deemed to be a=20
penalty.)
There are no provisions in the contract that would indicate the counterpart=
y=20
had creditor rights, or would otherwise contravene the objective of this=20
model that the counterparty=01,s rights would rank no higher than those of =
a=20
common shareholder. (Subject to future EITF discussions, it may be possible=
=20
to meet this criterion by having a legal letter addressing the issue or a=
=20
specific statement of this concept in the contract.)

Related Issues

There was also discussion of the provisions relating to termination and=20
settlement in the event of a merger or change in control. There was general=
=20
support for a position that, as long as the counterparty received the same=
=20
choice of compensation as other shareholders (for example, stock for stock,=
=20
stock and cash for stock, cash for stock), the fact that the counterparty=
=20
might receive cash in such circumstances would not preclude equity treatmen=
t=20
for the contract.

Similarly, in the event of nationalization or liquidation, a net cash=20
settlement of the same type afforded a common shareholder would not preclud=
e=20
equity treatment for the contract.

In addition, counterparty rights that did not exceed rights of common=20
shareholders should be acceptable, for example, rights to sue for damages i=
n=20
the event of misrepresentations or a breach of warrranties or if a company=
=20
simply refused to perform under the contract, as long as a common sharehold=
er=20
would also have those rights.

With respect to events that would cause a contract that was compliant with=
=20
the model at inception to later become noncompliant (for example, because a=
n=20
acquisition consumed enough authorized shares that otherwise were needed to=
=20
satisfy the contract), the EITF concluded that, at the time the contract is=
=20
no longer compliant, the fair value of the contract should be transferred=
=20
from equity to an asset or liability at fair value with prospective changes=
=20
in fair value reported currently in earnings. There would be no immediate=
=20
earnings effect at the time of this transfer.

Further, if, at a later date, sufficient shares were authorized to again=20
satisfy the contract, the carrying amount of the contract (that is, its fai=
r=20
value) would be transferred back to equity and the contract treated as equi=
ty=20
prospectively to the extent the contract continues to comply with the model=
.=20
(The company would not be permitted to reverse the gains and losses in fair=
=20
value recognized in earnings during the period the contract was treated as =
an=20
asset or liability.)

Transition

The EITF tentatively concluded that all contracts entered into after the da=
te=20
of a final consensus will have to comply with the model at contract incepti=
on=20
to achieve equity treatment. (The goal is to reach a final consensus at the=
=20
September 2000 EITF meeting.) For contracts entered into before the date of=
 a=20
final consensus, a company will have until June 30, 2001, to modify the=20
contract to comply with the final consensus.

For example, if a company entered into a contract before the date of the=20
final consensus, the company will have until June 30, 2001, to obtain any=
=20
shareholder authorization of shares needed to satisfy the criteria or to=20
modify their contract for the other criteria or any EITF changes to the=20
tentative model.

Since a variety of viewpoints are discussed at Emerging Issues Task Force=
=20
(EITF) meetings and it is often difficult to characterize the conclusions,=
=20
the following minutes may differ in some respects from the final minutes=20
available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
