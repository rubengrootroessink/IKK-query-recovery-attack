Mahesh:

I have a question that needs to be answered on Wednesday morning:

 What company actually employs John Greene?

I am now being told by Instinet that the company employing the trader must 
sign a new confidentiality agreement for the UK terminal (for trading by ECT 
Investments, Inc. through its arranger Enron Investment Services Limited).  
Please advise by email or voice mail

Thanks  Sara

Sara
Apologies - I have been out of the office for the past 10 days.

I had asked Cindy in legal to provide you with signature blocks when you 
first asked for it - I will chase her again today.
I will call you this afternoon to discuss the status of the agency agreement 
and any other requirement that you may have - let me know when you are 
available.

Regards
Mahesh

I am still waiting for a copy of the services agreement and the form of 
signature.  Instinet is proceeding but will still require this information.  
Thanks.  Sara
