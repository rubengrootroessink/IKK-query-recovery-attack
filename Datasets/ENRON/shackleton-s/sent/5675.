Yes, please.  Let's look at the .com master before we do anything.  The Enron 
Corp. master should be "easier".

FYI - I received a voice mail from Anita Khosla of CSFB (212-538-1938).  She 
wants the Enron Corp. master to mirror the master they recently executed with 
Enron Credit.com.  I have not had a chance to call her back yet.  Do you want 
me to obtain a copy of the Enron Credit master?
