Jennifer below are MAP's legal department's comments on the Enron OTC 
agreement from July 14..

  1. On the address at the top of page 1 the address for MAP should be 
correctly identified.  I don't believe "Document Department" is correct. 
CHANGE TO ATTENTION DALE BARWIG

  2. Under the provision titled "Floating Amount Details", "Floating Price" 
at line 3, change the word "entitled" to "titled".

  3. Under Governing Law change "Texas" to "New York".

 On the last page, information should be inserted for notices for MAP and 
another provision for communications.  Under "Communications" insert "Prior 
to the close of business on the next business day following the trade date, 
ENA will prepare and forward this contract electronically (faxed or attached 
to an email in a mutually acceptable format) to MAP's trader with a copy to 
the supervisor of Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting as listed 
below under Contractual Invoices".

 Then for "Contractual Invoices":

Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP)
Name: Fred L. Bennett
Title: Supervisor, Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting
Address: Room 444-M, 539 South Main Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840
Tel No: (419) 421-4200
Fax No: (419) 421-5040
Email: FLBennett@MAPLLC.com"

  4. Under Annex A General Terms and Conditions under the provision titled 
"Market Disruption Event", line 3, change "ENA" to "both parties".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here starts my comments on the contract language.

5.  As we talked about I am confused that which crack sale has occurred.  The 
fixed price referencing the attachment should indicate USGC 74 Grade (Pipe) 
Heating Oil.  I am unclear where in the document we mention Low Sulfur.

Floating Price: The average of USGC platts oilgram midpoint for USGC Pipeline 
No. 2 74 Grade OIl, multiplied by 42, less the First Nearby NYMEX WTI Crude 
Oil futrures settlement prices

Where is the settlement paragraph?  Something like:

If the Fixed Amount exceeds the Floating Amount for such calculation period, 
the fixed price payor shall pay the floating price payor an amount equal to 
such excess.  If the floating amount exceeds the fixed amount for such 
calculation period, the floating price payor shall pay the fixed price payor 
an amount equal to such excess.

Thanks for you help.
