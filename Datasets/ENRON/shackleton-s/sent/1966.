Attached are the transaction documents for Project Tahiti.  Each of the 
documents is marked to show revisions against the version circulated last 
Wednesday, August 30.  As we discussed on the phone, we have incorporated the 
business agreement reached between CIBC and Enron, as follows:

The Tahiti Series Trust Agreement has been revised to require the consent of 
all certificateholders (which includes Fiji Z LLC, which can only consent 
with the consent of its Class B Member - CIBC) prior to (i) the creation of 
any series after December 31, 2000 (see definition of Series Supplement) and 
(ii) making any amendments to the purpose provision (which specifically 
limits the purposes of the Trust to holding Trust Property - defined as the 
warrants) or the definition of Series Supplement.

The Subscription Agreement has been revised to provide that CIBC's commitment 
to fund on December 31, 2000 will be terminated if the Bali Trust receives 
any funds except in connection with the issuance of debt of the Bali Trust 
(which would require the consent of CIBC as the beneficial owner) or funds 
received from CIBC.

Please be aware that because of the revisions described above, it was not 
necessary to incorporate  all of Tim Elwood's comments received September 3, 
2000.
