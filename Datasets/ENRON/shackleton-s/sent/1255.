Mark:  Nice to meet you too!  When Credit sends us the creditworksheet, we 
can generate an ISDA master to send to the counterparty.  Sara

Sara,
 I just joined Enron about 1 month ago and am just getting use to the 
process.  Could you start the ISDA process with EnSight Resources.  The 
address and phone number and contact information are below in the John Suttle 
memo.  Thank you very much.

Mark

John,
 Could you set up EnSight Resources an account with Enron, so they can 
transact some NYMEX NG fixed price swaps with us in the near future.  Karen 
Anthony is the CFO and she can provide you any financials that you need to 
get them set-up.

The address is:

Karen Anthony
CFO
EnSight Resources, LLC
333 Texas St, Suite 1175
Shreveport, LA 71101
318-429-2226


Thanks for your help in this matter.

Mark Smith
