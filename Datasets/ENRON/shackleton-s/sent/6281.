FYI, there has been activity regarding the KCS file, in particular, the 
status of the amendment to permit cross-netting of certain agreements and the 
impact of that amendment now that KCS has emerged from bankruptcy.  Two (2) 
new financial transactions have been executed and there is a VPP looming 
ahead for June 15.  The issue which we were trying to isolate is the effect 
of the amendment to the financial/physical agreements post-bankruptcy.  We 
concluded that KCS is bound post-bankruptcy (Carol St. Clair thought you may 
have had some reservations).  I'll keep you apprised of any developments.
