Hi, Michael:

Per my voice mail, I am interested in purchasing a case of Skewis 
half-bottles (any vineyard).  Do you have 12 bottles available?  That is my 
first request.  If you don't have 12 Skewis, then I may have to search for 
alternatives. 

Shipment for this case will be directly to:

Michael C. McKeogh
601 Poydras Street, 23rd Floor
New Orleans, LA  70130

We can discuss payment when I hear from you.  Thanks for your help.
