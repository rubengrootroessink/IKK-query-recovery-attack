		 Subject: File Check Out Cards

We discussed the idea of each file having its own card.  It was the consensus 
that this would be too much to track on a going forward basis due to all the 
name changes, mergers and the like.  I suggest we delay this project and 
assess how the new system works for awhile.  Then after we get caught up on 
other of the projects, we can reassess this idea.  Let me know what you 
think.  Mary
