Sara:  Enclosed are clean and marked copies of a revised schedule for
the proposed ISDA master agreement between Enron and FP&L.  I have
only reviewed and commented at this time on the master agreement's
schedule itself (I have left the credit support annex attached within
the same document, as you sent it, but have not yet reviewed or
commented on it, so ignore it for now).  I have reviewed many such
schedules and found your form to be quite good (as you may know, those
of some large market-makers are not so good, so please don't take this
as patronizing; it's a sincere compliment).  Hopefully you will find
the revisions equally acceptable.  I look forward to your comments or
approval.  Regards, -Serge
