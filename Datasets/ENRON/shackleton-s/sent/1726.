Here's my stab at the Product Long Description.



Sara - please review and offer your comments.

RAC - I need a Sigma Factor, please.

William - I have built a test Product in the Product Manager and it appears 
to have worked okay. I have asked David Forster to review the description as 
well as the attributes that I built in TEST. I will begin to build this in 
Production once I have his and Sara's sign-off. David will also be checking 
on the issue that I mentioned to you about the number of characters that can 
be put in the Volume and Price feilds in the Stack Manager. This is the one 
thing that could really hold up the process, so we may want to think about 
alternatives (such as trading in 10,000 increments - so that 5 means 50,000; 
50 means 500,000; etc) 

Jennifer Denney will be contacting Clara Carrington to talk to her about how 
Clara will see trades come over in the EOL Bridge Monitor.

Things are progessing relatively well so far, with the exception of the issue 
of the character limitation.

Dale
