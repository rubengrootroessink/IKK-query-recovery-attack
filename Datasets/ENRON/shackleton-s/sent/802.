Nancy: I just spoke to Rick and he confirmed that EPCA is the company that 
needs the brokerage account. I also just learned from Kishkill that we would 
like to start trading as early as Friday, if possible. We would appreciate if 
you could help us speed up the process. Please let me know if you need any 
further information. Thanks.

Subject: Brokerage Account/CIESA Transaction

Please let me know which company needs to open a brokerage account in 
connection with the CIESA transaction.  Once you tell me which company it 
should be, we can start the corporate authorization process and I will 
coordinate with Marie Heard of ENA concerning other information she'll need 
in connection with opening the account.

Please bear in mind that it will take some time (I'm not certain exactly how 
long--I will find out) to get all of the proper authorizations and other 
paper work into place, once you have decided on the company.  

Nancy
