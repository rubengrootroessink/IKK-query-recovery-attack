Mary/Cheryl:

Carol has seven (7) master swap agreements to be reassigned.  Cheryl and I 
will work on these together.  All appear on the legal/credit list.

(1)  Cross Timbers Oil Company
(2)  Camden Property Trust
(3)  Clorox Company (The)
(4)  Montana Power Comopany (The)
(5)  Ocean Energy, Inc.
(6)  Quebecor World USA, Inc.
(7)  Russel Metals Inc.

Mary:  Would you please reassign paralegals to Cross Timbers and Quebecor?  
These were handled by Samantha.  Maybe Marie could assist; these don't appear 
to be urgent.

Thanks.
