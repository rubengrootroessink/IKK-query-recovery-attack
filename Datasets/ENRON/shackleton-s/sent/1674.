Dear Dan:  Sorry not to send the check last week as promised.  It seems that 
my mom landed in a hospital in England and I had to dash out of town.  Now, 
eight days later, I am just catching up.  Tomorrow (July 19) I will send the 
check to you by Federal Express for Friday delivery together with my request 
for a response from you to the "birthday boy".  I did receive your newsletter 
- thanks very much.  Regards.  Sara
