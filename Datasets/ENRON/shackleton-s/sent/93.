I will have the letter executed.  I changed references in third to last 
paragraph to read "ECT" rather than "Enron" and replaced Bill Coffman's name 
wtih Robert Loughran, ext. 142.  Do you assume responsibility to transmitting 
to Canadian immigration or do we?  Please explain the process.  Thanks.  Sara
