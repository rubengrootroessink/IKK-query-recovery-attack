Yair:

Tracy and I would like to discuss the "Transfer" issue with you tomorrow, if 
possible.  We think this should be a short discussion (maybe 10 minutes).  
How is 1 pm NY time, tomorrow Wednesday April 25?  This seems to be the most 
convenient for both of us, but we will entertain times before 3 pm NY time. 

Would you please email your response?

Thanks.
