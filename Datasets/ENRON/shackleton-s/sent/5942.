Teresa:

Your emails have not gone unheeded!  We were facilitating things for Richard 
and he needs to let us know his slate for the U.S. segment of the London 
business.  We'll wait to hear from Richard.  If you have any questions please 
give me a call.

Thanks.

Cheryl:  Where do we stand on the ECT Credit Inc. three (3) accounts?  

Richard:  Do you have the proposed U.S. slate for Teresa?  We do not know who 
you want as officers/directors.

Please let me know if this request should be directed to someone else's 
attention or if documents have already been prepared regarding changes that 
Mr. Sage requested.  Thanks for your help with this matter. Teresa

Importance: High

Richard Sage has asked us to change the slate of directors and officers of 
this entity to U.S. people, with the exception that perhaps Richard Sage will 
retain an officer title.   Will you please provide to me a list of who the 
directors will be and who the officers will be and their respective titles.  
My understanding is that these elections should take place effective March 5, 
2001.  Please advise or if you would like to discuss please call me at 
X58444.  Thanks for your assistance.  Teresa

Teresa,

Both Richard and Bryan signed the letters on 5th March.   If you need any 
other information regarding these then your best bet would be to contact 
Simon Pook.

All,
So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of 
steps of which I am aware.
I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in
etc

Thanks,
Richard
