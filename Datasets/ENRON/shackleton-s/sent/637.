I've been thinking about your query and in the interim, I find that David is 
very conscientious and does not let outstanding issues linger. He also seems 
quite eager to learn.   As I continue to work with him, I am glad to keep you 
updated if you remind me periodically.  Sara

Just wanted to drop you a note to see if you feel like David Dupre is working 
out.  With Dale moving over to EOL I am trying to make an accessment of how 
things are going in general and I know David has been working with you on 
some Financial Power Confirmations.

Thanks,
Jeff
