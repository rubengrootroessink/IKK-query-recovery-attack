The JV between ENA (or some Enron sub) and Peoples Energy Corporation is 
called Enovate.  I was on a conference call this afternoon with  Greg Penman, 
Molly Harris, Stacy Dickson and Kay Mann.  The issues is WHO will negotiate 
ISDA's ffor the JV (and negotiate the basic ISDA between Peoples and the 
JV).  You will recall that Haedicke did not want us to negotiate on behalf fo 
Bridgeline.  Kay is meeting with Mark in about an hour and will raise these 
issues.  SS
