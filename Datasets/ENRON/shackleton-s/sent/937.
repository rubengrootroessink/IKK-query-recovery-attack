Patricia:  I was wondering if you had an opportunity to speak with any 
persons associated with the Argentine Derivatives Association in connection 
with our discussion of last week.  I can't recall if you were going to try to 
speak with the lawyers for Citibank and/or Morgan to determine whether the 
ADA might welcome our participation in the association, and specifically, 
with respect to the template currently in circulation.  I think you were also 
going to attempt to locate a current membership list for the association.  
Please advise when you have further information.

I am trying to plan several trips to Argentina and Brazil.  I am considering 
a trip to BA during the week of February 28.  Will you be in town that week?  
During my visit, my tax colleague from Houston and I will try to meet with 
local tax consultants and organizations lobbying for tax reformation.  
Regards.  Sara
