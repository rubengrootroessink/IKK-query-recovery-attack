Derek:

I'm on the phone.  Is this agreement for Enron Credit Inc. or Enron Credit 
Limited?  I only represent the former.  Dennis represents the latter.

Sara,
I left u a voice mail and email 2 weeks ago regarding the status of the 
Goldman docs.
I haven't seen a reply from you but as I remember from speaking to you last 
time, the ball is esssentially in our court.
Can u tell me what is up?   In the meantime I can't do any US$ credit biz 
with GS and it is a MAJOR problem.

regards,
Derek
