Stephanie:

Can we get the SITA blackline out today?  We should put ENE guaranty in line 
for execution and let's push Clem for Friday at the latest.

Also, Matt Dawson has requested copy of latest docs AND he cannot locate the 
executed P/A.  I think you should try tax.

Let me know if you need my help.

Sara
