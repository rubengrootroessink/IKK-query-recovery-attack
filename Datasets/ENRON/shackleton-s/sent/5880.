Sheila:  Thanks for the message.  I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted 
me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you 
know that he was apologetic for having not having "better rates" to charge 
ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to 
reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might 
want to have this bit of information.  Regards.  Sara

Theresa and Greg,
The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive 
(acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16 
using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
On the debit side it is competitive.  
Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go 
ahead unless anyone can see an objection.
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila,
 Below is the information I received from Joe Hunter's group regarding 
funding rates for some of the exchange brokers.  For comparison JP Morgan's 
Futures funding rates are:

  Credit rate     Debit rate
US Dollars 90 day US TBill auction rate less 0.25%  JP Morgan Overnight 
Borrowing Rate plus 0.25 %
