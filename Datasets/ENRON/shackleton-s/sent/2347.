Leslie:  Per our conversation, you mentioned that you had comments to the 
form of assignment to be executed by you, Lehman and Enron North America 
Corp..  Would you please provide me with your comments so that I  can forward 
the same to Lehman?  I know that the Merrill name needs to be corrected.  
Thanks.  Sara
