Sara:

I attach a clean copy of the nondisclosure agreement, which I have dated as
of today.  As we discussed, if you fax a signed copy of the agreement to me
tomorrow, I'll have it signed on behalf of Bertelsmann and fax it back to
you.  We will then exchange originals by mail.  It has been a pleasure
working with you on this.

Regards,
Jackie
