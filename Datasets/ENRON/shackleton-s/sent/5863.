Justin:  I haven't heard from you in some time now.  How is everything?  Are 
you going to be in San Antonio?

I wanted to set up a short call to discuss equity trading and what Houston 
and London can do (are doing?) to stay abreast of activity and developments 
on the trading desks.  Please let me know a convenient time for you.

Thanks.
