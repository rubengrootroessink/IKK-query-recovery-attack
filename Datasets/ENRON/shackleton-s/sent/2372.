Treasa:

Do you have a deal diagram?  Is there a commodity swap between ENA and 
Morgan?  
The TD/ENA commodity swap has language regarding "loan repayment" and the 
"fee".  Has Matt seen this?  Shouldn't this be in a separate document?  Also, 
I'm not sure what TD is tyring to net (quarterly payments under the swap with 
other payments due on the same day in the same currency under the Master?).  
Do want TD to be the Calc. Agent for the commodity swap and the rate swap?  
Are you satisfied wtih the Disruption Fallback (which is the same as the 
Master but for the reduction in  Postponement from 5 to 3 days).
I am trying to speak with Rod.

Sara
