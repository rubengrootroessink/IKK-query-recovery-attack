No, not at this time, let me get the guaranty information finalized first, 
this way we eliminate any further confusion.

Thanks

By the way, do we have our legal meeting today??

Should we send out a new draft without changing the guaranty language from 
the original draft?

Hello Sara,

I talked to Chuck Kaufmann in Cinergy's credit dept. concerning the ongoing 
issues.  Basically, he has agreed to the cross-default levels of 50/100 
million.  He is going to look further into the guaranty issue and get back to 
me on this. I will keep you updated.



Thanks
Russell
