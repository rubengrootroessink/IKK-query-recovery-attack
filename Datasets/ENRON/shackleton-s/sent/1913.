Sara,

We have about 4 new people in our mid marketing group, and I've been putting 
together meetings with Credit, Risk and the Back Office.
I think we're about ready for the Legal perspective and I would like to have 
maybe 30 minutes of your time next week if its possible.  


Regards,

Lucy

P.S.
Hope you're doing well.
