Jane - 

Attached is a worksheet in response to a request from  Australia New Zealand 
Bank for an ISDA and Enron Corp. guaranty covering FX trading.  The contact 
is Michael Midden, whose e-mail is below.  I said we would e-mail the draft 
documents to him for comments.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

John

John,

Australia New Zealand Bank has put in place FX limits for Enron North
America Inc.(on behalf of Enron Japan) of USD 2 million (R/13 months) and
the corresponding USD 27.5 million in settlement limits (R/3-day) (subject
the full guarantee of Enron Corporation). It would be greatly appreciated if
you could assist us in implementing a guarantee from Enron Corp. to support
these trading lines.

Regards,

Michael Midden
