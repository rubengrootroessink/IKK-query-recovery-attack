Please review the attached "paper & pulp" doc for accuracy.  I've already 
marked the doc for accuracy (as far as I can tell) but I don't know if the 
general statements are accurate.  Please coordinate through Tana Jones.  I do 
not know who wrote the document, but I presume it was someone in London.  Sara

Mark Taylor has asked me to forward the attached email to each of you.  Per 
Mark's direction and the email, we need to sign off, from a Legal (not 
business) perspective only, on the attached descriptions of the 12 product 
areas to be traded online.  So far we have only received 5 of the referenced 
12 descriptions.  I will forward the additional descriptions to the relevant 
Legal group when I receive them.  Per the attached email, Awais needs our 
Legal sign off by Friday.

I understand Alan may be out for the rest of the week so the attached 
descriptions on Coal, SO2 and NOX will need to be approved by someone else in 
his group.  I'm not sure who that would be.  Could you let me know?  Mark 
asked if Shari and Sara could sign off on the weather and pulp & paper 
description for our group.

Thanks for your help!

Tana,

I am afraid there is more than one description.  Some are quite lengthy,  US 
West Power (11 Pages) and US Natural Gas (5 pages).  There is a quite urgent 
deadline to get these uploaded into the web pages and then integrated into 
the site by the end of this week.  So any comments you can provide ASAP would 
be much appreciated.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to phone, or email me.  Tel 
no: 44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Awais

Steven & Carol,

I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
will be trading on the system to give users some general information.

I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.

In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
below.

Canada Gas
LPG
NOx Emissions
Oil & Oil products
Plastics and Petrochemicals
Pulp & Paper
SO2 Emissions
US Coal
US Natural Gas
US East Power
US West Power
Weather Derivatives

I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  

Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
tomorrow.



If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Awais
