Subject: Comments

Here is a blacklined copy of my initial comments.  I did not realize until I 
printed my comments that I went a little overboard and made so many 
non-substantive changes.  Please feel free to disregard all meaningless 
changes and let me know if you have questions or comments on my other 
suggestions.  Thanks.
