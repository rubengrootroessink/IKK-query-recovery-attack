Sara,
 I received a confidentiality agreement from Wiser Oil that we need to sign 
in order to get a copy of their reserve report to use to establish a credit 
line for some financial hedges.  I have the fax from Wiser and Fred Lagrasta 
told me to get you to look at it and sign it, so we can get this process 
going.  Let me know what you think and I will send it up to you.  Thanks
