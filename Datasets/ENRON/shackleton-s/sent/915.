1.  Friday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               -218.42     -2.05%   10425.21

The markets ended a volatile week with an afternoon sell off due
to some inflationary economic news and a weak tech sector led
downward by shares of software giant Microsoft Corp.
(Nasdaq:MSFT).  Meanwhile, traders shrugged off news of an
explosion that occurred early this morning only a few blocks from
the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors absorbed some mixed economic data that renewed fears
that the Fed may raise interest rates at its next meeting as a
means of combating inflation.  The Commerce Department revised
upward its U.S. retail sales figures for December, saying retail
sales rose 1.7%, significantly greater than the previously
announced 1.2% increase.  This inflationary news was tempered
somewhat by the Commerce Department's report that retail sales
increased only 0.3% in January, which is lower than the 0.6% gain
expected by economists.  Nonetheless, investors were concerned
because when the Fed raised interest rates at its last meeting,
the members of the FOMC, the Fed's interest rate policy
committee, indicated that they would consider acting again if
inflation pressure continued.

Retail stocks were mixed on the day, with Wal-Mart Stores
(NYSE:WMT) off 13/16 (-1.43%) to 56 3/16, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) up
1/2 (+0.84%) to 60 1/16, JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) down 1/4 (-1.40%)
to 17 5/8, Staples (Nasdaq:SPLS) edging up 1/4 (+0.90%) to 28
1/16, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Nasdaq:COST) declining 7/16 (-
0.84%) to 51 11/16.

Dell Computer (Nasdaq:DELL) shares slipped 4.95% (down 1 59/64)
to 36 7/8 after the computer maker announced quarterly earnings
late Thursday.  Profits came in at 16 cents per share, beating
revised downward Wall Street estimates of 15 cents per share.
Dell's revenues grew at 31%, which is a slower pace than in
previous periods due to chip supply problems and sales slowdowns
due to Year 2000 concerns of buyers.  Shares of other computer
makers ended with mixed results, with Compaq Computer (NYSE:CPQ)
up 5/8 (+2.50%) to 25 5/8, Apple Computer (Nasdaq:AAPL) down 4
3/4 (-4.19%) to 108 3/4, and Gateway (NYSE:GTW) lower by 2 3/8 (-
4.08%) to 55 7/8.

Despite Dell's strong showing, the tech sector led today's market
decline.  Microsoft Corp. shares were a catalyst for the sell
off, dropping 6 1/16 (-5.72%) to 99 15/16 after a study from
technology consulting firm Gartner Group raised questions about
the compatibility of the soon-to-be-launched Microsoft 2000 with
existing software programs.  Microsoft shares were also hurt by
comments from Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Computer (see above),
suggesting that the Linux operating system, which competes with
Microsoft Windows, was gaining popularity and that business
customers were not showing extraordinary demand for upgrading
hardware systems for Windows 2000.

Other tech sector losers today included International Business
Machines (NYSE:IBM), down 3 13/16 (-3.20%) to 115 5/16, Hewlett-
Packard (NYSE:HWP), down 4 5/8 (-3.67%) to 121 3/8, Motorola
(NYSE:MOT), down 4 1/32 (-2.60%) to 151 1/4, and America Online
(NYSE:AOL), down 1 11/16 (-2.90%) to 56 9/16.

In other large cap news, Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) shares edged
lower by 3/16 (-0.18%) to 105 3/4 after the company announced
that its Chairman, Frank Popoff, will retire in November after he
turns 65 and will be succeeded by William Stavropoulos, who
currently serves as President and CEO of the chemical company.

The Internet sector had another break today from the recent spate
of site outages from online hackers.  As the FBI's criminal
investigation continues, the White House said today that
President Clinton will meet with senior government officials and
Internet business leaders to discuss the attacks and online
security issues.  A host of leading Web sites -- including those
of Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO), Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN), eBay
(Nasdaq:EBAY), Buy.com (Nasdaq:BUYX), and CNN, a division of Time
Warner (NYSE:TWX) -=0F- were the targets of the attacks this week.

Competition in the chip sector heated up today after Advanced Micro
Devices (NYSE:AMD) launched a new and faster chip, an 850MHz version of
its AMD Athlon processor, in a challenge to Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC),
the world's leading semiconductor company.  AMD shares were also
impacted after the company's Chairman, W.J. Sanders III, said at a tech
conference that AMD expects its first quarter sales to be consistent
with or slightly higher than those in the seasonally strong fourth
quarter.  AMD shares ended higher by 2 1/2 (+5.88%) to 45 and Intel
shares were off 1 3/4 (-1.63%) to 105 7/8, while Applied Materials
(Nasdaq:AMAT) shares sank 9 3/4 (-5.58%) to 165, Micron Technology
(NYSE:MU) shares were off 1 1/4 (-1.73%) to 71 1/8, Altera
(Nasdaq:ALTR) shares dropped 2 15/16 (-3.85%) to 73 5/16, and Novellus
Systems (Nasdaq:NVLS) shares declined 9.21% (down 5 1/2) to 54 1/4.

Knight/Trimark Group (Nasdaq:NITE) announced that it acquired the
institutional stock business from troubled New York investment
firm D.E. Shaw & Co.  Knight/Trimark said the move is aimed at
growing its business with large institutional investors.  Shares
of the #1 market maker on the Nasdaq stock market fell 3/8 (-
1.14%) to 32 7/16.  Other stocks in the e-finance sector ended
mixed, with Schwab (NYSE:SCH) up 1/2 (+1.30%) to 39, Ameritrade
(Nasdaq:AMTD) down 1/4 (-1.55%) to 15 7/8, DLJ Direct (NYSE:DIR)
jumping 9.32% (up 15/16) to 11, and TD Waterhouse Group
(NYSE:TWE) rising 11/16 (+4.58%) to 15 11/16.

Several stocks in the networking sector succumbed to profit
taking today after the sector received a boost from Cisco
Systems' (Nasdaq:CSCO) earlier this week of better than expected
quarterly earnings and a 2-for-1 stock split.  Today, Cisco
shares gave back 5 (-3.68%) to 130 15/16, while certain other
networking stocks followed suit, including Redback (Nasdaq:RBAK),
down 7 1/2 (-3.36%) to 215 1/2, Nortel Networks (NYSE:NT), down 4
137/256 (-3.69%) to 118 55/256, RealNetworks (Nasdaq:RNWK), down
9 3/8 (-5.02%) to 177 1/2.   Two exceptions were Foundry Networks
(Nasdaq:FDRY), up 1 5/16 (+1.06%) to 124 13/16, and Juniper
Networks (Nasdaq:JNPR), up 7 3/8 (+3.54%) to 215 7/8.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors included:

<> Winstar Communications (Nasdaq:WCII), down 5 (-5.97%) to 78
3/4 despite its announcement yesterday of a lower than expected
quarterly loss of $3.28 a share, compared to analyst estimates of
a $3.38 a share loss.

<> Cognizant Technology Solutions (Nasdaq:CTSH), jumping 6 1/4
(+5.05%) to 130 after the software services company announced a
2-for-1 stock split.

<> Policy Management Systems (NYSE:PMS), falling 39.53% (down 6
1/4) to 9 9/16 on analyst concerns regarding the company's
financial results.

<> SunGuarda Data Systems (NYSE:SDS), rising 16.23% (up 4 5/8) to
33 1/8 after the computer service and application software
company reported better than expected earnings and was upgraded
by Robertson Stephens to a strong buy rating from buy.

<> Infosys Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq:INFY), bolting 26.79% (up
141 9/16) to 670 1/16 on no apparent news concerning the Indian
software firm.

6. IPO Commentary

IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF=3D"http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo">AOL users click
here.</A>

The IPO market continues to stand out as an oasis for investors
amid declines in major market indices, even in the tech-heavy
Nasdaq.  Several companies made their public debut and any
worries that investor enthusiasm for IPOs has dried up quickly
evaporated.  Leading the way was webMethods Inc. (Nasdaq:WEBM), a
provider of business-to-business (B2B) services for the e-
commerce sector, whose shares soared 507.50%.  Another strong
performer today was Internet services company Lante Corp.
(Nasdaq:LNTE), which bolted 174.69% on its debut.

One notable exception to the IPO frenzy was Pets.com
(Nasdaq:IPET), which closed unchanged at its offer price of 11 on
the day.  The disappointing performance of Pets.com reinforces
that a company's brand name is less important to investors than
the growth opportunities of the market in which the company
operates.  That is why we continue to see unknown names in the
B2B sector, like webMethods, soar while prominent companies in
slower growth industries, like Pets.com, stagnate.
