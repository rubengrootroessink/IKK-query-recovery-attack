All:  (1)  Please provide the name of the Enron party to this agreement.  If 
it is the London credit group, we need to verify authority to execute.  I 
never heard back from Paul Simons.
(2)  What is the priority?  I think we are waiting to hear back from Mike 
because we have had a conversation with the BuySideDirect people and can give 
an additional explanation.
