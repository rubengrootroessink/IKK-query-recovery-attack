What person(s) in London prepares credit for the English and Singapore 
financial transactions?  At some point in the not so distant future, the 
Houson and London credit departments need to speak in order that each 
understands the "philosophy" behind credit analysis for the omnibus and 
master transactions.  I look forward to hearing from you.   Regards.  Sara

ps  Congrats on your promotion!  I didn't have a chance to speak with you 
after the offsite to shake your hand.  Hope you enjoyed your weekend in 
Houston.
