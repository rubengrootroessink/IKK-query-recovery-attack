Tanya:  Do we need to differentiate between the MAC as used in the CSA and in 
the Schedule (as an "Additional Event of Default") with respect to the 
disappearance of a credit rating from either S&P or Moody's (or both) based 
on your usage in power masters?  

I believe that we agreed that for purposes of the CSA (when S&P and Moody's 
are indicated on the credit worksheet), both ratings must disappear to 
trigger the MAC.

For purposes of an Additional Event of Default, should we just pose the 
question to credit?

It should say either; therefore, if one were to disappear, an Event of 
Default would occur.  This was the intent and is probably consistent with 
that in the Master Power agmt.

Ed:  For the Additional Event of Default (ratings trigger), do you intend the 
MAC to apply when only one or both credit ratings disappear?
