Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside 
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side 
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly 
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some of 
my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that 
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Yair:

Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of
3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  I
have tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 "swap side
letter agreement."  Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to
finalize by April 6.  Thanks.
