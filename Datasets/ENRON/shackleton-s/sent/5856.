Susan:  This may look confusing!  It contains all of our "choices" for 
preparing the documents.  See Part 2 (Tax Reps) and the end of the document 
which has our "choices" of tax forms.

I thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues, 
etc., why we need the tax reps, and what questions we could ask upfront about 
a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module.  We tend to not 
"think" and expect a party "fill in the blank" when we are preparing draft 
documents.
