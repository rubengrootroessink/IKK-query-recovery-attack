Hey, DUDE!  Have you forgotten to read your Lotus Notes today?  Looks like 
this one filtered through lots of people (since you left, multiple people 
fill your shoes).  And where did you hear it was nice over in Houston?  It's 
raining with a high of 54 F.  But it is supposed to reach mid-70's over the 
weekend.

I'll ask Susan B. to send you a copy.  Stay tuned for the mad cow email.

Hi Sara.  Who set the credit terms for this one?  Let me guess ... me.  I 
actually would like a copy for our files over here.

It's raining.  Again.  I hear Houston is nice.
