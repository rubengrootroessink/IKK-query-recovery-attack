As per our conversation, ECT is not to engage in business in the UK and, in 
this regard, is not to have business transacted by it or on its behalf 
anywhere except in the United States.  Accordingly, trades entered into by 
persons outside of the United States should not be confirmed as ECT trades.  
I hope all finds you well.  Best regards.
