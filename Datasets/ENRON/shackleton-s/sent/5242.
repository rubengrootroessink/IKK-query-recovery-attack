Sara:

Thank you for resending it.  After going through our files, I did see where
you had sent it last month, and we are currently working on it.
I am aware that we are about to finalize an ISDA with Enron North America,
but I wasn't sure if the provisions in the schedules would be the same given
that the ENE share transactions would be documented under the Enron Corp
ISDA.  I'm sure the provisions are similar and we will be able to fast track
the ENE Corp. document.  Our internal negotiator's e-mail is
vijay.suchdev@funb.com (who I believe has dealt with you in his former life
at Lehman Brothers)

Regards,

Terry Ganser
