Tanya:  Please see page 7 of the attachment (Par. 5, part C) regarding 
setoff.  ENA was about to have this agreement executed just as I received 
your email.  I'll call you after 5 pm.  We need to discuss today.  Thanks.

As requested, attached is the final Agreement which I believe reflects the
revisions we discussed this morning.  If this is acceptable, please have
the Agreement executed on behalf of Enron and return the necessary
counterparts to me for signature by Chase.  I will then return fully
executed copies to you.
