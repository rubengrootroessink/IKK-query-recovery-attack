I spoke briefly with Gary Perlmutter who now represents the parent Sempra 
Energy but who told me that restrictions on the regulated utility have been 
lifted by the CA PUC.  I will verify (or I'll give you his name, etc. and you 
can speak with him directly) when the SDG&E lawyer returns my call.  Thus I 
am not sure that your online efforts require limitation.  I will also inquire 
about SDG&E's online objectives.  SS
