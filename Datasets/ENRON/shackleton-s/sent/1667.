Sarah, 
The Financial trading group would like to enter into a a prime trading 
agreement with First Boston. They have an internet-based 
futures trading program which holds a certain amount of appeal for us and we 
would like to expedite the process of gaining access to this system. I wanted 
to let you know in advance and will forward the agreements as soon as I 
receive them.

Sincerely,
Darren
