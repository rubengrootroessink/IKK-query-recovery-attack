Rhett:

I am negotiating with First Union National Bank (Party B below).  Is the 
following rep OK?

"Party B is a national banking association organized under the laws of the 
United States of America and is treated as a corporation for United States 
tax purposes."

Why does the bank see the need for the latter clause?
