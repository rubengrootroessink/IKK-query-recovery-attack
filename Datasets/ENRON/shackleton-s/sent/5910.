Are you the "someone" who will prepare execution copies?  Strange.

Keith Marlow, our CFO,  has finished his review of the ISDA forms you guys 
sent to us. He is not certain we need it, but has no objection to executing 
it. We have no changes.  Please have someone prepare execution copies of the 
agreement and exhibits and send two sets over to us for signature by EECC. 

Thanks.
