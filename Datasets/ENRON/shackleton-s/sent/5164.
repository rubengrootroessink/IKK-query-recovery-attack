Sam:

Don't you have a new address by now?  I remember you said that you were 
moving into a plush high-rise overlooking the great southern city of Atlanta, 
home of the Peach Bowl!   Please email me and let me know.

A belated thanks for the birthday card.  I had a fabulous birthday in Napa 
Valley at Auberge d'Soleil with my little sister and friends.  We drank 
wonderful wines and dined in great restaurants - and had great weather.

Hope you're doing well.

Have you started any new business ventures?  Maybe taken Wendy's to Amelia 
Island Plantation?  Or better yet, purchased the water rights to Palm Springs?

I'm just hangin' in Houston, same old job, etc.  I joined my two friends 
Monty and Keith for our annual birthday celebration at Galatoire's about two 
weeks ago.  It's always great fun.   I think I get to plan a reunion of 
Gordon, Arata et al ex-pats.  There are about thirty of us scattered around 
the country.

My regards to Beverly and Helen.
