Scott:  I just wanted to let you know that I am working on a number of 
quarter-end deals and haven't heard from anyone today about the ESA swap for 
Raptor 2.  I WILL NOT BE IN THE OFFICE ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29.  However, I 
will identify a lawyer to assist on this transaction should the need arise.  
I'll be back in the office on Monday.  Sara
