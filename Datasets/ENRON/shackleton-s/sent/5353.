Sara,

I was interested in the 1991 and 1998 definitions because they referenced by 
name in the Rabo-RBC TRS Confirmation (Cerberus restructuring).  I didn't 
realize there was a newer version of the definitions.  Unless that 
Confirmation is scheduled to be modified to refer solely to the 2000 
definitions, I'd like to get a copy of all 3 if possible.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill:  Is there a reason why you don't want the ISDA 2000 Definitions/Annex A 
(which supercede the 1991 and 1998 Definitions)?  Sara

Sara,

Brent suggested you might have copies of the above-referenced documents that 
you could e-mail or interoffice to me (EB 1768).  If not, any suggestions 
regarding where I might get my hands on them?

Thanks,
Bill
