It may be the first email but I gave this to Sam at our legal/credit meeting 
last week.  She was going to wait for the meeting with Cassandra for approval 
and signature (which was postponed).  But we can't postpone responding to the 
request.  Sara

As a general proposition, I need to be advised of the activity on Gary's 
desk.  Please let me know if you have responded to Sheila.  I think the 
request is about two weeks old.  Sara

Sara and Samantha,
When will ECT Investments be signed so we can send an updated copy to our

Thanks. Sheila
