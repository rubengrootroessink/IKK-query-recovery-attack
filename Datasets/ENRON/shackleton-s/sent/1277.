Subject: ISDA - Capex

Sara/Rod, I have received the ISDA for Capex that Susan sent me. I would like 
to set a conference with both of you to understand the content of it, as we 
intend to meet the CP this friday to discuss the Master Agreement and other 
things.
What time is best for you tomorrow?

Regards, Julian
