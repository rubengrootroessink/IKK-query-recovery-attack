Instruction letter from ECIC to ECT Investments is waiting on  Mike Deville 
to fill in minimum trade price.I owe Donna documentation of necessary 
internal releases.  Donna--will you authorize on a verbal release and we can 
do paperwork later this week?  We are only anticipating selling the 2.3 
million, the remainder will be back in ECIC's name.
