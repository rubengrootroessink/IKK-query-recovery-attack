Tanya:

Enron Corp. has a 1/17/92 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange master wtih 
Paribas.  I will fax to you the letter which I received regarding the above 
merger.  Basically, Enron Corp.'s signature to this letter will indicate 
agreement to put all [existing, if any, and future] Transactions under this 
master but with all obligations becoming those of the surviving entity which 
is BNP and which changed its name to "BNP Paribas."

Do you have any credit issues?
