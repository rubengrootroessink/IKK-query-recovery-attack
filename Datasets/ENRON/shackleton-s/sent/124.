Subject: OPP confidentiality agreement

Sara, Janice:

I'm not sure which, if either, of you will work with us on this.  We are 
under a somewhat rigid timeline though.  OPP is flying up from Brazil on Mon 
July 12 to hopefully finalize overall agreement in principle on the 
"Contingent Buyer" transaction terms.  We'd like to finalize our response to 
a confidentiality agrement by Wed 7/7 and send back to OPP for signature.  
From what we see in the document looks like we need to:

work on the wording of the preamble
make "two-way" protecting our terms and conditions etc.
add agreement term
add "confidentiality" term
define "products"
require their signature

Comments???

Thanks,

Doug

P.S.  This transaction has about $5 million in value to Enron.  Thanks for 
your urgent attention.

Douglas,
Attached please find the confidentiality agreement that will cover
information received by Enron from OPP in connection with the proposed
transaction. Please review and then send to OPP. Please fax me a copy of the
signed confidentiality agreement as well so that I can send you all the
information that you requested regarding OPP.
