ED:

EWEB has requested a blackline of the ISDA and is ready to sign next week.  
Your MAC references the "Electric System" which is defined in the Bond 
Indenture which I sent to you earlier today.  It looks to me like the 
Electric System includes physical and intangible assets acquired by the Board 
as a separate utility system, including generating and transmission 
facilities and the Trojan Project (not sure what this is).  I've asked 
Stephanie to revise our docs to incorporate these definitions.  Please review 
the CSA when Stephanie sends it to you (and comment) and I can send first 
thing on Tuesday.  Thanks.  Sara

Stephanie:  Please send Ed a copy of the blacklined CSA when you are done.
