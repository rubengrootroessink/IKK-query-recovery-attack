We need to finalize.  Legal opinion needs to come from Mark Haedicke (my 
recollection is that he may not need the back up).  Have we requested the 
guaranty?  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

     Any progress on getting a guaranty, legal opinion and a corrected
certificate of the secretary for me?  I will forward the executed master to
you with my attached docs once I receive these docs from you.

Thanks
Chuck
