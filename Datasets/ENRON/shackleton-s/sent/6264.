URGENT!  Traders trying to trade.  What is the legal entity trying to do the 
swap?  What is the legal name of the parent?

Sara,

Attached are Welch's comments to the schedule and paragraph 13 proposed by
Enron.  I look forward to discussing the terms of these documents at your
earliest convenience.   The form of the Letter of Credit and the guaranty are
still under review by Welch's and MWE.

Thanks,
