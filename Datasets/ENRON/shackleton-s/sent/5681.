Mark:  

A few years ago we sought California legal advice for transacting with 
California cities.  We have an opinion from McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & 
Enersen. LLP dated 7/28/98.  

Should we update this opinion given the increased number of cities with whom 
we are sending draft ISDA's to?  If so, which law firm do you think we should 
hire?
