I am following up with MS but I haven't received your answer.  Will advise 
when I hear back.  SS

Do you have any reason to think that Morgan Stanley would not be willing to 
hold physical Millenium securities as part of their brokerage services they 
provide for trading in the Millenium stock or do you know if Enron actually 
prefers to hold physical securities in some particular place?

If MS can do it thats great.  Is there any problem per MS with the parent 
CayCo receiving the ADRs and holding them in its sub-account on behalf of 
PEP?  Perhaps Sara could inquire.  These are physical certifciates (if issued 
as restricted) so I don't know if the MS account is set up for physical 
custody or whether we need to prepare some additional documentation.

Regards,  Bruce

Subject: Millenium ADR(s)

BONY has asked us to send them a letter instructing them to issue the ADR(s) 
and specifying where and to whom to deliver the certificates.  I will prepare 
the instruction letter, but I am assuming that we want someone at Morgan 
Stanley to take actual possession of the certificates.  In any event, I need 
someone to tell me where the certificates should land and give me a physical 
address for  the certificates.
