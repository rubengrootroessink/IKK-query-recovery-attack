Thanks Jason,

How long has this request been in Clements hands, that group has a
tendency
to have a slow response time.  Is there no other way we can proceed with
execution of the document while we wait on the Guaranty?  Also, Midcoast
has been transacting at the parent level (Midcoast Energy Resources) and
these trades will need to be assigned to Midcoast Marketing under the
new
ISDA.  I think it would be a good idea to prepare assignment documents
as
well to have the trades moved. Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.
Russell

I'm waiting on Clement Abrams response to one comment on the Guaranty.
everything else is finalized.

Jason,

I talked to MidCoast today about their collateral threshold, we have
agreed
to give them a $2MM threshold, I cannot remember off hand what I gave
them
originally, but this is the new amount.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks
