Sara:

I'm not sure if maybe another version of the confirmation was inadvertently 
attached, but the attached version that I received is unchanged from the 
earlier version that was circulated on 9/27. Thanks.

Brent

Attached is a revision to the original swap confirmation.  I have tried to 
incorporate all of the concepts discussed yesterday.  Please send comments or 
call (X35620).  I will be out of town after noon on Thursday for an offsite.
