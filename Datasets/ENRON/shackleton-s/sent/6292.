Susan:

Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.

Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?

Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
be booked in ENA rather than RMT?

Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please 
verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms

Thanks..
