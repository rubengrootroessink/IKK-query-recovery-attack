Ms. Shackleton:

I did receive your note the other day, as well as a more recent phone call
from Mr. Brant Reeves.  I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.

As I explained to Ms. Heard a while back, I had placed this in the "going
nowhere" file, given all the work we had put in over here which had
apparently been rejected wholesale by Enron.  If you recall, we had sent
over our so-called "base form" to which Enron responded with a vast array of
comments.  Many of those were incorporated in a redraft, but that effort
went nowhere.

I'll be glad to exhume this file and see where we are, and what our
prospects are for making progress vis-.-vis the others we are working on
over here.

Mike
