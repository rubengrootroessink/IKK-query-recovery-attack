Hey, Jen:  I'm not going to email you to death like some people but I hear 
through the grapevine that you're having a blast and making tons of friends.  
I told your mom that she and I should rent a convertible, don our sunglasses 
and drive to Natchitoches to go shopping at the Walmart and take you to 
lunch.  She didn't think you would like the idea too much.  Hope you really 
are having a wonderful year, making lots of friends and stretching your brain 
power.  Love, Sas

P.S.  How did you make out in your investment class?
