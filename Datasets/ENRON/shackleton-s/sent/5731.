John:  I hope you are able to locate an executed ISDA Master Agreement 
between RMT and EECC inasmuch as neither our database nor files reflect one.  
, I've asked Susan Bailey to resend the draft Schedule.  In the event that we 
need to execute this Schedule, you should provide us with appropriate notice 
information. We can then prepare execution originals.

Let me know if you need further assistance.  Thanks.

Sara, our CFO remembers executing one of these some time ago, but we cannot 
locate the document yet. If we can't get our hands on it by next week, we 
will go ahead and do a new form. Please resend the electornic form of the 
ISDA master agreement. Your prior transmission seems to have been deleted in 
a clean-up of the e-mails over here.. Thanks
