I don't think Marie handled yet.  Please handle and advise Brent that you are 
the person working on Argentina.  Also, we can send the latest deal report 
which we should discuss briefly (and the new list of addressees).  Thanks.  
Sara

Marie;
Could you please email me the most recent form of ISDA Schedule (modified for 
Argentina) with Attachments that we could use as a sample document to hand to 
prospective counterparts here in Argentina.  We were sent one prior to the 
reorganisation and name change.  Thanks.  Please call if you need additional 
information. 

Brent
