(1)  I just received my copy of the Annex to the 2000 ISDA Definitions.  Have 
we previously distributed the "2000 ISDA Definitions" (consolidation of the 
1991, 1998 Supp. and certain other 1998 Euro Definitions)?

(2)  I have the blue file for Swiss Bank/ENE.  We need to change the label in 
conformity with our procedures for mergers.  Taffy, can you handle, please?
