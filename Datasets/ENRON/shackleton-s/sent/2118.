John:  Per our conversation, attached is the copy of the Duke confirm.  The 
Duke trader is John Miller (713/260-6541). 
I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on 
September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax 
lines were open.  Upon receipt, John Miller called our confirm desk alleging 
that he never did the deal (the EOL "back office user" shows that the trade 
WAS done).
Please let me know if you need legal assistance.
Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

The Duke trader that selected this deal is KRBARBER.  This is how the 
information shows up in the EOL server that I use.
