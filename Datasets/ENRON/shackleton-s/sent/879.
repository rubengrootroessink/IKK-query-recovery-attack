Just wondering if you had a chance to comment on the "advisory memo" to be 
sent to the Enron subs/affiliates regarding brokerage agreements.  I have no 
real deadlines, only a self-imposed deadline so that we can get this thing 
organized and running on a regular basis.  I would appreciate your input.  
I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 7&4; maybe we can chat early next week.  
Thanks.  Sara
