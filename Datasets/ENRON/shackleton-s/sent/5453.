The Half Day of Beauty spa arrangements have been confirmed.  As mentioned in 
my earlier e-mail, you will need to arrive at Tova's by 12:00 Noon on your 
scheduled day.  Please plan on leaving the office at 11:30 AM.  Arrangements 
will be made to have a temporary fill in at your desk for the afternoon.  
Tova's address is:  1409 South Post Oak Lane (next to the original Post Oak 
Grill).  You will receive lunch, manicure, pedicure, full body massage, and 
facial.  The gratuity has already been taken care of so you do not need to 
tip.  

You are scheduled as follows:

Suzanne Adams  Connie Castillo  Carolyn George  Sheri Cromwell
Kaye Ellis  Margaret Doucette  Linda Simmons
