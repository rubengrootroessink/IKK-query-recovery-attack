Looks like nothing was ever done on this so I've contacted Tracy Ngo to move 
on a credit worksheet and then we can turn out a draft ASAP.  Do I need to 
call Holli?  Do you recall whether you and I had further discussions on 
this?  Sara

Sara,
Holli Krebs has asked for an update on the EWEB ISDA process.  EWEB means 
Eugene Water and Electricity Board           and is a small Oregon muni.   
She was under the impression that we had already sent an ISDA to EWEB but,  
she just got a call from Jim Deisen (the guy you and I met with at that  
Portland law firm---remember about a year ago?)  and Jim asked if we could 
send over our ISDA and schedule.    So.......   if we have already started 
down the path with EWEB, the West Desk would appreciate it if you could 
please  put it on top of the pile and follow up with Dieson (503-224-3092) 
or, if we have done nothing,  could you please give him a call and get the 
ball rolling on an ISDA.  Thanks very much and let me know if I can help in 
any way.----cgy
