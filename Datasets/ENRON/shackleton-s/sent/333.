Our internal phone and voice mail system is all screwed up.  Is 3pm Houston 
(5pm BA) today too late for you to discuss omnibus?
I haven't heard a word from Richard.  Scott Neal left a message about the 
Friday letter.
Also, Bruce Harris called this morning about the issue of Elektro trading 
(Hickerson desk).  I am hoping that Antonio Felix can talk to me sometime on 
Wednesday.  He's then out for the rest of the week.  Coordination is getting 
complicated.  I'm supposed to get my visa today (so I can leave anytime).  
Talk to you soon.  SS

Sara, I can't get through to you on the phone.  I have tried two different 
ways.  I have not heard anything on Duke other than Richard has a draft 
response he is working on.  Call me when you want to discuss the omnibus.

(1)  I can confirm that the swap group has no financial (or physical) info on 
Bolivia.  You may want to check with Alan on the existence of any specific 
physical reviews on Bolivia. 

(2)  Do you have some time to discuss the omnibus confirm process?

(3)  Have you heard further of Duke?
