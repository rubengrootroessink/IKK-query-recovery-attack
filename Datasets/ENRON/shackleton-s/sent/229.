Paul was too nervous using the local firm of Tindall & Foster.  Kevin Zemp 
was recommended by our Calgary office.  Kevin refined the prior information 
and will "pre-clear" Paul with authorities for Paul's trip entering through 
Calgary around 8/24/99.  Do you have any comments to the new attachment?  SS
