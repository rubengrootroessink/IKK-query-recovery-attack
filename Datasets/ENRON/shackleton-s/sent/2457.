Randy/Sara,  

Please confirm if Enron can or cannot execute a financial swap with Aracruz 
Brazil.

Alternatively, we need input on Enron's ability to execute a financial swap 
for pulp with Aracruz's off-shore, Panamanian  subsidiary. 

We are trying to prep for a discussion scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday 
afternoon, Sao Paulo time (4 hours ahead of Houston). 

Thanks your help.
