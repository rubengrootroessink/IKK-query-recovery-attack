Sara-

This is a new deal that came up in Brazil, which I need to follow up on.  I 
just returned from vacation so, I haven't had the chance to get any details 
yet, but wanted to let you know about this transaction.

Regards,

Pat

Pat,

We have submitted a proposal to Petrobras as you will see in the termsheet 
attached.  We pay up-front R$1 million to them, and receive for 1 year (minus 
a certain amount of days) 6 MW per hour and sell them back up power, up to 10 
MW per hour, for a maximum of 37 days.  Please let us know if there is a lot 
to do to update the credit review for Petrobras.  We'll find out this week 
whether we have won this deal.  I'll keep you posted.

Feel free to call me if you have any further question.

Remi
