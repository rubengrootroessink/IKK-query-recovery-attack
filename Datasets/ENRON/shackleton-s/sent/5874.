Susan:

I've spoken with a new Indian tribe and need to send the "sample governmental 
ISDA" to several people.  I"ll forward the names/addresses to you.  Stewart 
Rosman is the commercial person and he should be copied as well as Tracy 
Ngo.  Please include the following message (verify the question I left for 
you) with the attachment:

"Per our recent conversation, please find attached a sample Schedule to the 
ISDA Master Agreement (and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - 
Susan, can we send?) which is not tailored specifically for the Tribe.  We 
will be able to provide a specific Schedule and Paragraph 13 after our credit 
group has concluded its review.  You may already be familiar with the ISDA 
Municipal Counterparty Schedule and will note that although we are 
incorporating many of those provisions.  We assume that you have the ISDA 
boilerplate (for the Master Agreement and the Credit Support Annex).  

Please let us know if you have any questions."
