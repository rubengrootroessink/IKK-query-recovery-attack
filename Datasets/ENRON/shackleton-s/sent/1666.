Sara,

I have received an invoice from Tozzini re. Trades and spoke to Andrea 
Bertone who said that these services have been requested by you.

Can you please let me know your fax number so that I can fax it for your 
review/approval. Also let me know whether or not ESA will pay for that and 
where I should charge to.


thanks
Ana Cristina Santos
