NEXT TIME YOU THINK YOU=0F2RE HAVING A BAD DAY:

Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out section of
forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased
male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his
back, flippers, and facemask. A post-mortem revealed that the person
died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records
provided a positive identification.

Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver ended
up in the middle of a forest fire. It was revealed that on the day of
the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast some 20 miles
from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as
quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large
dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and then flown to the
forest fire and emptied.

You guessed it.

One minute the man was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next he
was doing the breaststroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air.
Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10" of the fire. Some days it just
doesn't pay to get out of bed.

This article was taken from the California Examiner, March 20, 1998.


STILL THINK YOU=0F2RE HAVING A BAD DAY?

A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the
kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it
accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the
handlebars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the
motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. The wife, hearing the
crash, ran into the dining room and found her husband lying on the
floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next to him, and the
shattered patio door!

She ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance. Because they lived on a
fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of stairs to
the street to escort the paramedics to her husband.

After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital, the
wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Since gas was
spilled on the floor, the wife got bunch of napkins, blotted up most of
the gasoline, and threw the napkins in the toilet. The man was treated
and released to come home.

Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage
done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom, sat
down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the
cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while
seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and
her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband
lying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was
suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin.

The wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same
paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The
paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began carrying him
to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street
accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the
husband had burned himself.

She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them
slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down
the remaining stairs and broke his arm.

STILL HAVING A BAD DAY? Just remember, it could be worse.....

1. The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska was $80,000! At a special ceremony, two of the most
expensively saved animals were released back into the wild amid cheers
and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer
whale ate them both.

2. A psychology student in New York rented out her spare room to a
carpenter in order to nag him constantly and study his reactions. After
weeks of needling, he snapped and beat her with an axe leaving her brain
damaged.

3. A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking
frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards
the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current
she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, breaking
his arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening
to his new Walkman.

4. Two animal rights protesters were protesting at the cruelty of
sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn Germany. Suddenly the pigs, all
two thousand of them, escaped through a broken fence and stampeded,
trampling the two hapless protesters to death.

AND FINALLY.......

5. Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn't pay enough postage on a letter
bomb. It came back with "return to sender" stamped on it. Having
forgotten it was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.

YOUR DAY'S NOT SO BAD, IS IT?
