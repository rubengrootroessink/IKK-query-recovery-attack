Sara,

Michael Moulton did a two year trade with SITA that we need to document under 
a Deemed ISDA.  It is possible that they will end up wanting to use a 
different entity and provide a guaranty.  Please prepare the Deemed ISDA with 
the same credit terms as the original ISDA draft.  Let me know if you have 
questions.

Thanks,
Tanya
