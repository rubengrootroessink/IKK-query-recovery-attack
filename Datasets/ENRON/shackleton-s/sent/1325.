Susan:  Attached are the electronic agreements for ENA trading with Goldman.  
Not much to do here because we'll need only  a signature (get Gary Hickerson 
to sign).  I have two changes to the Client Access Agreement which I will 
give you to add.  We do not need certificates or our typical authorized 
trader list to send back.  However, we will have to authorize password 
applicants on Goldman's form.  How does EOL keep track of this?  We will have 
to track because Harry Arora will be the password applicant (there may be 
more) and I think he's still ENA.  I know that we will want to receive the 
password very soon.  Thanks.  Sara
