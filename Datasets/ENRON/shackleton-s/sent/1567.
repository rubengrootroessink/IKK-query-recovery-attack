Bob:  Hope all is well.  Per my voice mail, attached is the confirm.  I'm 
trying to refresh my knowledge of equity derivatives and securities issues 
(for ENE).  You can reach me at 713/853-5620.  Let me know what your schedule 
looks like.   It's looking like a wave of equity deals is coming my way.  
Thanks.  Sara
