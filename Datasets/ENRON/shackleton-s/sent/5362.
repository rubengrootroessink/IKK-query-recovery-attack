Since your plan is to assume the existing hedges, you need to determine from 
Sara Shakleton, our legal advisor, the issues related to assignability. Also, 
you should reduce the amount of CAD that you need to hedge by assigning the 
existing hedges. 

Sara: What should we do if there is a position with a bank in which we do not 
deal with or have agreements with?

Stuart:

Would it be possible for you to send us a tradeable forward curve (we need to 
use it for our base case and run sensitivities from there)?

Also here are some answers to  the questions you asked earlier this morning. 



1) Will the asset be in a mark-to-market book? If so, will you need 
mark-to-market accounting for this hedge? 
Answer:  We will plan to review with Kent Castleman
 
2) Under what entity name will the hedge be executed?
Answer:  Not yet determined

3) What will be done with the existing hedges that the entity currently has 
in place? Will they be assigned to Enron? Liquidated?
Answer:  Yes, we plan to assume the existing hedges on the date of purchase



Thanks a lot. 

Fati and Carlos
