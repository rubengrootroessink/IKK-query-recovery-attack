I received a call again from Gary Ordway.  Who will be preparing credit?  
Gary asked that his credit person be copied and his name is John Fryer. 
Thanks.  Sara

All:  I received a request from PPM to send our form of ISDA to document 
trading.  We previously sent a draft to these guys on 1/13/99.  The only 
difference is that they now want to trade and the Scottish Power acquisition 
is done.  The contact is:
