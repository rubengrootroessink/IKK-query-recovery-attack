		 Subject: Foreign Listed Equity Options - GS update

I spoke with Kara Saxon and Margo Topman, Goldman Sachs Legal, 212-902-9982.
Per our conversation ....

Foreign Listed Equity Options are considered Unseasoned securities because 
they are issued on the date purchased and not widely held (from U.S. point of 
view).    GS has reviewed our ability to trade Foreign Listed Equity Options  
vis-a-vis REG S.  Goldman says that we can execute from our London Office 
(not from States) Foreign Listed Equity Options.  We can settle and hold with 
our current account, documentation  and legal structure with Goldman Sachs.   

Margo said that there is some risk but they do not think it is large.  She 
suggested we do a follow-up with our Securities counsel.  
Sheila

Sara, 
Can we run this by someone?  Margo offered herself as a contact if we need 
more infomation.
Thanks. Sheila

Goldman Sachs has given us the go-ahead to do Foreign Listed Equity Options.  
Kara Saxon at Goldman called me today and will follow-up with an e-mail.  
Goldman Sachs legal has said that we can trade as we currently do as ECT 
Investments, Inc.  This includes the whole European market.  I asked her to 
check on Canadian and Australian.

I will forward Kara's e-mail tomorrow.
Sheila

Sheila-

I just left you a voicemail.  My 2 follow up questions on the European
listed options are:

What is the title of the person in London who would be making the
investment
decisions doe Enron?

Does Enron have any foreign subsidiaries?

Thanks,
Kara

You are interested in trading European listed options and not OTC Euro

Thanks,
