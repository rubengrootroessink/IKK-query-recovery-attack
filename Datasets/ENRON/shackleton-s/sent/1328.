Dear Ms Lavergne

Further to my email of 14 April 2000 attaching the first drafts of the 
Schedule and the CSA to the Agreement and the Parent Guaranty, I attach 
revised first drafts blacklined against the previous version to show changes.

These contain minor changes predominantly resulting from changing the Enron 
counterparty entity from Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. 
to ENA..

I look forward to hearing from  you.  If I am unavailable please contact my 
colleague, Deepak Sitlani who is also working on this matter (also on 
telephone number +44 20 7783 4539).

Kind regards
Michael Khajeh-Noori
