Paul:

I originally sent this request to Ed but I understand from Mike Curry that 
you handled credit for the physical agreements.  Would you please prepare a 
credit worksheet for this counterparty or direct the request to the 
appropriate person?  Thanks.

Ed:

Will you please prepare a credit worksheet for Frontera?  I don't know the 
complete name for this counterparty.

Thanks.

Sara-- Are you still the swaps lawyer to assist with this?  If not, would you 
pass it to the person who can help Mike Curry with this?  Thanks.
