Please review the attached confirmation letter.  In order to apply the 
system's automated signature for Dana Davis, I couldn't change that area of 
the letter, but all the other changes should be there.  I do not have any of 
the information called for in the "Payments to Counterpary" section.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you!
