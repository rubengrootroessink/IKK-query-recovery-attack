I will be coming into the office late tomorrow morning, I will be waiting for 
a second phone line to be installed.  I will be working on some weather deals 
from home.  I will be available at my home number if anyone needs to reach 
me.  My number is 281 866 8797, my cell number is 832 368 3286.  

I would like to take the following Wednesdays as vacation days if it does not 
cause a conflict in staffing:  September 27, October 11, October 25 and 
November 8.   I would also like to take December 27 through 29 as vacation 
days.  Please let me know if this will be problem.
