Monday, November 20, I have scheduled the following appointments:

Beginning at 4 pm:

Deb - facial, then massage

Sara- massage, then facial

Steve- massage, then !!!!!!!!!!!!

Villagio does not have reflexology.  I didn't know if Steve wanted a facial 
(but if he does, there is no one to do the facial at 5!)
Seriously, check their website for other services for Steve (and you).  I was 
only trying to time all of our services together, but that may not be 
entirely necessary.
I don't know what time dinner is on Monday but I'm assuming it is late enough 
to allow us to change clothes and shower (and wash hair if we feel like it).  
The spa has lot's of availability earler in the day and on Sunday.  So we can 
make changes.  This is particularly important since all changes must be made 
within 24 hours of the service or it gets charged to my credit card.  And I 
really hate unnecessary charges.

On a slightly different note, I am compiling places I'd like to visit since 
we have no itinerary.  Then we can have a tribal meeting to vote.  Big Tiger 
Feather has changed his plans to stay until Tuesday so we'll have two cars.

Bye now!  Love, Sas (the future Miss America over FFFFFFFFFFFFF)
