I was looking forward to seeing you tomorrow and hope that we can arrange 
something soon.  I'm not sure about my plans during the Thanksgiving holiday 
but I think I'll be spending most of it in Houston.  I am taking a long 
weekend (this weekend) in Napa with my sister, brother-in-law and Mike to 
celebrate my birthday so I'm anticipating somewhat of an eating 
exttavaganza.  Talk to you soon.  Sara
