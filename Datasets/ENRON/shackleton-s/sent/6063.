Dick:

I am suggesting a minor change to the "Power Risk Management Committee" 
certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit "A").  If we leave the 
reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm as 
Exhibit "A" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know if you 
are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend the 
certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the change, 
please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation labeled Exhibit 
"A" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Thanks, Sara.  No problem making the changes.

Attached are my comments to the certificates.  We will need to attach the
form of confirmation to be certain that each particular transaction is
authorized.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Attached are drafts of two certificates which I believe will satisfy you
needs.  Please get back to me with any comments.
