Dear Sara,

With respect to our recent exchange of voice-mail messages,
I await to receive from you at your earliest opportunity
a draft of the Amendment to the Credit Support Annex between
Enron North America Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated.

I have also been advised by our Credit Department that we are
to begin negotiations on an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron
North America Corp. and Cargill-Alliant, LLC.  We assume the
ISDA being amended above would serve as a basis for this new
Agreement.  Could you please advise if you will also be handling
negotiation of the Cargill-Alliant, LLC ISDA?

Regards,
Mara Alexander
