Mary:  Attached is a format that I used in 1999 to inquire about certain 
issues impacting financial trading with foreign counterparties.  I also have 
information about possible New Guinea counsel which I will clear with Derrick 
and Haedicke.  Our potential trading counterparty is a mining company called 
"OK Tedi".  Sara
