Brent:  Gabby Aguilar(?) from BA has requested Lynn for an "immediate white 
paper" addressing tax issues for physical (power, gas and I don't know what 
else) and financial trading in Argentina.  What phone call on Thursday were 
you referring to on your voice mail?  I'll try to call you in about an hour.  
Sara

I think we should meet and make sure the three of us are on the same page in 
terms of what our position is for this office.  Let me know what works for 
the two of you.  I do not know if Lynn is interested in the issues the 
commercial group has been raising lately other than his advice means that we 
cannot transact from Argentina.
Thanks
Brent

Dear Sara:

The people behind the Argentine Association of Derivatives are mainly the
big international banks.  I know them well.  The Firm has been invited to
join ADA but has not yet done so.  No specific reason.I knew that they were
working on a standard text but have not seen it.  I can easily obtain it
because the chairman of ADA is the Treasurer of Citibank and a good friend
of mine.  I worked extensively for a team that he led last year trying to
set up the legal framework of a futures and options markets.

As far as I know, they were focused on financial derivatives and not on
commodities but I can inquire.

ISDA can be used for international transactions but not for transactions
where both parties are domiciled in Argentina since in this case the
transaction cannot be subject to foreign law.

Let me try and investigate where they stand and I will give you a call.

Best regards and happy new year to you also.

Patricia
