Cheryl:  Sheila can print out a listing of instruments to be assigned to each 
new Enron Credit Inc. account.  The portfolio includes high-risk, high yield 
instruments.  We should contact the brokers today or tomorrow for the form of 
agreements.  Why don't you ask Stephanie or Sam to prepare three sets of 
assignments?  They should coordinate with Sheila to identify the attachment.

Cheryl:

Enron Credit Inc. , a  Delaware corporation, has been created for U.S. debt 
trading currently handled by ENA.   As a result, ENA will need to transfer 
its brokerage debt positions to Enron Credit Inc. accounts with those 
brokers.  The brokers include our favorites:

Bear Stearns Companies
Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co. 

ENA will need to assign its positions by the end of February, 2001.
Richard Sage (London office) will need to see the "sample package" (unanimous 
consent, authorized trader list).  Will you please see that an email is sent 
to Richard with this information?

We should begin the documentation now.  Let me know if you have any questions.
