Sara

In advance of your calling me later this afternoon, I set out below some 
thoughts the issues to be discussed:

1. Jurisdiction - under the English law Annex the preferable route is 
recourse to the courts - I can confirm that this is Enron London's policy.

2, Non-reliance:  From our telephone conversation yesterday, I understood 
that you said that the CP would be relying on us.  I believe that this should 
not be the case and the usual non-reliance provisions should apply.  If this 
is not the case, then

3. the additional para. (h) that you faxed me earlier today, I am informed, 
is unnecessary.  I also understand that the practical effect of those 
provisions might be to scare the CP.

Please call me so that we can discuss any of the above and/or to confirm that 
you are happy for the documents to go out to the CP.

Thanks
Michael
