Sara, long time no see.  I won't be over for this autumn's ECT conference but 
hope to be around next year.  

Please do me a favour and look through the doc attached below, which is 
governed by New York law (in particular the reps under Section 2(d) and the 
governing law language/jurisdiction language).  The contract gives rise to 
some issues (e.g. deficient default language), which I thought I could 
address myself.  The matter is somewhat urgent.  Tks.

Martin
