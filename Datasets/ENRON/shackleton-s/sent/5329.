Angela

Thank you very much for your message.  I am happy for you to prepare the
equity swap confirmation for Rabo's review.  I will review the document but
could you also copy in Mark Lauber and Christine Hogg.  I have copied them
on this mail, so you'll have their email addresses.  

Will you also be negotiating the ISDA?  If it is not you, could you let me
know who it will be.

Kind regards
