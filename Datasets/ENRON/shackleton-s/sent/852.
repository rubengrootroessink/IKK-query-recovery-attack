Subject: Moema PPA

Sara: As requested, attached is the English translation of the 10-year PPA 
that Enron Comercializadora entered into with Moema. The Agreement is signed, 
and Moema is supposed to start delivery in May 2000. However, performance by 
both parties is subject to Moema requesting and obtaining from ANEEL the 
status of independent producer. I don't know who else should get a copy of 
this agreement. I am assuming that credit has been already involved.
