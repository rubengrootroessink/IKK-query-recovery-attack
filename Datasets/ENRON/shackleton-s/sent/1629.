All:  Attached is a short recap of the items which I have been discussing 
with Clint and Jeff.  I'd like to get together sometime today or tomorrow.

Rex and Jim:  I will fax to you copies of the Enron Corp. resolutions (some 
final, some draft only) referenced in the attached summary.  I may not have 
the latest information and perhaps you can update and address when we meet.  
Please call me with a suggested time.  This afternoon is best for me.
