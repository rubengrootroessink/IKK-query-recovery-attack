Whichever Enron entity is the transacting entity needs an ISDA over the 
deals.  I don't know how Dependency Agency arrangements alter our 
documentation, but we should make certain we have collateral rights/credit in 
place whichever way we go.

Hi John,

I have followed up on this with Darren Delage and it seems that this is the 
situation: The trades with ANZ will be done by Enron Japan but only by virtue 
of "dependant agency" arrangements with ENA. (These arrangements are still 
being documented.)

I think this means that ENA and not Enron Japan will need to enter into 
agreements with ANZ.

I think Darren will follow up from his side but could you go back to Micheal 
on this.  

Jane

Jane - 

Attached is a worksheet in response to a request from  Australia New Zealand 
Bank for an ISDA and Enron Corp. guaranty covering FX trading.  The contact 
is Michael Midden, whose e-mail is below.  I said we would e-mail the draft 
documents to him for comments.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

John

John,

Australia New Zealand Bank has put in place FX limits for Enron North
America Inc.(on behalf of Enron Japan) of USD 2 million (R/13 months) and
the corresponding USD 27.5 million in settlement limits (R/3-day) (subject
the full guarantee of Enron Corporation). It would be greatly appreciated if
you could assist us in implementing a guarantee from Enron Corp. to support
these trading lines.

Regards,

Michael Midden
