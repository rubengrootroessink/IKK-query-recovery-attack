Sara,
As per our discussion last week, we have agreed upon all changes to the client

your business people.

Can you please provide me with a status update?
If you prefer, our salesperson is more than happy to discuss the issue with 
your
business people.
Please forward the appropriate contact name or number, or have then call 
Michael
Schneider directly at  (212) 648-1164.

Many thanks for your assistance with this matter.

Sara,
Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement
procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer
3
forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration
will be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne
