Tanya:

Once again, we need a master for Pushkar's FX trading.  The counterparty's 
name is:

ING Barings (U.S.) Capital Markets LLC

I am constantly receiving calls for this agreement.  Please asssign.  Thanks.

Don't know if I have the name spelled correctly but I received a call 
requesting an ISDA Master (for Pushkar Shahi) for trading rate/currency.  
Thanks.  Sara
