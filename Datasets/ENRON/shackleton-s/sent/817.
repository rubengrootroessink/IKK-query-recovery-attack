The purpose of the account is to buy 0.5% of TGS shares.  By buying those 
shares, Enron will be able to utilize NOLs that are currently trapped in 
CIESA, the parent company of TGS.  Jeff Kinneman's group will handle actual 
market execution.  Glenn, please forward to Ted and Sara a  copy of the 
signed DASH.

Regards,  Bruce

Sara,

Ted Murphy has executed the documents relating to the opening of a brokerage 
account for EPCA @ Morgan Stanley.  Ted has asked that you send him an e:mail 
message as to the purpose of the EPCA brokerage account.

Thanks.
