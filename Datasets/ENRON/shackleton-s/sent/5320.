Sara,  

I am sorry to be contacting you again today.  

I am trying to purchase a digital signiture licence for the eTrader system.  
It is required to enable us to distribute ActiveX components over the 
internet.  Can you please look at this link and select the "Enrol" button to 
view the form and let me know if your department has to get involved in this 
process.  The link is : http://digitalid.verisign.com/developer/ms_pick.htm

I have added below some further information sent to me

Regards,

Chris

Christopher,

Thank you for obtaining our Guide, "Realizing the Possibilities
of Internet Software Distribution," which we hope will serve as
a useful reference tool. In the Guide, you will learn how to:

* Digitally "shrink-wrap" your Microsoft Authenticode.
* Assure your customers that the code you're sending them is safe,
  authentic, and really comes from your organization.
* Protect your code from hackers or unintentional corruption
  during Internet delivery.
* Time stamp your code to ensure validity after certificate
  expiration--this feature is available only from VeriSign!

The Guide is located at:
http://www.verisign.com/developer/rsc/gd/authenticode/index.html

*******************************************************************
Get your Code Signing ID for Microsoft Authenticode right now,
go to http://digitalid.verisign.com/developer/ms_pick.htm
*******************************************************************

If you do not serve as your organization's security contact for
code distribution, please forward this message to that individual
so that he or she can also learn about the advantages of digitally
signing the software your company delivers over the Internet.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Mya Marshall
