It seems that Miriam Radach has been transferred to Sherman & Sterling's 
Washington D.C. office.  She is working with a NY associate named Jennifer 
Kumble.  The lawyers had a lot of issues to discuss with Tiger and should 
give us comments next week.  Have a nice holiday!  I'm going to Baton Rouge 
to watch the tigers (LSU!) play ball.  Sara
