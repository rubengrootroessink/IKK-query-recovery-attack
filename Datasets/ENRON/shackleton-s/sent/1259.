Carol:  I spoke with Richard Peterson (retail side).  Apparently we were 
dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.  We agreed to (1) 
mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been 
negotiated last year (with our form changes).  John Scales (exploration side) 
wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.  Do you want to handle?  Just 
let me know.  Sara
