I am forwarding a resume from an Enron Argentina legal candidate who is 
perhaps interested in ENA.

Sara;

I am forwarding to you a copy of Esteban Buljevich's resume for your review.  
We have interviewed Mr. Buljevich for our BA Office, but we would think that 
he would rather pursue an opportunity with Enron North America.  I would 
greatly appreciate it if you could forward Esteban's cv to the appropriate 
people within ECT and ENA.

Thanks,

Sami

Sami:

Thank you for your emails this morning.  Attached is a copy of Esteban
Buljevich's c.v. as you requested as well as a copy of his list of selected
transactions.

I am very pleased that you will be speaking to Randy about Pablo de Rosso.

Please let me know if John Novak requires my assistance in arranging to
speak with Joaquin Sales Saborit.

Regards,
Stanley Ross
