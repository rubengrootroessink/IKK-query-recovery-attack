Sara, here are the trader guidelines I developed for UK gas, UK power and 
Nordic power.  I assume you need both gas and power. These are to some extent 
country or market specific. As these guidelines need to be approved by 
Houston, I am copying this to Mark, Alan and Jeff. tks

Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines (physical and 
financial) for the London traders.  I am trying to develop similar guidelines 
for the Southern Cone regions (first Argentina) and thought your expertise 
would be very helpful.  Could you send me a set?  I'm leaving for Sao Paulo 
on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow.  Thank you for your help.  
Regards.  Sara
