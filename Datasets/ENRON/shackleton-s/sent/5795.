No, I would like to meet with you individually to discuss the 
unenforceability issues with respect to brokerage agreements.  Our 11 am will 
be short.  The afternoon meeting will be with Sam, Stephanie and the two of 
us.

Sara, my calendar says we have two brokerage meetings for tomorrow.  You and 
I may have set up one individual one and then apparently there is a team 
meeting.  I do not think we need to meet twice so maybe we should just all 
meet in the afternoon, right?
