Denis:

I spoke with Clem and forwarded the attached guaranty.  I didn't read the 
guaranty so I don't know if it was negotiated or standard.  You should 
contact Clem about the urgent nature of the request as I am not familiar with 
the details.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara - I would be very grateful if you could have the attached executed and 
faxed to Matt Flett at MS in London, with a copy to myself asap.

Many thanks for your assistance.

Matt and Denis:

I spoke with Matthew Flett about an hour ago and he advised that 
EnronCredit.com Limited had finalized its ISDA.  I requested a copy burt he 
has not yet sent it over.  Both ENE and ENA want to execute masters with MSCS 
and we would like to work from your document.

Can you email me a copy?

Thanks.  Sara
