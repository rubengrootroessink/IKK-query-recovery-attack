The following power point presentation graphically sets forth the steps 
necessary to integrate MG plc into Enron NetWorks L.P.  This presentation 
differs from that sent to several of you last week in that there are now 
dotted lines in red around those pieces of MG that are affected at each stage 
of the reorganization and solid red lines around the same pieces reflecting 
where they wind up at each such stage - hopefully a more friendly on the eyes 
presentation.  Please do not hesitate to call regarding any piece of the 
presentation.  My best to all.  Steve.
