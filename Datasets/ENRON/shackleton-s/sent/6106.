Paul:

Further to my earlier email:

Do you want to request the language which we have devised for (1) hedge fund 
monthly account statements and (2)  quarterly/annual engineering reserve 
reports?

Please call to discuss.  Caroline says she may be transacting today.

Paul:

  With respect to Valentis:

 (a)  Does the MAC apply to both S&P and Moody's?  (not clear from worksheet)
 (b)  Are the financial covenants Events of Default or Termination Events?  
(looks like these were Termination Events in AIG)
 (c)  Is this deal two-way margining?  You have set 0 Thresholds but 
indicated Return/Delivery for both parties.  Our discussion of last week may 
have changed (we discussed one-way margining for CP only).

I'll have the same questions for CD Holdings.
