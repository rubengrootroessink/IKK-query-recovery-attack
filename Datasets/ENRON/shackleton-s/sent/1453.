Rod:  Further to my recent memo, the Tokheim debt is being transferred to DLJ 
(and we owe Deutsche Bank for the unwind of the loan swap).  Sara

P.S.  Who will handle credit derivatives in your absence?

Rod:  attached is a recap of current credit derivatives trading in Jeff K.'s 
group.  I don't know about activity during Shari's oversight but I hear it 
was minimal.  How does this compare with Enron Credit.com?  Also, do we want 
agreements with other trading counterparties (e.g., DLJ Capital Funding, 
Inc.)?  Are Jeff and Paul calling credit before trading?  Please call to chat 
when you have a chance.  Thanks.  Sara
