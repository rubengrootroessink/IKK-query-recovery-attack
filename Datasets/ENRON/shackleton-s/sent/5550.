Dee:  I am trying to hear from credit on about four issues, namely, the legal 
entity, need for First Union Corp. guaranty (due to the availability of 
financials), haircut on bonds and Specified Conditions.  I would then propose 
preparation of a blackline to squeeze out the remaining issues.  If I hear 
from credit tomorrow (and I'm pushing), I could have the blackline by 
Wednesday and we could talk.  Hopefully, we'd be done by this week.  Hope 
this works.  Regards.
