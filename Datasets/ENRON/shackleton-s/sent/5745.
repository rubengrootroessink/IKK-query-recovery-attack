Dana:

I received your call.  I have not heard from credit.  There are two things 
that you can do in the meantime.

(1)  For online trading, please call Tana Jones at 713-853-3399

(2)  Please advise what physical and financial products you want to trade.  I 
believe that you didn't know when we last spoke.

Thanks.
