Hi, Kristina:

It was great speaking with you last night!  Hope your dad is home and doing 
well.

I have contacted two different offices within Enron.  The first is Human 
Resources in Houston.  I suggested to them that you might be a good candidate 
for the associate/analyst program but they may think of other positions as 
well.  I don't know how quickly that office might respond so let me know.  
The second "office" is directly to London.  There is a woman in London named 
Anna Jansson who is currently leading efforts for the associate/analyst 
program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  I have spoken with Anna and she has asked 
that you visit the website "www.enroncareers.com" and apply through the 
site.  She already knows your name and I am trying to fax your resume 
(business resume) to her as well.  When you visit the site, you may decide to 
use a different resume; just let me know.  Just in case you would like to 
call directly, Anna's number in London (dialed from the U.S.) is 
011-44-20-7783-5912.  The company directory shows her email address as 
"anna_jansson@enron.net" (which looks a little weird to me).

Please keep in touch and let me know if you receive responses (or don't hear 
back) so that I can follow up internally.  By the way, you have an impressive 
resume.

Please feel free to call me at anytime.  I hope we get to meet soon.
