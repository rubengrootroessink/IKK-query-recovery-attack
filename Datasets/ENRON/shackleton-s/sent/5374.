Bob:  

Thanks for the memo and we should discuss in a future meeting dedicated to 
form changes.

If we adopt the 2000 Definitions in our Schedule, we will also need to change 
the existing reference in Part 6(f)(iii) to "Negotiated Fallback" (to Section 
7.5(c)(iv))

Also, the term "Relevant Price" is used in the "Negotiated Fallback" 
definition. We should clarify whether we need to retain Part 6(f)(iv) of the 
Schedule when using "Negotiated Fallback" or whether we intend that "Fallback 
Reference Dealers" be an entirely separate and distinct fallback (i.e. the 
4th fallback in our Schedule).
