Thank you for the message!  Let's schedule the following:
(1)  Phone call on Thursday, Sept. 16 to discuss parameters for financial 
trading discussion.  I can call you at 1 pm (Houston time) which is 3 pm (Sao 
Paulo time).

(2)  Meeting in Enron's Sao Paulo office on Tuesday, Sept. 21 in the 
morning.  Anytime is convenient for me.  Do you have a preference?  How about 
9 am?

I will not need to call you today if we can schedule our conference call and 
meeting in Sao Paulo via e-mail.  Thank you for responding promptly.  
Regards.  Sara

Dear Sara:

We can meet either on the 21 or 22.  As to our prior telephone call, please 
be advised that I will be out of the office on Tuesday and Wednesday.  
Probably the best alternative is for you to call me on Thursday afternoon.

Best regards,

Antonio Felix

Greetings!  I hope that we can make certain plans to meet when I am in Sao 
Paulo
and to have a telephone conversation this week.

I will arrive in Sao Paulo on Sunday, Sept. 19.  Andrea Bertone and I will be
meeting with Jose Emilio on Monday, Sept. 20. regarding physical trading
matters.  Would you be able to meet with me at Enron's office on either 
Tuesday
or Wednesday, Sept. 21 (preferably) or Sept. 22 to discuss certain aspects of
financial trading?  I will be able to clarify the specific issues this week.  
I
would also like to schedule a telephone call this week, say Wednesday or
Thursday to discuss.  Please e-mail me as to whether we can meet in Sao Paulo.
I will try to call you today.  Let me know if you have a convenient time.

Sara
