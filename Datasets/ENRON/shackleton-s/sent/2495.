Jim:

I was hoping that we could speak sometime today as I will be out of the 
office Dec. 7 and 8.  I would like to discuss your comments the Schedule and 
receive your blackline to the Credit Support Annex.  I am available all day 
except between the hours of 10 am - 2 pm (Houston time).  I look forward to 
hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara
