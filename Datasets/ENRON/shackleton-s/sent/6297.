Cheryl:

Attached are Con Ed's documents.  We need to do an "ISDA comparison" and 
prepare a redline to submit to Con Ed.  Sam worked on the original ConEd 
draft, the latest dated 1/24/01.  The file should be in the file drawer.  We 
can talk about the comparison when we meet.  Thanks.

Hi Sara and Ed!
ConEd wants to get going on an ISDA , in parallel to adjusting as necessary 
the long form for the upcoming transaction.  They believe that the ISDA will 
not be negotiated in time for when they want to execute, thus the parallel 
documents.  
Regarding the annex, the uncoming deals could potentially be swaps, collars, 
or participating swaps.
I think they are quite eager to hear our response.
Thanks,
Janelle
