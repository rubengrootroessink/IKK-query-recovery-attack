Please assign.  This is an Annex A for a general corporate.  An Annex B 
should be attached.  Both Annexes should read SAMPLE or DRAFT with our 
exclusionary language.  Obviously the Annex B will not have anything on it 
other than reference to credit determination.  Please e-mail today to John 
Malowney.  Thanks.  SS  and call if you have questions.

Being that the potential counter party is Fred Meyer (AKA Kroger Co.) I would 
consider them a general corporate.  JOHN

Before I send the draft, please let me know the type of customer (general 
corporate, utility, municipal, etc.).  Thanks.  Sara

Sara, would you e-mail me a sample Master ISDA and "two page" confirmation 
that I can forward on to a customer in regards to a financial fixed for 
floating swap.  Thanks !!    JOHN
