Sara,
Paul Radous passed the Inland Paperboard ISDA over to me.  (Thanks, Paul!)  
Jim Crump forwarded me the 43 issues they had with the document.  Since I am 
not familar with where we are, I would like to get together to talk about 
their issues and decide how best to move forward.  Please let me know if you 
have some time to get together.
Thanks,
      Ken Curry
