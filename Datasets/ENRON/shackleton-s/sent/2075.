Bill:  The attached memo was distributed to legal last week.  We have had a 
number of questions arise on the power side lately regarding financial 
transactions (ranging from short term to quarterly) with governmentals.  As 
you will see in the memo, the risks are significant.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.  Sara
