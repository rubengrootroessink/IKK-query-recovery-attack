Sheila,

As requested by Lynsey Wenger, attached for your review and use is our
futures documentation (in pdf format).  Booklet I contains the actual
futures account agreement; Booklet II contains disclosures for your review
and retention.

I am providing you with the below checklist to facilitate your efforts in
gathering the appropriate supporting documentation to provide us when
opening a futures account.

  Supporting Documentation to be provided with fully executed
Futures Account Agreement

* IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable, must be fully
completed/executed..

* Documents that authorize the use of futures and establish the
client's existence:

    For the corporation, a certified resolution,
internal investment guidelines and/or operating agreement.

    For a pension - a trust agreement.

* Audited financials.

* Signature authority (generally in the form of a resolution).

Please call me at 212 902-0861 if you have any questions.
