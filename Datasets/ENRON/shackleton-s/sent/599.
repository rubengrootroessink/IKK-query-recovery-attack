Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It 
still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending 
their guaranty.  Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and 
ENA?  At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.
