Is that desk doing options (NOT SWAPTIONS!)?  Why are you asking?  There are 
many issues on the paper desk regarding options.  Sara

Hey Sara,

Would you please look over this omnibus option template that I took from TAGG 
and modify it as you see fit for the Paper World?

Many thanks,

Lucy

P.S.
This particular deal is for a paper DRAFT, but I thought  we should have the 
template in place anyway.  For future deals of course.
