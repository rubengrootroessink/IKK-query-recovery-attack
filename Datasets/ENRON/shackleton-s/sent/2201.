FYI - I spoke with Thomas Fay in NY about setting up Instinet in London.  I 
HAVE BOTH INSTINET FILES IN MY OFFICE.  Sam, I told Thomas that we do not 
need copies of any agreements.  You must have been looking for them while I 
was on vacation.  Remember, broker'futures agreements are in RED files to 
make them visible.  SS
