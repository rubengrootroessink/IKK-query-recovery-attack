How are we handling the "dual agreement" situation?  Have we spoken with 
credit?

There is an executed Assignment Agreement transfering CES's transactions with 
Bank of Montreal to ENA.  The CES Master Agreement was not terminated, but is 
inactive.

Re:  Bank of Montreal and ENA, have we terminated the CES agreement (and has 
credit agreed)?  I don't know how Susan F. "inactivated" the CES ISDA with 
BOM,  We are in the process of negotiating with BOM in connection with our 
Japanese affiliate.  Sara
