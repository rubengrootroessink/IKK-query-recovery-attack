McISDA is sprouting Golden Arches.  Although we have a serious legal issue, I 
think the CP really wants to develop a long term relationship with Enron and 
will overcome the problem.  Also, CP is interested in eliminating a Credit 
Support Annex and will call Tanya (or already has called her).  Call me and 
I'll give you the scoop.  Sara
