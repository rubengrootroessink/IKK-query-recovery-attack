Here are the updated changes per our phone call and fax received at approx. 
1pm.

Please check page 5 of your fax. The top of the fax was cut off, and I want 
to ensure that
the language should read, ", other than Section 6(b) of the general....".

Please let me know of any other changes/modifications, etc.

David
