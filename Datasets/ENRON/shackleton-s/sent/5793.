Hi Sara.  I did just hear. Your approach sounds fine.  Do you have a schedule 
of trades, or should I try and dig one up?

Subject:  Assignment of trades




Hi, Steve:

We am preparing a form of assignment from ECT Investments, Inc. in favor of
Enron North America Corp. whch will transfer several credit derivative
Transactions.  I anticipate an attachment to the assignment which will
identify the trades.  I believe that Bill Bradford (Ernon) and Mark
Tarkington have discussed these trades and Bill is sending me the list.

Please let me know that you are aware of this request.  Thanks.
