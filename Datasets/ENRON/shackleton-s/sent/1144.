Hi Sara,

How are you?  I am in the middle of making up the
"wedding list" and I don't have your address in
Houston.  Can you Please email it to me.  Also, I am
going to have the invitation  addressed to you and
guest.  Or do you want me to include Mike's name as
well?  Let me know.

Everyone is fine.  Gary is busy again, and I'm just
doing what I usually do....

Anyway, please email the info so I can get it over to
Robyn's parents.

Thank you soooo much.

Love,
Joan
