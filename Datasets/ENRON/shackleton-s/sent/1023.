1.  Thursday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               +154.20     +1.56%   10010.73
S&P 500                        +34.99     +2.56%    1401.69
Nasdaq                        +149.60     +3.05%    5046.86
Internet Stock Index           +42.29     +3.95%    1111.96

The Dow recovered in Thursday afternoon's trading session,
making big gains before closing up sharply, while Internet and
technology stocks propelled the Nasdaq to its fifth biggest
single-day point gain ever to close above 5000 for the first
time in history.

Thursday's early market action had all major U.S. indexes
performing lower following the Labor Department's report that
the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits increased
for the second consecutive week to 280,000 from 275,000 in the
previous week.  At the same time, however, a more accurate
longer-term measure showed that the closely watched four-week
moving average fell for the second straight week to 277,250,
which represented the lowest figure in 26 years.  Economists
view the four-week moving average as a more dependable indicator
of job market trends since it accounts for weekly fluctuations.

Notwithstanding the Labor Department's report, financial stocks,
which typically are sensitive to news related to potential
interest rate hikes, performed well, with American Express
(NYSE:AXP) edging up 1/8 (+0.10%) to 122 7/8, JP Morgan
(NYSE:JPM) gaining 5/16 (+0.29%) to 107 11/16, Chase Manhattan
Bank (NYSE:CMB) closing up 2 1/8 (+2.69%) to 81 1/8, Goldman
Sachs (NYSE:GS) finishing up 5 7/16 (+5.34%) to 107 3/4, and
General Electric (NYSE:GE), which has a substantial financial
services component, rising 1 1/16 (+0.82%) to 131 3/8.

In other financial stock news, Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's
largest bank, and competitor Dresdner Bank AG, the third biggest
German bank, jointly announced on Thursday that Deutsche Bank
would commence a $30 billion takeover of Dresdner in a
transaction that would create the world's largest bank with $1.2
trillion in assets.  Under the deal, the combined company would
close approximately 800 branch offices and reduce payroll levels
dramatically.  It is estimated that these cuts would result in
annual cost savings of over $2.75 billion.  Following the
announcement, Wall Street began speculating about whether this
deal would put increasing consolidation pressure on U.S. banks,
including financial giant Citigroup (NYSE:C), which edged lower
by 7/16 (-0.87%) to 50 1/16.

One of the strongest performing sectors on Thursday was the
pharmaceutical idustry, with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)
jumping 12.04% (up 5 3/4) to 53 1/2, Merck (NYSE:MRK) gaining
6.93% (up 3 15/16) to 60 3/4 and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) closing up
8.11% (up 4 1/2) to 60.

Insurance powerhouse Metropolitan Life Insurance announced on
Thursday that it would acquire the remaining interest in
insurance asset manager and research firm Conning Corp.
(Nasdaq:CNNG) in a deal valued at approximately $68 million.
MetLife already has a 61% stake in Conning that was captured
through MetLife's January acquisition of Conning's indirect
majority owner, General America Corp.  MetLife, which is
scheduled to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange by
the end of March, increased its offer from $10.50 per share of
Conning to $12.50 per share.  Shares of Conning gained 15.98%
(up 1 11/16) to 12 1/4, while shares of other companies in the
insurance space performed well, with Chubb (NYSE:CB) rising 3/4
(+1.68%) to 45 1/2, Aetna (NYSE:AET) closing up 3 1/8 (+5.77%)
to 57 1/4, and Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:HIG) gaining
15/16 (+3.19%) to 30 5/16.

Investors reacted on Thursday to the request by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for more information relating to
the proposed $135 billion merger of America Online (NYSE:AOL),
the #1 Internet service provider, and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX),
the media and cable giant, after the initial filing by these
companies was deemed insufficient.  While a second request for
information by the Justice Department or Federal Trade
Commission frequently is viewed as a sign of potential delays in
approving a merger, analysts expect that the FCC request will
not delay significantly the agency's evaluation of the proposed
deal.  Shares of AOL rose 6 (+10.93%) to 60 7/8, while shares of
Time Warner gained 7 7/16 (+9.38%) to 86 3/4.

Among the big Dow movers on Thursday were:

<> Boeing (NYSE:BA), which closed up 3/8 (+1.12%) to 33 3/4
following the aerospace giant's announcement that an ongoing
strike could hurt the company's earnings and cause longer delays
of jet deliveries.

<> AT&T Corp. (NYSE:T), which dropped 3/8 (-0.71%) to 52 5/8
following news that Dan Hesse, president of the company's
wireless business that will be sold in what could be the largest
U.S. IPO ever, is leaving AT&T to take the helm at an Internet
start-up company.

<> Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP), which rose 11 (+7.81%) to 151 7/8
and was a driving force behind Thursday afternoon's recovery on
the Dow.

Internet and technology stocks continued to drive the Nasdaq
higher, with several companies hitting new all-time highs during
Thursday's trading session.  Among the several high-flyers
reaching new records were Redback Networks (Nasdaq:RBAK), which
jumped 32 3/16 (+9.82%) to 359 7/8, Nextel Communications
(Nasdaq:NXTL), which rose 15 15/16 (+11.63%) to 152 15/16, Cisco
Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO), which closed up 6 15/16 (+ 5.24%) to 139
5/16, and Phone.com (Nasdaq:PHCM), which gained 24 1/2 (+16.90%)
to 169 1/2.

GoTo.com (Nasdaq:GOTO) announced on Thursday that it would
acquire AuctionRover.com, a resource for online auctions, in a
deal valued at approximately $170 million.  AuctionRover's
proprietary technology permits buyers to search for products and
services that are being auctioned in cyberspace.  Online search
engine GoTo.com operates an Internet marketplace that introduces
Web users to advertisers.  Shares of GoTo.com, which analysts
believe will benefit tremendously from its e-auction acquistion,
fell 2 5/8 (-5.20%) to 47 7/8, while shares of online auction
companies finished mixed for the day, with eBay (Nasdaq:EBAY)
dropping 1 1/2 (-0.82%) to 182 1/2, Yahoo (Nasdaq:YHOO), which
operates Yahoo! Auctions, gaining 6 1/4 (+3.53%) to 183 1/4, and
Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN), which runs Amazon Auctions, closing up
5 3/16 (+8.15%) to 68 13/16.

In the wake of International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM)
launch of a large-scale Internet campaign, the company announced
on Thursday that it has signed agreements under which local U.S.
telephone providers Bell Atlantic (NYSE:BEL) and SBC
Communications (NYSE:SBC) will test IBM's new Internet access
devices.  While IBM did not disclose the number of devices that
would be tested in the trials, analysts predicted that the
testing by Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications would be a major
step in IBM's efforts to shift its focus to the development of
products designed specifically for Internet access.  Shares of
IBM gained 1 3/8 (+1.29%) to 107 5/8, shares of Bell Atlantic
closed up 2 1/8 (+3.76%) to 58 5/8 and shares of SBC fell 1/16
(-0.15%) to 41 9/16.

Old economy fast-food titan McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD)
officially has entered the age of the Internet.  The world's
largest fast food chain announced on Thursday that it has made a
significant investment Food.com, which provides online food
takeout and delivery services.  McDonald's also is exploring
various online opportunities for some of its smaller restaurant
brands, including Donatos Pizza, Boston Market and Chipotle
Mexican Grill.  Shares of McDonald's rose 7/8 (+2.85%) to 31
5/8.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors
included:

<> Smith Micro Software (Nasdaq:SMSI), which skyrocketed 101.80%
(up 10 5/8) to 21 1/16 following the company's announcement that
it has developed a new wireless Internet access solution.

<> Globalstar Telecommunications (Nasdaq:GSTRF), which fell
12.99% (-2 11/16) to 18 and was one among the most active stocks
on the Nasdaq on Thursday following the downgrade of the company
by CIBC World Markets.

<> Copper Mountain (Nasdaq:CMTN), which rose 9.19% (up 8 13/16)
to 104 11/16 and rode the wave of a strong overall Nasdaq
performance.

Leading Internet and tech stocks performed as follows:

Company                      $ Change   % Change      Close
Amazon (Nasdaq:AMZN)          +5 3/16     +8.15%   68 13/16

In addition, Selectica, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLTC), a provider of
