Hey, Carol!  

How is everyone and everything???  I am always being asked about you, how's 
the baby, etc.  I hope I haven't missed your visit to the office!  I'm just 
working away (next to Dan Lyons, I might add) in my own little world.  We are 
getting help soon and I don't know if Mark mentioned anything to you.  Raptor 
is a "pain" and Mary has undergone trial by fire.  I am counting the days 
until my vacation (to Marfa and Napa) which begins after the legal conference.

Do you recall Project Marlin?  I think Lance was involved.  My memory is 
really bad if I worked on this deal.  There's nothing in Lotus Notes 
(rats!).  

Take care (I'm starting to sound like David Mitchell).

Sara
