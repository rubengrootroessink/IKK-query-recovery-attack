Subject: Re: Financial Trading in Brazil  

I am not aware of any products that need to be identified prior to 12/31/99.  
Going forward into next year, the following products might be of interest for 
trading.  Our current plan for managing risk is via offshore products through 
Gary's group due to tax and regulatory reasons.

1. Brazil corporate eurobonds
2. Brazil Brady bonds
3. Other country corporate and/or Brady bonds (ie, can a Brazil limitada own 
an Argentine eurobond?)
4. Bovespa index futures
5. R$ currency futures
6. Local Treasury bills (both US$ indexed and R$ rate) such as BBCs, LBCs, 
LTNs, NTNs, NBCs, etc
7. R$ currency forwards
8. Rules/regulations/tax effects on individual stock trades
9. Local company commercial paper (typically trades at 105% to 110% multiple 
to the overnight rate depending on credit).

As discussed, it would be interesting to see what the tax effects are on each 
type of investment, what margin is required, and what offshore alternatives 
are available for items #4-8 (the first 3 are bringing offshore items into 
Brazil, which we might do if there was a tax benefit that could be obtained).

Thanks,  Bruce

Before my next meeting with the Tozzini lawyers this month, I would like to 
create a list of SPECIFIC products for managing Enron's Brazilian risk.  
Bruce Harris is creating a list which he will forward to you shortly.  Please 
review this list, comment and identify any products required for trading 
prior to December 31, 1999.  Please let me hear from you if you would like to 
discuss any issues in particular.  Thanks.  Sara
