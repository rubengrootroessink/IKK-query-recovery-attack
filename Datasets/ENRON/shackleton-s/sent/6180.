Dick:

That will be fine.  However, you need to attach the trade confirmation 
(marked Exhibit "A") to each of your certificates since that is how each 
certificate is drafted.

Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates 
with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.   Please 
call if you have any questions.

Thanks for ;your assistance.

From our end, we would like to have the direct reference to the specific 
confirm.  I know it is a little more hassle, but it works better for us 
politically.

Dick:

I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.  I had asked if
you would mind revising the forms of certificate which we will attach to
each trade confirmation.

We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.  This
will be the format for all future transactions.

Please send revisions to Kimberly Hundl.  Her phone number is (713)
853-1647 and fax if (713) 646-2443.

Thanks.

Dick:

I am suggesting a minor change to the "Power Risk Management Committee"
certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit "A").  If we leave
the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm
as Exhibit "A" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know
if you are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend
the certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the
change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation
labeled Exhibit "A" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Thanks, Sara.  No problem making the changes.

Dick:

Attached are my comments to the certificates.  We will need to attach the
form of confirmation to be certain that each particular transaction is
authorized.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
