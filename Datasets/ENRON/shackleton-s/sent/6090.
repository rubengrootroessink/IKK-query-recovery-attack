Anna:

I would like to fax the resume of Kristina Fisher to you (I do not have a 
word version to email).  She is the candidate about whom we spoke recently.  
I have also asked Kristina to visit the website "www.enroncareers.com" and 
apply through that process.  I assume that you are the person who receives 
inquiries on the website.

Please advise me of your fax number and I can send the resume directly to you.

Thanks so much for your interest.
