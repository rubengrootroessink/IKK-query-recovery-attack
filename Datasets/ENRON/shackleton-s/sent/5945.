Jorge:  I may send you some emails throughout the day to help clarify some 
things for me.

 Where are your definitions of "Calculation Period" and "IPA Modified 
Calculation Period"? 

In your definition of "IPA Floating Rate Payment", you use the term "Share 
Spread" which is not defined.  What do you mean?  There is a dangling 
definition of "Share Spread" at the end of the IPA Compensation section, but 
it refers to spreads appearing in either Annex I or Annex II.

In the "IPA Compensation" section, how is "a negative IPA elected"?  Who is 
making an election?

Let's discuss tomorrow.
