Thanks for your response.  My prior message to you was in error because I did 
enter the correct address.  For example, I can get to the screen that says 
"Documents" but when I click on one of the choices, I get a message that says 
"Netscape is unable to locate the server ei-sp-data01.  Please check the 
server name and try again."  Am I doing something wrong?  Should I simply 
call the Helpdesk here in Houston?  Thanks.  Sara

Sara, the correct address is http://ei-sp-data01/regulatory      and not  
http://ei-sp-01/regulatory as you tried before.
If you can access Enron's intranet or extranet you are able to get in the 
site. Please let me know if you still have problems accessing it.  Thanks,  
Carlos Gustavo
