Per Sara Shackleton, I need to check with you to find out if the guaranty cap 
for the above-referenced Counterparty has not changed.  Please respond to my 
e-mail at your earliest convenience so that I can forward a new Guaranty to 
Emma Nakakuke.  Your assistance with this matter is greatly appreciated.

Would you please generate a fresh ENE guaranty and email to the lawyer (see 
Lotus Notes - Emma Nakakuki is the new attorney).  Also, please verify with 
credit (Rod Nelson in London) that the guaranty cap has not changed.  I have 
the file in my office.  Thanks.  SS
