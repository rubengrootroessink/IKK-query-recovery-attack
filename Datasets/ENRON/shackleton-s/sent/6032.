Sara, I wanted to let u knwo that under the FERC rules, we have to file the 
Enron side letter for the physical master agreement in the same manner that 
we filed the original agt between Enron and Allegheny.  Our PA office is 
handling that and, if I am not mistaken, has taken of that yesterday.  I do 
not think that EPMI is requried to file with the FERC because u are a power 
amrekter, but I am wondering whether u do such filings anyway.

Yair:

I've left a message with Tracy Ngo (in Portland) and will let you know as
soon as I hear from her.  How long will you be in the office today?

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Yair:

Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining
issues, including:

(1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is
adequate.

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for
dual confirms.  This is too confusing.

(3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too
subjective.

The other changes were not substantive.

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Yair:

Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of
3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  I
have tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 "swap side
letter agreement."  Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to
finalize by April 6.  Thanks.
