Sara, Samantha,
I spoke with Guillaume this morning.  He suggested that we do the PrimeTrade 
Access Agreement first.  This allows us to get the CD for the PrimeTrade 
application  and to install it on a  PC here, roll it out to the traders, and 
have CSFB come in for trainng.
At the same time we can complete the clearing agreement.
We will not do the give up agreement.  If we decide we can do easily in the 
future.
Guillaume suggested that you call him if you have any questions.  He will be 
happy to facilitate.

Sheila
