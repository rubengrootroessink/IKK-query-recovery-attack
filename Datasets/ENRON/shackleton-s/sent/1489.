Sheung,
I am resending this e-mail to you.
As soon as we have an account number for EDIDE we will give you a letter to 
transfer Shares as a contribution from EPCA  to EDIDE.
We will send a separate letter for instructions for EDIDE to convert the ADRs 
to ordinary Class B Shares.
Thanks. Sheila

Corrections to #4 below.  Originally had EPCA, should be EDIDE.

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so 
that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate 
Resolution from EDIDE.  I understand that the contact at Morgan Stanley has 
changed.  Please advise.
