John:  I don't know if you've been in touch with Instinet but they are now 
holding up the documents.  Instinet could not find the ECT Investments, Inc. 
executed 1997 agreements (which I have resent to them) and I now have their 
lawyer agreed to amend that agreement to add the London terminal.

This should be a minor item.

Can you put pressure on New York?

Sara
