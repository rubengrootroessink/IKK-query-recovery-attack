Diane:
Looks like the guarantor will have to change to:  NUI Corp. (and replace NUI 
Utilities, Inc.)  This will require changes to the "Additional Provisions" 
section, part (b) and the Exhibit A.  We will target Monday morning to 
finalize.  Thanks.

Mark,

Attached please see the confirmations, with
a change to the Addtional Provisions (b) section
referencing both deals - which should answer
your concerns, as per Sara.  

Please let me know if these are OK to sign
and send.  If you are unable to OK these by
12:45 today (I'm leaving for the weekend), 
please respond to Joe Hunter and he will 
sign and send them.  

 

Thanks,
Diane
