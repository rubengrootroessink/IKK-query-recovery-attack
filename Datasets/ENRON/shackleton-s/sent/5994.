Russ and Richard:

The referenced agreement was sent  to you for execution on December 7, 2000.  
We have never received an executed original of the agreement or the guaranty 
from Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.  We have called on several occasions to 
locate these instruments.

Please let us know if there is a problem.
