David,

We continue to wait for word from you on the availability of additional 
financial information to review Glencore International AG.  We are looking 
for similair information to that which was provided S&P.  Without such 
information, a limited global credit line  will be allocated per your 
direction.

Sara, I believe we should holdoff preparing executable documents until we 
hear back from David.  That way, we can include in a single amendment those 
changes I referenced in my credit worksheet.

thanks
brant
