I had a VERY long call with the two lawyers.  I would say for the most part 
that Tiger will reconsider many of our provisions now that the lawyers 
understand our position.  Big issues:  arbitration (I need an explanation in 
order to go to our general counsel)
                                          Limitiation of Liability

All else is negotiable.  SS
