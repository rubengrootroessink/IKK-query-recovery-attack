Sara, Susan:

The attached revision of the Appendix to the HS Resources to HS Energy 
Services assignment corrects the Total MMBtu column, which had a math error.  
The trade descriptions, which would control in any event, have not changed.

We would like to proceed with execution on Thursday.   Would you please 
accept the changes  in the red-lined documents I sent yesterday, print 
cleans, get signatures, and fax to me at 303-296-9709?  I will send the HS 
signiture pages in the morning, and will send the J. Aron pages as soon as I 
get them.

I will be in touch with you in the morning to discuss further.

Thanks. Jim
