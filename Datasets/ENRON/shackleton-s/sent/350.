I would like the credit group to respond to the following:

1.  What person in credit is the initial contact for the preparation of 
credit worksheets for structured transactions?  How can we insure that the 
process will run smoothly?

2.  Can we (credit and legal) schedule a meeting with a trader to walk 
through the actual termination amout calculation process?

3.  With respect to L/C's, does credit review incoming L/C's for content?  If 
not, we need to establish a procedure?
