Subject: PULP & PAPER MEETING TOMORROW: draft London / Houston trade flow 
schematic

In advance of the video conference tomorrow amongst the Houston and London 
personnel involved in the Pulp & Paper deals, I now attach a final draft 
version of a "schematic" which sets down the trade flow structure on the 
deals sourced by EEFT for ECTRIC.  If you have any comments on this, please 
let me know.

Sara / Carol / Dale:  Please see fit to let any other appropriate personnel 
in Houston have a copy of this document at your discretion.

Kind regards

Mark
