Who will be handling the LDC swap in your absence? It might be a good idea to 
identify that person before you leave and give them a download. Thanks!

I will be on vacation from October 6- 13.  Also, the ENA lawyers will be 
offsite October 5 and 6.
Should you need assistance during my absence, please contact my assistant 
Kaye Ellis at Ext. 35968 who will direct you to a lawyer.
Thanks.  Sara
