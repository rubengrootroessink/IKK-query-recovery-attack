Sara;

Today at 11:00am Houston time (3:00pm SP time) works out well for me.  I will 
call you in the office.

Bracewell suggested the following dates: March 23, March 30, April 6, April 
20 and April 27.

Regards,

Sami

Sami:  Can we schedule a short conference call to discuss?  I am in the 
office all week except for Friday (and Monday, February 21 is a legal holiday 
in the U.S.)  Please let me know your availability.  Maybe you can select 
from the following this week:

Tues, 2/15:  10:30 am until 1 pm, after 2 pm

Wed., 2/16:  9 am until 10 am, 11am until 2 pm, after 3 pm

Thurs., 2/17:  1 pm until 4 pm

All of the foregoing times are Houston times.
Also, I am trying to verify holidays in Brazil for the remainder of the 
year.  Is Bracewell looking at early or late March?

Thanks.  Sara

Subject: Bracewell & Patterson Seminar for ESA (Brazil)

Sara;

As per our previous telephone conversation with respect to a legal seminar in 
Brazil, I would like to discuss with you the most appropriate way to meet the 
expectations of both ESA lawyers and Direct Sales business people.  My idea 
is to organize a 1 or 2 day seminar in S?o Paulo, having Nancy Wodka (B&P) 
and Jos, Em?lio (Tozzini, Freire) talking about international and Brazilian 
legal issues of "Contracting" (focusing on PPAs and equity participation).  I 
would also very much like to have you talking about "Derivatives".  
Additionaly, it would be interesting to have someone from EES (or V&E) to 
talk about "Outsourcing".  I'd like to hear your opinions before contacting 
Nancy and Jose Emilio.  Please be advised that Nancy has indicated to us that 
the Seminar must take place in March.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Regards,

Sami
