Please ADVISE if "European Power Holdings" is the correct legal entity for 
closing out the FX piece of Sutton Bridge and if Maroon Aboudy is the party 
to whom a confirm should be directed.  Thanks.  SS

Sara et al.,

As part of the Sutton Bridge unwind, Trena has executed a foreign exchange 
deal with the parent company--European Power Holdings.  Is the attached form 
of confirmation acceptable to that counterparty?  Also, is Maroon Aboudy the 
appropriate person to send the confirm to, or should it be someone else?  
Thank you.
