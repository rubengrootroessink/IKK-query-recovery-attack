I spoke with Bernardo Andrews about this and he has decided to wait until 
Friday for Metrogas to give us their financials. I'll have them sent to 
Houston as soon as I receive them and let you know.

Thanks for your help.

Andrea

I still need financials for this company to evaluate and set credit terms for 
the master swap.  Let me know if you perhaps have a contact for me.
