Sara:

Julie Beck (VP Finance - Inland Paperboard and Packaging) has given me the 
name of another attorney who will review the new ISDA and confirms:

 Jack Falconi,  (214) 360-4865,  jfalconi@gfbank.com

Temple Inland (the parent  -  will provide a $15 million guaranty) has worked 
with Jack in the past and wants him involved.  

It might be a good idea to call Jack.  I am not clear on the role that Grant 
Adamson will play (Grant gave us comments on the earlier ISDA).  From what 
Julie said, I think that Jack will be our main legal contact at this point.


Thanks,  Jim
