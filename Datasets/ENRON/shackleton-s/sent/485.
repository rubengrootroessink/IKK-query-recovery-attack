Hey there Sara!  I'm back from Pittsburgh and Indy and would love to get 
together with you for lunch.  I'm free on Wednesday and Friday.  Let me know 
if either of these dates work for you.  Otherwise, we will probably have to 
wait until November since bid week is right around the corner!  Hope you had 
a nice weekend.  Happy Monday!
