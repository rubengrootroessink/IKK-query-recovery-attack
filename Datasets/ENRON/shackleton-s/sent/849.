This would be 9 AM Houston time.  Can you follow up with Julian and Lynn to 
see if they can be available and I will inform Mike as to the purpose of the 
meeting.  Thanks.

Conference with Julian, S. Jackleton and L. Evans: You've probably talked to 
Mike about this meeting, but anyway, it's OK for him on the 27th at 12p.   He 
would like to be briefed before this meeting.  
Thanks,
Mariana
