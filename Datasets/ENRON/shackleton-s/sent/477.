I spoke to Todd Busby.  He said he is trying to set this up as a transaction 
where we could directly link the two swaps.  It is my understanding that this 
would simplify the transaction in that the credit/contracting process would 
be fairly straightforward.  He said that he needs to get his internal ducks 
in a row before he is prepared to take a step forward with us.  He will call 
me if and when this occurs.   So, this might not come to anything.  I will 
let you know if and when he surfaces so we can decisde what we should do next.

Thanks!!

Chris
