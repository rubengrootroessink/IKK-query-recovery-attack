Please let me know who handles this one.  Our power trader is Joe Wagner 
(X33143) and the draft should be emailed to John Porter:  japorter@tva.gov
Joe would like an update.  John Porter will direct to a TVA lawyer.  Thanks.

I don't know who is going to work on this one, but I just wanted to remind 
you that we had that big file with lots of due diligence on the TVA...
