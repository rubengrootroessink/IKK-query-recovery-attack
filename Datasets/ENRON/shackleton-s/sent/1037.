Donna,
Mike Deville spoke with Jeff Kinneman and me regarding the pending sale of 
Rythyms
5,400,000 shares (value approx. $40s something) 
Restricted legend being removed by transfer agent
Sale through Merrill Lynch ONLY
Shares held in vault on 48th floor
Shares currently in the name of Enron Communications Inc.
Gill Melman ECI Legal

Discussion Items:
When expect back from transfer agent
Are shares being reregistered in whose name or STreet name so we can send to 
Morgan Stanley
Open up Morgan Stanley account, Need registration for account set up (whose 
name on account, agree to stock ownership)
Resolution needed for J. Greene to trade on behalf of ECI
Can we sell short if lifting of restrcted legend is guarantted???? 
Want letter from ECI (EBS?) requesting us to sell and at what prices will 
accept

Please give me a call
Thanks. Sheila
