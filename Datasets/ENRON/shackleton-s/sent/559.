Randy:  Please forgive me for missing the call this morning.  I mistakenly 
thought that my 7:30 am doctor's appointment was tomorrow and not this 
morning.

Just a brief update to my resport of yesterday, Lynn, Brent and I are meeting 
this afternoon to discuss the Tozzini response and set plans for another trip 
to Sao Paulo to meet with the lawyers and refine the review.  I'll keep you 
briefed because I know that we're fast approaching year-end and Tozzini will 
be in a crunch.  We can discuss as the need arises.

Also, Lynn is preparing his synopsis regarding Don's recent inquiries about 
trading office locations.  Don's questions tie into the legal review of 
financial trading options in general but it's a good idea to address these up 
front.

Please call if you have any questions.  I promise to be back on board next 
week.  Regards.  Sara
