Paul:

Just checking to see if you are the lawyer monitoring equity trading in the 
U.K.  I am charged with the oversight of Gary Hickerson's equity activity 
here in Houston and I want to coordinate with the London lawyer.  Please 
advise.

Also, I heard that you were recently married.  Congratulations!
