Subject: Secretary's Day is coming up!


	

It is on Thursday April 27th this year. I wanted to go ahead and start 
organizing what we should do for Kaye since she has supported us all 
outstandingly well this past year (surprise, surprise...) .  I have 
personally already gotten her a small present but would be happy to go in on 
flowers and/or lunch for her. 

Please email me back by the end of the week if you want to participate in: 

1. Lunch

2. Flowers

3. Lunch & Flowers

Also - I am open to suggestions on the lunch place. Anybody have a 
suggestion??   Some that I would propose are:  Mark's, Ruggles, Crostini, 
Boulevard Bistrot.
