Mark:  I have scheduled a 5 pm flight to NO.  I am attending a wedding Friday 
night.  I hope this is not a problem, but let me know.  Also, did you receive 
my voice mail about the Goldman electronic agreement and their denial of my 
request for injunctive relief upon proof of breach?  I'd like to finalize 
this agreement.  Thanks.  Sara
