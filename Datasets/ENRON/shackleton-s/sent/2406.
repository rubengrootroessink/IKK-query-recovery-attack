Tanya:

This year is no different from any other year and we are always asked to 
review the swap component of the Global Finance structured deals.  We are 
also seeing lots of prepays.

Who is the credit person to be apprised of these transactions?  Should we 
immediately involve you and Bill?

At the moment, Mary Cook, Angela Davis (legal finance group) and I are 
juggling the deals.

Please let me know and I'll alert the swap group.  Thanks.  Sara
