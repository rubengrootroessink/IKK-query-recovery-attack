Laurel:  Will John be trading in the names of BOTH ENA and ECT Investments, 
Inc. or only one of them?  Is John located in London temporarily?  Will 
Houston book the trades pursuant to the agency agreement? (I'm not certain 
which companies are covered by the agreement).  Let's discuss.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

I'm sure that as soon as the technical kinks are worked out, John will want 
to begin trading European stocks right away.  Could you please have a look at 
the Instinet agreement, and see what changes might be necessary to facilitate 
this?  Please let me know what you think.  THanks.

Julie,

This is the Instinet install.  Who do you think is the best person to 
coordinate the install?  Please forward this to them and ask them to contact 
me on ext. 3-5534 in London.

Laurel,

Please be aware that we are wanting to add european equity trading to the 
existing Instinet contract.  Although it may change at a later date, we would 
like for this activity to be done in the name of ECT Investments so I am not 
sure how much the contract will change.  As I have mentioned, there is a 
chance that we may have to have such trading done out of another entity but 
we can worry about changing any contracts when that happens.  I want to get 
the technological kinks worked out during the "down time" so that as soon as 
we have figured out how this activity is going to be structured we can begin 
trading immediately.  I will direct the Instinet contract contact to you as 
soon as I find out who that is.

Thanks and regards,
John

Hi John,

Thanks for taking the time to chat with me regarding your new London office.
You are very smart to start setting up the equipment ahead of time.  My
colleague in London is Mark Freeman.  He will be calling you to discuss the
details of your account.  If you need to reach Mark in London call 44 207 680
3191.

As we discussed on the phone, we will need to pass your account through credit
committee at Instinet London.  It sounds like Enron Houston is the same entity
as Enron London.  Hopefully this will make the legality issues simple.  In
addition, you mentioned that the phone lines to Reuters have been installed.  
We
can usually hook the Instinet terminal right up to the Reuters phone line.
Please let me know once you have the name of the technician handling the 
account
so we can contact him/her.

I ran you through some of the functionality Instinet provides on the
international side.  We should probably talk about this in more detail soon.  
I
will be in London the week of 9/11-9/15 so perhaps I could bring your new
coverage person over to meet if you think that makes sense.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, comments or concerns please 
contact
me on 212 310-7268.  As I mentioned, I am still on jury duty but hope to be 
off
by next Tuesday.  I always check messages from the road.  Good luck with the
apartment search.  You can not go wrong in Chelsea it's fantastic.  Have a 
great
weekend!!!

Jenn
