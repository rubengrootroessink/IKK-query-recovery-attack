Paul:  This was the only "hedge fund" related item that I could find.  I 
think that I may be the lucky recipient of Moore Global Investments.  SS

Just a note to Group after discussion w/paralegals and Mark:  on a going 
forward basis if our counterparty is a hedge fund, we will ask for all 
corporate documents, plus a copy of their prospectus (which should show us 
what the fund is allowed to invest in).
