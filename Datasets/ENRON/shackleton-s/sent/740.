This is the deal that Susan F.  worked on on Friday.  I'll forward the 
Schedule to you.  No one is asking for a revised Schedule yet but we should 
make the change and email  the parties on Susan's email so that everyone 
knows the latest changes and then ask if anyone has comments.  ss

In follow up to our conversation earlier today, please take out the Threshold 
Amount applying to the parties of the ISDA.  This would result in the 
Threshold Amount to only be tied to the Credit Support Providers.  This 
provision will then be parallel with the physical contract.

Regards,
Tracy
