From:  Mark Haedicke


 I am pleased to announce that Kristina Mordaunt has been promoted to Vice 
President and General Counsel, Structured Finance for ECT.

 Kristina joined ECT in 1993 from the Houston law firm of Butler & Binion 
where she specialized in public finance, project finance and asset 
securitized transactions.  Since 1996 she has held the position of Vice 
President and Assistant General Counsel with primary responsibility for the 
legal matters associated with structured finance transactions including off 
balance sheet funding vehicles, structured prepays, monetizations of existing 
assets and financing for acquisitions.

 Please join me in congratulating Kristina on her promotion.
