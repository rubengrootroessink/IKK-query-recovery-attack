Sara and Gil,
John Greene is questioning why we need to execute through Merrill only since 
it may affect our abiltiy to get "best price".
thanks. sheila

Sheila,

Another question that is very impotant from a trading execution perspective 
is: why do we have to use Merrill ONLY?  This has obvious ramifications on 
how we execute the order.

Thanks and regards,
John

Donna,
Mike Deville spoke with Jeff Kinneman and me regarding the pending sale of 
Rythyms

Restricted legend being removed by transfer agent
Sale through Merrill Lynch ONLY
Shares held in vault on 48th floor
Shares currently in the name of Enron Communications Inc.
Gill Melman ECI Legal

Discussion Items:
When expect back from transfer agent
Are shares being reregistered in whose name or STreet name so we can send to 
Morgan Stanley
Open up Morgan Stanley account, Need registration for account set up (whose 
name on account, agree to stock ownership)
Resolution needed for J. Greene to trade on behalf of ECI
Can we sell short if lifting of restrcted legend is guarantted???? 
Want letter from ECI (EBS?) requesting us to sell and at what prices will 
accept

Please give me a call
