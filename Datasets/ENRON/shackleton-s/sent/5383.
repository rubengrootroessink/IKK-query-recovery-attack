		 Subject: Duke Energy File

I am looking for Shari's file/papers on the ISDA Master that we did in Canada 
with Duke Energy Limited Partnership.  At one point in her negotiations with 
them, Stikeman Elliot changed our cash collateral provisions to make it work 
in Canada and taht language may be useful to me on another ISDA that I am 
working on with our office in Japan.  Does anyone have her working file on 
this or know where her papers would be?
