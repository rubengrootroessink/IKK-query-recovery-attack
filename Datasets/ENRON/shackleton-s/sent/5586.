Trena:  attached is an email from Joe Hunter which has some of your answers.  
You may want to chat with Shifali Sharma (I don't know her but will be glad 
to call).  My guess is that many of the crude deals are brokered (maybe 
that's why the deals originate in Houston).  I'm also forwarding to you Joe's 
message about traders.

Please call me if we need to pursue further.  SS

Sara,

We're waiting on Shifali Sharma for this info.  She is our Risk person for 
the Crude Desk.  There are going to be quite a few Traders and Books.  All 
deals that are Financial will be booked as ENA (RMT if internal).  I'm not 
sure if that's what your looking for as far as question 3 below.

We'll forward the other info along as soon as we get it.

Joe

Joe:  A few questions:

1. Who trades this?
2. What book does it sit in?
3. What legal entity is that book?

Please let me know as we are comparing this to another product.  Thanks.
