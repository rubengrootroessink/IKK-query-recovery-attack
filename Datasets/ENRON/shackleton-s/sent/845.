Dear Sara:

The people behind the Argentine Association of Derivatives are mainly the
big international banks.  I know them well.  The Firm has been invited to
join ADA but has not yet done so.  No specific reason.I knew that they were
working on a standard text but have not seen it.  I can easily obtain it
because the chairman of ADA is the Treasurer of Citibank and a good friend
of mine.  I worked extensively for a team that he led last year trying to
set up the legal framework of a futures and options markets.

As far as I know, they were focused on financial derivatives and not on
commodities but I can inquire.

ISDA can be used for international transactions but not for transactions
where both parties are domiciled in Argentina since in this case the
transaction cannot be subject to foreign law.

Let me try and investigate where they stand and I will give you a call.

Best regards and happy new year to you also.

Patricia
