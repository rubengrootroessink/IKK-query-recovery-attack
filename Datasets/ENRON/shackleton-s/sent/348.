Subject: Tiger ISDA Docs faxed to you last night

Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed 
the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original. He 
faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight. Hope you'll 
have time to review it today.

S&S has again asked about the gtee and l/c wording. They do not have anything 
from us in writing confirming the agreed changes. Joe asked that you fax the 
revised gtee wording that has been agreed (I believe it was our agreeing to 
reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5) and the new l/c wording 
(drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first 
refuses to pay). I know we talked about these issues earlier, but Tiger's 
lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be 
issued for signing, even if we are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c.

Thanks! Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help. There is an 
outside chance we could have everything set to go this week.

With best regards,
Per
