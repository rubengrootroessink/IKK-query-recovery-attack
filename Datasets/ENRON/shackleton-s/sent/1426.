Does anyone object to Wednesday, at 2:00 p.m., Carol's office? (Conference 
rooms are both booked.)

Susan and Susan:
In an effort to better manage your work flows, Sara and I would like to meet 
with you for about 30 minutes this week to get an idea of what's on your 
plate and what we can do to ease the work load.  Could you please give this 
some thought and let Taffy know when you want to meet so she can get it set 
up?  Thanks.
Carol
