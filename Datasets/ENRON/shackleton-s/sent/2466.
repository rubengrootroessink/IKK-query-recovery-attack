Tanya:  Is Lee the right person to approve this change for SITA?  Remember, 
SITA is acutally with ECTRIC (nto ENA) and SITA wanted to settle in Euros.  
Thanks.  Sara

Sorry for delayed response.

Tom says below that the invoice is likely to be in French Francs (FF) , 
therefore, I would have thought that having contractual currency as FF (or 
Euro as / when it replaces the FF)  is the most sensible. 

As the early termination value is likely to be calculated in FF or Euro, I 
think that this would not be a problem either.

Please feel free to give me a call if you wish to discuss 207 783 6755

regards 

Lee

As you are perhaps aware, the Master for this CP has been arranged thru 
Houston.  Would you cast your eye over the comments laid out below and revert 
to either Sara or Tanya with your comments.  
As background, Houston has negotiated all the docs and were intending to 
trade out of Houston.  This CP has now been handed over to us and all trades 
will be generated from here.
Any help much appreciated.
Tom

Tanya:

SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual 
Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the 
Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already 
agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to 
confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, 
the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).

What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.
