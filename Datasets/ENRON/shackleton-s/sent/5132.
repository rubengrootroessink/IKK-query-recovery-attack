Subject: FX Trader in Tokyo =20

Heidi,

In response to your attached e-mail, I am attaching the e-mail message that=
 I=20
sent out yesterday regarding the structure for the FX trader in Tokyo and t=
he=20
EM-Japan traders.  (You were already copied on this but I want to make sure=
=20
that you got it.) =20

In this e-mail, I explain that PWC-Tokyo has recommended following a=20
dependent agent approach for these traders (which is what you reference in=
=20
your attached e-mail).  I recommend this approach saying that it is a=20
pragmatic approach and should be easily implemented.  I talked with Sheila=
=20
Glover and Darren Delage about this approach yesterday evening and they lik=
e=20
it as well.  (In fact, they were also copied on the e-mail regarding the FX=
=20
trader and the EM-Japan traders.)

The following points should be kept in mind in following the dependent agen=
t=20
approach, which I have already discussed with Sheila and Darren:

(1) Agency approach:  Enron Japan would be considered to be an agent of ENA=
. =20
In this role, it would facilitate trades that would be entered into between=
=20
ENA and the third party counterparties.  The trades would be entered into i=
n=20
the name of ENA.  Under this approach, Darren is limited in what he is=20
authorized to do, and his trading parameters will need to be reduced to=20
writing.  These parameters must restrict his activities so that they=20
constitute activities that have a preparatory or auxiliary character.  The=
=20
advice that we received for the FX trader's activities in Australia should=
=20
equally apply to our facts here.  The following is an excerpt from a memo=
=20
that I wrote last year summarizing this advice:

Guidelines and boundaries must be established on what the financial trader=
=20
can do (e.g. price parameters, product parameters, etc.). Activities cannot=
=20
include the negotiation of terms of master contracts, forwards and other=20
derivatives with counterparties. If a master contract must be executed in=
=20
Australia, then it should be executed by an independent agent (such as a=20
lawyer) having a power of attorney from the hedging party. Confirmations=20
should be issued by the hedging party, rather than by EA Finance in Sydney.=
=20
The Australian tax advisor recommended that the financial trader say:  =01&=
My=20
principal will deal with you within these parameters =01(.=018

(2) Darren's employment:  Darren must be considered an employee of Enron=20
Japan so as to avoid ENA being treated as having a permanent establishment =
in=20
Japan.
(3) Darren's agency role:  Darren should not identify himself as an employe=
e=20
of ENA Houston.  He should make it clear that the third parties are enterin=
g=20
into the transactions with ENA as principal.
(4) Service agreement:  A service agreement must be put in place between=20
Enron Japan and ENA (similar to what we did for the FX trader in Sydney).=
=20
Enron Japan should at least initially  be compensated at a cost plus 5%=20
mark-up.  Yesterday evening I also forwarded to Sheila and Darren by e-mail=
=20
the old service agreement that we put in place for the FX trader in Sydney =
so=20
that they could review what terms have been previously used.  (Incidentally=
,=20
the service agreement we put in place between Enron Australia and ENA was=
=20
very similar (almost identical) to the one that was put in place between=20
Enron Europe and ENA for the FX trader in London.)
(5) Potential issues upon Japanese tax audit:  Notwithstanding that this=20
approach is easier to implement, more workable and more pragmatic in=20
approach, we need to be aware that there could be questions upon a Japanese=
=20
tax audit.  In that event, transfer pricing issues could be raised.  That i=
s,=20
the auditors could question whether a cost plus 5% mark-up is commensurate=
=20
with what an unrelated third party would charge for similar services.  We=
=20
would then need to justify that service fee, or if unsuccessful, try to wor=
k=20
out a commission fee that would be acceptable to the Japanese tax auditors.=
 =20
Management needs to be aware of this potential.

I guess I wasn't clear in my attached e-mail.  I am sorry for any=20
inconvenience this may have caused you.  I hope this e-mail better explains=
=20
the recommended structure.  Please let me know if you would like to set up =
a=20
conference call to discuss this further (and let me know who you would like=
=20
on the call).

Best regards,
Susan

Subject: Enron Metals & FX Traders in Japan =20

Jan-Erland,

I have not yet received the 2001 projections/budget for the Enron Metals=20
trading in Japan.  If you have already sent it, could you please re-send it=
? =20

Also, I talked with PWC-Tokyo late last night about structuring for the FX=
=20
trader and Japanese Metals traders to confirm Baker & McKenzie's advice on=
=20
not using a dependent agent structure in Japan.  PWC has advised that=20
although Baker & McKenzie's approach is more technically correct, foreign=
=20
traders usually set up their Japanese trading operations through the use of=
 a=20
dependent agent in Japan.  The Japanese dependent agent is usually reimburs=
ed=20
using cost plus 5%, at least initially.  Then, if the Japanese tax=20
authorities raise questions upon audit, a commission arrangement is general=
ly=20
used, with the question being what should the profit split be between the=
=20
agent and the foreign company.  Whether the Japanese tax authorities raise=
=20
questions upon audit is dependent upon the volume of trades and the magnitu=
de=20
of the trades.  The PWC Japanese tax partner suggested that we use this=20
arrangement for both the FX trader and the EM Japan trades.  I have asked P=
WC=20
to send this advice in writing by tomorrow.

This seems to be a much more pragmatic approach than the one suggested by=
=20
Baker & McKenzie.  And it should be easy to implement by year-end.  However=
,=20
management must be aware of the fact that PWC's approach could raise=20
questions upon a Japanese tax audit.  Note that if we follow this approach,=
=20
we would need to set up a services agreement between Enron Japan (whichever=
=20
the appropriate entity is) and ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,
Susan

Thanks for the note Susan. Like you, I would love to get the funding resolv=
ed=20
before year-end as we have finalised the amounting owing to Houston etc=20
(subject to some invoices etc being received) so it would be a good time to=

Re the FX trader, I have been harassing Sheila a bit this week, so I was=20
hoping to hear from you or her on the progress here. At this stage I=20
understand that the deals are still being done in the name of ENA, but ther=
e=20
have not been alot, so again if we can get this addressed before the volume=

Janine:

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted t=

verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this=20

include RMT for internal trades?=20

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks=
