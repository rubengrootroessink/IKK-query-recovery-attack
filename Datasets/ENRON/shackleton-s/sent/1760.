Mark:  Do we have any special considerations/expertise with respect to the 
evaluation of "internet trading platform" agreements?  I am starting to see 
more of these from Gary's group.  Please let me know.  Currently, I have 
Jason evaluating two of these.  Sara

I recently joined Jeff Kinneman's group and have been asked to participate in 
the evaluation of various internet trading platforms.  Is your area reviewing 
agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent 
Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and 
any outstanding issues ?

Thanks.
