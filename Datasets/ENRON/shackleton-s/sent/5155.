Maria:

Can you provide me with a blackline of one of the confirms below marked 
against the draft which Enron marked up and faxed to Steve on September 1, 
2000?  The current format contains a number of changes and it would be easier 
to review.  The directory on that document reads "Ext. ID[.]".  We want to 
respond quickly, today being our goal.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara and Clint:

I attach a final draft of the equity forward confirmation for the two
outstanding equity forward transactions. We need to fill in the: (1) par
value of your stock in the definition of Shares in each of the attached that
appears on page 3 for the May 8, 2000 trade and on page 2 for the August 4
trade; and (2) date when the share repurchase program was publicly announced
that is page 16 of the May 8, 2000 transaction and on page 15 of the August
4, 2000 transaction.

If the attached is acceptable to you, please advise me of the above so that
we may prepare execution copies and finalize these confirmations.

Regards,
