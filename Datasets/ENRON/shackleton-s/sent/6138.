Thanks for your help.  I also left a message for Jeff because I was told that 
he worked on the transaction.

The name "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona" ("Stadacona") does not appear on 
the corporate database so I cannot verify that it is an Enron-owned entity.  

The only question is:  Can we book the FX trade in the names of Stadacona and 
RMT?
