Aaron:

I spoke with both Matt Flett (Morgan counsel) and Denis O'Connell about the 
ISDA already negotiated by EnronCredit.com Limited.  Each was supposed to 
send me the draft docs for me to review and comment on for ENA.  I have not 
received anything yet but will comment immediately upon receipt.  I'll keep 
you up to date.  Sara
