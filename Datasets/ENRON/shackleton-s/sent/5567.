Hi Sara,
Thanks for the update.  With respect to First Union Corp., the holding
company of First Union National Bank ("FUNB")  providing a guaranty, I don't
believe that's an option. FUNB is a rated entity and as mentioned in my Jan.
23rd email, we can provide quarterly call reports (with year-to-date
information), which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov). First
Union Corporation's consolidated annual financial statements are available
on EDGAR as well as First Union's home page (www.firstunion.com).  I look
forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  It seems that our
marketers are asking for credit approval to enter into the Shenandoah trade
today without the Master in place. If approval is given, we will need mutual
downgrade provisions in our confirm.  I think all other pending trades are
on hold until we can get our docs wrapped up.
