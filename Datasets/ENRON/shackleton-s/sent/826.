Gosh, I had totally forgotten!!  That Friday makes for a long President's Day 
weekend which I was trying to arrange.  Will this lunch be too difficult to 
reschedule?  Just let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  Are you feeling better?  You missed our group meeting.  I asked what I 
thought was an innocent question about the legal survey database since it was 
related to part of our discussion.  BIG MISTAKE.  Tana was explosive.  Sorry 
you missed it.
