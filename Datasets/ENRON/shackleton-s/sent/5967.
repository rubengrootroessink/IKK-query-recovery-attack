Hi Sara.  I'm sorry to bother with this, but I'm not sure who the appropriate 
para-legal is these days.  

Can you have someone send me an electronic copy of the ENA-CitibankN.A. ISDA 
contract?  I'm looking for the general trading contract and not the one used 
to confirm the one-off Yosemite structure.

Thanks Sara (or whoever ends up helping out).

Rod
