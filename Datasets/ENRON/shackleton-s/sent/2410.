Stephanie:  Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

Please follow up with this guy.  Looks like he's in London.  We need to 
verify that he's with Harvard, either through Caroline or asking that he send 
a faxed request so that we can see the letterhead, etc.  Also, please keep 
track of the fully executed master.  Thanks.  Sara

Sarah
I have been speaking with Caroline Abramo regarding our trading relationship 
with the President & Fellows of Harvard College.  I am trying to obtain a 
copy of the ISDA that I understand has been signed with them.
I would be grateful if you could forward a copy of this to me.

Thanks for your help
