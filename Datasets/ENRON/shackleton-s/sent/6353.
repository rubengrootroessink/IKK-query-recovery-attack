3:30 Thursday, Central Time happens to fall exactly to the minute on a time 
when I have to be on the phone with Mark Haedicke and Elizabeth Sager.  I 
cannot move that time.  Can we go earlier or move it to Friday?  I am trying 
to get the cases to you as soon as I can. ----cgy

Does Mark have time in the afternoon to meet with me and Christian Yoder 
(Portland - 2 hours earlier than CST)?  The topic is "Washington State 
PUD's".  I'd schedule about an hour.  Thanks.
