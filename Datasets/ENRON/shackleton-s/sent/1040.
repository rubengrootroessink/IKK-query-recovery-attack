On March 9, Susan Flynn sent to Ing. Guillaume Rivron a memo regarding 
Process Agent (specifically, CT Corp.) and a form of certificate for Delivery 
of Documents.  This was copied to Martin Cassone and Julian Poole, both via 
fax.  Susan is out of the office most of this week.  SS

Brent, did we ever send further documents or papers to the people from 
Hinisa/Hidisa after the meeting we had?
I remember we arranged to send them something.
