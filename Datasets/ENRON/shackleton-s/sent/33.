 In regards to this trade, I talked with the trader, Randy Degner, about 
their confirmation.  He is in agreement on using our omnibus confirm since 
their confirmation was incorrect as far as referencing a Master Agreement .  
He would like to see if someone can speak with JoAnn Goza (316) 828-7169 in 
their Wichita office to establish a Master Agreement between KCI and ECT.

Thanks
