Monica:  Since our recent conversation, I thought that you were going to send 
me the entire format for the European format for the repos.  Also, have you 
had an opportunity to review the existing repo between Chase and Enron North 
America Corp. (formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) dated as of 
January 29, 1998?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara
