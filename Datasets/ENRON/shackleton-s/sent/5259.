Your language is fine.  I will get the bank info to you tomorrow.

We faxed back the confirm yesterday.  Our mgmt assistant did it.  If you need 
the name of the recipient, I can get that for you.

Dick:

After our conversation, I spoke with our settlements people again who
requested an EWEB invoice when Enron owes money to EWEB.  I propose that we
add a section to the Schedule entitled "Accounts" (Part 3(h)) as follows:

"Prior to each payment date for any Transaction, Party A (ENA) shall
provide Party B with an invoice reflecting the net payment owed by a party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party B shall provide Party A with an
invoice prior to any payment date on which Party A owes a net payment to
Party B.  With respect to all payments hereunder, and except as otherwise
directed in writing, the parties shall comply with the following payment
instructions:

[bank, account no., ABA no.]"

Please provide me with EWEB's account data and let me know if you have any
comments.  I'll send the blackline immediately after I hear from you.

Also, I have not received EXECUTED CONFIRMATIONS.  Have these been sent to
anyone at Enron?  Sara
