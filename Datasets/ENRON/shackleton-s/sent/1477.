Martin:  I wasn't certain if I sent you an email earlier today, but I am in 
need of current information regarding Swedish law, in connection with an ENA 
swap with a Swedish corporate.  I faxed our counsel (from the 1996 
derivatives survey) Advokatfirman Vinge KB to inquire about the 
enforceability of arbitration in ISDA agreements between US and Swedish 
parties.  Do you know the answer?  Or do you have any other suggestions?  We 
did a trade yesterday and I'm trying to document using a deemed ISDA.  I 
appreciate any help.  Regards.  Sara
