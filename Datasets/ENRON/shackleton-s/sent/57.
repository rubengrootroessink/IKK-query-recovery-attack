I have spoken with Carl and agreed to send him a draft Master gas sales 
agreement, together with ISDA documentation based upon the agreement that 
Carl says is already in place with ECT Houston.

Do you anticipate doing trades with Sempra in the future?  Please see below 
which indicates Sempra's desire for a master if that is the case.  Please let 
me know.
713-853-5294.

Thank you,
Jeff Sorenson

I suspect they plan to do deals there as they are trying to get Enron Corp to 
guaranty the UK entities.  Talk to Lee Munden (London Credit) as he has been 
managing the Sempra relationship over there.

Thanks,
Tanya

Credit needs to initiate (and it may have to be London credit) but Tanya 
Rohauer will know.  FYI - London told us that Sempra "will not trade with ECT 
International."   SS

If we anticipate having to document any trades under ECT International Carl 
Petersen is going to want a Master set up with that entity.  Who needs to 
initiate that?

Thanks,
Jeff
