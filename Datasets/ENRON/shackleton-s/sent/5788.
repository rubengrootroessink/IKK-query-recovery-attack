Hi, Steve:

We am preparing a form of assignment from ECT Investments, Inc. in favor of 
Enron North America Corp. whch will transfer several credit derivative 
Transactions.  I anticipate an attachment to the assignment which will 
identify the trades.  I believe that Bill Bradford (Ernon) and Mark 
Tarkington have discussed these trades and Bill is sending me the list.

Please let me know that you are aware of this request.  Thanks.
