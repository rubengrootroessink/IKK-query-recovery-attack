Tanya,

With regard to Credit's "initialling-off" on the Confirmation signature 
pages, that would be my call.  I know we have done so with some other 
structured deals.

So my apologies if this was not to be the case.  If you prefer, Brenda can 
run off new signature pages (where legal wil "initial-off" only).  The others 
can be destroyed.


Brenda,

Please run-off new pages, and I will get legal to initial-off only.


Cordially,

Brenda,

I am comfortable with the concept of the confirm you sent me; however, why 
are we not circulating the actual final confirmation with the signature 
pages?  The file you sent me still has a few blanks, etc.  I am not sure why 
credit is signing off on the confirm as this is not standard procedure. 
Please advise.

Thanks,
Tanya
