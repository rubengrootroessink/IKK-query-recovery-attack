I'll try to call you later (or vice-versa) about the memo.  Also, if you are 
willing, we'd love your participation in the credit/legal meeting.  SS

Sara:
Great news!  I will give her a call on Monday!  Hope all is going well.  
Again, I'm happy to participate in the legal/credit meeting on Tuesday by 
phone.  Alos, do we need to go through my memo?  Just call or e-mail me.
