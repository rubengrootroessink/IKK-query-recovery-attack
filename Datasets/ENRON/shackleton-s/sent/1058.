I have agreed, after much discussion with both Bradford and Per, that in the 
case of these two contracts only, we will agree to a collateral threshold of 
$0 for both ENA and the counterparty.  In addition, I have agreed to a 
rounding multiple of $250,000 and minimum transafer amount of $1.  Worksheet 
is attached.
