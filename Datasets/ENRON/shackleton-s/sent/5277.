Susan:  Please prepare a draft ISDA for the above parties with:  (1)  no CSA 
and (2)  bilateral cross-default at US$100 million.  I am presently reviewing 
CP comments to the ENA master and may have some changes for you tomorrow.  We 
will send this out on Tuesday.  

Clint:  First Union Securities Inc. is the bank's marketing arm and is NOT 
the correct ISDA counterparty.
