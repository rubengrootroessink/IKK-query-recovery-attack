I have a meeting at 230pm which just appeared yesterday afternoon for our Y2K 
project.
Afterwards, I resume my nymex checkout function from 3-5pm.
Could we meet on Monday or any day next week?

David

Hi, 
I enjoyed meeting with you yesterday. We are certainly grateful for your 
review and approval of 
new language for points which the traders initiate on a frequent basis. 

Let's select a day and time to review the large folder to ensure that the 
inventory process of capturing the
language is in place. I'm confident of our procedures and updating process, 
but will initiate a full review
of our current confirmation language. How about Friday, Nov. 12 or 19th to 
review the large folder and compare it 
to our comprehensive list of pub codes?

From our discussion on Catalytica, it appears that the current arrangement 
regarding
the deal in progress, setup as a spark spread option, was arranged to be an 
off-balance sheet activity. 

During my research yesterday on the Internet regarding Catalytica, I learned 
that their Board of Directors
has two Enron leaders, Tom White and John Urquhart.

David
