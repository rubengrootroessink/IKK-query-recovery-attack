Mark:  I just received a copy of my "IOU/municipal" chart from last year with 
an undated note from you about our omnibus format/IOU's.  I would like to 
speak with you especially since I'm speaking with credit about municipals on 
Wednesday.

As a practical matter, I'm not sure whether we even transact with utilities 
on the omnibus.  Perhaps Tana can answer the question as to online trading 
and the confirmation desk as to offline trading.  Secondly, I'm not sure how 
often the Additional Event of Default is successfully negotiated into the 
ISDA Agreement.  The latter point might be worth an email to the lawyers. 

Do you have a few minutes today?
