Ed & Brant:

I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.  Brant 
prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.  ENE 
"represents" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on 
behalf of those utilities.  I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure 
that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.

Ed, Shari suggested that you may have some insight into ENE.  Should I drop 
this one altogether?  Or are we interested in pursuing?

Either Ed or Brant please let me know.  Thanks.
