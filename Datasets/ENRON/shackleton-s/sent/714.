RECAP:  This is Project Moosehead.  After the meeting, we determined that the 
transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption.  The Fixed 
Price is the premium.  The Strike is the Cap Price (remember, strikes are for 
options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals).  We'll need to revise 
today to send in the morning.  CP is "Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.".  
Enron party normally is ENA but we may change to EPMI and create a new ISDA 
Master for the deal.  There must be a zero floor (ie, no negative payments in 
the other direction).  Don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may 
eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal. 

Could you begin revising?  Also, do the calculations work?  Please feel free 
to call me as I'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes 
on.  SS

Sara,

If it's a Cap, is the Fixed Price then the Strike Price?  I think the format 
looks good.  I would prefer a "Notice of Exercise" provision, but it's not 
necessary.

Thanks,
Joe

I think that this transaction is called "Project Moosehead".  I have a 
meeting on it this morning.  Please comment to the draft I sent to you 
yesterday.  I don't know if the structure works.  I couldn't decide upon the 
format; it also looks like a cap.  Thanks.  SS
