I am negotiating an ISDA on behalf of ENA with an Australian corporate 
insisting upon a legal opinion (enforceability) with respect to the Enron 
Corp. guaranty.  Is this a customary request by Australian corporates that 
you would normally grant?  If so, who has issued the opinion?  I look forward 
to your reply.  Regards.  Sara
