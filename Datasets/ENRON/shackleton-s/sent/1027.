I apoligize for not getting back with you sooner.  I thought I already did.  
As you can see from the fast response to your call today, I had already 
marked up your draft, but forgot to send it to you.  Here it is.

Attached is a clean and redline version of your document with Enron North
America Corp.'s suggested changes.  Please call me to discuss when you have
had an opportunity to review.  Also, does your document contain "coding"
information?  I was a bit confused by some of the characters appearing in
your version.  Regards.  Sara
