Chuck:  I am currently in our Buenos Aires office for the week.  I have to 
resolve our few issues when I return to Houston.  I can tell you, however, 
that we cannot agree to provide you with the legal opinion as to 
enforceability as we discussed in our conversation last week.  I'll follow up 
with you next week.  Sara

Sara,

     Just a quick note to see where we stand.  Please drop me a line when
you have a moment.
