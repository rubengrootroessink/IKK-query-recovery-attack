Susan:  We are going to open a futures account with Bank One.  They have also 
sent a give up agreement.  This message is FYI.

Sara,
Thanks again for your time Thursday.
Attached is the standard give-up agreement we discussed, with the
governing law changed to New York.
Please let me know when you have finished looking it over.  If you wish,
I'd be happy to prepare them and send to you.
Regards,
Jim Naughton
