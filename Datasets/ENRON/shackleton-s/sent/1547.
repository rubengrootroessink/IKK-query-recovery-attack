David:

Thank you for the email.  I left a message for you to call (let me know 
what's convenient and I'll make myself available) because we were trying to 
make the language generic enough to include all future products which might 
fall into this category.  We considered the following:

Alternative 1:  "For purposes of any Transaction in a Commodity for which 
there is either no market or for which the market is illiquid, Party B 
recognizes that (i) this market is less liquid than other OTC derivatives 
markets; . . ."   

Alternative 2:  "For purposes of any Transaction in which the relevant 
Commodity is traded in a market that is newer or less liquid than other OTC 
derivatives markets, Party B recognizes that (i) such market is newer or less 
liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; . . . "

We also considered adding some type of statement that specifies newer 
products without limiting future applicability (i.e.. "including but not 
limited to paper and pulp").  Also, "newer market" may not mean illiquid.  
"No market" could mean that we are the only market maker.

Your language places the onus on us to continually identify these illiquid 
products either in the Schedule, by amendment to the Schedule or in a 
separate writing.
Can we please discuss?  I am free all afternoon.  Thanks.  Sara
