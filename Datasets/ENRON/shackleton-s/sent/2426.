Richard:

I have spoken with Jeff Blumenthal (US tax) about your request as I think he 
would be better suited to provide your advice.  Jeff cannot make your 
conference call tomorrow but I have forwarded to him this message and your 
diagrams from last week.  If you could provide Jeff with a short description 
of any issues, he will be glad to respond this week. 

Thanks.  Sara
