Jeff/Laurel

Please find attached the Trade Confirmation and Schedule to the ISDA Master 
Agreement.

Please print up the Trade Confirmation, sign and fax to the counterparty at 
the number below.

In regard to the Schedule - two copies should be printed.  The Schedule 
should then be attached to the printed form of  ISDA Master Agreement.  I 
have left a voicemail for Sara Shackelton - Sara should be able to provide 
this to you.  Page 18 of the ISDA Master Agreement and  page 29 of the 
Schedule should then be signed.  

Page  1, Page 18 of the ISDA Master Agreement and all pages of the Schedule 
should then be faxed to the counterparty at the number below.  Later this 
evening I would be grateful if you could courier both copies of the ISDA 
Master Agreement & Schedule to the counterparty at the address below with a 
covering letter requesting that one original copy be returned to me duly 
signed.

Please call Ed Newman once you have sent the docs.

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Tks,

Denis
