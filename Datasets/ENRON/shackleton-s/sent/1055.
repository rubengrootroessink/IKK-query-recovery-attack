Subject: ISDA Master


Phil Morley asked me to follow up on the status of the ISDA Master.  I think
you have everything you needed from me--please let me know if I'm wrong.
Phil would like us to proceed with finalizing the form of the ISDA master
even if the pulp plant purchase is not scheduled until June.  I look forward
to hearing from you.  Thanks.
