I received a call from Jay Boudreaux (CTG group working with paper & pulp) 
about presenting "agreements" to the lender (Paribas) for review in 
connection with the loan for construction of the mill.  I know that Jarrod 
has prepared "draft confirms" for these companies but I don't know if anyone 
has raised the ISDA issue.  Sounds like too many hands in the pot but the 
bank may really need to see Master Swap Agreements.  Let me know if this has 
already been addressed.  Thanks.  Sara
