Dear Sara,

As you requested, attached is a clean copy of the NDA between ECT and w-T, 
reflecting the changes we have agreed to.
Please have it executed and faxed back to 212-406-1694, to my attention, 
after which I will return to you a fully
executed copy.

Thanks for you assistance in getting this done.

Best regards,
