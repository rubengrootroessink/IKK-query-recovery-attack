Internet Stock Index             +32.33     +3.37%     991.92

Blue chips powered forward and sent the Dow higher on Tuesday,
while Internet and tech stocks thrust the Nasdaq to another
record high as investors put away their fears about market
volatility and potential interest rate hikes by the Fed.

Several sectors that had been suffering from beaten-down stocks
rallied back today, including the financial services sector, as
several brokerage firms outperformed.  Lehman Brothers
(NYSE:LEH) closed up 4 3/4 (+7.00%) to 72 9/16, Goldman Sachs
(NYSE:GS) gained 4 (+4.55%) to 92, National Discount Brokers
Group (NYSE:NDB) soared 45.77% (up 14 3/16) to 45 3/16, Merrill
Lynch (NYSE:MER) rose 5 3/8 (+5.54%) to 102 5/16, JP Morgan
(NYSE:JPM) closed up 2 5/8 (+2.41%) to 111 3/8, and Charles
Schwab (NYSE:SCH) jumped 12.23% (up 4 9/16) to 41 7/8.

Oil service stocks also had a strong day on Wall Street as gas
is trading at its highest levels since the Gulf War and as crude
oil prices continue to skyrocket.  Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) gained
3 5/16 (+9.50%) to 38 3/16, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) rose 4 1/2
(+6.50%) to 73 3/4, Transocean Offshore (NYSE:RIG) closed up 3
1/16 (+8.52%) to 39, Cooper Cameron (NYSE:CAM) gained 2 5/16
(+4.36%) to 55 5/16, and Smith International (NYSE:SII) rose 2
3/4 (+4.58%) to 62 3/4.

Merger-mania continued in the media and entertainment sectors as
Clear Channel Communications (NYSE:CCU), the U.S. radio and
billboard giant, and SFX Entertainment (NYSE:SFX), a provider of
live entertainment shows, jointly announced that Clear Channel
will acquire SFX in a deal valued at approximately $2.7 billion.
By expanding Clear Channel's presence in areas such as concerts,
sporting events and theatrical productions in more than half of
the top 50 U.S. markets, the acquisition is expected to result
in greater value for Clear Channel's 1,000 radio stations
worldwide.  Shares of Clear Channel fell 8 1/4 (-10.97%) to 66
15/16, shares of SFX edged up 9/16 (+1.48%) to 38 9/16, while
shares of other media and entertainment players had a great day
on Wall Street, with Seagram (NYSE:VO) gaining 5/8 (+1.11%) to
56 3/4, Viacom (NYSE:VIA) closing up 5 9/16 (+11.10%) to 55
11/16, and CBS (NYSE:CBS) jumping 11.85% (up 6 5/16) to 59 9/16.

Two Dow giants entered into a ground-breaking agreement on
Tuesday, as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and General Electric (NYSE:GE)
jointly announced that they will begin the production of two
state-of-the-art lines of long-range jet aircrafts, including
the world's longest-range airplane that would be capable of
flying nonstop from New York to as far as Malaysia.  The
companies designed the new twin-engine jets in an effort to
compete more effectively with a new airplane from Europe's
Airbus Industrie.  The first deliveries of the new jets are
scheduled for September 2003.  Shares of Boeing dropped 3/16 (-
0.51%) to 36 13/16, while shares of General Electric gained 3
9/16 (+2.75%) to 133.

In other Dow action:

<> International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-
Packard (NYSE:HWP) were selected by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)

provide subsidized computers to its workers.  Shares of IBM fell
2 5/16 (-2.21%) to 102 3/16, while shares of Hewlett-Packard
closed up 6 15/16 (+5.38%) to 135 13/16.

its fight to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's
proposals geared towards regulating the tobacco industry.

<> Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares closed up 3/4 (+2.29%) to 33
1/2 on the heels of Monday's announcement by the entertainment

The Nasdaq's surge resulted in several record highs during the
day's trading for a broad range of Internet and tech stocks,
including Brocade Communications (Nasdaq:BRCD), which gained 6
1/16 (+2.14%) to 289 1/8, Applied Mirco Circuits (Nasdaq:AMCC),
which rose 19 5/8 (+7.68%) to 275 1/16, PMC-Sierra
(Nasdaq:PMCS), which closed up 14 5/16 (+8.01%) to 193 1/16, COR

(+7.10%) to 166 15/16, and Motorola (NYSE:MOT), which rose 11
13/16 (+7.45%) to 170 5/16.

Chip stocks were a driving force behind the Nasdaq's strong
performance, as analysts and investors anticipate a huge demand
for computer memory chips to run wireless products such as hand-
held organizers and cellular telephones.  Altera (Nasdaq:ALTR)
closed up 8 1/4 (+11.54%) to 79 3/4, Lam Research (Nasdaq:LRCX)
jumped 13.08% (up 18 1/16) to 156 1/8, Xilinx (Nasdaq:XLNX)
gained 13.52% (up 9 1/2) to 79 3/4, KLA Tencor (Nasdaq:KLAC)
rose 8 1/8 (+11.64%) to 77 15/16, and Rambus (Nasdaq:RMBS)
soared 25.16% (up 60 5/8) to 301 5/8.

Leading Tuesday's telecom news was the announcement by TeleCorp
PCS (Nasdaq:TLCP), AT&T Corp.'s (NYSE:T) largest wireless
telephone partner, that it will acquire Tritel Inc.
(Nasdaq:TTEL), AT&T's #2 wireless affiliate, in a transaction
valued at $5 billion.  The deal would result in a combined
company having a contiguous wireless network running from the
Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.  Pursuant to the agreement,
AT&T will obtain TeleCorp's existing wireless operations in the
Boston area in exchange for $100 million in cash, as well as
wireless licenses and rights to acquire licenses in Iowa and
Wisconsin.  Shares of TeleCorp fell 8 1/16 (-14.93%) to 45
15/16, shares of Tritel catapulted 32.29% (up 7 3/4) to 31 3/4
and shares of AT&T gained 4 7/16 (+9.86%) to 49 7/16.

In other telecom action, Amdocs Ltd. (NYSE:DOX), a leading
provider of integrated customer care and billing systems for
wireless telecom operators and service providers, announced on
Tuesday that it would acquire billing and customer care software
maker Solect Technology Group in a deal valued at about $1
billion.  The move by Amdocs is expected to strengthen the
company's presence in the market for billing and customer care
software for the Internet.  Shares of Amdocx jumped 13.26% (up 8
11/16) to 74 3/16.

America Online (NYSE:AOL) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) jointly
announced on Tuesday that the companies will open up their cable
television systems to other Internet service providers upon the
completion of their blockbuster merger.  The move was seen by
analysts as a potential catalyst for the rest of the industry to
follow suit.  Specifically, the pledge to give customers greater
choices could put tremendous pressure on long-distance phone and
cable television operators, including telecom giant AT&T, to
further open their systems to rival Web-access providers.
Shares of AOL, the #1 Internet service provider, fell 1 11/16 (-
2.78%) to 58 15/16, while shares of Time Warner, the world's
biggest media company, dropped 1 3/16 (-1.37%) to 85 1/2.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors
included:

<> 3Com (Nasdaq:COMS), which jumped 23.95% (up 18 15/16) to 98
on tremendous demand for the spin-off of the company's Palm
unit.  3Com increased the price range for Palm's IPO to $30-$32
per share from $14-$16 per share.  The public offering of 23
million shares could now generate as much as $736 million.

<> SpeedUs.com (Nasdaq:SPDE), which skyrocketed 136.69% (up 11
7/8) to 20 9/16, riding on the wave of popularity among
investors of wireless handheld device manufacturers and services
providers.

<> Redback Networks (Nasdaq:RBAK), which jumped 21 1/4 (+7.66%)
to 298 1/2 following yesterday's positive remarks from Lehman
Brothers.

Leading Internet and tech stocks performed as follows:

It was an explosive day in the IPO market today, with 3 much-
anticipated IPOs beginning to trade on a strong day in the
overall equity markets.  Leading the way was Net.genesis
(Nasdaq:NTGX), a provider of e-customer intelligence solutions,
whose shares surged 215.63%.  Another winner was Avenue A
(Nasdaq:AVEA), an online advertising firm, which bolted 200.00%
in its debut.  Finally, NIKU (Nasdaq:NIKU), a provider of
Internet solutions for the sourcing, management and delivery of
professional services soared 187.50% in its IPO after its
pricing range was raised from $10-$12 to $20-$22, which is
usually an indication that the underwriters expect strong demand
for the offering.

Continuing on today's momentum, there is a host of companies set
to go public during the rest of the week, including the much-
hyped IPO of Palm Inc. (Nasdaq:PALM), the provider of handheld
computing devices and spin off of 3Com (Nasdaq:COMS).
