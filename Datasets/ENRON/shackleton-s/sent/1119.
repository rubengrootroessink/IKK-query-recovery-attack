Please excuse the delay but I was hoping to deliver all of my information to 
you at once.  I am attaching our latest generic Schedule format.  You will 
see our "No Reliance" and "Limitation of Liability" provisions included.  
None of our confirmation templates contain non-reliance provisions (unless it 
is specifically added by an attorney for a particular Transaction).

Unfortunately, I  do not yet have an answer as to the existence of written 
guidelines or policy addressing the provision of  quotes to customers.  I 
will follow up when I have the response.

Please let me know if you need more information or if we need to conference.  
Regards.  Sara
