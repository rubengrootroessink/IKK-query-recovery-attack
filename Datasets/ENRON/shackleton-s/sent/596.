I spoke with Robert Nuernberg (inhouse legal) who acknowledged that company 
has authority to trade financially.  ENA will send ISDA master to company 
which will also offer up new resolution or legal opinion.  We can do a 
one-month deal and book on our short form omnibus.  Call if you have any 
questions.  Sara
