Sara,

Carol and Rod are working on the ISDA comparison for a potential ISDA between 
ENA and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  Last week, Cregg Lancaster furnished 
Reliant's newest form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 for our review.  You may 
want to visit with Carol as to the status.

Also, it is my understanding that once we have the ISDA between ENA and 
Reliant in place, that that form of agreement would be used for the ECC and 
Reliant Canada agreement (with the exception of the provisions specific to 
Canadian entities).

Hope this explanation help.

Susan

FYI new request.  What about our master tax agreement?

Sara, I didn't realize that Shari had left the financial swap group.  She 
just sent me an e-mail telling me that she thought you were handling the 
negotiation of ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, so I thought I would forward 
this message I sent to Tana today for your information.

Thanks

Greg

Tana, I received a request this week from Jannalyn Galloway of Reliant Energy 
Services Canada, Ltd. to commence the process of putting an ISDA in place 
between Enron Canada Corp. and Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  We 
recently finalized a Master Physical Agreement between these parties and I 
was wondering if you could commence the process of obtaining credit approval 
to do the ISDA and provide a draft to Jannalyn.  Her fax number is 
713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as 
above.

Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me 
know.

Greg
