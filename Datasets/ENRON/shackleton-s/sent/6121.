Chris:

We should chat.  Per the ISDA, ENA is the calc agent and we have already 
agreed to usual Market Disruption Events and fallbacks in the ISDA.  If you 
want to change the ISDA agreement, then we can consider the items which 
Merchant has included in the draft.

As calc agent, we should create a draft and send the form to you for review.  
However, I do need you to explain/verify Floating Price B.  And verify 
rounding convention which differs from our standard.

Please call to discuss.

Sara:

I am looking at a transaction with MErchant Energy Group.  We have an ISDA 
with them.  It is a financial tolling deal where we will be a fixed price 
payor for power and gas and we will pay them an option premium.  They 
forwarded the attached pro forma to illustrate how the deal would be 
papered.  Can you please review the attached and let me know if it looks OK 
or what changes are required?  They indicated an interest to transact late 
this week or early next.
