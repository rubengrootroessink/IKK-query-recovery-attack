 Lynn and I arrived safely in Houston and the weather seems much like

Hi All,
For those of you that don't know I am currently on a 7 week trip through
Africa, from Nairobi to Vic Falls, with my brother John-Henry. This will be
our means of updating all you boring non-traveller types of our adventures.
We arrived yesterday safe and well in Nairobi. We were tired, but had a full

day visiting an animal orphanage that raised these animals and set them back

into the wild. We were very priviledged to pet baby elephants, rhino and
zebra. We had a meeting of the folks we are travelling with and they all
seem really nice. All in their early 20's and I think I am mingling in well.

There are 8 of us on a truck made for 20 so lots of room. Last night we went

to a carvery that specialised in the local wildlife. Crocs, Zebra, antelope
that sort of thing. Today has been a long drive into Tanzania, to a place
called Arusha, from here we go off on a 3 day game drive over the serengeti.

We are staying in a place called Snakepark, which is a little unnerving, but

hell thats what we are here for.
We are both fit, well, happy and a little pink. I gave the first of those
little toys out today mum, there was a ?3yr old when we stopped for
charcoal. It took her a few minutes to touch the wiggling frog, but she
loved it. I had to bribe the others with pens so they didn't snatch it off
her. We are off now to eat as we skipped lunch and it is about 4.30pm.
Love to you all
Tessa and J-H

Hey Folks,

How is old blightey!!!
What a week J-H and I have had.
The 3 day safari around the Serengetti and Ngorongoro Crater was fantastic.
The 8 of us were split between 2 landrovers, that the rooves came off so we
had a really good view. We saw loads of game, basically everything. I was
most impressed with the 7 rhino - ok so 6 of them were in the distance and
we only knew they were rhino by looking through nans fantastic binoculars, a

quick thankyou to nan for lending them to me. And 6 cheetahs as I had seen
niether on my previous safari. Other things included 2 eagles eating an
impala up a tree, a leopard must have killed it and taken it up there, we
sat and watched a very bossy male zebra organising this whole herd of zebra
in and out of a watering hole in groups. Also elephant, lions - lots,
especially 11 sat on a large rock together, hippos, hyena, wildebeast,
warthogs, waterbuffalow, crocodile. I have probably left loads out, but you
get the drift, J-H made a list. In the evenings we camped and you will all
get to here J-h's story of the lion, but it is his story - niether lion nor
boy were harmed.
I will have to finish this tomorrow as I have loads more to say, but I have
to meet my group for a sunset beer.
Thanks Mandy for passing all this on. Give mum our love and reassure her
that J-H is really coming into his own.
Ross- don't you dare start lecturing me about settling down, you are only
doing it now and you are a dinosaur compared to me.

Love you all loads, and thanks for the replies.

Tessa

Ok Folks,
Where was I?
If you are interested we just made sunset last night and had a very welcome
cold beer.
Back to the adventure! The campsites we say in vary hugely, we range from
ones with just a hole in the ground toilet facility - like the one in the
Serengetti, to ones with proper toilets, showers with warmish water and
fully stocked bars!! In the Serengetti we were very close to nature. Too
close, we all went to bed early - this seems to be a bit of a trend, bed
before 10 most nights and up at 6, we have even made it up before sunrise a
few times. But the stories going between tents in the serengetti were of the

campers that have been lost to lions. Sure enough we certainly saw evidence
of their presence in the camp when we got up in the morning, even without
J-H's story. The next night after a long game drive, we camped on the edge
of the Ngorongoro crater, a bit windy, but warm, then as soon as the sun
went down it was bitterly cold and we huddled round the fire to eat our
supper, but all retreated to our sleeping bags soon after. It actually
turned out to be the best night sleep some of us had, especially as I always

find a lumpy bit of ground. I share a tent with a girl from Huddersfield
called Helen and we have the putting up and dismantling of the tent down to
a fine art.
The crater was fantastic, very bumpy and we were being thrown around the
back of the landrover as the driver did his best to get in front of a Rhino,

he did a brilliant job and it meant that the rhino passed by really closely.

That evening we went back to the snake park, to find our intrepid leaders
had finished doing some work on the truck. We were all desperate for
showers, even though you get dusty and mucky again very quickly it is lovely

for a while. We tried our best to wash our clothes, and managed to get the
semi clean. Since then Helen and I have discovered that it is easier to pay
a local to clean them properly and it only costs 15p for a pair of trousers.
The next day we played with the snakes for a while in the morning, they have

a baby pyhton we are allowed to hold, then J-H had a ride on a camel.
We went into Arusha to do a few things and stayed at a campsite the other
side of town, just to knock 20mins of the journey the next day. The cooking
has become a bit of a competition, J-H and I did the first dinner, rice and
stir fried veggies. Everyone thought it was great and it set a challenge for

the others, so people get a bit worried before its their turn. Since we did
just veggies, people have been adding meats, doing selection of salads,
cooking the rice with cashew nuts. It is getting like Ready Steady Cook,
when they started the chefs only did maincourses, now they do 5 course
dinners!!
We started the next day at 4.30am, it is a long drive from Arusha to Dar Es
Salaam, but we got to see the best sunrise over mount Kilimanjaro. During
these drives we are very pleased to be a select group, cos it means we get
to spread out and sleep. When we don't sleep it is really interesting to
watch the world go by and wave at the locals. They must be used to seeing
the trucks as quite a few do the same route, ours is the scruffiest - we are

very proud.
The campsite in Dar was right on the beach, we all ran in fora swim mand
gave up after we were over 100 yards in and syill only knee deep.
We had a morning in Dar and took the afternoon ferry over to Zanzibar. We
all fell deeply in love, it is the most beautiful place. We are staying in a

hotel here, Helen and I were in raptures over the ensuite bathroom and
airconditioning. We showered quickly and went off for dinner. In Stone Town
there is an evening market that is mainly selling cooked food, so you wander

down and take your pick. The first night I had tuna, squid and lobster, to
give you and idea, the lobster cost me about 80p. The group decided there
and then that we are setting up a commune here and turning our back on
civilisation.
Anywhere I can dine nightly on lobster gets my vote. We went on a spice tour

of the island yesterday, they grow everything from nutmeg to chilli to
cumerin. And all the fruit, bannanas, star fruit, mangos, pineapple, apples,

lemons etc etc, eat home even has their own tree that produces iodine for
any cuts they may get.
Obviously we went back to the market for dinner, J-H has challenged himself
to try and eat 5000 shillings worth - about 4 pounds, so far he is up to
3000. Today is a lazy day, postcards will be written etc. Tomorrow we are
off to stay at a deserted beach on the east of the island. This has been a
long e-mail - mainly for the family - cause the internet places will be few
and far between when we hit Malawi next week, so you may not here from us
for a week or 2. We will try whenever we can.
Love to all in breezy old England
Tessa

Dear All,

This is our last day in Zanzibar. We have just come back from the East
coast. It was very pretty, with few tourists or hotels. Unfortunately this
made the food and drinks more exspensive - ok, so we may only be talking
about 8p, but we are in cheap-sake travelling mood. There was also not a lot

to do, so it was 2 days of lying in the shade - the sun being too hot -
reading, playing cards and looking for shells on the beach. Boy what a tough

life I have!!
Our swahili is up to about 8 or so words.
Jambo - hello
Habari - how are you
Mizuri - beautiful
Mizuri-sana - very beautiful
Santa-sana - thankyou very much
Karibu - welcome
Fiti-Fiti - slang for very well
Thats about it.
Today we went to swim with the dolphins on the south coast. Apparently
nobody informed the dolphins and only a couple of pods turned up and they
were not in the playing mood. We got quite close to them and as soon as
anyone jumped into the water they were off - honestly you just can't get the

dolphins!!
Then we snorkelled on the reef for a while, there seemed to be quite a bit
of damage. I was really annoyed by a fella that kept diving underneath me
and picking things off the coral. Some people are sooo ignorant - sorry
Ulli, I love you to pieces - but they were bloody Germans.
We have our last meal at the harbour stalls tonight and take the 10pm ferry
back to Dar. Because of some silly rule they won't let us into Dar until
6am, so we kip on board ship.
Then we are back to our wonderfully dusty old truck and more bush camps.
As I said before Malawi is very poor and unlikely to have lots of internet
cafes so it may be a week or 2 before the next one.

Loads of Love
Tessa

Dear All,

Welcome back mum and dad, hope India was fab. The gang over here think the
Weltons are trying to take over the world.
Well, it has been a long time since the last update. This is due to Malawi
being a very friendly but poor country.
The adventures in the last 9 days are too much to go into too much detail.
The partying started in ernest at Lake Malawi, up until then the driver
thought we were a little slow, I was up late, but everyone else was flaking.

Our first big night the weltons did well, winning a drinking game each and
not being any of the 3 people that passed out. The next big night a few days

later we didn't do so well, the other boys think it is very amusing to get
J-H plastered and they have found 2 drinking games that he is really bad at.

He has even started praticing on the truck as we travel around. That night
though was a bad taste night and we had all had a budget and went to a
clothes market and bought each other outfits. Everyone was hoping I looked
bad, but a very nice unimaginative bloke just bought me an overall, I was
disappointed. All the lads had frocks, J-H had a fetching orange silky
blouse and silky skirt, he looked surprisingly fetching. Slightly less so
when passed out on the toilets 3 hrs later, or passed out on the floor in
front of the toilets, and he annoyed a few people when he woke up at 4.30 am

demanding to know where the party was - loudly. Apart from the parties we
have seen and done other things we have visited a school, a hospital, a
mountain or 2, had a tribal village meal and a brewery. That last one was
really tough. The gang are getting on really well, some how a hitch-hiker
has joined us, but he's cool. We had a couple of days of heavy rain, so
people were getting fed up with the tents, the mozzies have been on great
form, but its Africa and we love it. The crew have been trying to persuade
us to stay till Cape Town and if I didn't have fixed plans I would be here a

few more months. I shall return.
Now we are in Harare the capital of Zim. Just to make any of you sports
lovers sick, we have found out where the England cricket team are and will
be going to their hotel to watch the 6-nations rugby this pm and supporting
them in their one day against Zim tomorrow. As I said its a hard life. Last
night we went to a local night club and the band were amazing and still
going when we left at 3.30 am. I have just enough time to do a spot of
shopping before going to find Goughie and the boys.
I have probably left loads out, but nevermind, you are all going to have to
listen to my stories anyway.
Tessa
