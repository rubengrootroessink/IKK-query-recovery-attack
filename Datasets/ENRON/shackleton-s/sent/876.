It sure sounds like you have your hands full with the restructuring!  I have 
been trying to get a better grasp of the deal flow in Brazil through some 
type of "Deal Report".  In Houston and Argentina, the business groups 
circulate a transaction listing.  Also, legal in both Houston and Argentina 
circulate a listing from Legal's perspective. Is a commercial team deal 
report circulated weekly in Brazil, and if so, can I be added to the 
circulation?  I will ask Randy if he can circulate his list.  It would be 
helpful for me when we have our weekly conference call.  In that regard, what 
is "Alcan", the PPA which may eventually serve as a template?  I am glad to 
prepare some type of module as Randy suggested which sets forth basic Enron 
Corp. and/or trading policy as to certain issues (force majeure, governing 
law, dispute resolution, damages, etc.),  Let's coordinate for the seminar 
which you are organizing for March.  Thanks.  Sara
