Carol:

(1)  see Tanya's note re:  Occidental

(2)  I think I negotiated either a confirm or Schedule with a Trust (I'll try 
to find).  Of course, there are lots of structured deals with Trusts.

(3)  I don't have strong feelings about the offsite - but I'd vote for the 
a.m. rather than change the legal credit seminar to accommodate the offsite.

Nova Scotia Power  - this was pending a credit wkst from me.  Weather desk 
was pursuing - I have not heard anything out of them regarding this customer 
and have not seen any trades other than the one.  Brent may have heard 
more...If not, I am game with removing until the commercial team resurrects.

Occidental - I agree it has not moved forward.  We can take off the list, but 
I will ask Brant/Jay to pursue on our end.

Tanya:

After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following:

(1)  Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as "credit review".  Should this 
remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?

(2)  Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new "Forest Oil" of the 
list so I say let's forget it.  No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest 
draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.  Further, she 
cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.

Please let me know what you would like to do.
