We may find out today so hold the Master.  We are waiting for Lehman to 
revise the confirm and the Lehman trader (Paul Rosica) was going to "clean 
up" behind his attorney to make sure that there are really not any other 
changes to the Schedule!  Paul has been traveling for the last two days and 
should be back in the office today.  Clint Freeland (our trader) will let us 
know more.  SS

Sara,

We revised the Master to include the Moody's ratings.  Do I need to send it 
to Lehman or hold onto it for now?  I think you were going to call the Lehman 
trader to discuss.

Thanks.
