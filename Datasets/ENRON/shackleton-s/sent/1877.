What a miserable "friend" I am!  I would love to meet you and Donna anytime 
at all.  Please let me know.  I have been running around like crazy.  We are 
understaffed and I work too hard.  Also, I had to take a week off in mid-July 
to rescue my mom who ended up in a hospital in Salisbury, England while 
attempting to attend the funeral of a cousin.  Mother is fine.  I (on the 
other hand) do not take a vacation until October and I hope to live.  Maybe 
you and Donna want to come over one night and raid my wine cellar.  That 
would be fun for a change.  We could pick up food from Eatzi's or wherever.  
Can't wait to hear from you.  Sara

I had a very delightful lunch today with a dear friend of yours, Donna
Mullen of Dominion. Paul Dunning introduced me to her at the AAPL in New
Orleans, and she was nice enough to attend a dinner I hosted at Antoines
during the convention. We want to have lunch with you. Are you free for
lunch at all next week. We will come downtown to meet you. Sorry I
missed you last week during my break from the South Texas Mineral Law
CLE seminar. Mary Ogden, a good friend, showed me your office and
introduced me to some of your co-workers. Everyone says you are the
best. It is nice to be able to say that I am a friend of Sara's from New
Orleans and watch everyone's face light up. You and Julia have a great
group of co-workers there.

I hope you and the hounds are well.

Carson
