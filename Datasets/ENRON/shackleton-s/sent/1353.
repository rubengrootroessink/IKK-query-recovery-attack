Jarrod:  Attached is a "form" letter for you to send (with adjustments as 
indicated) or let me know and I will sign and send with the Vitol confirms.   
Separately, I have faxed to you the first page changes.  Call if you have 
questions.  Please be sure that we have included the additional reps.  Sara
