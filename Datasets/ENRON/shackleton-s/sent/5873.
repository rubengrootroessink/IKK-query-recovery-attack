Stewart:

I spoke with Rawleigh White (Tribal CFO) and the Tribe's outside counsel the 
other day.  Pending receipt of Tracy's credit worksheet, I'll send the 
Tribe/lawyers a "sample ISDA without credit" which is not specific to the 
Tribe.  The lawyers will begin to determine if the Tribe is an "eligible 
contract participant" for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Rawleigh wants to know if Enron is interested in helping the Tribe finance 
the purchase of the two dams.  Can you please address for West Origination 
and respond to Raleigh?

Thanks.
