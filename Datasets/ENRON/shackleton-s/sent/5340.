Sam:  We need to send Sharen Cason the Deemed ISDA format to reconfirm this 
transaction.  It is a domestic deal and I'd like to review your template 
before sending to Sharen.  Please email to me on Monday so that we can send 
to Sharen.  Thanks.  Sara

Hello Sara,  Sharen Cason can be reached at 3-3001 and Kimberly Hundl at 
3-1647.

Sharen and Kimberly, One of the financial paralegals (Stephanie Panus, Susan 
Bailey, or Samantha Boyd) will be sending you a different template format in 
order to send a revised confirm to Cargill (deal # 495432.01).  The template 
is called a deemed ISDA.  They want to change the format of the confirmation 
letter that we already sent them.  Sara will want to see this before it is 
sent out.  Call and find me in Portland if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Melissa
