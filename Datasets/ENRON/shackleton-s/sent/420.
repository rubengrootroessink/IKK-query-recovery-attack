I have a 1998 opinion which addresses only a few issues but it's a start.  
Let me know if we should proceed further.  SS

Sara,

I got an inquiry from a South African country today.  Off the top of your 
head do you know anything about our ability to do derivatives in that 
country.  I'm just wondering if you have any ready info...i.e. at this point 
it would not merit any incremental research.

Thanks,

Bob
