Thanks for the info.  I don't need anything further.  Also, thanks for your 
assistance last week and continued attention to our legal group.  Sara

This was part of a normal maintenance program that moves groups of messages 
with large attachments from one point to another. David is a Notes 
administrator.  The return receipt was  a side effect of the message moving.  
I can give you more details if you need them. Please let me know.

Thanks

Mark Davidson

David-

Sara Shackleton sent mail out to four EI people.  She got a return receipt 
from you.  You were not on the address list.  Can you please explain how she 
received a return receipt from you?

Thanks

Mark Davidson
