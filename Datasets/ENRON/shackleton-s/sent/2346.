		 Subject: Holiday Luncheon Sign-Up

Please don't forget to sign-up to bring a dish for our Holiday Luncheon on 
Thursday, November 17.  The turkey is provided but we need more volunteers to 
bring the side dishes.  The luncheon is always a lot of fun!!  There is  a 
sign-up sheet in each kitchen.
