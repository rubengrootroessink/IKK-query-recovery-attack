Sara- I'm disappointed that you described hearing from me as only a "small
pleasure" since I've always heard that size DOES matter. Do you disagree? I
am living in Atlanta ( very calmly as compared to Livin La Vida Loca as you
are. Leica is doing wonderfully and is still a great dog. I still have the
Corky's in New Orleans and 13 Wendy's in Florida with John Casey as my
partner. What kind of new car did you get? I'll show you mine if you'll show
me yours! My Mom is doing fine. Jill has been married for about 3 years,
Richard is doing his residency and getting married in Cleveland next month,
and Karen is a dietician ( those are Beverly's kids, in case you've
forgotten). Bev is dating a guy for several years and Helen is divorced and
living alone ( I hope) in Pensacola. How is your entire family? Why didn't
you invite me to S.America with you? Forget the lame excuse and just invite
me on the next trip-like the usual family trip at year-end!! Call if you can
be nice to me and come visit me or invite me to visit you!   Sam
