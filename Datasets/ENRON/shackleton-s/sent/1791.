Sara,

Can we trade with counter-parties in Chile??  We have a strong credit in 
Chile that wants to purchase an 18 month financial swap for newsprint.  See 
note below for more in.  Let me know what we need to do...

Thanks.

Ed Quinn

Ed

The full name of the company is Empresas CMPC based in Chile

web site is www.cmpc.cl 

There might be a problem with the site only being in Spanish, but I know that 
credit here got S+P data on them.

Sending the Report tonight.

Darren
