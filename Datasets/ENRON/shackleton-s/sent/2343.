Teresa, as I mentioned, attached is revised term sheet intended to reflect 
latest commercial changes but subject to legal review.  Please particularly 
consider (with commercial and operational teams as appropriate) Engineering 
(eligibility) Criteria applicable to proposed VPPs, and proposed terms of 
Balancing Agreement, Master Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, and 
Master Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Of course, any other thoughts 
you have are most welcome.

We are having an internal meeting (global finance, accounting and tax) to 
discuss term sheet at 2:00 PM on Friday, 11/10/00 in EB 2868.  

If you can meet with us on Friday or otherwise give us feedback by Friday 
afternoon, it would help facilitate finalization of term sheet and movement 
to drafting of definitive documents.

Thanks, NJD
