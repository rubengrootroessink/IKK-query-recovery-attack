Sharon & Susan:  We will send blackline shortly.  With respect to your fax of 
11/10/00, please note the following:

1.  continuing guaranty is fine
2.  Rider A will require further discussion and is not acceptable
3.  30 days is too long and not justifiable but we are agreeable to extend 
time to  10 Business Days
4.  Replacement credit support is not acceptable

If you still wish to pursue unacceptable items, please advise and I will try 
to  arrange a call for you and the Enron Corp. lawyer, Clement Abrams, who is 
currently out of town.  He returns tomorrow.  

Thanks.  Sara
