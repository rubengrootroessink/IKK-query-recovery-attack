Bill:  Is there a reason why you don't want the ISDA 2000 Definitions/Annex A 
(which supercede the 1991 and 1998 Definitions)?  Sara

Sara,

Brent suggested you might have copies of the above-referenced documents that 
you could e-mail or interoffice to me (EB 1768).  If not, any suggestions 
regarding where I might get my hands on them?

Thanks,
Bill
