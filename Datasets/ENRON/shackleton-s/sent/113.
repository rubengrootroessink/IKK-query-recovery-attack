Per our conversation, I'll be happy to assist Lucy during your absence.  Sara

Subject: Paper Desk Support

I am tied up in reviews for at least 4 hours today, and will be leaving 
tomorrow at about 2 o'clock to start my two-week vacation. Starting 
immediately, please send all correspondence, questions or requests to Lucy 
Ortiz. I have handed off all open items to her (with the exception of the 
remaining National Gypsum Company trade), including the trades that came down 
yesterday. 

Melba returns on Monday and will resume her role documenting Confirmations. 
In my absence, Lucy will assume my role of review/additional support, and 
will coordinate any new issues, language, etc. with Sara Shackleton.

As with myself, please realize that Lucy wears many hats, and extend to her 
the same patience and understanding that you give me.
