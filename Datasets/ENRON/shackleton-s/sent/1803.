Dear Sara,

EXCITING UPDATES WITH SHAREBUILDER!
Last month I told you about some exciting things happening here with 
ShareBuilder. Have you noticed it on our site yet? We've just added over 
1,000 new stocks for a grand total that tops 3,000! There's never been a 
better time to consider adding new stocks or index shares to your plan. Visit 
http://www.sharebuilder.com and click on "ShareBuilder Stock List" today to 
checkout the complete list.

Now you can make dollar-based investments in some of these new stocks.  
Here's an example of a few with names you may recognize:

SHAREBUILDER.COM AFFILIATE PROGRAM:
Another exciting addition you might have noticed recently is our new 
ShareBuilder Affiliate Program. Web portal sites that qualify to become 
affiliates will be able to share the benefits of ShareBuilder with visitors, 
and receive compensation.  If you have a business or work for a company that 
has a web portal site and would like to provide a great investment tool for 
your visitors, your organization can apply to become a ShareBuilder 
Affiliate.  To find out more about our affiliate program, visit 
ShareBuilder.com and click on "Become an Affiliate".

CREDIT UNION PARTNERS:
I'm also pleased to tell you that we've partnered with many credit unions 
over the last few months - we now have dozens of credit union partners. These 
partnerships let credit union members take care of all of their finances from 
a single online source - from balancing checkbooks, to making mortgage 
payments, and now watching long-term investments grow through ShareBuilder. 
Two of our most recent credit union partners are among the biggest in the 
nation: Boeing Employees Credit Union and The Golden 1 Credit Union. If 
you're a member of either, look for ShareBuilder on these sites: becu.org and 
golden1.com.

SAFECO PARTNERSHIP:
We also have entered into a partnership with SAFECO Corporation, one of the 
leading insurance companies in the U.S. and a Fortune 500 company.  We 
launched the SAFECO ShareBuilder last month, which is now available to direct 
investors in its mutual funds at safecofunds.com.  This is the first 
relationship we have announced with a major insurance company and are 
delighted to be associated with SAFECO, both as a partner and as a major 
private investor in our company.

If you have any questions regarding your account or ShareBuilder plan, feel
