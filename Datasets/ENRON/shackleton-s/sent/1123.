1.  Friday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials                 -7.14     -0.06%   11112.72
S&P 500                         +0.11     +0.01%    1527.46
Nasdaq                         +22.42     +0.45%    4963.03
Internet Stock Index           +16.63     +1.56%    1080.27

A buying binge of Internet and technology stocks sparked Friday
morning's market rally, which led to solid gains on the Dow and
the Nasdaq throughout most of the day, before the Dow finished
lower amid profit-taking by investors, closing a week
characterized by strong performances on the major U.S. indexes
as investors temporarily put aside their concerns about future
interest rate hikes and upcoming quarterly earnings
announcements.

Friday's market action was kicked off by the Commerce
Department's report that new orders for durable goods, including
cars, computers and appliances that are intended to last three
years or more, fell 2.3% in February to $208.45 billion, which
was weaker than analysts' forecasts of a 0.2% decline.
February's numbers for orders of costly U.S. manufactured goods
represent the second month of declines in a row.  The report
came only a few days after the Federal Reserve hiked short-term
interest rates for the second time this year in its ongoing
determination to keep the steaming economy in check.

After boosting stocks on Thursday amid rumors that the mammoth
government antitrust lawsuit against it might be nearing
closure, Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) is expected to make a sweeping
offer to settle the case as the government eases up on demands
that the software titan be broken up.  If the proposal by
Microsoft is sufficiently wide ranging, then it could result in
final negotiations as early as this weekend among Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Joel Klein
and Judge Richard Posner, who has been serving as the case's
mediator.  On the other hand, if the proposal is deemed to be
too narrow by prosecutors, it could destroy the settlement
negotiations and throw the case back into the courts.  A federal
judge ruled last year that Microsoft had abused monopoly power
in its Windows computer operating system, which allegedly harmed
consumers, customers and other companies.  Shares of Microsoft
dropped 3/16 (-0.17%) to 111 11/16.

Oil services companies had a strong day on Wall Street, as oil
prices rose on Friday in the wake of a final effort being made
by the U.S. government to persuade OPEC to agree to a big output
hike at next week's gathering of the group.  Halliburton
(NYSE:HAL) gained 7/8 (+2.31%) to 38 3/4, Schlumberger
(NYSE:SLB) closed up 7/8 (+1.13%) to 78 3/16, Transocean
Offshore (NYSE:RIG) rose 1 3/16 (+2.64%) to 46 3/16, Cooper
Cameron (NYSE:CAM) gained 2 1/8 (+3.28%) to 66 7/8, and Smith
International (NYSE:SII) closed up 1 7/8 (+2.50%) to 77.

The drug sector was buzzing over the statement by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) that Propulsid, a popular drug with
nearly $1 billion in sales last year, had been associated with
341 reports of heart rhythm abnormalities, including 80 reports
of deaths.  Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the maker of the
prescription heartburn drug, reported that it would stop
marketing the product in the U.S. and that it is working with
the FDA to create a special "limited access" program to keep it
available for certain patients that have not been helped by
other treatments.  Following the news, shares of Johnson &
Johnson plunged 10.78% (down 8 5/8) to 71 3/8, while shares of
other drug stocks also had weak performances, with Merck
(NYSE:MRK) dropping 1 1/8 (-1.79%) to 61 3/4, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
closing down 3/16 (-0.53%) to 35 1/16, Schering-Plough
(NYSE:SGP) falling 1 1/2 (-3.97%) to 36 1/4, Pharmacia & Upjohn
(NYSE:PNU) dropping 2 9/16 (-4.30%) to 57, American Home
Products (NYSE:AHP) closing down 1 1/2 (-2.77%) to 52 11/16, and
Warner-Lambert (NYSE:WLA) falling 15/16 (-1.00%) to 93 1/16.

The hotel and real estate industries converged on Friday as
MeriStar Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:MMH), which operates 235 lodging
properties, announced that it would acquire BridgeStreet
Accommodations (NYSE:BDS), which offers upscale furnished
apartments, townhouses and condominiums as an alternative to
traditional hotel rooms.  The deal is expected to result in
MeriStar's leading position in the market for providing
temporary housing for executives and business travelers.  Shares
of MeriStar inched up 1/16 (+2.27%) to 2 13/16, while shares of
BridgeStreet soared 29.03% (up 9/16) to 2 1/2.

The Nasdaq had another run up on Wall Street on Friday, leading
to more record highs for many Internet and technology stocks
during the day's trading session, including Adobe Systems
(Nasdaq:ADBE), which closed up 1 5/8 (+1.52%) to 108 3/16,
Xilinx (Nasdaq:XLNX), which dropped 1 3/4 (-2.07%) to 82 5/8,
and Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:SUNW), which closed up 2 11/16
(+2.75%) to 100 1/2.

Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) surpassed Microsoft as the biggest
company in the world during Friday's trading session, before
Microsoft regained that distinction in a late-day rally.  Shares
of Cisco closed up 1 9/16 (+2.01%) to 79 3/8, representing a
market cap of $550.7 billion, while shares of Microsoft closed
down 3/16 (-0.17%) to 111 11/16, representing a market cap of
$581.3 billion.

In leading Internet stock news, the Financial Times reported on
Friday that Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) and online auctioneer eBay
(Nasdaq:EBAY) have resumed the merger talks that had collapsed
earlier this month.  In early March, analysts noted several
strategic benefits that would be derived from a Yahoo-eBay
alliance, but indicated that an acquisition of eBay would be
extremely expensive for Yahoo.  Moreover, questions were raised
with respect to why eBay would desire to sell out at a time when
its business is thriving.  Shares of Yahoo rose 3 (+1.57%) to
194, while shares of eBay jumped 20 3/16 (+9.03%) to 243 3/4.

Business-to-business (B2B) news was topped by reports that four
major players in the aerospace and defense industry are joining
forces to create an online marketplace with B2B powerhouse
Commerce One (Nasdaq:CMRC).  The joint venture, which includes
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTNa), Boeing
(NYSE:BA) and British Aerospace, is being designed to bring
together buyers and suppliers in the industry, allowing them to
buy and sell parts and conduct business over the Internet.
Following the news, shares of Commerce One jumped 18 11/16
(+9.12%) to 223 11/16, while shares of other B2B players
finished the day with mixed results as E.piphany (Nasdaq:EPNY)
closed up 6 1/2 (+3.80%) to 177 1/2 and Oracle (Nasdaq:ORCL)
gained 1/8 (+0.14%) to 87, while Ariba (Nasdaq:ARBA) dropped 5
15/16 (-2.24%) to 259 9/16, VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT) fell 6
9/64 (-3.23%) to 183 7/8 and VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT) closed
down 6 9/64 (-3.23%) to 183 7/8.

The B2B announcement was the latest in a wave of moves by
leading companies in various industries to create online
marketplaces.  It wasn't even the first such deal in the
aerospace and defense industry -- last month, United
Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and i2
Technologies (Nasdaq:ITWO) announced plans to launch
MyAircraft.com, an electronic marketplace for aerospace products
and services for approximately 25,000 buyers and sellers.  In a
separate transaction, General Electric (NYSE:GE) recently
created a new online exchange that will allow major airlines to
buy and sell parts via the Internet.  B2B marketplaces also have
sprung up in such industries as chemicals, automobile
manufacturing, construction and pharmaceuticals, as companies
increasingly are seeking to move their supply chains into
cyberspace to reduce the paperwork and time involved in
purchasing, manufacturing and inventory.

The online brokerage sector had a strong day on Wall Street
following the statement by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray that it
was raising its revenue forecasts for online brokerage giants
Ameritrade Holding (Nasdaq:AMTD) and E*Trade Group (Nasdaq:EGRP)
as a result of recent unprecedented trading volumes.  Shares of
Ameritrade gained 2 5/16 (+10.54%) to 24 1/4, shares of E*Trade
rose 4 1/8 (+14.80%) to 32, while shares of other online
brokerage firms also performed well on the day, with National
Discount Brokers Group (NYSE:NDB) rising 5 5/8 (+11.07%) to 56
7/16, Siebert Financial (Nasdaq:SIEB) gaining 1 9/16 (+11.26%)
to 15 7/16, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCH) closing up 3 3/8 (+5.51%)
to 64 5/8, Knight/Trimark Group (Nasdaq:NITE) rising 6 5/16
(+11.97%) to 59 1/16, and DLJ Direct (NYSE:DIR) gaining 1 7/16
(+10.04%) to 15 3/4.

Other Internet and technology stock movers included:

<> GoTo.com (Nasdaq:GOTO), which surged 33.17% (up 11 63/64) to
48 7/64 after the Internet search engine company announced on
Friday that it logged more than 2 million unique visitors during
March 2000 and expanded the number of paying advertisers to more
than 25,000.

<> Xircom (Nasdaq:XIRC), which fell 10.21% (down 4 3/16) to 36
13/16 after the maker of products that connect portable personal
computers to telephone systems, networks and the Internet
reported that its quarterly earnings would not meet Wall Street
expectations.

<> Wit Capital Group (Nasdaq:WITC), the parent of online
investment banking group Wit Soundview, which jumped 29.43% (up
4 7/8) to 21 7/16 after reporting that its first quarter
financial results likely will exceed analysts' forecasts.

<> Compaq Computer (NYSE:CPQ), which fell 1 5/16 (-4.39%) to 28
9/16 on very heavy volume based largely on concerns that the
computer company's first quarter earnings may fall short of
estimates as a slowdown in corporate spending on PCs during the
first quarter might create a revenue shortfall.

<> Teledyne Technologies (NYSE:TDY), which jumped 14.68% (up 2)
to 15 5/8 on continued momentum from Wednesday's announcement by
the leading provider of sophisticated electronic and
communications products that it has reached an agreement with
Lockheed Martin to supply turbine engines for the Joint Air-to-
Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program.

<> Power Integrations (Nasdaq:POWI), which sank 39.97% (down 19
11/16) to 29 9/16 one day after the circuit maker reported that
it expects its first quarter revenues to fall below
expectations.

6. IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF="http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo">AOL users click
here.</A>

The action in the market today demonstrated how not all IPOs --
even those tech-related -- are created equal.  Investors recent
love affair with communication/semiconductor stocks continued as
Silicon Laboratories (NASAQ:SLAB), a maker of mixed-signal
integrated circuits, bolted 123.79%.  In contrast however,
eMachines (NASDAQ:EEEE), a maker of low-cost computers, fell
8.33%.  eMachines is an interesting story because it actually is
one of the leading PC manufacturers in terms of total PCs
shipped.  Its low-cost model, however, clearly did not sit well
with investors.

Looking ahead to the next few weeks, the IPO pipeline is still
stacked.  While there are still many quality IPOs expected to
come to market, the glut of IPOs will make the top issues
slightly more difficult to find.  Investors are increasingly
scrutinizing business-to-business- and Internet infrastructure-
related issues just as they started to with business-to-consumer
Internet issues when supply became to much.
