Jim and Rex:

The Lehman Bros. form of "put" works fine from a legal perspective.  
Yesterday, I faxed to you one of the "puts" with underlined language 
reflecting differences in securities language from our prior swap/forward 
deals with Lehman.  The differences may be alright for purposes of the "puts".

Please let Jeff know if the "puts" are acceptable for execution (from the 
securities perspective).  I have already initialed the documents from the 
swap perspective.  Let me know if you have any questions.

As usual, thanks for your help.
