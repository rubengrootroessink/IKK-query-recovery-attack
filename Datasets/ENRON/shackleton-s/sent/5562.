I haven't heard from credit.  Why don't you call Tana Jones (our EOL 
paralegal specialist) at 713-853-3399 and let her know that you want to 
pursue the Electronic Trading Agreement and GTC's for online trading.  I will 
also provide Tana with the background discussion that you and I had.  At 
least she can get you moving on EOL and pursue credit at the same time.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Sara,

Per our discussion on February 6th, I was wondering if you had any feedback
from your credit people regarding the five Enron-Hess entity ISDAs we
discussed.  Also, as I mentioned in the February 6th e mail to you, Amerada
Hess Corporation would like to be able to trade on Enron On-Line
immediately.  Can you give me a call to discuss how soon we can make
arrangements for this?


Thanks,

Mark,

I would like to contact you in order to follow up to your conversation of
last week with Mr. Chuck Cerria regarding executing an ISDA between
numerous
Hess entities and numerous Enron entities.  Unfortunately, I do not have
your phone number.  Could you either call me or e mail it to me?

Thanks so much,

Dana Dellacona
