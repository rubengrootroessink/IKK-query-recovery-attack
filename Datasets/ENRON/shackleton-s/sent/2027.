Hi, Susan!  I work with the FX/rate desk and Darren Delage is currently 
residing in Tokyo and trading.  I have a conversation this evening with Alan 
Aronowitz, John Viverito and Darren to discuss Japan issues.  

At the moment, Darren has exeacuted several trades.  These are being 
documented in Houston AS ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP. trades.  I had assumed 
that all trades would be done in the name of the Japanese financial trading 
entity; I have no idea who is handling back office functions.  

Can you update me?  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  We MUST confirm all trades.
