Susan:   (1) We need to have the following agreement with Goldman 
re-executed.  I have the prior agreement in my office (if you want it). 
Please let me see the cover letter you submit to Lisa.  Please add this to 
the equity list.
(2)  I will give you Direct Trading for execution.  It should also be added 
to the equity list.
(3)  I think we need to add a reference to the First Boston Enron Corp. 
account to the equity list.
