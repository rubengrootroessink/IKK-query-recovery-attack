Sara -
SMUD gave us their version of the ISDA agreement about 6 weeks ago and I am 
still waiting for comments.  I believe Susan Flynn is working on it and I 
thought we would get comments by this past Monday.  They want to start doing 
financial gas and power swaps and I would really like to wrap up the legal 
contract side of things.  Can someone please call or email me and tell me the 
status.

Thank you (503-464-3810)

Stewart
