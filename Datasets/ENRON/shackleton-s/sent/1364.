Erica:  I am so embarrassed that I inadvertently left you off of this 
message!  Please forgive me.  FYI:  Marie doesn't want us to give HER a party 
so we've agreed that it's just a "get-together".  Sara-

I just learned that I have a conflict on June 2.  So I have already consulted 
with Marie who has agreed to Friday, June 9.  I hope this works for the 
majority of the group.  Thanks.  Sara
