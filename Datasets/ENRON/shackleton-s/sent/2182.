These are not all my files.  Some were Carol's, Mary picked up a Yosemite and 
perhaps Mark handled one or two.

Taffy,  these are all finance deals that Sara worked on.  Can you work with 
her to get copies of the ISDA Masters for this guy in the Audit group.  Check 
Lotus Notes to see if we have blue files, and if not, check w/Sara.
