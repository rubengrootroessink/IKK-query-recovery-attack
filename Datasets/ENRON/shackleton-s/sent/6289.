Frank:  I know you just received the credit worksheet.  Can you give Mike 
Curry some idea of when the ISDA can be sent?  Thanks.

Now that you have received the credit worksheet from Paul, what is the 
status/timeline of getting an ISDA agreement I can forward to the customer?  
Thanks for your assistance with this, - Mike

Sara-- Are you still the swaps lawyer to assist with this?  If not, would you 
pass it to the person who can help Mike Curry with this?  Thanks.
