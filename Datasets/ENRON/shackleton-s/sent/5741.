Pat:

I've  finished reviewing the confirms and am missing the following FX 
confirmations:

(1)  National Bank of Canada  4/25/01 maturity

(2)  Comerica   4/17/01 maturity

(2)  Scotia Bank   maturities for 5/8/01, 6/8/01, 7/8/01 and 8/8/01

Also, if you have added more transactions beyond your January 31, 2001 
summary, we would like copies.

Other than with respect to the two Forward Extras with Bank of America, are 
there any restrictions in your credit agreements with the various banks that 
require notice and/or consent (with respect to forward positions) when there 
is a change of ownership, etc. (as to Daishowa)?
