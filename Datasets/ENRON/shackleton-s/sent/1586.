Hi, Patricia!  Just thought I'd drop you a quick note to see what you might 
have available by Maxwell Hendler.  I understand that you had a recent show 
of his work.  Please drop me an email or you can reach me at work (713) 
853-5620.  Mike and I still think about "Tangee", "Aqua Pool", etc.  I hope 
you are doing well and we look forward to returning to L.A. soon.  Thanks 
very much.  Regards.  Sara
