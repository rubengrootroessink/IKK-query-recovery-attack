IPO News

Despite the heavy new issue supply and weak market conditions,
internet IPOs continue to outperform.  Investors continue to bid up
shares of well-known brand names, first movers, and any high-speed
internet related issues.  Both Nextcard (Nasdaq:NXCD), which offers
online credit cards, and Copper Mountain (Nasdaq:CMTN), which provides
high-speed internet connections, performed well on their first trading
days.  In contrast, Intelligent Life, which provides financial content
through its website Bankrate.com, failed to impress investors, closing
its first trading day unchanged from its offering price.  Apparently,
investors were not aware of Intelligent Life's internet business due
to the lack of media coverage or a ".com" in its name.
