Mark:

When you have a few minutes, I'm glad to discuss continuing "training" and 
balancing workloads.
Mary has no one to unload Canada and structured transactions (Global Finance) 
since Carol does not have time for either.  Angela has no time for equity 
deals.  I think we need a backup for each.  Perhaps Anne Koehler fits the 
bill.  Or Cheryl.  Each of Anne and Cheryl need ISDA experience.
I don't know Francisco's longer term schedule and maybe you need to speak 
with him and/or Mark Haedicke about his contined international workload.  
This could turn into a "Yao long term project."
