This deal has already come and gone. We exercised an option for 2000 short 
tons a month, so I do not think that portion of this confirm needs to be 
revised. If it does please let me know. Dale is working on that language for 
all deals from now on.

Thanks for your help.
JC

The form of this confirmation looks good.  Is Dale amending the "auto 
termination" provision?  SS

I have attached the revised J.D. Irving deal that we discussed the ECT to ENA 
name change. Will you please review it and let me know if everything looks 
O.K.?

Thank you,
Jarrod
