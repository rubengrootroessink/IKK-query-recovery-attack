Subject: EDEN ISDA Master Agreement

Sara, 

As way of background, ENA faxed a revised draft of the proposed ISDA Master 
Agreement to EDEN on December 8th.  EDEN apparently still does not want to 
render an opinion of "outside counsel".  Following-up on the messages from 
Rodolfo Freyre and Jeff Kabel, have you spoken to either Jeff or Rolo 
regarding EDEN's not wanting to sign an opinion of "outside counsel" in 
connection with the ISDA Master Agreement.  Has a decision been made with 
regard to ENA's position on such matter?   

As for Jeff's quiry, ENA does not have an executed ISDA Master Agreement with 
AES Corp.

Let me know if I can be of assistance.   Thanks.
