Happy New Year!

And back to old business.  ENA is holding the amendment pending receipt from 
you of the attached Exhibit A (describing the collateral).  I had previously 
left you a message but I'm sure it was lost in the year-end madness.  Please 
forward the attachment so that we have a complete document.  Thanks.  Sara

I was just checking to see when we would execute the amendment to the 
Security Agreement (to permit the rehypothecation of securities).  Please let 
me hear from you.

Regards,

Sara
