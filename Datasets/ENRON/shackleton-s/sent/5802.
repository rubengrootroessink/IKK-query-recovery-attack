You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the 
inclusion of "Other Agreements" in the "All Agreements" section as the system 
is currently designed.

I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago.  
The system is confusing.

It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for 
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section 
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general 
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the 
"Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.  My 
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the 
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.  
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong 
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been 
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the 
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement 
is a very bad idea.

Tana:  I think the agreement is listed in Section 1 (all agreements) which is 
not just Master Swap Agreements.  It is also listed in the approprate Section 
13 entry.
Hope you're enjoying Canada!

The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an 
Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other 
Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the 
entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!
