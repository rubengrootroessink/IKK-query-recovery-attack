Pat:

I am a financial trading attorney with Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") in 
the Houston office.  Christian Yoder gave me your name and suggested that we 
speak regarding the EWEB transaction.

I will be negotiating the ISDA Master Agreement with EWEB, probably with Jmi 
Deason directly.  ENA requires that governmentals provide specific evidence 
of authority to enter into derivative instruments (including certified 
resolutions specifically authorizing execution of the master agreement and 
all transactions thereunder, legal opinion and additional reps/warranties).  
I was curious as to the specific documentation you had reviewed from EWEB.  
It sounded from your email which Christian forwarded to me, that you were 
reviewing evidence of authority to enter into physical transactions.

I would like to speak with you directly, if possible.  I am in a Central time 
zone and my direct line is (713) 853-5620.  I look forward to speaking with 
you.  Thanks.  Sara
