Sara,

I think we must mention the following as the source of the index price for 
energy: "Documento de Transacciones Economicas" (DTE). This is an electronic 
document published by Cammesa, and is available to all participants of the 
Wholesale Electric Market in Argentina. It's a summary of all the economic 
transactions between the participants of the Wholesale Electric Market 
(Generators, Transmission Co, Distributors, Marketers and End Users).

This DTE is published around the 5th or 6th day of each month and reports all 
transactions for the previous month. It is accessed by calling into Cammesa's 
server and replicating the corresponding database.

The attached word file shows you different screens of this electronic 
document. The second zipped file is the DTE for June.

(See attached file: IndexView.doc)(See attached file: dte9906.zip)

Have a look at it and give me a call if you have any questions.

Regards, Julian
