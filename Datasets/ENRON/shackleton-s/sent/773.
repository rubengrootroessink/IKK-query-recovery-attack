*****************************************************************

1.  Wednesday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               +124.72     +1.13%   11122.65
S&P 500                         +2.69     +0.19%    1402.11
Nasdaq                         -24.15     -0.62%    3877.54
Internet Stock Index           -25.25     -2.95%     831.89

The Dow rebounded from yesterday's steep losses while the Nasdaq came
back late in the day after plummeting earlier on, as markets were
subject to volatile trading.

The Dow's resurgence was sparked by blue chip gains, as IBM (NYSE:IBM)
rose 3 15/16 (+3.51%) to 116, Exxon-Mobil (NYSE:XOM) moved up 4 3/16
(+5.45%) to 81, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) went higher by=20
 (+0.89%) to 56
15/16, and Merck (NYSE:MRK) rose 2 7/16 (+3.74%) to 67 11/16.

Financial stocks, still bracing for a possible raise in interest rates
by the Fed when it meets in early February, came in with mixed results,
with Citigroup (NYSE:C) gaining 7/8 (+1.76%) to 50 5/8, JP Morgan
(NYSE:JPM) rising 2 1/8 (+1.84%) to 117 1/2, while American Express
fell 3 5/8 (-2.40%) to 147 7/16, Chase Manhattan Bank (NYSE:CMB)
dropped 7/16 (-0.62%) 70 7/16, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) edged lower
3 7/8 (-4.68%) to 78 7/8.

Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) continued difficulties resulted in no 1999
bonus for company Chairman Michael Eisner.  The owner and operator of
the ABC and ESPN television networks and various theme parks struggled
in 1999 with slumping sales for consumer products and lower product
licensing revenues.  Shares of the world's second-largest entertainment
company and Dow component rose 1 5/16 (+4.15%) to 32 15/16.

In a sign of a continued strong economy as we move into the New Year,
the Commerce Department reported that orders for U.S. manufacturing
goods rose 1.2% in November, which came in above the 0.9% forecast by
economists and represented the first rise since the 1.3% gain in
August.  The manufacturing sector has been emerging steadily from its
slump during 1997 and 1998, which was caused by weakness in Asia and
other foreign economies.

2. Internet and Tech Stocks

Internet stocks, please visit:  http://www.smartportfolio.com/freetrial

here</A>

Shares of leading Internet retailer Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN) slipped
14.87% (down 12 3/16) to 69 3/4 and led Internet stocks lower on the
day.  Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN) reported that its fourth-quarter sales
jumped over 150% from the year-earlier period, but shares of the
Internet retailer dropped as the company warned that its losses for the
quarter would not be reduced despite the sales boost.  While Amazon's
fourth-quarter sales of over $650 million exceeded the $610 million in
sales that the company posted for all of 1998, investors were
disappointed to learn that the Amazon's losses would not decline as a
result.

Ebay (Nasdaq:EBAY) rallied to close up 8 9/16 (+6.69%) to 136 9/16,
while investor disappointment spilled over to other Internet stocks, as
barnesandnoble.com (Nasdaq:BNBN) dropped 5/16 (-2.16%) to 14 3/16, and
CMGI (Nasdaq:CMGI) fell 10 3/4 (-3.66%) to 14 3/16.

In other Internet news, Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) announced an extension of
its agreement with RealNetworks (Nasdaq:RNWK) under which Yahoo! can
utilize the latest version of RealNetworks' streaming software, which
enables the creation and delivery of audio, video and other media
content over the Internet.  Shares of Yahoo! fell 32 1/2 (-7.34%) to
410 1/2, while shares of RealNetworks gained 11/16 (+0.59%) to 118 1/8.

America Online (NYSE:AOL) shares fell 2 (-2.60%) to 75 despite
announcements by the Internet giant that it reached agreements with
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP) and Compaq (NYSE:CPQ) to allow AOL members
to access, send and receive their e-mail via HP and Compaq palm size
PCs, including the HP Jornada and Compaq Aero.  Hewlett-Packard shares
edged lower 11/16 (-0.63%) to 107 7/8 and Compaq shares slipped 3/8 (-
1.29%) to 28 5/8.

In other computer-related news, Compaq said it will launch a new line
of personal computers, called Presario EZ2000, that are slick looking
and have easy-to-use features, including 1-touch Internet access.  The
move comes roughly one month after its lead competitor, Dell Computer
(Nasdaq:DELL), introduced a similar line of stylish and user-friendly
computers.  Computer manufacturers are trying to catch up to Apple
Computer (Nasdaq:AAPL), which has led the way with its introduction of
cutting-edge computers.  Separately, Apple shares closed up 1 1/2
(+1.46%) to 104 on news that company founder and interim CEO Steve Jobs
will now become the permanent CEO and on news that Apple will invest
$200 million in EarthLink Network (Nasdaq:ELNK), which will become the
Internet service provider (ISP) for Apple's Macintosh computers.

After the markets closed today, Gateway (NYSE:GTW) issued a profit
warning saying it expects to report earnings 7 cents below estimates
due to lower revenues resulting from weaker processor supply issues and
a sales slowdown due to Year 2000 concerns.  Beyond.com (Nasdaq:BYND)
also announced after the markets closed that fourth quarter revenues
will come in below expectations and that the company will post a loss
between 65 cents and 68 cents per share.  Shares of Gateway closed down
5 15/16 (-9.42%) to 57 1/16, while shares of Beyond.com edged lower
11/32 (-4.37%) to 7 17/32.

MicroStrategy (Nasdaq:MSTR) moved higher by 12=20
 (+6.38%) to 208 1/2
after generating some positive momentum from its 2-for-1 stock split
announcement on January 4.  The record date for the split is January 20
and the new shares will be issued on January 26, 1999.  The most recent
issue of the Smart!Splits Report forecasted the MicroStrategy split.

Nokia (NYSE:NOK) announced today that it has increased the availability
of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) products to businesses and consumers
by strengthening the interoperability of such products with leading
Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) vendors, including 3Com
(Nasdaq:COMS), Intel (Nasdaq:INTC) and Lucent (NYSE:LU).  Shares of the
leading supplier of DSL technology closed down 1/4 (-0.14%) to 172 3/4.
