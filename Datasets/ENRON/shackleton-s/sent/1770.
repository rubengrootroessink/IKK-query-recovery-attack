The London office is forwarding recent legal advice from our lawyers in South 
Africa regarding FX clearances.  It seems that prior to transacting with a 
South African party, we need copies of the party's "certification" from the 
National Bank allowing the party to make payments out of the country (thereby 
converting local currency to USD).  Such approvals are severely restricted.  
I will forward the memos to Susan Bailey for inclusion in our "database" of 
global advice.  Sara
