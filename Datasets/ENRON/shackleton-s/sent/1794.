We are in the process of updating our legal due diligence for financial 
trading with Chilean counterparties right now.  Outside counsel is putting 
together an opinion for us and reviewing our form of master.  We expect to 
have some information early next week.  I will keep you informed.  In the 
meantime you should have credit check them out.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  

Brent

Sara,

Can we trade with counter-parties in Chile??  We have a strong credit in 
Chile that wants to purchase an 18 month financial swap for newsprint.  See 
note below for more in.  Let me know what we need to do...

Thanks.

Ed Quinn

There might be a problem with the site only being in Spanish, but I know that
