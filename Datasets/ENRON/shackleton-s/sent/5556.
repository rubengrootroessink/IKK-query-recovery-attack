Dear Carol:

Glocap Legal Search is one of the fastest growing in-house legal recruiting
firms in the nation.    We have worked very hard to create a unique and 
powerful legal recruiting company and we were gratified recently when Forbes 
ranked Glocap its Favorite Headhunter.   To read the review, which appeared 
in the spring issue of Forbes.com magazine click on

Glocap recruits for Fortune 500 companies, major financial institutions,

I am writing to  ask for your help. Do you know anyone or any department at 
your company that may need Attorneys and could use our services? If so, I 
would be grateful for the referral.
