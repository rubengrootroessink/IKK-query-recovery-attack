Anita:  It was great hearing from you and it sounds as though you have lots 
going on!
I am trying to refresh myself on the type of trading activity which is 
currently taking place in Singapore (physical vs. financial, types of 
commodities) and the confirmation procedures (what is confirmed in Singapore 
vs. what is confirmed in London).  Is there a written set of procedures that 
I can see?  Should I be asking this question of Paul Simons? anyone else?  
Please send me an e-mail.  These issues are arising because of my involvement 
in working with the Brazilian office.  Thanks.  Looking forward to speaking 
to you soon.  Sara
