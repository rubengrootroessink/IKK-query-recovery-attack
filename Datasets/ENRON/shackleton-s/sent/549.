There are no outstanding issues as to the Tiger guaranty.  We need to have it 
executed.  Although we have not seen a redraft from the Tiger lawyers, Per 
seems to think that he'll be ablt to transact this week.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

I never received any word beyond your e:mail concerning the Tiger Guaranty.

Therefore, the Guaranty has not been sent to Clement for signature.

I will be happy to help when called upon.

On Friday, did you send the Tiger guaranty to Clem for execution?  SS
