Susan:

Laurel Adams has an FX deal where RMT must be a party.  The counterparty is a 
100% owned Enron sub named "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona".  When I last 
checked, nothing shows up in the corporate database.  However, I have 
verified the name, ownership, etc.  with Jeff Blumenthal.  I will separately 
email you the counterparty info that I have.

We need a deemed ISDA for the parties.  We should later do the ISDA when the 
information is available on the database (which could be any day, I 
suppose).  I would just use our standard RMT format.

Please assign.  Feel free to call me or Laurel with questions.  Thanks.
