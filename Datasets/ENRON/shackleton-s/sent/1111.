Hi, Serge.  I am just checking to see when Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") 
will receive your comments to the ISDA Master Agreement for FP&L.  Paul Karns 
mentioned that you would be devoting some time for review of the agreement.  
Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.  You can reach me via email 
or phone (713) 853-5620 if you have any questions.  I will be negotiating the 
agreement on behalf of ENA.
