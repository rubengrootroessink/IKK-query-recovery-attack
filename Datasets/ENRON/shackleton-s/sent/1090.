Gil,
I received my copy of the instructions to Morgan Stanley and the letter to 
the transfer agent.
I have faxed a copy to Frank Moy at Morgan Stanley who has not received the 
original,as yet.
I have requested his verification that the account is open and an anticipated 
timing for the transfer agent.

Have instructions been provided with the account opening authorizing John 
Greene to trade for Enron Communications Investments Corp?
Has Donna been provided with the necessary internal releases for the sale?
Are we anticipating only selling 2,392,058 in the near term since that is the 
only piece being registered in street-name?
John Greene will be provided with  instructions requesting him to sell and 
acceptable pricing guidelines.
 
Thanks Sheila
