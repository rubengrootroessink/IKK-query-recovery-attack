book that tells you how to take full advantage of the knowledge
and power of the Internet and online investing. 1

It's called "It's Your Money: The E*TRADE Step-By-Step Guide to

Christos M. Cotsakos. This 200+ page book has a $16 retail value but

fundamental and technical analysis.  This is it, the only book you
will need, to figure out how to get control of your finances and beat
the professionals at their own game."

In this new book, you'll discover:

* How to turn $60,000 into a million bucks
* Financial planning's "rules of engagement"
* Where to stash your cash between investments
* A four-step checklist for researching technology stocks online
