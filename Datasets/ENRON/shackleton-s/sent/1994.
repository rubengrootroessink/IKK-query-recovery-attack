Sheila,

At the request of Kate Goss of our Fixed Income Trading Group
please find clearing documentation and a Give-Up agreement for
executing with additional brokers.

 <<futures.pdf>>  <<3prtygu.doc>>
Please have the clearing documents executed by the appropriate parties and
returned to my attention along
with supporting documents establishing the ability of the entity to trade
futures, authorization of the individual(s)
who signed the documents to be able to do so, trading guidelines and any
applicable resolutions.

With regard to the Give-up Agreement, please have this document executed on
behalf of Enron and forwarded to the
executing broker with instructions to return the Give-Up agreement to me for
final signature and distribution..

Please call with any questions or concerns.

Regards,
Steven J. Reis
