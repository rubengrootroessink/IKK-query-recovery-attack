Mark and Mark:

Per is continuing to pursue hedge funds offline and called me yesterday about 
EOL hedge fund trading.  Credit referred me to Mark's earlier message 
addressing the issues.  As you can see, Per will want to meet next week to 
discuss.

Thanks Sara. I don't remember seeing some of this so the full background was 
helpful. As we discussed, it appears that the reluctants to trade online was 
not in the context of full ISDA docs, due dil, etc that we have done to trade 
with the hedge funds we currently talk to.  I'll give some thought to this 
and talk to Caroline. More than likely we'll need to have a meeting in 
Houston with credit and legal to discuss not if but how to set up hedge funds 
on EOL. Trading with them is a business decision we made already, executing 
online seems to be a a logical extension and doesn't add any further legal 
risk, just monitoring issues.

I'm in Houston next week. If you're avaiable and Mark has time on his 
schedule, lets get together.
