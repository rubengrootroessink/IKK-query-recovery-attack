Susan:

Will you do a favor for me, please?
As you will see from the email below, Denis O'Connell in London has had two 
ISDA's executed in the name of ENA.  We need to log this into Lotus Notes and 
we have not received copies (and Denis will not log onto Lotus Notes).  
Thanks.

Also, did we ever resolve that RMT problem with EECC?

Details of ENA ISDAs:

ISDA Master Agreement dated as of 19 October 2000 between ENA and RVI 
Guaranty Co. Ltd.

ISDA Master Agreement dated as of 22 December 2000 between ENA and Credit 
Protection Trust XXVI (Amended and Restated as of 2 March 2001)

NB: Both of these ISDA's are 'Single Transaction' ISDAs - ie no further 
transactions shall be governed by same.

I will forward you copies over the course of the next week.

At this point there it is not contemplated that these ISDA's and underlying 
transactions shall be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.

Tks

Denis

Denis:

I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.  Where do 
you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the 
ENA database.    

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Thanks.

Sara - I did the ISDA with RVI. - This was a structured Credit Derivative 
Trade so you will not find this on the system.

I have reviewed and approved the Security Agreement.

many tks

Denis

Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a 
policy  - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA 
agreement.  This could be related to credit activity in London.  I am waiting 
to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.
