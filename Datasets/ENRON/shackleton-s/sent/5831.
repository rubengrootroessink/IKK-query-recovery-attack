Ladies and Gentlemen:

Attached please find the revised Transfer and Assumption Agreement.  Please
disregard the earlier version, a rider send from Enron was inadvertently
omitted.  Please note that the signature pages are now ready for signing, for
those who wish to sign and hold the pages in escrow.   I have enclosed a
blackline against both the version sent earlier today and the version sent 
last
night for your convenience.  Please not that this agreement is being sent to 
all
parties simultaneously, thus there may be further comments.

Best regards,

Kate
