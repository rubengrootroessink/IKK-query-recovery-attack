Thanks.  We amended the guaranty yesterday to do just that.  We are trying to 
have the guaranty executed.

Stephanie:  We will ultimately need to attach the "Clement approved" form of 
guaranty to the Confirmation.  Also, we may as well note the new guaranty in 
the amendment to the first transaction.

Looks good to me.  We will need to amend our outgoing gty by increasing the 
amount from $10MM to $20MM and also expand gty coverage to cover all agmts 
which are financially settled w/ ENA.

Ed,

Please review the attached revised confirm for Con Ed.  The revision is to 
the Exposure Threshold/Credit Ratings on page 1 of Annex B-1.  As ENA does 
not have a credit rating above BBB+, we have inserted $20 mil. (the BBB+ 
threshold) for those ratings above BBB+.

Please contact either Sara or myself.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Sara - I spoke to Clement about the revised guaranty and have emailed him 
clean and blacklined copies.
