Sara:

As we discussed this evening, I attach a revised draft based on our
discussions and, aside from the jurisdiction issue, have highlighted what I
think are the open issues in brackets.  I apologize in advance if I left
anything out and look forward to discussing this further with you tomorrow
morning.

Regards,

Maria Chiodi
