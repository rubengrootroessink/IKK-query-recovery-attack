Subject: CMPC Fiancial Deal

Gustavo,

CMPC would like to sell us fixed financial newsprint for 3 years (2000-3000 
tons per month).  I quoted a bid of $596/mt based on the RISI East index and 
$598/mt based on the PPW index.  Going forward all price questions should be 
referred to Jay, and the final price would need to be confirmed at the time 
of deal closure.

Alejandro and Francisco would like to review a draft of a contract, and a 
draft is currently being completed in Legal. You should call to confirm where 
they would like the legal documents sent.  I presume that they would like one 
set to go to their attorneys in NY and one set to themselves in Chile.

Their Contact information:

Alejandro Espinosa  56-24-41-2271  aespinosa@gerencia.cmpc.cl
Francisco Ruiz-Tagle  56-24-41-2271  fruiztagle@gerencia.cmpc.cl


Thank you,


Scott Griffin
