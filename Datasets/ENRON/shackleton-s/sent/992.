I called the theatre again (713-228-8421).  He ran a profile on McKeogh and 
said the next performance you have tickets for is March 24 for Hay Fever.

The Alley is NOT holding any tickets for me.  All I want to know is whether 
"McKeogh" at "713-664-3207" has a ticket for a performance on Friday, March 3 
since I do not have the tickets in front of me.  They should be able to tell 
you or just email the Box Office phone number to me. Also, I can't do 
anything about flights until I return to Houston on Monday.  Thanks.  SS

I've called the Alley Theatre.  They wanted to know when the tickets were 
purchased, if they were purchased with a credit card, was a confirmation 
number given at the end of the transaction and were they for Hay Fever?  
Since I didn't know the answer to any of his questions, I said "Can you just 
check to see if there are any tickets waiting to be picked up for McKeogh".  
He said there were not any tickets to be picked up for McKeogh for Hay Fever 
on March 3.  He acted like there is more than one production being done.
