Samantha:  You're doing a great job with Lotus Notes!!  I'm impressed.  Just 
a few thoughts about some agreements which have fallen through the cracks (on 
record keeping):

(1)  ABN AMRO in Australia (futures) -  Jason is working on this
(2)  Bank One (give-up agreement)  -  Mary is now working on this
