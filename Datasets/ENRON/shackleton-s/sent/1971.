Attached are clean and redline versions of the latest markup.  THIS REDRAFT 
IS BASED UPON COMMENTS RECEIVED TODAY FROM MARTHA PHILLIPS STUART WITH 
KIRKLAND & ELLIS.   Ms. Stuart has received but has not reviewed the 
redraft.  We expect to speak with her tomorrow.  Julia Chin is the "point 
person" for contacting Ms. Stuart.  Thanks.  Sara
