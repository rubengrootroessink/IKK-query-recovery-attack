I believe that I am still authorized to have access to the database.  I think 
the problem is that I am on an EI server that is not connected to the ECT 
server where the database resides.  Thanks.

Joya - Please submit a security request for Brendt Hendry in Argentina to 
have access to the NEW Master Swap Agreements database in Lotus Notes.

Thanks,
