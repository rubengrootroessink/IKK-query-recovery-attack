Sam:  Attached is the FINAL version of the CSFB futures agreement (by 
separate email I will send you the DRAFT).  I've "eyeballed" it but please 
verify that all changes were accepted.  I'll help with the application.  
Let's have Gary sign in the early a.m. (or tonignt, if possible) because CSFB 
cannot open the account this evening.  Also, per my vm, we need to ensure 
that the traders on my email to you (from Ellen Su) appear on the authorized 
traders' list.  Thanks. 

ps:  I'm not going anywhere.  However, I have a 5 pm conference call on the 
Alberta prepay.
