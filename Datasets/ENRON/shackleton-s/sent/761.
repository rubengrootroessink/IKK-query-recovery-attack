I have been unable to reach Ana Sonia by phone as she has not returned to t=
he=20
office and has not returned my telephone calls.  So, we are preparing=20
execution copies of the ISDA and will have these signed by ENA.  We will fa=
x=20
and Federal Express these to EDEN with a cover letter explaining to fax the=
=20
signature page back, when they can expect the Enron Corp. guaranty and when=
=20
we can expect their opinion of counsel.  I will also explain this to Ana=20
Sonia by separate fax.  I just spoke with Jeff Kable and explained this to=

him.  Susan Bailey is here all day but she is out next week (and I am out=
=20
next week as well).  However, Marie Heard will help out next week.  Let me=

know if you have any questions.  Sara
