 Brent and Lynn:  I have a severe case of laryngitis and I can't even speak.  
I'm not sure that I'll be able to (or even should) speak on Friday for our 9 
am (Houston) conference.  Brent, I was wondering if you would be in Houston 
next week before our legal conference on Thursday and Friday.  If so, then 
maybe you, Lynn and I can meet to assess the situation.  If not, then let's 
please reschedule our Friday call for Monday or Tuesday of next week.  I can 
suggest Monday after 10 am.  Tuesday morning we have Randy's call which I may 
have to begin taking at home due to the early hour so if we decide on 
Tuesday, it should be after 10:30 am..  Please let me hear from you.  
Thanks.  Sara

p.s.  I have not had an opportunity to review the memo but I'm going to take 
a look today.
