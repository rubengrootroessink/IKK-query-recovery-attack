Sara,

Melissa Murphy has asked me to revise the language for all financial power 
products on EnronOnline.  Please let me know if the section below (in blue) 
is o.k. by you.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,

Melba


Example:

US Pwr Fin Swap  TVA MWD Peak            Jun01           USD/MWh

A US Power financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. under 
which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted 
by Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in respect of the Notional 
Quantity per Determination Period. The Notional Quantity per Determination 
Period shall be the volume submitted by Counterparty on the website, 
multiplied by the number of applicable hours in such Determination Period. 
Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a

than one calendar month the Determination Period shall be the term of the

Delivery Day for the Effective Date 01 Jun 2001 to the Termination Date 30 
Jun 2001.
The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the 
daily prices listed in the Index for power delivered during Peak hours on 
each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period.  The Floating 
Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the daily 
prices published in Megawatt Daily's Market Report under the headings "Trades 
for Standard 16-Hour Daily Products;Weighted Average Index; TVA, into"  (the

Contractual Currency.

hour for the duration of the Transaction (the "Hourly Quantity').
The transaction is for on-peak ("Peak") hours on each Delivery Day beginning 
with the hour ending 0700 (6:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2200 
(10:00 pm) Central Prevailing Time. "Delivery Day" means a day during the 
term of the transaction that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or 
Friday, excluding any day that is a NERC holiday.

than one calendar month the Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction. The Payment Date(s) will be 10 calendar days following the last

Subject: Payment Date for financial power trades on EnronOnline

Hello, Kim Theriot and Leslie Reeves have spoken with Debbie Brackett in 
credit to discuss the payment date for financial power transactions done on 
EnronOnline.  The confirmation letters (for all financial power trades) that 
I send out have the following payment date language on them:

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price 
is determinable (for trades one month or longer)

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that 
includes the Determination Period (for trades less than one month)

The language on EnronOnline is different.  EnronOnline has 10 calendar days 
instead of 5 Business Days (see the EnronOnline definition below).

Debbie Brackett wants the payment date to remain as 5 days for netting 
purposes across ENA.

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do in order to get 
this language changed on EOL for all financial power products.

Thank you,
Melissa
