Bob:  I left you a voice mail last week about a lunch that legal would like 
to present next month for both groups (above).  We need a list of settlements 
persons who should be invited.  The purpose of the meeting is to provide an 
overview of the legal documentation process, including explanations of our 
documents, and encourage dialogue among the groups.  Please send as soon as 
possible.  Also, let me know if you have any particular topics which you 
would like to see addressed.  Thanks.  Sara
