?Investing Wisely in Volatile Markets
When markets turn volatile, we have a tendency to turn our heads away for=
=20
fear of facing the ugly reality.=20

In the age of online investing, when we have so much information about the=
=20
health of our portfolio, why don't we sell when markets turn bearish?  And=
=20
how is it that we miss opportunities that seem so clear in 20/20 hindsight?=
=20

The four following investment principles can make it easier for you to see=
=20
when the time is right for you to take action:

 1. Keep your interest in the market fresh
 2. Have a sell rule
 3. Diversify, but don't overdo it
 4. Have an accumulation plan=20

Kris Skrinak, co-founder of ClearStationc, explains how these four principl=
es=20
are built into ClearStation's portfolio manager.1=20
