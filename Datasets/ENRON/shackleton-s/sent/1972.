Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
further notice.

Thanks and regards,
John

John
Is this for European or US equities or both ?
Do you want to trade using Internet access or would you prefer a fixed link 
leased line ?
If you could let me know
Thanks
Cyrus

Cyrus,

Can you please arrange for this installation on my desktop.  Please 
coordinate with Julie Pechersky and Jamie White to ensure that my setup has 
the same functionality as Selena Gonzales in Houston.

Thanks and regards,
John

Hi John,

Please have your technology person contact Jamie White at jwhite@itgeurope.com
(670-4200 in London) to schedule an installation of the ITG Europe Platform.
Good luck getting the office set up!
