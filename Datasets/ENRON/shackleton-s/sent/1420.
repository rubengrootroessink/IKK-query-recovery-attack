Donna:  It's been awhile since we last spoke about advising Enron companies 
of existing brokerage accounts.  It has also been determined (in legal) that 
the accounts will remain with ME and not move to Alan A.  I have some 
temporary assistance in that an A&K lawyer, Jason Peters, is working up here 
for another few weeks.  I was hoping that we could all meet and put our 
"project" into action.  Please give me a call and suggest some time when we 
may meet.  Thanks.  Sara
