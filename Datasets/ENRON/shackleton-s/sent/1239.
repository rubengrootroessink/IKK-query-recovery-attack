For the time being Sara is handling the Swap Master Agreements for South 
America since they are ENA transactions.

Attached is credit terms for Capex master trading contract (per Julian's 
request).



Andrea,

I hoped your credit questions were answered concerning adequately in the 
recent contract negotiations with Pluspetrol.  I apologize if I wasn't 
sufficiently responsive.  I'm working on unloading other responsibilities so 
that I can focus purely on Southern Cone.  

Rod
