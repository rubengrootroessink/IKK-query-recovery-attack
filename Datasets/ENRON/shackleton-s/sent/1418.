Jarrod it seems the reference to Sydney time for a Melborne weather 
transaction could lead to an inconsistency this year. So if a time zone is to 
be referenced it should be Melbourne.

I agree this change could cause problems. During September 2000  daylight 
saving will start early in Sydney during the Olympics. As a result there will 
be a 1 hour time difference between Sydney and Melbourne.  The local time as 
reported by the Bureau of Meteorology is Melbourne time. Hence if there is to 
be a reference to a time zone it should time zone applicable to that 
location. More generally we should put a definition of "LST "in documentation 
as meaning the time at the relevant weather station. We could have a 
circumstance of reference weather stations in difference time zones (eg 
basket of cities).

Heidi can you handle?

Dear Heidi,

1.
I confirm that this is now a swap rather than a bought option.  

2.
To DAVID,
".... Please let me know if you think this document is acceptable........"

Since Jared has replaced LST with Sydney time -

should this be Melbourne time instead ?????

Raymond

The confirmation I have received below looks to be the deal we were talking 
about when I was in Houston. Is this correct? At that stage, were we not 
talking about there being a significant premium payable at the start of the 
deal. It appears from the confirmation below that this is now a swap rather 
than a bought option.  Can you please confirm that this therefore the same 
deal. 

Heidi

Jarrod looks fine. For completeness I have noted one minor inconsistency in 
(v) of the Fallback Data provisions that dates back to my first draft. Our 
rounding of degrees celsuis is to one decimal point. Hence the reference to 
whole numbers may not be apropriate in all cases. In practical terms it is so 
immaterial I question the need to redo the confirmation. Anyway please put 
together the the confirmation between between Enron Australia Finance Pty. 
Ltd. and RMT. I have copied in Susan (Tax) and Heidi (Finance) to double 
check they are fully aware of this arrangement.

David,

I have attached a copy of the Confirmation that we sent to Aquila. They have 
read it and returned a signed copy to me. Please let me know if you think 
this document is acceptable. If it is I will go ahead and put together the 
Transaction between RMT and Australia. If we need to make any changes, I will 
send a revised copy to Aquila and then do the back to back transaction.

Thank you,

Jarrod Cyprow (713) 853-5700
