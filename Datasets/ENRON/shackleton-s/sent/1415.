Sara,

I am not aware of any such agreement with Bank One.  They are not one of our 
top banking relationships, but it is good to see them get some ancillary 
business.

Thanks,

Kelly

Kelly:  ENA is opening a margin line with Bank One to facilitate NYMEX 
trading through the Bank One broker.  Has Enron Corp. ever signed a standard 
Master Note with Bank One?  I'd like to see what's been previously 
negotiated.  Thanks.  Sara
