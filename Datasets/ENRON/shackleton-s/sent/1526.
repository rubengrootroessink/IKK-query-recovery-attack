Just got off the phone with outside counsel for Credit Agricole.  We're very 
close. 
Tanya:  Can you tell me what products we trade? Are there many outstanding 
transactions?  Also, I'd like to make sure that the "credit worksheet" is 
current.  It looks like we're working off of something dated 1/31/96 (Terry 
Donovan!!!!!).  This must be wrong.
