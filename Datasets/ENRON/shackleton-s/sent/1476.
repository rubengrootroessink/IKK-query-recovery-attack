Susan:  Please send to Peter Bar (he's the trader) at Merrill:  
pbarna@exchange.ml.com
You can call him to see if you should also send to a lawyer, probably Gary 
Rosenblum.  Peter's phone number is 212-449-6763.  His fax is 212-738-1069.
Also, I had opened a Lotus Notes entry to begin capturing information.  You 
will need to delete one of the entries.  Thanks.  Sara
