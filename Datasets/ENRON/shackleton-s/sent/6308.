Tanya:  I faxed the prior credit worksheet (from 5/16/00) to you last week.  
Aaron Armstrong in London is asking for the draft  ISDA.  Have you had a 
chance to review the old credit?  

Please let me know if I can help.  Thanks.

Tanya:

Our FX/currency traders in London need an ISDA with MSCI.  Rod prepared a 
credit work sheet on 6/16/00.  The negotiations never went anywhere.  MSCI 
has now sent their form of agreement.  

Do you want to propose new credit or use the existing credit from last year?
