Further to our telephone conversation of 7 June, please find attached a draft
Schedule to the above ISDA Master Agreement.

Please note (1) that, in transferring the document to our system we have made
some minor changes to e.g. layout and punctuation (2) that I am liasing with 
our
NY office and our client with regard to some of the points discussed, and
accordingly not all of these are reflected in the attached.

I look forward to receiving your thoughts on those issues which you were to
conider further, and in particular on the form of Guaranty.

Regards

James Coiley
