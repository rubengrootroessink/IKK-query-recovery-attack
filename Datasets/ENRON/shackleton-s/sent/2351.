I don't know a thing about this deal!  I am expecting Marcus to call me this 
morning for further explanation.  Forgive my ignorance, but what is a CACS?  
Thanks.  Sara

Sara,
Do we need to complete a CACS form for this deal and if so does it need to be 
signed off by London or Houston as ENA are executing the deal ?
