At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing drafts of the following 
documents:

1.  Clean and blacklined copies of the ISDA Schedule showing revisions from 
the 9/22/00 draft.  Please note that RBC needs to complete the notice 
information.
2.  Copies of the Interest Rate and Commodity Confirmations.  Please note 
that certain dates, rates and pricing need to be determined early tomorrow.  

Please call me or Sara with any questions or comments with respect to the 
enclosed.
