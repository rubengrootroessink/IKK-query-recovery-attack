Shari, Westpac have contacted me re putting in place an ISDA with EAF. As far 
as we ar concerned it will cover just power trades and commodities. A couple 
of questions. 

Our credit sheet required a MAC trigger (fall below BBB-) for additional 
credit support. Was this changed? The ISDA Schedule Westpac sent me has no 
such provision?  
Can I have a copy of the Enron Corp.guaranty you finally settled with 
Westpac?  

 Thanks

David,

Further to our telephone conversation, please find attached a draft copy of 
the
Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  I have based this draft on the 
recently
completed agreement between Westpac and Enron North America Corp and your 
draft
sent to me in September last year.

I would be grateful if you could review this draft and advise me of any 
comments
that you may have.  If you require a copy of the American Schedule, please let
me know and I will be happy to forward one to you.

As a  Guarantee is to be provided by Enron Corp, I would be grateful if you
could supply a copy of this document for our review.

Please do not hesitate to contact me on any  of the numbers below should you
have any questions.

Thank you for your assistance and I look forward to hearing from you very
shortly.
