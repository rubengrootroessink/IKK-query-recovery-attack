I don't know anything about this swap and Mary is on vacation.  Would you 
please provide me with more information about the swap, deadlines, etc.?  
Thanks.

the latest is that they are going to put equity and warrants into raptor and 
not the debt.

that needs to go to mary/sara to do the swap (i can't remember mary's 
vacation schedule, but sara i think she is gone now??)
