Thanks.  

Also, please note that while you were away:

(1)  Your voice mailbox was full.
(2)  Keegan was immediately advised if we needed a file that could not be 
located.

Sara: 

I will forward the documents to you.  

For future reference, if anyone is looking for a file for an urgent matter 
while I am out, she should convey that fact to me by either (1) leaving a 
voice mail - as I checked my voicemails on Friday (that is how I was able to 
speak with Tom from New York on Friday) or (2) advise Keegan and she will 
contact me immediately by cell phone as she did regarding other matters on 
Friday.

Cheryl:

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution 
as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as 
the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a 
message with Sharon Chernick.

In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. 
("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the 
following documents:

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a 
separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the 
amount of  USD25 Million 

I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday 
of last week.  

Thanks.
