Got your voicemail and have confirmed our meeting for tomorrow (Friday) at 
2:30pm.  I have reserved conf. room EB 2719

Please let me know about how many will be attending and if we can provide 
Phil with a copy of an actual Contract and Confirmation from one of the 
counterparties on our list prior to the meeting.

Thx,

David
