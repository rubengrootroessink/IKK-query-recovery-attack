Subject: Draft Dial Swaption

Sara,

Dial's Treasurer is scheduled to meet with their CEO on Tuesday to receive 
approval for this deal (not a guarantee but he indicated he wants to finalize 
by Thanksgiving).  If possible, I would like to send him the draft confirm 
today.

I know you are busy.  Please call me at 30418 if you this will be a problem.  
Thanks.

Ed Quinn
