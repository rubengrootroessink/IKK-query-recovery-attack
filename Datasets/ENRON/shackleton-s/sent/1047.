BRAZIL: PRIMARY SURPLUS ON R$ 1.457BN IN JANUARY
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. a-7:-
 The primary surplus of the public accounts of the Brazilian government 
reached R$ 1.457bn in January 2000 (R$ 882mn in January 1999), including a 
Social Security deficit of R$ 725mn, taxes collection of R$ 15.144bn (R$ 
11.897bn in January 1999) and expenses of R$ 13.512bn (R$ 11.326bn in January 
1999).


BRAZIL: PROVISIONAL MEASURE FOR TAX ON FUELS
O Estado de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. b-2:-
 According to a provisional measure which was signed on March 10th 2000 and 
will be valid from March 13th, the payment of the taxes PIS (Employees' 
Profit Participation Program), Pasep (Public Service Employee Savings 
Program) and Cofins (Tax for Social Security Financing) on the Brazilian 
fuels sector will be transferred to refineries.
With the change, the Brazilian federal government will avoid losses of R$ 
1.2bn in 2000 which would have resulted from the lack of payment of those 
taxes by fuels distribution companies which had won preliminary orders to not 
pay them, hindering the balance of the fuels market.


ARGENTINA: OIL COMPANIES AND FUELS PRICES
La Nacion (Argentina), 11 Mar 2000, p. 2/2:-
 Argentina's oil companies association CIP announced such companies will not 
reduce the price of fuels in the Argentine market, as such price was fixed at 
a US$ 28 value per barrel and it has increased to over US$ 32 over recent 
times. Jose Maria Ranero Diaz, from Repsol-YPF, remarked this sector's 
profitability margins are very low, only 5% while Juan Jose Aranguren from 
Shell expressed companies are working with important losses. 


ARGENTINA: "IT WAS THE RIGHT MEASURE" 
La Nacion (Argentina), 11 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 "If tax collection figures remain stagnant at current levels, taxes may not 
be reduced, anticipated Argentina's Minister of Economy, Jose Luis Machinea, 
who also qualified as "the right measure" the implementation of a tax reform 
which implied significant increases over income taxes. During a recent 
interview, the official also admitted the government will intensify its 
negotiations with oil companies to force them to reduce the price of fuels in 
Argentina, as some companies may be operating as monopolies. Machinea 
announced the government had urged Repsol-YPF to reduce its stakes in some 
energy areas, where it holds a dominant position. Lower tariffs on assets 
imported from Mercosur countries as well as from extra-Mercosur areas and new 
credit lines from the Nacion bank are some of the measures the government may 
include as part of the exports promotion plan it may launch soon. Finally, 
Machinea predicted Argentina's foreign debt will fall, as a result of the 
measures adopted by its government.

into a plant moved by gas.

Gazeta Mercantil, 06 Mar 2000, p. a-5:-
 According to the co-ordinator of the Depollution Program for the Guanabara 
Bay (Greater Rio de Janeiro region in Brazil), Renato Lima do Espirito Santo, 
the shortage of collection network does not allow the use of the full 
sanitation capacity in the Greater Rio de Janeiro region.
One example is that the Sewerage Treatment Stations (ETE) of Pavuna and 
Sarapui do not work, even with total capacity for 1 cubic metre/second, due 
to the lack of 700 kilometres of collection network.


ARGENTINA: LPG TAX OPPOSED
La Nacion (Argentina), 13 Mar 2000, p. 2/7:-
 The tax imposed by the Argentine province of Buenos Aires on the initial 
sale of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) has been opposed by the sector chamber 
Cegla, on the grounds that it prejudices distributors of LPG in favour of 
natural gas, given that the tax will be used to subsidise the expansion of 
natural gas pipelines. The law was imposed in 1979.


ARGENTINA: OIL COMPANIES VS. GOV'T 
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 10:-
 The announcement by oil companies in Argentina last Friday, 10 March, that 
the recent drop in international crude prices would be reflected at the gas 
pump set off a new round of threats from the government. Argentina President, 
Fernando de la Rua, and his Economy Minister, both said they were prepared to 
battle the oil companies over prices. Meanwhile, the legislature is debating 
applying an export tax on oil, the funds from which would go to lowering 
consumer petrol taxes.


ARGENTINA: ENRON NEXT TO START LEGAL ACTION
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 2:-
 The US-based Enron Corp. could be the next company to take its case against 
Argentina to arbitration at the World Bank. Five other foreign firms have 
taken their cases to the World Bank, most of which are over differences with 
provincial governments. Enron, as well as Lancon International and Endesa, 
claim that taxes the provinces want to impose are unfair and were not part of 
concession and/or privatisation agreements. The French Compangnie Generale 
des Eaux is trying to claim damages when the north-western province of 
Tucuman cancelled its water services contract allegedly for serious errors. 
The oldest case is that of the firm, Eriday, which is claiming US$ 1.5bn owed 
by Argentina for its part in the Yacyreta hydroelectric dam. These cases are 
seen as one more negative legacy of the previous administration of Carlos 
Menem.


ARGENTINA: TO STAND FIRM ON YACYRETA ISSUE
La Nacion (Argentina), 12 Mar 2000, p. 2/7:-
 Argentina says that it will stand firm under any pressure to be applied by 
Henry Kissinger and his band of representatives from international companies 
to pay the some US$ 1.5bn due in budget overruns in the construction of the 
hydroelectric dam, Yacyreta. Eriday, the construction consortium, appointed 
Kissinger as its negotiator for its claims against the Argentine state. 
Officials in that country maintain they will review the claims one by one in 
an atmosphere of transparency, and for their part talk of amounts much less 
than those claimed by Eriday.


ARGENTINA: CAPEX RESULTS
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 18:-
 The Argentine energy company, Capex, reported earnings of US$ 11.6mn at the 
close of its intermediate balance on 3 January 2000, up by US$ 200,000 from 
the same period of a year earlier. Although net earnings were up, 
profitability was down considering that billing was up by 28%. 
Capex expects earnings to continue to increase especially now that the fourth 
line of the Comahue-Buenos Aires transmission line is working and the 
combined-cycle power plant in the western province of Neuquen is close to 
full operations.


BRAZIL: MEASURES TO COMBAT FUEL PRICES INCREASES
Folha de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. 2-1:-
 The Brazilian government is studying some measures to avoid more increases 
in fuels prices, and one of this possible measures is to cancel subsides for 
the alcohol, and also to increase the prices of kerosene for aviation and LPG 
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas).
Allowing the increase of these prices, part of the oil import costs, which 
are included in gasoline prices, can be transferred to these other products 
and gasoline prices can be controlled.


ARGENTINA: PETROL MARKET SHAKE UP DUE
La Nacion (Argentina), 12 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 The recent rises in petrol prices have caused new moves to be contemplated 
in Argentina to shake up the petrol market there. While many see government 
threats to control prices as empty, talk of opening up the market to other 
foreign oils imports and freeing up the petrol retail distribution chain is 
gaining ground. One idea circulating is to have supermarket chains act as 
sellers of foreign petrols. Oil companies remain firm in their stance that 
the reason petrol is so expensive in Argentina is because of taxes: 58% of 
the price at the pump.
