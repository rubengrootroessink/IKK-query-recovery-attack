Why don't you and I speak about the Enron concerns first.  I've reviewed the 
agreement and have a couple of questions about how we intend to use the 
account.  I'm available this morning before 10 am and after 3 pm this 
afternoon.  And I'm free all day tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara

p.s.  Do we need to bring in someone from Gary's group (e.g., Sheila Glover)?

I received a call from Bank of New York's Ray Palmer.  He indicated that he 
would like to set up a conference call.  They are a bit more expensive and we 
initially had some legal concerns with their documentation.  Lets discuss.

Laurel Adams told me that you would provide me with a name and phone number 
of someone at Chase for purposes of negotiating the global custody account.  
Do you have any information?  Thanks.
