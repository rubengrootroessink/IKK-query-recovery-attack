Please find attached Draft Confirmations showing indicative terms.

Please note that trade size, pricing and maturity are still subject to 
internal
approve and the issue concerning our ability to successful net credit 
protection
with this transaction still has to be resolved before we will be in a position
to trade.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

I'll speak to you later today

Regards Shane
