We need the revised confirm now.  I'd like to review it when you're done.  I 
sent the legal opinion draft to Deseret yesterday and they are sending their 
draft back shortly  (I received a fax from them at 9:30 am today). Thanks.  SS

Mike:  Do you want to see our legal opinion draft and/or Deseret's draft 
opinion to be sent shortly?

Just so I know what has been sent, has Deseret recieved both the Legal 
Opinion and the revised ISDA?

Also, I have not received my copies.  Fax 503-464-3836
