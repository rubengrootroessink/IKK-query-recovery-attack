I am still waiting for my Brazilian visa (another single entry, 
unfortunately).  It should arrive next week.  I was hoping to spend the week 
of Sept. 5-11 in Sao Paolo but that is impossible to plan without the visa.  
Maybe the latter part of that week or the next week will work.

If I arrive on a Sat. or Sun., what do you think about the two of us meeting 
over the weekend to work out a plan?  I can then devote all of my time to 
dealing with Tozzini on the physical and financial issues and working with 
originators to explain financial trading procedures.  I will need to 
determine if Jose Emilio (on the physical issues) and Antonio Felix and 
Renato (on the financial issues) will be available to meet during my trip.  I 
have sent them e-mails to at least pose the question.

I know that you are very busy.  Please let me know what you think about my 
proposal.  Also, I apologize for asking you to give up any of your weekend 
time.  Maybe you have another suggestion that will work better for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sara
