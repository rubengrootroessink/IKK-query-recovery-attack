Carol:  I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.  Prior to the 
departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex 
of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the 
confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten 
the confirms considerably.  Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the 
varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted 
in the annex.  Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.  I think it's a great idea. 

Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly 
different from those Shari gave us earlier).  We should verify that the 
weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to 
remove that rep from the Schedule).  Also, shouldn't we verify that all 
weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we 
now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?
