You are fantastic!  It looks like the trip is shaping up for a visit to BA 
around 9/12 with a longer stopover in Sao Paulo several days later which 
could last until 9/25 or the end of September.  Will I have the visa before 
then?  SS

Subject: Visa for Brazil

I haven't given up on a multi-entry Visa for Brazil.  I sent over a new 
letter for the Consulate this morning.  This letter states you will be 
visiting Sao Paulo several times during the next 12 months to attend various 
business meetings looking for new trading opportunities and conducting new 
negotiations for a planned trading desk in Enron's Sao Paulo, Brazil office.

Supposedly, the key to a multi-entry Visa is "new" opportunities in Brazil.

We should know by tomorrow if the Consulate approves the multi-entry Visa.
