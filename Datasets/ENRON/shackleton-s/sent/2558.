Marcelo:

Thank you for your response.  Yes, I am still interested in having the two 
questions (mentioned in my email to you) answered.  We have several 
derivative transactions with Chilean parties and I would like to know of 
modifications to both the derivatives memorandum which you prepared for us in 
1997 AND changes to our form of Schedule.  Please let me hear from you at 
your earliest convenience.

Regards,

Sara

Dear Sara,

I was out of the office last week and although I was checking my mail, for
some reason I could not receive yours. I will review my memos and let you
know of any update, unless you tell me that it is not necessary anymore.

Kind regards,

Marcelo
