Actually, Bob was handling and he knows you will handle.  I believe that this 
master was based upon the Cargill, Incorporated master.  SS

We discussed the possibility of my working on this -- we planned that you 
would talk to Mary about it first.  Let me know the outcome.  

I am already working on Cargill, Inc.   I am in the process of talking to 
Mara Alexander.
