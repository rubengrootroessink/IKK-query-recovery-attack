(1)  I have to leave early this evening to pick up pets (about 5:45)

(2)  Just a thought after seeing Shari's email:  would the paralegals and/or 
lawyers benefit from the two seminars "Successful Working Relationships" 
(valuing differences; creating understanding)?  Should this be mandatory with 
some type of follow up to help improve group communication skills?
