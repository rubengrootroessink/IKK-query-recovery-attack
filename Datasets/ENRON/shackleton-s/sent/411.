No, in general there is a netting issue with French counterparties.  The 
"quick fix" is to only permit ONE Transaction using a deemed ISDA.  The 
broader issue to be resolved is that one of the parties must be a "financial 
institution" under French law.  We tried to push ECT into that defintion, but 
without success.  The next step is to require  an opinion from outside 
counsel identifying our counterparty as that financial institution.

ps - Tanya is well aware of the situation

I'm pretty sure SITA is a French company.  Have we decided that French 
counterparties are ok?

Please prepare a deemed ISDA for the SITA deal.  Please forward to Jarrod 
Cyprow on the confirm desk. Please note the only credit specification is a 
cross default to third party debt.  Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya
