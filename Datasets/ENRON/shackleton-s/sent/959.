Tracy:

We reached basic agreement with Arco Products Company on a 1 year deal as 
summarized on the attached draft contract (this contract needs some work, but 
you can get the gist of it). It is like the Delano deal, but with no 
Ancillary Sercvices.  Could you please do a credit review for preparation of 
a Master and send it to Christian?  We have told them they would have a draft 
master by Monday of next week.  I am working on wrapping the Confirm into 
shape.

The counterparty will be Atlantic Richield Company.  They will not give us a 
corporate guaranty, but they want a guaranty from us.  We have a swap deal 
with them in place.  It was done as a one-off transaction (not a master).  
Sara Shackleton was our attorney repsonsible for that deal.  Enron Corp. 
posted a guaranty on that deal that I think has some negotiated terms and 
conditions.  They want to use the exact same pro forma.  Culd you find that 
and begin the process of getting one for this new deal?

Arco is concerned about set offs amongst various Arco facilities.  They want 
to limit this transaction to a single generation facility.  Is this OK?


PS  What is Enron Credit.com?  Do you have any options on the equity offering?
