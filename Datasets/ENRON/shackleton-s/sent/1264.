Hey, Sam:  Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as 
good as ever.  Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or  The 
Boulders?  I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for 
the fact that people age faster.  I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover 
since the seders were in the middle of the week.  But I know that my sister 
ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other 
Manhattan establishments.  My niece has been accepted at that high school in 
Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).  Jennifer is 
only 15.  My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.  My parents 
are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon.  
He'll be 83 in June.  I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the 
trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most "help" since that sweet little 
bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!) in my home.  Otherwise, 
I'm rocking along.  You know, I never called Helen but I still have her 
number and I'll do it this week.  Hope all is well.  Do you keep up with 
Ron?  Love, Sara
