Sharon Lewis asked me to contact you about this.  Our client has instructed 
us that it is SITA which will enter into the ISDA master agreement.  SITA as 
the main company must have a better credit than the company that you 
identified.

We cannot agree to a credit support document.

We suggest that you evaluate the credit of SITA and then get back to us.

Kind regards
Susan

Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.
There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the
counterparty identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a
DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named
"SITA", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does
not appear to be the credit which we evaluated.

Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement
contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major
issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.

Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.
You can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara
