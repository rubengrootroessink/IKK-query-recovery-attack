Thanks for your email Sara.? When would you like to do  the conference call

Susan:? Sorry for the delay in getting back to  you.? We have agreed to
delete the CSA and will return a blackline to  you shortly.? You may recall
that SITA expressly requested that theE nron agreement be governed by
English law which is why we prepared thisd ocument for execution by our
affiliate in London with the jurisdictionl anguage appearing in the prior
draft.? There are still issues posed by  your markup and we should be able
to schedule a conference call next  week.? Thanks.?  Sara

Further  to my fax of 3 October we have SITA's instructions.

1 - Credit Support  Annex :

SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit  Support
Annex.? SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on  the term and
volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support  Annex.

2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its  main
activities. Do you have any news regarding ENRON on this  point?

Kind regards
Susan  Hopkinson
