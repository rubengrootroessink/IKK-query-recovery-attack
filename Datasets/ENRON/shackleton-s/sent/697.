Good to hear from you!!!  I'm looking forward to hearing about your stay in 
Brazil.  Are you back in Houston?  Let's have lunch.   Sorry about the 
guide.  It sounds like a larger, well established hotel will have the edge on 
tourism information.

Sara:

Thanks for passing along the below address to me.  The tour guide was very 
nice, but a bit inexperienced and certainly not with a luxury car.  It was 
good for a do it yourself tour if you already have an idea of what you want 
to see.  It actually confirmed for me that, unless you really stay to become 
involved with the people, Sao Paulo is a fairly shallow city historically and 
socially.  I hear, however, that there are many interesting colonial cities 
in Minas Gerais, and Rio is only a 45 minute flight away.

Hope all is well.


Mike
