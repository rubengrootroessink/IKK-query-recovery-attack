Subject: VCP Asset Monetization Strategy

We have committed to move forward with one Asset Monetization transaction to 
fully address and resolve the issues and complexities involved and establish 
a base template by which we can expand the strategy as we move forward in 
Brazil. Votorantim Cellulose e Papel (VCP) is the targeted transaction due to 
its size, diversity of opportunities, and management commitment.


The structure of the assets is as follows:




The currently identified opportunities are as follows:



The tasks to be accomplished are as follows:  





The Team that we see on the project is listed below:





I would first like to ask each of you to provide feedback on what I have laid 
out to date. With regard to process and go forwards I am seeking all input.
Below are some additional files for your use.  We will co-ordinate initially 
with each functional group and get everyone together as we move forward.
We have a commitment to complete Stage I with a proposal to the customer by 
October 1st. It will take all of us to make that happen.

Thanks
MFG
