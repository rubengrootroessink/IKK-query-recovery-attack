Do you have further information about your pending trip to Canada?  I am 
reviewing the final letter prepared by Kevin Zemp and he is trying to 
coordinate with Calgary authorities.  I may be out of town during the week of 
Aug. 16 and I want your trip to run smoothly.  Give me a call sometime.  
Thanks.  Sara
