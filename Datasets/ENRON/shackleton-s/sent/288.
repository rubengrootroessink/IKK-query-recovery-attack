Subject: September 1st Group Meeting

Sara and Shari:
In preparation for our group meeting with the legal assistants next week, I 
was going to ask them to prepare a list of their current responsibilities as 
well as things that they would like to work on.  Enclosed is my list of 
"Special Projects".  Let me know if you have any additions or deletions.  I 
will wait to hear from you before sending this out and will wait for Mark's 
memo to them about these meetiongs before I send it out.  I did leave Susan 
Flynn a voice mail message about this since she will be out next week.  
Thanks.
carol
