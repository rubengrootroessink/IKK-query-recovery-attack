Mark, we should rotate the desk (as per this email).  Shall I speak to the 
group or would you prefer to do it?  SS

Sara, 

With end of 1999 so came the end of my four (4) month rotation as the Legal 
Contact for the Confirmation Desk.  Back in August, Carol, Shari and you had 
determined that a Confirmation Desk Rotation was essential, and had therefore 
designated me to serve the September 1, 1999 - December 31, 1999 rotation.  
It was my understanding, Susan Flynn would begin her rotation commencing on 
January 1, 2000, with Marie Heard following at the expiration of Susan 
Flynn's term.

However, your recollection as to who follows me may be different.  Also, you 
want to discuss this matter with Mark since he was not in attendance at the 
August meeting.

Thanks.
