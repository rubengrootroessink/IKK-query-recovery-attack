Sara,
 A broker account was set up under Friedman, Billings and Ramsey who clear 
their transactions through Bear Stears.  This was a special purpose account 
set up to facilitate the sale of DevXenergy for Jedi I.  We plan on closing 
this account as soon as the trade settles.  If you have any questions, please 
give me a call at extension 31439.

Thanks,
Theresa
