Hi Sara, 

(1) For clarification, my voicemail was not full on Friday - I checked it, 
got several messages including one fromTom Doukas and called him and others 
immediately as I arrived.  My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked 
in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the 
calls periodically.  I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due 
to the 50 or so  brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am 
working on so I do try to clear the box daily.

(2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan 
you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that 
you get what you need.   I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on 
vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly.  That 
way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although 
I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much 
about where I keep particular files or documents.  

(3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt 
uncomfortable being quizzed by you or  passing judgment as to why I have 
chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston.  
(The answer to the question is irrelevant.  If I were getting treatment 
across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work.  My 
getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my 
presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job).  

Equally important,  apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as 
she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only 
answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so.  Nor do I 
think they are fair of me.  I do not wish to justify my medical decisions 
with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or 
sick time I rightfully  can take.  It was previously represented to me that 
our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide 
in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not 
required.  If that is not the policy then please advise.  In any case, if for 
some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to 
rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the 
information you are getting is accurate.

Cheryl:

Thanks.  

Also, please note that while you were away:

(1)  Your voice mailbox was full.
(2)  Keegan was immediately advised if we needed a file that could not be 
located.

Sara: 

I will forward the documents to you.  

For future reference, if anyone is looking for a file for an urgent matter 
while I am out, she should convey that fact to me by either (1) leaving a 
voice mail - as I checked my voicemails on Friday (that is how I was able to 
speak with Tom from New York on Friday) or (2) advise Keegan and she will 
contact me immediately by cell phone as she did regarding other matters on 
Friday.

Cheryl:

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution 
as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as 
the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a 
message with Sharon Chernick.

In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. 
("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the 
following documents:

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a 
separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the 
amount of  USD25 Million 

I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday 
of last week.  

Thanks.
