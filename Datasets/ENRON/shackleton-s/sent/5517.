Ellen Su, bond trader in  Gary Hickerson's world, would like to know with 
whom we have repo agreements.  I'm pretty sure we have them with Goldman 
Sachs & Co. and with BMO/Nesbitt Burns.  Sara Shackleton has been working on 
getting an agreement signed with Warburg Dillon Read, but it appears that at 
present this document is not signed.  

Could you please advise if we have signed repo docs with any other 
counterparties?  Could you also update me on the status of the WDR agreement? 

Thank you very much for your help.
