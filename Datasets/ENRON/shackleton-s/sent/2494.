Melissa:

I finally reached Tom Seligson and he will change the guaranty (below) to add 
that ENA may assign the guaranty to any affiliate without the approval of the 
guarantor.

The remaining issue is whether to confirm on our omnibus or create a confirm 
and adopt by reference the provisions of the Alcoa Inc./ENA master.  I have 
left Ed Sacks a message.  Sara

ps  I will be out of the office on Dec. 7,8
