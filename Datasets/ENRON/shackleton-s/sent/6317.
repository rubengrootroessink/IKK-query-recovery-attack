Mary:

Attached is the latest draft from Chase.    

In particular, please take a look at the following paragraphs:

2.A (the definition of "Securities")
5.B (lien on securities)
5.C (setoff)

The ENA contact is Gennaro Contella.  Please leave me or Sheila a voice mail 
and we can arrange a conference call on Monday with Gennaro, Nancy Callahan, 
if necessary (Chase legal) and anyone that you need to conference in on 
behalf of Enron Corp.  The traders are anxious to have this account in place.

Irrespective of which Enron entity takes ownership of this agreement, we were 
looking to you for information regarding existing Chase accounts (in ENA's 
name).  

Thanks for your help.

As requested, attached is the final Agreement which I believe reflects the
revisions we discussed this morning.  If this is acceptable, please have
the Agreement executed on behalf of Enron and return the necessary
counterparts to me for signature by Chase.  I will then return fully
executed copies to you.
