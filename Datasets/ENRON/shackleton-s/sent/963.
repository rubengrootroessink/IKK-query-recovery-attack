Whatever you can do is most welcome.  We are only limited by time.  We have 
set aside the entire day of Wednesday, March 1 for you to schedule.  We can 
also be available late Monday afternoon, February 28.  I will advise shortly 
with respect to local invitees.  Thanks very much.  Sara

 Sara:  Trucco from Citi just confirmed.  I wondered wheter you would
be interested in meeting with one of the directors of the CNV who is in
charge of derivatives issues.  I could try to arrange a meeting if he is in
BA.  Please confirm.

 Who should we invite to the lunch from your local office?

 regards
 Patricia
