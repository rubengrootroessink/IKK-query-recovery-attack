Christian, these guys have their act pretty well together.  I spoke with Burt 
Dunn (his boss was also listening over Burt's shoulder and helping to confirm 
information).

Recently their Board approved a "general plan" of the transaction 
contemplated.   They did not do formal Board action in the form of a specific 
resolution, but I think the general approval will likely prove to be 
sufficient.

Here is what they are sending me:

1.  a copy of the "general plan" so that we can confirm just what the Board 
saw and what, if anything, might be seriously missing.

2.  a letter confirming the Board vote approving the "general plan."

3.  a copy of the resolution adopted by the Board several years ago exempting 
power purchase contracts from public bidding requirements.

4.  material from their Risk Management manual detailing the approval and 
individual authority to enter into provisions with regard to specific types 
of power contracts.

I asked Burt to fax these.  It may take a little while to pull it all 
together, but I expect to see it no later than early tomorrow morning.

Let me know if there is anything else on EWEB.

I just left a voicemail for Tom Grim re: Clatskanie.  I will continue to 
follow-up call him until I get a specific answer to your questions.  I 
acknowledge your 3 this afternoon deadline.

More when its available
