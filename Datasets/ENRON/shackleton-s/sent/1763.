The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm.  
If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane 
Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade 
Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let 
me know if you have any other questions.  Sara

I thought this was what we were already doing.  Sara, Mark, wasn't that your 
understanding?

When the Master does not have the weather modification to the Trade Option 
Exemption representation then I think we should include it in the confirm. Is 
this feasible?

Tanya forwarded the attached confirm on to me.  Are we supposed to have that 
weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master?
