Just kidding!  I'm fine.  I've been cut off twice on telephone calls to the 
states so I may have problems calling you in the next hour or so when I leave 
the office.  FYI:
NTAP closed at 188-3/4 and CISCO closed at 132-3/16.  It's too early for the 
mutual fund reports.  The weather is again gorgeous; we had empanadas for 
lunch and they were much better than tamales.  I read the tamale article in 
the Oxford American and it talked about the tamale man in Greenville, MS 
(whose name was Six Sixty-Six, being the sign of the devil so the tamales 
were really HOT).  Tomorrow we meet with another law firm.  Thursday and 
Friday I meet with the commercial people about ISDA agreements and one 
business customer is flying in from the province of Mendoza to discuss an 
agreement.  I'll call you later and I'm going to try to go to bed earlier 
tonight (I'll try to call after 9pm BA time).  Love, the DG
