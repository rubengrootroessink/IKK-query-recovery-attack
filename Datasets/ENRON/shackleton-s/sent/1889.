Kristina:  As you may have heard, some Raptor issues have been raised to a 
new level.  I have waited to further revise the confirm pending the V&E 
response; Also V&E suggested edits on the confirm format for all Raptor 
deals.  As you will see from Scott's memo, the unilateral right of 
termination is a potential issue.  Sara
