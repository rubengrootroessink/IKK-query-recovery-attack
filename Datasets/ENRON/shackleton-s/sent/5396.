		 Subject: Conference Room

The only time a conference room is available on Friday afternoon is from 1- 2 
pm.  Brent said people are not back from lunch by 1 pm, so he had me block 
from 10 am to 12 noon.  He said the mtg. will only last an hour and you can 
tell me what time between 10 & 12  you want to have the meeting.  Just let me 
know.
