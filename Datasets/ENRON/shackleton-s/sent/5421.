Dear Ms. Shackleton,

I am contacting at the request of Mr. Anthony Hoban of our office in regard 
to your
proposed changes to the NDA between ECT and w-Technologies.  I have accepted 
most of
your proposed changes and have made some additional ones for you to review, 
redlined
for your convenience.  Please let me know if those changes are acceptable.  
If so, I
will have clean copies thereof sent to you to sign, and fax back to my 
attention after
which I will provide you with a countersigned copy.  If not, I can be reached 
via any
of the methods below for discussion.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Lewis Swanston
