In connection with the "upgrading" of these old ERMS masters, I have limited 
information which Jeff Nogid (X34782) will verify.  Please verify spelling of 
names, addresses, etc.

Morgan Guaranty Trust - legal is Michael Stolfi (212-648-8231) or the trader 
is Henry Stuart (212-648-9057)
Morgan Stanley - Jeff will get the info today

We should include a cover letter in each indicating the reason why we are 
submitting.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Sara
