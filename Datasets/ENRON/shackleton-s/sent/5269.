Your name and email address were forwarded to me by Jane Anne Thomas in our
Legal department. We are working on a structured trade with the Royal Bank
of Canada (project Cerberus) that involves Rabobank entering into a

I am looking for the following information on Enron North America that we
need to start the processes of opening counterparty accounts and preparing
an ISDA master agreement:

- Full legal name;
- Registered Address;
- Telephone Number/Fax Number;

I would be very grateful if you could supply me with this information.
