Sorry to keep sending emails BUT my assistant just walked in and said that 
you were expecting a presentation by Mark Taylor on the phone call.  To my 
knowledge, Mark doesn't know anything about this call (your email of 1/17 
doesn't mention Mark).  So, I'm totally confused.  If we are going to discuss 
the term sheet process and related tax issues, let's do it.  If you want to 
cancel because you are expecting something different, please let me know (and 
advise Lynn and Julian).  Thanks.
