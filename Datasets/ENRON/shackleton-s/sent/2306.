OK, you guys, I'm trying my best.

All appointments on Monday, November 20 have been moved to 3 P.M.

Deb:  facial, then massage

Steve:  80 minute wellness massage

Steve:  the spa didn't have anyone to do a facial after 2 pm so I thought 
you'd like a longer massage.  There are facial appointments available Sunday 
morning and afternoon.  You may want to check the website and change the 
service.  You can have my facial appointment if you like (it's at 4 P.M.) and 
I'll take yours.  

Let me know if you'd like for me to make changes.

Otherwise, see you in wineland.  Sara
