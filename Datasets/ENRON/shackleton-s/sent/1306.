(1) In connection with Taffy's report, please note the following:
Aquila Canada Corp. - follow up
Christiania Bank - need to send for execution
Ospraie - send revisions

(2) Also, what have you heard from Laurie about the Australian ISDA's and 
brokerage agreements?  We should begin incorporating into our database.  If 
we use your assistant, we should input data during the regular business day. 

(3) I have Jason helping me on about seven different brokerage arrangements 
and will soon need appropriate backup to send together with execution 
copies.  I am keeping dummy files until these are finalized.
