Carol:  Here's my "short" list of issues for Mark:

(1)  Swap Group Meeting on Wednesday, June 7:
 (a) reiterate "rules" (e.g., office hours, taking personal/vacation time and 
advising the rest of the group, how rotation of masters/confirms/C.A. works 
and   what happens when someone is ill/vacation, timeliness of deemed 
ISDA's/omnibus confirms, confirmation desk, etc.)
 (b)paralegal workload

(2)  Confirmations and need to create a "writing"
 multiple confirms with the same counterparty 
 confirms with extremely short terms (hourly, under 5 days) - no confirm?
 use of confirms with negative language

(3)  Hiring a clerk to assist paralegals to run errands

(4)  Policy regarding INDIVIDUALS as eligible swap participants

(5)  Method for shortening weather confirms

(6)  Mary and Brent - possible work assignments
