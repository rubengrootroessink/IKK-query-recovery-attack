Hi Sara.  I can't find in my email system what our conversations were after 
this.  Did you get a chance to respond?  If so, please advise.  Thanks.

Sara, the weather group is wanting to get Sempra prepared to do weather 
trades, how should we proceed?

Celeste:
I think that we need to execute an ISDA to do weather trades with Sempra as 
the 2/22/96 Agreement appears to only work for commodity trades.  If this 
needs to be pursued further, please have someone contact Sara Shackleton as I 
am moving to the power group.  Thanks.
