Thanks for the tax article.  It's the published version of the one I sent to 
you in September, 99.
Also, you were going to select a date at the end of January when we could 
teleconference to discuss Argentine issues, and, you were going to send to me 
the term sheet in use in Argentina.  Thanks.  Sara
