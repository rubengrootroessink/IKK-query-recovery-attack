Have you been talking with ITG Posit regarding installing their software in 
London?

Julie/Laurel,

I am back in London to continue our effort to get equity trading going over 
here.  Being back in the States the past two months, however, I have not been 
pushing the install of these apps.  I think we are OK on Autex and Instinet 
(although there may be issues with their Win2K compliancy) but do not know 
the status on ITG/Posit.  Although there may well have been further 
correspondence subsequent to the e-mails below, this is the most recent I can 
find.  Do either of you either know of any further developments and/or have 
the install/contractual package I mentioned?  

Thanks and regards,
John

Julie,

Do you have any recollection of receiving any software for this install?  
Laurel does not have anything on it.  Please let me know as soon as possible 
because if we don't have it we will have to get in touch with the vendor to 
get it going.

Thanks and regards,
John

Julie/Laurel,

After the flurry of e-mails below, I received a package from ITG/Posit Europe 
which I subsequently sent to one of you in Houston.  I am not sure who I sent 
it to but I am quite sure it got there and was "put through the channels" 
because Sara Shackleton has been working with ITG on the contractual issues.  
I am now trying to find out if any software was included in that package 
because I would like to get the install process going pending the 
finalization of the contract negotiations.  Please confirm as to whether or 
not either of you are aware of this installation software.

Thanks and regards,
John

John,
The contracts for the AutEx system have arrived and are being processed.
Do you still require the Instinet and ITG systems I vaguely remember some 
contracts being sent through do you know the status ?
Thanks

Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
further notice.

Thanks and regards,
John

John
Is this for European or US equities or both ?
Do you want to trade using Internet access or would you prefer a fixed link 
leased line ?
If you could let me know
Thanks
Cyrus

Cyrus,

Can you please arrange for this installation on my desktop.  Please 
coordinate with Julie Pechersky and Jamie White to ensure that my setup has 
the same functionality as Selena Gonzales in Houston.

Thanks and regards,
