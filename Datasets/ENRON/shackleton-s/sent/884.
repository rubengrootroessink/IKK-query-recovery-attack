I just finished neogtiating Annex A with this CP and its lawyer for the 
8-month financial deal effective 2/1/00.  The CP is anxious to receive an 
ISDA so that the ISDA will govern this transaction and future transactions.  
Please let me know who will prepare credit (since the CP knows my phone 
number and is awaiting receipt of a draft!).  Thanks.  Sara
