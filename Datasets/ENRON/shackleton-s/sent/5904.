The accounts at Bear owned by the credit book are:

The old account under ECT name: 102-04919
This account is empty but not yet closed

The current ENA acct is: 102-06181
This is where the positions are now held

These are the accounts that need to go to Enron Credit Inc

Thanks,

Tom

Tom:  Which accounts are being transferred to Bear?  Are these internal 
account numbers?  Thanks
