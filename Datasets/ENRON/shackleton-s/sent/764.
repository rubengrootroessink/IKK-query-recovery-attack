I did speak with Ana Soria.  Her only concern was the legal opinion.  I faxed 
her the format for the legal opinion and attached a cover sheet which 
indicated that ENA must receive the executed opinion by the close of business 
on December 29.  I've attached a copy of the fax cover sheet.  Also, Joe 
Hunter has added the "Automatic Termination" provision into the 
confirmation.  Have a happy holiday.  Sara
