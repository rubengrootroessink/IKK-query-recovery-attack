I believe that there is a general consensus that Clem needs assistance to 
respond timely to  the mounting number of guaranties requested from Enron 
Corp.  In speaking with Clem, it seems that any evidence of increased and 
increasing business and demand for guaranties will be helpful for him to 
obtain help.  Would your group be able to put together some facts and 
projections which might address the continuing demand for new guaranties?  
Since you are the first (and most important) point of contact for evaluating 
potential business, I think that your input would be extremely valuable for 
Clem to "plead his case."
