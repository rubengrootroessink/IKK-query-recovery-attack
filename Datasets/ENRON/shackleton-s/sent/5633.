Susan:

The internal EOL FX products will be opened up to third parties shortly.  I'm 
reviewing the GTC's.  With respect to the tax reps which are incorporated 
into the GTC's, I think we need a "universal" rep since the products could be 
traded by parties residing anywhere in the world.  I believe that the first 
week in March is the target EOL date.  

Can you prepare the tax rep section for the GTC's?  I am not aware of any 
other EOL product having this type of rep but I am not familiar with the 
totality of EOL products.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.
