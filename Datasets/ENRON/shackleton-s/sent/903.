Jarrod,

Please prepare a draft ISDA swap agreement with the attached terms.  Our 
lumber group is needing this for their negotiations with Stora as soon as 
possible.
It is my understanding the two companies are getting close to finalizing the 
ISDA.
As we discussed, a template for settling lumber swaps using the CME Lumber 
contract average last 3 trading day settle will be required.
If you need anything further or need clarification of anything, please call 
me to discuss.

JH.
