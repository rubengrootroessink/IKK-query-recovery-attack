Gareth suggested that I forward these swap documents to you two.  We are 
working on a 125 "revolver" structure that allows for several 125 assets to 
use one Trust to complete transactions.  Each asset will be set up in its own 
Asset LLC and Transferor LLC, but the Total Return Swap will be with the 
Master Trust and a new confirmation will be issued for each asset as it is 
placed in the vehicle.  I will be out of town next week, so please let Gareth 
or Charles DeLacey (x35757) know if you have any questions or comments.  I 
will be available through tomorrow.  Thanks.
