Sara:

Any chance you are available at 1:30pm on Wednesday for a call regarding the
Enron/Corrugated Services ISDA?  If that time will not work for you, please
suggest another time tomorrow afternoon that would.

Also, you will be receiving on Thursday morning a copy of some of the more
relevant documentation relating to the June 2000 drop down of the Corrugated
Services, Inc. operating assets and liabilities (including the original
Enron/Corrugated Services, Inc. ISDA) into a newly formed limited
partnership known as Corrugated Services, L.P.  In connection with that
transaction, Corrugated Services, Inc. changed its name to CSI Holdings,
Inc.  CSI Holdings, Inc. also formed at that time and now owns 100% of CSI
GP, Inc., which entity serves as the general partner of Corrugated Services,
L.P.  All of this was done to create a more franchise tax efficient
operating and ownership structure.

Based on the foregoing, we believe that it will be necessary to redocument
the original agreement either through an amendment thereto or the
cancellation thereof and the creation of a new LP/Enron agreement.

We plan on discussing the foregoing during our call tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks.
