In connection with the ISDA negotiations, PG&E is insisting on revising our 
"Limitation of Liability" language"

"...PROVIDED, HOWEVER,THAT NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL AFFECT THE 
ENFORCEABILITY OF SECTION 6(e) OF THIS AGREEMENT with respect to incidental 
damages."

PG&E claims that it will never be responsible for consequential damages and 
that certain elements of "Loss" comprise consequential damages (PG&E always 
agrees to "Market Quotation"). 
Have you ever prepared a list of the "Loss" components?
Can you assess before I go to Haedicke (or is this a non-starter)?
Thanks.  Sara
