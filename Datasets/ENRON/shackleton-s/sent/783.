1.  Friday's Market Action

                        $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Jones Industrials     +269.30     +2.39%   11522.56
S&P 500                    +32.43     +2.31%    1435.88
Nasdaq                    +155.39     +4.17%    3882.52
Internet Stock Index       +52.41     +6.76%     827.88

The Dow climbed to another record high while the Nasdaq racked up its
biggest point gain ever to rebound at the end of a week characterized
by extreme volatility.

Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) sparked today's Nasdaq rally and
simultaneously made history, becoming the most heavily traded stock in
a single session ever on the NYSE.  Shares of Lucent gained 1 3/4
(+3.37%) from Thursday's after-hours plunge following the warning
issued by the company after Thursday's markets closed that profits for
the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker would not meet
analyst expectations.  The announcement by Lucent, which was considered
a company-specific issue, propelled the stocks of its rivals in the
competitive telecommunications equipment market.  Shares of Nortel
Networks (NYSE:NT), a leading global supplier of telephone network
services, jumped 26.30% (up 20 1/4) to 97 1/4, while shares of
networking leader Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) closed up 5 7/8 (+5.88%)
to 105 7/8.  Other telecom equipment stocks also advanced, with JDS
Uniphase (Nasdaq:JDSU) jumping 20.16% (up 30 1/16) to 179 15/16 , Ciena
Corp. (Nasdaq:CIEN) closing up 25.89% (up 11 7/8) to 57 3/4, and
Tellabs (Nasdaq:TLAB) rising 2 1/4 (+3.53%) to 66 1/16.

Today's market rebounds were bolstered by positive economic news, as
the Labor Department reported that the December jobless rate held firm
at 4.1% and that December's growth of U.S. jobs outside the farm sector
was the largest in five months.  While the announcement was a sign of
the continued strong economy, it also set the stage for increased fear
among investors that the Fed will raise interest rates when it meets in
early February.  The Fed has indicated that it is closely monitoring
the job market as it considers whether to raise interest rates in an
effort to cool the booming economy.

Contributing to today's market gains was a resurgent drug sector, with
Dow component Merck (NYSE:MRK) up 6 9/16 (+9.60%) to 74 15/16, Eli
Lilly (NYSE:LLY) gaining 4 13/16 (+7.27%) to 71, Schering Plough
(NYSE:SGP) moving up 5 1/16 (+11.79%) to 48, and Pharmacia & Upjohn
(NYSE:PNU) rising 2 11/16 (+5.69%) to 49 15/16.

Biotechs also performed well today with Amgen (Nasdaq:AMGN) gaining 6
7/8 (+11.25%) to 68, Biogen (Nasdaq:BGEN) rising 1 7/16 (+1.92%) to 76
3/8, Genentech (NYSE:DNA) up 8 7/8 (+6.93%) to 136 7/8, Immunex
(Nasdaq:IMNX) rising 9 7/16 (+10.42%) to 100.

Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), the world's largest retailer, announced
that it will team up with Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Accel
Partners to form an Internet company, to be called Wal-Mart.com, which
is expected to enhance the giant retailer's Web site and bring more of
its shoppers online.  The partnership is also seen as a larger sign of
the move by leading retailers worldwide to become major players in the
competitive e-tail (online retail) market.  Investors reacted favorably
to the news, anticipating a major IPO of Wal-Mart.com in the future,
which sent shares of the Dow component rose 4 13/16 (+7.56%) to 68 1/2.
Meanwhile, shares of e-tailers performed well, with Amazon.com
(Nasdaq:AMZN) rising 4 (+6.10%) to 69 9/16, barnesandnoble.com
(Nasdaq:BNBN) gaining 1 9/16 (+10.55%) to 16 3/8, and CDnow
(Nasdaq:CDNW) edging up 9/16 (+5.81%) to 10 1/4, although E-toys
(Nasdaq:ETYS) dropped 1 15/16 (-8.24%) to 21 9/16.

Other big movers on the Dow helped drive the markets upward, with
Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) rising 8 5/8 (+8.00%) to 116 1/2, General
Electric (NYSE:GE) closing up 5 21/64 (+3.66%) to 151, Johnson &
Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) gaining 3 3/16 (+3.44%) to 95 3/4, Coca-Cola
(NYSE:KO) rising 3 3/4 (+6.58%) to 60 3/4, and Honeywell (NYSE:HON)
closing up 3 (+5.36%) to 59.

While telecom stocks helped drive the Nasdaq higher, telecom investors
were buzzing over the threat by Federal Communications Commission
Chairman William Kennard that regulatory action would be forthcoming if
the cable television industry and consumer electronics manufacturers
fail to resolve a standards dispute that is holding up the availability
of digital TV sets.  The parties have yet to reach an agreement over an
interface that would allow cable shows to appear on sets while
protecting the programs from being illegally copied.  Telecom stocks
came in with mixed results, as #1 U.S. long-distance carrier AT&T
(NYSE:T) rose 1 (+2.08%) to 49, Sprint Group (NYSE:FON) gained 9/16
(+0.89%) to 63 15/16, Winstar Communications (Nasdaq:WCII) closed up 1
1/2 (+2.21%) to 69 1/4, while Covad Communications (Nasdaq:COVD) fell 1
21/32 (-2.75%) to 58 1/2, Sprint PCS (Nasdaq:PCS) dropped 2 5/8 (-
2.78%) to 91 13/16.

In other telecom news, McLeodUSA (Nasdaq:MCLD), a leading provider of
local and long-distance telephone services, announced its intent to buy
Splitrock Services (Nasdaq:SPLT), the operator of a nationwide, high-
speed data network carrying over 2 billion minutes per month of
Internet traffic, for approximately $1.75 billion in stock in its
effort to expand its menu of offerings beyond voice telephone services.
Shares of McLeodUSA edged up 11/16 (+1.31%) to 53 1/4, while shares of
Splitrock jumped 21.75% (up 4 13/16) to 26 15/16.

Today's tech stock action also saw RealNetworks (Nasdaq:RNWK)
announcing its creation of an alliance with Universal Music Group, the
world's biggest recording company, which will allow consumers to use
RealNetwork's software to listen to music from Universal's wide array
of artists.  Under the agreement, Universal, a unit of Seagram Company
(NYSE:VO), will distribute RealJukebox, the digital music player
software developed by RealNetworks that lets users record and organize
songs on a computer.  Shares of RealNetworks rose 18 7/8 (+16.68%) to
132 1/16, while shares of Seagram edged lower 1/16 (-0.13%) to 48 5/8.

MicroStrategy (Nasdaq:MSTR) closed up 10 1/8 (+5.06%) to 210 3/8,
continuing its upward momentum gained from its 2-for-1 stock split
announcement on January 4.  The record date for the split is January 20
and the new shares will be issued on January 26, 1999.  The most recent
issue of the Smart!Splits Report forecasted the MicroStrategy split.
