Sheila:  Mike Fowler is involved in this effort.  He tells me that the entity 
is "EnronCredit.com Limited".  Is this info correct?  Sara

Sara,
What entity are these agreements in.  If they are in ECT Investments name, I 
think you should do.  If they are in ENA name, London can sign.

Justin/Paul:  The Houston contingent of EnronCredit.com Limited has a number 
of agreements which they would like to have executed.  All ENA/Enron Corp. 
affiliate brokerage/futures agreements are signed by the Enron trading party 
TOGETHER WITH Ted Murphy (for control purposes).  I am currently reviewing  
about 4-6 of these agreements.

How should we handle review of the referenced agreements originating from 
Houston?  Shall I continue to review?
Do you have trading resoutions/authorized trader lists in place for 
EnronCredit.com Limited?

I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara
