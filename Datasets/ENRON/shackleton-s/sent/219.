I believe the ISDA is ready to be signed, and credit has been approved. Sara, 
do we have signature pages yet? I think we want to confirm it under the ISDA 
but not until we have signature pages.

The DRAFT on this trade was sent in (executed) ISDA form. We are we 
anticipating a signed ISDA Master Agreement ? How should I confirm this trade?

Has Credit approved the transaction?
