I understand Greg Penman has inquired for the same.  I would be happy to 
coordinate amongst us and informed Greg accordingly.

Thank you
Molly

Tana

Is it possible to get electronic file for the Enron North America and Peoples 
Energy Corporation ISDA?  Is it in Word?  I am trying to get our new JV, 
Midwest Energy Hub, to utilize our format for the template for MEH.

Thanks
Molly

Molly,

Could you send me an electronic version of the ISDA that was signed between
ENA and PEC. I understand from our attorney that we did not work with an
electronic version, only a hard copy. In order to create an ISDA template
for MEH, I need the electronic version.

Thanks

Aparna
