I love you so much.  And you send great messages.  My life has always been a 
mess.  I never had a chance to tallk to you about Cuba and I'm totally 
fascinated with the island.  I sat next to this lawyer from NY on the flight 
from BA to Miami and he's recently separated and wants me to dump Mike.  I 
have a "house sitter" while I'm on vacation (thought I'd try it out since you 
probably would!).  Mike asked the concierge at "The Argyle" to make 
reservations from a list I prepared.  All of your suggestions except Parkway 
Grill appear.  How do people in LA dress for dinner? HELP!  I have to pack 
tonight.  I need new shoes.  I'll be in the office tomorrow until 4:15pm.  
Bye now ................... Sass

Hey Sass,

My life is a mess!! I barely have time to pee.
These are the restaurants I remember as great--Patina (but you can't
wear jeans I don't think), La Campanile (maybe it's El Campanile) and
Parkway Grill.
Have fun.
Love,
Deb
