Paul:  I think you are trying to avoid me!  Hope all is well and you are just 
overworked and overwhelmed.  I am now working with Moazzam Khoja in Houston 
who is part of the enroncredit.com group most of which (as I understand) is 
located in London.  In connection with that group's activities, I have some 
questions and all fingers point to you.

(1)  Do you have credit derivative research that may be applicable for credit 
derivative transactions (including your online "bankruptcy swap") in the US?  
I am sure that you've already explored the "insurance" issue and I don't want 
to duplicate reasearch, if possible.
(2)  What forms have you devised?  Are they online?   Should I just grab a 
password?
(3)  Are the enroncredit.com traders in the UK required by the SFA to take an 
SFA exam (I'm guessing it's a broker or securities exam)?  Is trading in 
credit derivatives regulated, or regulated differently than other types of 
derivatives?  I am trying to determine whether Moazzam needs to take the 
Series 7 here in the US; our traders taking that exam must be dealing in 
"securites" for that exam to be necessary.
(4)  Where is enroncredit.com headed?

I would very much appreciate your [PROMPT] reply.  Sara
