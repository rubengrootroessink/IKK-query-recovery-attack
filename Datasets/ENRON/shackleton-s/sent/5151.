Holli:

I have still not received the above-mentioned comments.  I have also not 
received EWEB's proposed form of legal opinion.  I will go ahead and 
blackline the Schedule once again.

When the lawyers last spoke, we agreed to execute all docs prior to the end 
of the year.

Would you please call EWEB and inquire about these items?

Thanks.  Sara
