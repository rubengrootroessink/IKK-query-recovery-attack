George:

1.  You didn't answer my question about "Calculation Period" and "IPA 
Modified Calculation Period".

2.  Are you saying that EEL "elects" to increase/decrease the Basket 
Component Shares?
Are you saying that the "IPA Number of Shares" is negative or the IPA is 
negative?
Is the IPA negative when the Initial Price exceeds the Relevant Price?

Good Morning Sara,

"Share Spread" is not applicable and should be deleted. 

A negative IPA is subject to a specific swap traded. It would have to be a 
case where the Stock is already part of the Basket and they elect to unwind 
the swap and reduce the number of shares from the basket. For example, if 
10,000 shares of XYZ Company were part of the original basket, they can trade 
off 5,000 shares of the swap effectively creating a negative IPA. The trade 
is mutually agreed upon. 

Looking forward to meeting with you!

Jorge

Jorge:  I may send you some emails throughout the day to help clarify some 
things for me.

 Where are your definitions of "Calculation Period" and "IPA Modified 
Calculation Period"? 

In your definition of "IPA Floating Rate Payment", you use the term "Share 
Spread" which is not defined.  What do you mean?  There is a dangling 
definition of "Share Spread" at the end of the IPA Compensation section, but 
it refers to spreads appearing in either Annex I or Annex II.

In the "IPA Compensation" section, how is "a negative IPA elected"?  Who is 
making an election?

Let's discuss tomorrow.
