Dee:

No answer on your phone!  Monday morning works fine; I've put you down for 10 
am Houston time and I'll call you.  Contact my assistant Kaye Ellis if this 
doesn't work (713-853-5968).  I'm busy from 2 - 4 pm Houston.  

Also, Susan Bailey will be unable to answer your questions, so let's wait 
until we speak.
