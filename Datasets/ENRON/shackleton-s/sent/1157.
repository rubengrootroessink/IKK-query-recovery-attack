(1)  The term "Threshold Amount" as used in Annex B refers to the threshold 
for cross default purposes under Section 5(a)(vi) of the ISDA boilerplate by 
reference to outstanding loans ("obligations for the payment of money", i.e., 
"Specified Indebtedness" in Section 14 of the ISDA boilerplate).  Credit sets 
the threshold level and we input that number into the document.

(2)  Susan Bailey will send you the ISDA Master Agreement boilerplate.  Her 
number is X34737.

SUSAN:  Please send Davis the ISDA boilerplate (no CSA).  Thanks.  Sara

Laurel,

As we discussed on the phone, the floating rate day count convention should 
be Actual/360.

Sara, could you easily explain what the Threshold Amount means in Annex B?  I 
tried to look it up on the web but couldn't find anything.  Additionally, if 
you have an extra copy of ISDA up there, I might like to have a copy (hope 
you don't hurt yourself laughing...).

Thanks & regards,
Davis

please pay speical attention to the Fixed and Floating rate payer payment
