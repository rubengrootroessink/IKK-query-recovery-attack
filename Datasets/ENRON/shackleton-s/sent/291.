I have spoke to Jeff Harbert about the use of "Fallback Reference Price" in 
the confirms and the need for an additional provision addressing 
"Postponement" (which will override our defintion of Postponement in the 
Master Agreement).  Please take note of this in preparing new confirms.  I 
have appropriate language.  Please call if you have any questions.  Sara
