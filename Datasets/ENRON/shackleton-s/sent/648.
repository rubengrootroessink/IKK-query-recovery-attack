Hi Christian!  I wanted to ask you a few questions about the occurrence of 
negative pricing on the west desk.  I'm getting a differenct response on the 
east desk.  Although my interest is financial trading, you may have 
experieced this issue on the physical side (Jeff Hodge has not).  In the past 
on the west desk financial trading, any prices which are negative are deemed 
to be "0" (so an average of hourly prices could include some zeroes).  The 
east desk wants to add in the negative numbers.  Please call me to discuss.  
I'd really appreciate it.  Sara
