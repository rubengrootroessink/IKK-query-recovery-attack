Dennis:

Attached are two "templates" for power trades confirmed under an executed 
ISDA Master Agreement, one is for a swap and the other for an option (cap or 
floor).  Ignore the symbols and elections which are only to feed deal terms 
into our confirmation system.  The specific terms of each trade (dates, 
notional quantities, price indexes and pricing, etc.) would be inserted into 
the format.  I hope this helps. Sara
