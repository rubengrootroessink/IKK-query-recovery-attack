?
Thank you for your email.? Our comments are as  follows:
?
1. Thank you.
?
2. We do not understand the difficulty in accepting our Rider  A which is a 
standard provision in a guarantee and one which our client strongly  wishes 
to include. Please would you therefore schedule a conference call with  your 
corporate lawyer Clement Abrams to discuss this.? Please note that  Susan is 
out of the office on Thursday. 
?
3.? We agree to 10 Business Days.
?
4. We agree to there being no replacement credit  support.
?
We look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Sharon Lewis and Susan Hopkinson
