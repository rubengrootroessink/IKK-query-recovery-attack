Bill

You are probably aware that Enron has gone unconditional on its offer to buy 
MG, a metal company here in London.
The objective is to integrate with them ASAP and as smoothly as possible.

I made a visit with MG today and talked to their FX trader who said that he 
trades with the following banks:
CIBC
Deutche Bank
Commerz Bank
Metall Bank

Can you please tell me what lines we have in place with these, if any at all.


Sara
Do we have isdas etc in place?


Most of the trades are spot or 3mth forward, but some trades are up to four 
years out.


Thanks
Trena
