Pablo,

Sara asked that I e:mail the attached sample form of ISDA Master Agreement 
for an Argentine Counterparty.   Please do not e:mail this Agreement to your 
counterparty, rather we ask that you download the attached Agreement and fax 
same to your Counterparty contact. 

Please contact us if you have any questions.
