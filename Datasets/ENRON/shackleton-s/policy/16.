Welcome to WorkPerks!


Who:  The Enron WorkPerks team has been working hard for YOU! 

 
What:  WorkPerks is "stuff that makes life a little easier."  This "stuff" 
can be a program such as a summer camp for children of Enron employees, a   
benefit such as a paternity leave, guidelines such as Enron's new part-time 
structure, or an amenity such as Ticketmaster.


Where: All Enron locations will receive WorkPerks!


When:  WorkPerks will kickoff in Houston Tuesday, February 15 and soon 
thereafter launch globally.  
  All Enron domestic locations should have WorkPerks by mid summer 2000.*
  WorkPerks will arrive in all international locations by early 2001. *
  

Why:  Because Enron employees deserve the best!

If you have any questions, please contact WorkPerks on home.enron.com 
(website will be available February 15th) or call the WorkPerks Hotline at 
713.345.8600.  We welcome your suggestions!


*Please be patient, as we will be working to design customized WorkPerk 
programs that fit your region's particular needs.
