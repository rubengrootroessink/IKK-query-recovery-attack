To protect against viruses, all inbound Internet addressed e-mail with 
attachments will be quarantined beginning on December 31.  E-mail without 
attachments and those with low and medium risk attachments (see below) will 
be delivered after a brief delay of approximately 15 minutes.  Delivery of 
e-mail with high and extreme risk attachments will be released on January 6, 
2000 unless a serious virus threat still exists.

Category: File Extensions:
Low: *.txt, *.htm 
Medium: *.jpg, *.avi, *.bmp, *.pcx, *.gif, *.mid 
High: *.dot, *.doc, *.ppt, *.xls, *.hlp, *.(all unrecognizable)
Extreme: *.exe, *.bat, *., *.vbs, *.wbt, *.cmd, *.com, *.dll, *.zip

Low and Medium risk categories will not be held unless there is a deemed 
emergency in which case we will begin holding these file types as well
High risk will be held starting Thursday December 30, 1999 @ 6:00pm through 
January 5, 2000 @ 12:00 midnight
Extreme risk will be held starting Tuesday December 28, 1999 @ 12:00 midnight 
through January 5, 2000 @ 12:00 midnight

If you require an e-mail for business purposes that is being quarantined 
please send an e-mail to Y2K Email Release.  Please include business 
justification, name of sender and name of recipient(s).  We will review the 
email you are requesting and release it to you once we have determined it is 
virus free.

In addition to being cautious regarding email please remember to do the 
following as mentioned in Rick Causey's Y2K email on December 16, 1999:

 Log off. For most users, follow normal procedures and choose "Close all 
programs and log on as a different user" when leaving for the night.   
 Leave PC turned on.   

Following these procedures will allow the Infrastructure & Integration team 
to download virus patches to your PCs over the millennium weekend.  

A considerable amount of work preparing for Y2K has been done, and we hope 
you will help minimize any impact the calendar rollover could have on Enron's 
computer systems.
