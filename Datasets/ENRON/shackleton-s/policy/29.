I am proud to announce to you the members of the newly created Enron 
Diversity Task Force.  The goals of this Task Force are twofold:  to instill 
Enron's commitment to diversity throughout the organization and to ensure 
that at Enron it is not your background that matters, but the quality of your 
ideas that continue to create the dynamic environment that challenges us to 
view the world from different perspectives.

These key leaders from throughout the company will work closely with our Task 
Force Leader, Cindy Olson, and me to shape Enron's commitment to diversity.

Diversity is a responsibility of each and every one of us to educate 
ourselves, to better understand, appreciate and accept one another.  New 
ideas from anyone, anywhere, anytime will be the catalyst to Enron's 
continued future success.  Our purpose is to implement and lay the framework 
to make that happen. 

If you have any recommendations for us to consider, please feel free to 
contact me personally or any member of the Task Force.
