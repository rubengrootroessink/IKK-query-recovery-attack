Hi Everyone!!!

As you already know Neil and Robyn are getting married
March10,2001 at the Four Seasons in Palm Beach.  The
Chestnovs have reserved a block of rooms for the
wedding.

If you want to make your reservation now, at the Four
Seasons, their phone # 1-800-432-2335.  The rate is
$335.00 per nite (Friday and Saturday 3/9 and 3/10).

There is a Hilton next door to the Four Seasons.  I do
not know what their rate is, but the phone number is
(516) 586-6542.  There is also a Howard Johnson.  That
phone # is (561) 582-2581.

I know you probably think it's too early to make a
reservation, but the Four Seasons only has 200 rooms,
and the guest list is about 250.

Let us know if we can help you with any arrangements.

Joan and Gary
