Sara,
I spoke with Gary regarding the clearing of this CSFB activity.  I have also 
spoken with Kathleen Goss, CSFB, to clarify the use of these different 
agreements.  
The Executing Broker Agreement, includes the "give-up" to another clearing 
broker.  That is, we may choose to execute through CSFB but Clear through our 
existing agreements with Prudential and Carr.  
The Clearing Agreement, is our abiltiy is for  CSFB to clear the 
transaction.  Gary does want to put this in place.
The PrimeTrade License Agreement is specifically for the electronic Trading.

CSFB is forwarding the other two agreements, Executing and Clearing,  to me 
and I will forward them to legal.
Thanks Sheila

Sara, We need to send back to them with the agreements the fee schedule.  I 
will forward a copy to you.
Thanks, Sheila

Sara, Ted,
CSFB has a new electronic access trading system for futures. 
Financial Trading, Enron North America, wants to establish a relationship to 
support this trading.  

To Trade Electronically, ENA will need a Standard Execution Agreement 
(Executing Broker) and a "Prime Trade" Agreement which supports the 
electronic trading.  
Financial Trading is still assessing whether we need a Give-up agreement with 
CSFB or will utilitze our current relationships with Carr and Prudential to 
hold the positions.  I have confirmed with Bob Klein that noone at Enron 
currently trades futures with CSFB.  
Trading will include Futures including, S&P, Nasdaq, Fixed Income (bonds, 
eurodollars) and Forex.

Sheila
