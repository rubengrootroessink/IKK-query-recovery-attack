Sara,
 I have received a faxed copy from Merrill Lynch for prime brokerage 
clearance services agreement.  They are asking us to fill out the form and 
return to them.  We have reviewed our current listing of executing brokers 
and found that Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith has already been 
established.  Do you know when the executing broker agreement with Merrill 
was signed so I can forward this information to them?

Thanks,
Theresa
