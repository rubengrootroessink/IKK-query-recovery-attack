Mark:
I and several other people in our group are concerned about Cheryl's apparent 
unwillingness to attend on a consistent basis group meetings (i.e., 
legal/credit meetings and seminars and our legal group meeting) that are 
held.  I understand from Sara that today Tana had to go and get Cheryl to 
come to the legal/credit meeting.  Last week, she did not show up for the 
legal/credit seminar that Brent held.  Could you please talk to her about 
this?  I am concerned that she is not plugged into our group and is not 
learning and hearing the things that she needs to be learning and hearing.  I 
alos think that it is important to act and be like a team on some matters and 
not an individual.  Thanks.
