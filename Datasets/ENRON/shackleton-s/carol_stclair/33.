On the offsite, Frank has a doctor's appt. that afternoon and asked that we 
reschedule.  Should we have it in the morning of the 24th or reschedule our 
23rd c credit seminar?  As for a list, I'm working on it.  Last week was a 
blur with PG&E and Proctor & Gamble.

Sure.  I think we should ask Paul R. if anyone else from credit is necessary 
(London, perhaps?) and from legal, you, Brent and me.

Also, we need to refine the offsite now that we have a date set.  I will be 
on vacation during the week of May 7 - 11.  Were you able to put a list 
together?

Sara:
Do you want me to coordinate setting this up and if so, who should attend?
