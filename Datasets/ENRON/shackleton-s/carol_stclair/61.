Sara:
Just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics:

1.  credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define 
the "materially weaker" standard.  Alos, I'm wondering how credit monitors 
mergers in general.

2.  additional termination events - when does credit consider additional 
events like change of control, MAC, chnages to partnership agreement or 
structure etc.

3.  minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the 
threshold

4.  threshold amount - what triggers makes it reduce to zero

5.  enforcement of collateral remedies - going over the timetable for 
enforcing our remedies when a counterparty fails to post and the different 
cure periods.

6.  letter of credit bank qualifications - confirming with credit that these 
are still current

7.  cash collateral in Canada
