Subject: Duke claim against Enron

Although no formal notice has been rec'd from Duke, They have informed me 
verbally that they do not intend to proceed with any claims against us.  If 
you need any details please call me in BA or send me an email with your 
contact instructions.  Given the nature of this topic I would prefer to 
discuss my thoughts on the subject in person, if necessary.  Thanks for 
everyone's help, and I apologise for any inconvenience.
