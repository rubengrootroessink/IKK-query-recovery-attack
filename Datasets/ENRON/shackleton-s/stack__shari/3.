Dear Rogelio, 

Thank you for your email. 

Things are changing here at Enron and I am moving to a different group within 
the Legal Department. I will be doing the legal work to support our Physical 
Power Trading operations, effective April 3, 2000. 

My colleague, Sara Shackleton, will be replacing me with respect to the legal 
work for financial derivatives in Mexico. Her direct line is 713-853-5620/ 
Fax 713-646-3490. I will forward your email to her.

It has been a pleasure working with you and your colleagues and I wish you 
all the very best for the future. 

Kind regards, 

Shari
