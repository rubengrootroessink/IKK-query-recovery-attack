Lynn,

From a cash perspective, we are going to start having wires, invoices etc. 
paid on behalf of the LLC beginning on November 15 so that we can minimize 
the activity on Enron International Inc. (1U9).

I am getting calls again from people asking me whetehr to book the NDF's in 
Enron International or ESA.  As I had mentioned, I am indifferent from a tax 
perspective but did not know whether you were ready from an accounting 
perspective to switch these transactions to ESA.  Where do we stand on this 
issue?

Lynn
