Please review the attached sample swap confirmation.
Like I said, Rob Scheuer is trying to create the Lumber Market and would like 
to use ISDA documents in the future.  
He will be passing this sample swap confirmation out to many potential 
customers.
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Many thanks and kind regards,

Lucy
