I have no problem with the format.  I have not talked to Maria.  I got a call from Michael Emerson (today), which I have not answered--he wants to get the confirm signed and leave the VE discussion (on form of opinion) until later this week [and I have no problem with that either].  Why don't you finalize it with Maria and ask her to tell Michael that later this week for VE discussion is fine?  Thanks.

Jim:  Based upon our discussion of last wee, the attached format looks fine to me.  Did you have a chance to check on 3.1(iii)?  Have you already spoken to Maria?
Please call when you have a chance.  Sara

As we discussed, I attach a revised copy of the confirmation that is marked
to show changes made to our June 27th draft.
