Clint,

Per our discussions, we need to agree to some modifications to the
confirmation this week in order to proceed with the roll.

These modifications involve making sure we can receive the cash due to us if
you net share settle, and should not impact your accounting for the
transactions.   This clauses are standard - I'm not sure how they got
dropped from the confirmation.

Here is a blackline version of the confirm: <<Enron confirm blackline
