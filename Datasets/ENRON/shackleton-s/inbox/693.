Dear Sara:

I apologize for the delay but I have been unsuccessful in finding a good way
to get you your wine.  I am unable to ship FedEx or UPS unless it is going
to a distributor.  We have some customers who live in similar "unfriendly"
wine states who make arrangements with private mailing companies here in
California and we have mailed it to them.  Unfortunately, the danger in us
doing it is it could get held up somewhere along the way and they may
destroy it.  I believe it is too much wine to risk the possibility.

I will continue to look into other possibilities but if you have any
suggestions or are planning to be in another state soon, please let me know
and I will do whatever I can to get it to you.

Regards,


Jill Melendy
Dutton-Goldfield Winery
