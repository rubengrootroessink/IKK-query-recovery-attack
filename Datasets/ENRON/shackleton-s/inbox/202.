Sara and Marie,
CSFB Europe requires information to open an account.  We have an account with CSFB Corporation - NY. Would you please review their requirements?  Do we have a problem with any of them?

Please do not hesitate to call if questions.  I will get Robert Daborn's telephone number.
Thanks,
Sheila

SG,

I called CSFB (Robert Daborn CSFB Compliance) yesterday because they issued yet another confirm in the name of ECT Investments PLC and not ECT Inv Inc. (We thought this matter had been resolved on their side but apparently not).

Below I have attached an email that I received from Robert.  The email contains a word document that requires an authorized Enron person's signature.

Please let me know if I can do anything from this side to resolve this matter.

Many thanks
Kimberly

Kimberly,

Further to our conversation of earlier today it would appear that trades
have been incorrectly allocated to an existing Enron account. This existing
account has been opened with CSFB for several years and it may well be the
case that it is the correct entity for certain transactions between our two
corporations.

However, I note that for transactions executed by yourself the correct
booking entity should be ETC Investments Inc (ETC). Whilst ETC is an
existing client of CSFB Corporation - NY it is not currently set up as a
client of CSFB Equities / CSFB Europe Ltd.

In order that your account can be set up and trades booked correctly I would
appreciate it if you could provide CSFB with following information:

1) Confirmation that ETC is a wholly / majority owned subsidiary of Enron
Corp. This can be evidenced by providing CSFB with a copy of Enron's Annual
Report / Audited Financial Statement and Accounts or confirmed in writing by
Enron on Enron letterhead  

2) Confirmation of the registered address of ETC

3) Completed and signed authorisation document attached below.

The information requested above is required to meet our UK Regulatory &
Legal obligations and is not to my knowledge retained by our New York
office.

Please accept my apologies for any delay you've experienced in resolving
this issue but by providing the information requested we should be in a
position to make the requisite changes.

Kind Regards

Rob Daborn
