Sara and Susan,

I was just wondering whether you've received credit terms to include in the
Credit Support Annex Paragraph 13.  Once we receive these terms, I will
immediately consult my Credit Dept. and respond.

Thanks,

Vijay

	Vijay,

	I have not received anything.  However, Sara may have--but she is
out of
	the office today and will be back on Monday.

	Have a pleasant weekend.

	Thank you for sending your draft Paragraph 13.  I've looked it over

		Mr. Suchdev,

		Attached is our sample form of Paragraph 13, which
supplements
	the
	ISDA
		Credit Support Annex boilerplate.   Once Credit has
furnished us
	with
		the terms under a Credit Worksheet, we will be able to
provide a
	version
		which includes the credit features.

		Hope this helps in the interim.
