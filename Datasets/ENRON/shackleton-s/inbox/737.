Sara,

Can you give me a status on this request?  I have your name as the contact person to accomplish this.

Thanks!

As mentioned, we would like to review gas financial transactions.  As a start, we would like to obtain confirmations, and individual transaction MTM's, for the transactions associated with the 10 largest In the Money counterparties (as measured by positive net MTM)
