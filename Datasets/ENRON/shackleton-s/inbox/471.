Sheila,
Further to my earlier E Mail I have now spoken to Credit Lyonnais and we
have agreed that for the futures transactions we will not need to prepare a
Terms of Business for Enron North Amercica Corp.
Best Regards

Jackie,

Legal is reviewing the Terms of Business document for Credit Lyonnais
and Monument Derivatives.

For Equities and Options, we will trade as ECT Investments, Inc.  with
all clearing through Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley &
Co.

For Futures, we will trade as Enron North America Corp. with Give-up to
Carr Futures and Deutsche Banc Alex Brown Inc. We are currently in the
process of setting up the Deutsche Bank agreement.  Rob Manders,
212-469-2034, Rob.Manders@db.com,  may be contacted for more
information.

Legal thought that for the futures we only require your give-up
agreements to Carr and DB and will not need the Terms of Business
Agreement on the Futures side.

Please advise.
Sheila
