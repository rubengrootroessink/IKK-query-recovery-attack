Sara:

Thank you again for forwarding me an information on financial settlements. 

You were working on the Master Log of all counterparties that had financial trades with Enron that would include contract types (ISDA, etc.), termination conditions, and contract numbers. Could you please forward me this document at your convenience. Should you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me at X 3-4305.

Best regards,
Elena
