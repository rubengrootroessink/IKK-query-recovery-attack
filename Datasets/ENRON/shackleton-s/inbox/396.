Item 1.  Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form reg=
arding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our s=
chedule.

(g)=09Setoff.  (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early T=
ermination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in eith=
er case, "X") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any=
 amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, "Y=
") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this A=
greement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), =
any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's A=
ffiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obliga=
tion) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o=
r undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respe=
ct of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent o=
f any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y noti=
ce of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after t=
he setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not a=
ffect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, "Owed" sha=
ll mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of wh=
ether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Terminat=
ion Date.
Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by=
 X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rat=
e of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, =
would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being convert=
ed.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that o=
bligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant pa=
rty accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in=
 this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security inter=
est except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision =
shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting=
, offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to whi=
ch X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by=
 operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents =
and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral =
part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the=
 parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the part=
ies further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of i=
tself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of=
 its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Sectio=
n and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agr=
eement as it relates to this Section.
(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreeme=
nt, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, sha=
ll not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amo=
unt under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party=
 receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (whi=
ch may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any=
 kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined her=
ein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any pay=
ments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affil=
iates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o=
r undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof ha=
ve been fully and finally satisfied.

The following are three areas of questions.

A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section=
 7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's "priority" position (assumin=
g Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?

1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff=
 rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setof=
f right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables.=20

2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron h=
as made no public filings) without Enron's written consent?
=20
B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignmen=
t provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we=
 may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the maste=
r agreement and transactions "as security".  Please review and advise of an=
y particular language you think should be added. =20

C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) p=
rovision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the=
 end of 7(b), ";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subje=
ct [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all =
rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section]."

Item 2.  Can I get any other comments on the revised draft of master nettin=
g agreement?
