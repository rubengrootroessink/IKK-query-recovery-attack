Sara,

Unfortunately, I do not know either of these people.  I was given their
names from the lawyer who replaced me at A&K in negotiating ISDA's on
Bridgeline's behalf (Sharon Ward).      Entergy-Koch   -   Troy Martin
713-544-6210   and Marty Jo Rogers 713-544-5282.  I hope this is helpful.

Jason
