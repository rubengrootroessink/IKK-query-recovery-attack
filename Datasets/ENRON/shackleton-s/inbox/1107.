Lauri:

Enron Corp. would like to reexecute the guaranty (everything the same but with proper date) so we will deliver a new guaranty and certificate.  We ask that upon receipt, you return the guaranty that you are now holding.

Thanks.

Sara

Lauri:

We are in the midst of obtaining the certificate.

Also, I just noticed that the effective date is missing the year "2001".
Would you like to insert it and we will initial?

Thanks.  Sara

   Would it be possible for you to forward a corporate resolution
   indicating
   that the signatory
    on the guaranty has full authorirization? Thanks in advance for your
   help
