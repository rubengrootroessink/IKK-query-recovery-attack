Sorry that I did not get around to talk with you both but if Bob Bruce could pick up the financial side of EIM, that would be a big help to Cheryl.  Bob, please talk with Steve VanHooser for transition.  Let me know if there are questions etc.

No.  Yesterday, Sheila mentioned that Bob Bruce would be handling the EIM financial contracts.  I do have a stack of Financial confirms that Gordon Heeney provided - who should I send them to?

Cheryl:

Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?

Thanks.  Sara
