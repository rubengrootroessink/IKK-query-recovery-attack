Sheila:
After we spoke, I did go back and check the rule and it appears that the filing must be made for 3 more quarters in 2002.  In the example used by the SEC:  [Enron] will file a Form 13F for the calendar quarter ending in December 200[1] - and the calendar quarters ending in March 200[2], June 200[2], and September 200[2] - if [Enron] meet[s] the $100 million filing threshold on the last trading day of at least one month during the year 200[1].  In other words, if we go this route, I think we need 2 more filings for 2002.

Donna and Sara,

Rather that calling the SEC, a easier and a cost effective approach may be to prepare the March 31, 2002 SEC 13F filing which is due on May 15, 2002 now.

I have confirmed with Art Boos, Bowne, 713-869-9181, that we can submit and approve now and they will hold unitl the release date in May.  

Please advise if you are okay with this approach.  At Sara's suggestion, I have discussed with Robert George who agrees with the the efficacy of this approach.

Regards,
Sheila

Donna and Sara,

Executed hard copy to be sent to you today.

I will call the SEC because once you drop below the 100 million you are supposed to file for three quarters.  June 30th was the last time we were over $100 milllion so by rule we should file one more time.  I am not sure how they treat a company that is no longer in business.
