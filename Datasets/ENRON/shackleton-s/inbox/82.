Can we discuss what DIP money is?  If it is in the ENA grouping of accounts at Goldman Sachs, I think we have to say it is.  And, besides ECT Investments, Inc is 

Do we have what GS is looking for in the "order"

Just confirming - this is DIP money.  If so, use acct 4078-1075  Enron North America

Mary,
Do you have an Enron North America Corp. bank account I can use for Goldman Sachs.  The hedge book is in a grouping of accounts under ENA.  In the past, we have wired to ECT Investments Inc.'s Citibank account but this is probably not a good idea at this time.

The amount is $985,614.39.

Please advise.
Sheila
