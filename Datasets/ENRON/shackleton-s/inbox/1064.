Clint,

Here is the calculation again.    As discussed, the forward price was
dropped from the 1/4/02 settlement date level back to the unwind settlement
date of 11/6/01.   For a note issued on 11/6/01, interest should be
calculated to the note maturity date of 12/3/01.

Please let us know when the note is ready to be picked up, and we will send
someone over.

Regards,
