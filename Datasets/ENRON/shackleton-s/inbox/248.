The decision that was made early on was that we were only going to tackle Gas and Power first.  I am concerned that there may be other amendments that Stacy has sent to Mark which you may not have....

Kim:  Sorry for the mixup.  Attached is my redlined version of Stacy's form.  Do we need to add references to crude?  Sara

Sara,
Attached is the EOL Amendment that Stacy Dickson has already prepared for Texaco and sent to Mark.  Power does not need to see it as stated below since Power does not do any business with Texaco.  Can you incorporate your financial comments into the version below?

Mark, 
Attached is an EOL Amendment for the Texaco entities.  EPMI does not trade power with Texaco so Janet does not need to see this amendment.
