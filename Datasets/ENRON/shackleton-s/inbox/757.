I thought that you, Mark Quaglia, and the other fellow from Cadwalader are assigned to the top nonterminated financial gas contracts, with more resources to come.

Am I right?

P.S. The list sent to Louis is not the live gas financial contracts, and has not been updated for awhile.

Sara suggested that you have an electronic copy of a document that assigns attorneys to the top x live financial CPs.  Please forward to Ed McMichael and myself today.
