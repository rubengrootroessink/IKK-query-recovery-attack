Sarah, EDF only gave us their risk adjusted number for statement day 10/30/01.  They were under the assumption that they would go back to calculating margin on a span basis the following day once the specified trades were moved.
Statement Day:		Span Margin		Risk-Adjusted Margin
10/30/01		$34,853,585		$89,097,843
10/31/01		$31,141,475		N/A
11/01/01		$16,900,771		N/A

Thanks,
Todd
