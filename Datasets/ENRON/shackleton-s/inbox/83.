David,  

This trade needs to be unwound and ECT Investments taken out of the loop.  
We should not be a counterparty on the trade.  Please confirm your course of action. 

Regards,
Sheila

Sheila,

It's the triplets trade.  We probably owe about 800K that we would have to pay.  The trade was originally done with ECT Investments and never re assigned.

I'll all you later to discuss.

Cheers

David

David,
We received a Credit Derivative notice for ECT Investments Inc..  We do not have any credit derivative positions in our books.
Is this yours?  Enron is the credit event!  I have faxed to you.

I do not think I have any positions left with Enron Credit as the counter-party, Please confirm that all cross positions with your books have been unwound.
Thanks, Sheila
