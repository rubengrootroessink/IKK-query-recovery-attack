Carlos Ruiz is asking for the value of the ENA/Garden State Paper (GSP) swap to be included as a creditor in the GSP bankruptcy.  GSP is a bankrupt affiliate and the purpose of the valuation is not to settle but merely to show the claim that ENA has against GSP.  Can I provide him a MTM on the position?  

The internal attorney involved is Cheryl Lindeman.

Thanks
