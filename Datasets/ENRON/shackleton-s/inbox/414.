Sara,  I further questioned Raju about whether the "North Sea, West Africa" changes the language they use - but she hasn't gotten back to me yet.   Until then, see her answer below.......

Hi Diane,

Sorry about the delay but I just got back from a meeting. Anyway, the language looks fine. Attached is an example of what we use on our confirms.

 
Regards,
Raju

Raju,  Any luck?  Our attorney, Sara Shackelton, was hoping you could confirm this language today.  

Let me know.
Thanks,
Diane

Raju,

You can ignore the second half of this (from the conversion on).  Can you confirm that this is the correct name and location in Platts.

Let me know.
Cheers,
Diane
