I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.
