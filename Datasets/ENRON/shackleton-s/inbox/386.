hi sara -- i tried to leave you a message but the voicemail is little screwed up.  so i will just send you an email.

on the whitewing share settlement agreement/put: when does the put get terminated per the ISDA?  when we have satisfied all the obligations under the put by delivering shares and/or cash, how can we make sure the put will go away?

thanks.
