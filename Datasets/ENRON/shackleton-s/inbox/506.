Depending on the Broker we can settle in USD or CAD. We currently settle in both for some brokers.

Anil, Frank or Todd,
Do we always post Margin in USD? The FIMAT Canada Account will have Canadian Dollar Activity in it. The account says that margin is held in the underlying currency.
Are you okay with this?

Please advise ASAP.
Thanks. Sheila
