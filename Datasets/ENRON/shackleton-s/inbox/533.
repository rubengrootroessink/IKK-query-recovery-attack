I don't think the account number is the issue.  I am more concerned that we have not responded to their letter, and they seem to think that they can just send us the money as though we have agreed to the amount.  Do we have a process yet for how we are going to divide up responses, track them, etc.?

Tanya: 
I think that this needs to go to the Citibank account? 

Lisa and Sara: 
Do you agree?
