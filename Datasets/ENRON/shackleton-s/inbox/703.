Re:		NYMEX, CME Partner to Offer E-mini Energy Futures

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Inc. (CME) today announced at a joint news conference in New York
that they have reached a cooperative agreement to offer newly created
"E-mini" versions of key NYMEX energy futures contracts for trading on CME's
GLOBEX
 electronic trading platform and clearing at the NYMEX Clearing
House.

	The first E-mini energy contracts will begin trading in the summer,
officials of the exchanges said.

	The agreement calls for the two exchanges to launch smaller,
electronically traded versions of NYMEX's crude oil, natural gas, heating
oil and gasoline futures contracts.  Precious metals contracts may be
introduced in subsequent phases.  Modeled after CME's popular line of E-mini
stock index contracts, which are one-fifth the size of the standard-sized
contracts, the new E-mini energy and precious metals futures would be a
to-be-determined fraction of the size of the standard-sized NYMEX contracts.


	Under the cross-access program, CME members will be granted access
to GLOBEX to trade the E-mini versions of the energy futures products and to
NYMEX ACCESS* to trade NYMEX Division products listed on that system,
subject to the guarantee of a NYMEX clearing firm.  CME members who are not
members of NYMEX will receive discounts for these trades.  Similarly, NYMEX
members will receive access to GLOBEX and discounts on fees for CME products
traded on GLOBEX with a CME member firm guarantee, and for the E-mini energy
products with the guarantee of a NYMEX clearing firm.

	The Exchange officials said that a cross-margining program will
provide capital efficiencies for market professionals and proprietary
accounts by combining the positions at joint or affiliated clearing members
in baskets of CME and NYMEX or COMEX Division commodities, the new E-mini
energy products, and GSCI* futures and options into a single portfolio.  The
risk-based performance bond (margining) systems of each clearing
organization will then determine a single performance bond requirement
across both markets.

	Vincent Viola, NYMEX Chairman, said, "This deal will bring our
successful energy products to a broad retail user base through the GLOBEX
distribution network, as well as expand the opportunities and cost
efficiencies for participants in both markets."

 	"This is an innovative new development in the futures industry that
builds on the long-standing relationship between our exchanges," said CME
Chairman Scott Gordon.  "With this cooperation agreement, we are blending
CME's successful E-mini concept, our GLOBEX infrastructure and global
distribution network with NYMEX's proven product line, established liquidity
and customer relationships in these markets."

	NYMEX President J. Robert Collins, Jr., said, "In 2002, we have seen
a 64% increase in natural gas futures over the same period last year, as
well as a 20% increase in overall energy futures trading.  By reducing the
size of the contract unit, we hope to emulate the CME's success in expanding
the trading community for our most liquid markets."

	"Tremendous synergy has been developed between the open outcry and
electronic trading in our stock index markets since CME first introduced the
E-mini S&P 500 futures contract in 1997 and the E-mini Nasdaq-100 contract
in 1999," said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty.  "By
expanding GLOBEX distribution to the NYMEX floor and leveraging our existing
distribution channels, we hope to build on our previous success, enhance
market liquidity and expand the customer base for energy and, potentially,
metals futures."

	Unlike their standard-sized counterparts, the new E-mini products
will be cash-settled to the respective NYMEX futures contract month final
settlement price on the last day of trading.  Two contract months will trade
at any given time.

	GLOBEX is an open access electronic trading platform that displays
the "book" to any qualified market participant with the ability to route
orders to the system.  The book represents the ability to view bids and
offers in the market.  Under the agreement, market participants interested
in trading the new products will be designated "qualified" if they are
guaranteed by a NYMEX clearing member firm.  In addition, NYMEX members and
customers trading the new products on GLOBEX will have access to CME's
electronically traded products, subject to the guarantee of a CME clearing
firm.

	In addition to the extensive distribution network and connectivity
alternatives of GLOBEX, the exchanges will work together to provide NYMEX
members and customers with access to GLOBEX, both on the NYMEX trading floor
and around the world.  Points of access will include GLOBEX TraderSM-Direct
terminals placed on the NYMEX trading floor adjacent to the pit, enhancing
liquidity and providing trading opportunities similar to CME's E-mini equity
index complex on its trading floor.

	NYMEX and CME jointly developed CLEARING 21*, the clearing platform
operated at both exchanges for high-volume, high-capacity clearing and
settlement of exchange-based transactions. The system processes reported
trades and tracks positions continuously in real time, providing users with
instantaneous information on trades, positions and risk exposure.
