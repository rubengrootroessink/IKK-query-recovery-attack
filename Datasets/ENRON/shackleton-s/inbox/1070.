Sheila,

Below is the SNL contract for the insurance module.  It looks good to me but can you take a look at it and then forward on to legal.

Thanks,

Selena

Selena-

I got your voicemail.  I'm glad you've decided to subscribe to the insurance
module.

I've attached the quote for services document for your signature.  I left
the terms the same as we agreed for the original subscription - No more than
10% increase for second year renewal and quarterly billing.  The Master
Subscription Agreement will be the same, too.  Cheryl Nelson in your legal
department already has a copy.

I did extend the trial until next Friday so that will be the invoice date
even if you return the signed copy before then.

Thanks and regards,

Ellen
