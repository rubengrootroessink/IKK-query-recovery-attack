At long last my ship has come in. Another evening with not one but the two most beautiful, sexy, intelligent,
elegant, open mined, ( shall I say more ) women in Houston. How I have patiently waited and emailed to no
avail for such a night. I have a select bottle of Cakebread that was to be consumed by you and me on your
birthday, back in July.  Can we consume it to celebrate both you and Sara's birthdays?

I am going out of town tomorrow but will be back in town late Wednesday. So lets get together this Thursday.
I can not wai. We can go to Le Vista again and bring our own wine or anywhere else you two want to go. But I
do want to consume this bottle of Cakebread, and I have some other bottles that I can throw in also.

Thanks so much for putting this together. I have missed seeing you both.

Carson
