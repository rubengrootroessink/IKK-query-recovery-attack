We have sent the first draft of an ISDA with EFET LLC to Deutsche Bank, which mirrored the terms of the Enron NA ISDA with English law amendments.

Are you happy for me to negotiate the ECTRIC ISDA on the same terms with English law amendments? I will run it past tax and credit again. We will be wanting gas as well as lc's in the CSA for both.

Credit think Steve will want a MAC clause which we want to avoid and they have asked me to stall him so I haven't called him back yet but I will tomorrow.

Thanks.
Anna

Subject:	Deutsche Bank AG ("DB") request for ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC

Steve Kessler (212-469-8202) with DB legal has called to request an ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC.  Who is the appropriate legal contact in London to initiate this process?

DB has an ISDA with ENA.  Steve told me that DB also has an ISDA with Enron Credit Limited.  Is a master netting arrangement appropriate here?

London:  Please let me know on Monday which lawyer will handle this ISDA request.

Jay:  Please let legal know if this arrangement requires a master netting agreement.

Thanks.   Sara
