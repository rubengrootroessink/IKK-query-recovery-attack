I have delivered  my request for withdrawal to the 16th Floor receptionist (which I believe is Zulie's desk) for delivery to Pam, but the instructions appear to say that Renee is to get the request form....if Renee is the required recipient, please make sure that it is delivered to her.   I would hope that under the circumstances the  Plan Committee would authorize these transfers without delay so that the requested wire transfers can be made today.

Sincerely
Barbara Gray
