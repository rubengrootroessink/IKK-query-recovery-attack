Good Afternoon Sara,

Per our discussion, attached is the ISDA Confirmation currently being used for the B of A head office FX trades.

We did have a trade executed today for value 9/27/01, wherein we need to send out a ISDA Confirmation. Please send me the revised version upon the completion of your review. 

Thanks!! Enjoy your afternoon! 

Jorge
