Sara,
This would be ENA.  I want to talk to Shane because it says "JP Morgan online FX system" but the agreement is with Chase.  With Chase, we would only be requesting Online trading functionality for an existing counterparty relationship.  
Sheila

Sheila:  Please send your usual message on this one.  I assume it is for ECT Investments Inc.
Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

We are setting up access to JP Morgan's online FX system. These are the documents they sent us to get signed before they will give us access. Are you the correct person to send them to?

Regards,
Shane
