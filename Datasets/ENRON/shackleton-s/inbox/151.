Mike,

May I get a status on the $159,022.86 wire request for Enron North America for account 102-06159-26, for our Hedge book?

Also, do you know if BS has liquidated all the positions held in the Enron Credit Inc accounts?    I believe that they were working on a sale of the 91,674 long shares of MLMG.

When can we get a release of the residual balances held in the Bear Stearns accounts for ECT Investments, Inc. and Enron Credit Inc.?

Would you please have someone fax me copies of all of our current statements at 713-646-2196?

Many thanks,
Sheila
