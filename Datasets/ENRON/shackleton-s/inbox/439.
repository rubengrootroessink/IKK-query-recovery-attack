The "reg out" is not applicable for these guys.  Its generally used on municipal cps.

Darren:
I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.
