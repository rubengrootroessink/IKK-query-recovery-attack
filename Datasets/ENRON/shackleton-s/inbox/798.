Sara:  I need access to your calendar and any other folders that you want me to have access to.  Follow the procedures below or call me and I will walk you through.  I may be away from my desk for a little while.  I have a good-sized copy job to complete.  Thanks.  It is going to be fun working together again! -Becky
