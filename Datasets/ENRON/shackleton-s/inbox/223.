Dear Sara,

It was wonderful to talk with you the other day.  I was looking for an
excellent image of the Fiam mirrors and the best that I could find were on
the Fiam website -- as it is in macromedia flash, I am unable to copy and
attach.  Hence, I am listing their web address -- once on their site, chose
english version and then products, there are many different mirrors
available and my personal favorite is Caadre in natural with light.  Prices
range from $5,478 to $6,174 w/integrated lamp.  This is for the free
standing floor version that measures:  76.75" x 41.3" w.

Let me know what you think.

All best wishes,

David
