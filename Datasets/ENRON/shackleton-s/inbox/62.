Hi Sheila,

Please find enclosed the instructions to wire funds from ECI's Bear Stearns accounts to Enron Credit Limited account at the Bank of Scotland. I am also faxing you the requests that have been signed by Bryan.  

Please discuss with Sara as I believe she has already communicated with Bear on this matter.   

Thanks for your help and please feel free to call me at 77834777 or alternatively contact Bryan at the same number.

Regards,

David
