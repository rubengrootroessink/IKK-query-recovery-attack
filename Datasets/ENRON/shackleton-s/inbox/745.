Sara,

This relates to the Enron Re receivable (Bob Bruce is handling for Enron Re). Any ideas where Brent's files on this might be? Thanks in advance. DEC

Dominic,

The files belonging to Brent Hendry should contain the information regarding the SMUD transaction.

I would appreciate access to these files to build a file for the weather desk as we don't have records for this transaction.

Also, could you also please cc Mark Tawney and myself on correspondence regarding the weather desk so that we remain informed and can assist where necessary.

Regards,
