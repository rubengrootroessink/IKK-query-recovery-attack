Sara,

I asked Simon for a schedule for all of the Credit trades which are in the name of ECT Investments Inc and North America.  If they have been terminated and what is the expected value at termination date.

Simon has sent the attached schedule.  I will review with him tomorrow and then we will follow-up with you.  

Thanks. Sheila
