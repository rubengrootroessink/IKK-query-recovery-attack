The Worthington Steel Company - they have an ISDA
I also show ENA financial exposure for the following companies for steel:
	Dennen Steel Corp
	Balli Trading Ltd
	Huntco Steel
	Metalwest LLC
	Triorient Trading Inc.
	Webco International LLC

Some may not be regular financial deals - but structured ones - such as Huntco, Balli, and Webco.  Sam Leuschen is the best contact to discuss the deals as she was involved in the booking of all of them.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya:

Is there a way to identify outstanding financial/physical positions with respect to these products?

I'd like to cross check to see which counterparties have sent termination notices.

I've already spoken to Bob who will compile his list for me to track.
