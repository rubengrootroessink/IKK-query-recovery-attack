Sara, 	
London does not have a copy of anything that was sent to GS.  Has Marie been able to locate?
Thanks.

Rich,
We believe that GS was sent some paperwork to move the Credit account from the ENA grouping to Enron Credit Inc., as a stand alone.  If you can locate please fax us a copy at 713-646-2196.

Thanks for your help.
Sheila
