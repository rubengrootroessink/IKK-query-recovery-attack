Sara, 
Mary Nell and I will give you a call.
Paul can ignore this as he is part of the administration.
Marcus von Bach is working on ECTRIC but is currently out of the office.

Ted/Paul:  Could you give me a call on Tuesday morning to discuss?  I think Mary Nell will try to call me as well.  I just want to determine how Houston can assist.  Thanks.  Sara
