Carol & Sara- 
The original Bank of America letter of credit number 3024519 should be returned to: 
                          Fortis Capital Corp. 
                          ATTN: Jonathan Fronda 
                          Three Stamford Plaza 
                          301 Tresser Blvd. 
                          Stamford, CT  06901-3239 
I am informed that a letter of cancellation signed by an authorized representative of Enron North America Corp. should also accompany the original letter of credit and all amendments.  A facsimile of this cancellation letter is acceptable if transmitted to 203-705-5898 (ATTN: Jonathan Fronda).  A copy of the overnight courier air waybill should be attached to the facsimile. 
I understand that Don Perkins has also started the process to confirm Fortis Capital Corp. letter of credit number 011290 through the parent company, Fortis Bank, as well as making the correction we discussed earlier (delivery of gas).   
Please call me if you have any questions. 
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
