I apologize for not returning the call. I discussed the issue further with =
Melissa M. and Kimberly H.
I think we currently have two separate issues:
First:
Melissa and Kimberly H. I think would prefer to have one paragraph of settl=
ement language to use on all power financial confirms (rather than the two =
current versions) so they could have a "one size fits all" description that=
 still addressed the two types of deals - 1) deals less than one month and =
2) deals one month and greater. Melissa - can you confirm if this is the id=
ea behind what we discussed?
Second:
The language being used currently actually requires I invoice separately th=
e two classes of deals (as specified above) - because the language we uses =
makes deals less than one month due on the fifth workday of the month and m=
akes Month + deals due on the seventh business day because indices are not =
known until second workday.  Invoicing these types of deals separately woul=
d be more time consuming that any benefit that would result.  I have yet an=
other challenge - I have a counterparty that demands their remittance perio=
d of five days starts over if the index is revised after original publicati=
on. Then I have Williams (who we exchange paper with - confirms are not sig=
ned) - who puts net 10 on all their deals. I really cannot come to a soluti=
on. I have only a handful of power counterparties - they end up doing both =
classes of deals - and the settlement date becomes a negoiation every month=
. This is the going to be the third month my department has been responsibl=
e for this area - so the whole situation is rather new. So at this time I t=
hink the probability of solving my problem is remote. So while I appreciate=
 your offer of assistance - I am not entirely sure what to do. Given the ot=
her priorities I have right now - addressing these is going to be in the fu=
ture for me.
=20
I have not had an external request to change the language. I think the main=
 request was from confirms and my issue(s) are secondary -  and for which I=
 have no good solution.
=20
I apologize for the long email - I am trying to do this from home to get ca=
ught up.
Thanks
Evelyn

Evelyn:=20

I left a voice mail for you in mid-November inquiring about your request fo=
r language in financial power confirms (same counterparty) for payment upon=
 termination of deals rather than aggregation of multiple deals with paymen=
t at the end of a calendar month.  Credit is inquiring as to whether this r=
equest is internal or external.

Can you please call and explain the issues?=20
