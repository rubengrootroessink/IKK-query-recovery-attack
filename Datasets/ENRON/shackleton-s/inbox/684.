Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.
