 to react to today's manufacturing data from the New York NAPM, but it will=
 be watched for signs of improvement, as it will provide insight into Wedne=

USD/JPY. However, the currency will continue to be mired by pessimism about=
 Japan's deflationary spiral, as well as the rise in Japanese unemployment =
