Sara,
I wanted to get something more formal to document deals in the name of Enron North America and ECT Investments.

I will let you know when I understand the amounts for ENA.

Simon,
I resorted your schedule to get the balances with the street.  

Does this make sense?  I am trying to get the third party balance for ENA and ECT Investments Inc.  ECT INvestments is the estimated loss of 890,589.  ENA looks like a positive $15.4 million?

Thanks Sheila
