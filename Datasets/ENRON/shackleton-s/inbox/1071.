Fimat accepted the Enron Corp guarantee so our trading line with then will be increased tomorrow (to approximately $15-16 million from $11 million.)  Fimat will have our trading line up to $20 million as soon as they complete their internal credit process. 

The Soc Gen money is priced as follows:

Original margin:  LIBOR
Variation margin: LIBOR + 5 bp 

Warren will call John directly when the line is increased.  

Thanks to everyone for all their help.
Sarah
