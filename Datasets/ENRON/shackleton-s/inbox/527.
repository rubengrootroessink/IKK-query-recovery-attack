I have attached the proposed amendment to the Agency Agreement for your review.  
 
Sara, subject to comments, I would appreciate it if you could also coordinate signatures.
 
Note that I will be out of the office until 13 August.  Please contact Janine if you have any questions/comments.
 
Kind regards,
Steve
