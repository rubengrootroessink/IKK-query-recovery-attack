I spoke w/ Brian Russo this morning.  He will submit payment for the invoice(s) amount on either today or tomorrow (3/13/02 or 3/14/02).  He agreed to submit separate payment for the default interest once we provide the rate.

Someone in settlements needs to contact him to determine Default Rate since BG&E wants to pay full amount (sounds like all deals have terminated)
