Greg,
	Derek Lynn suggested I get with you to discuss changing the authorized signatories on the Enron Canada Corp primebroker account at Morgan Stanley.  I am not sure who in the Canada office has the authority to determine who should be authorized to trade or transfer funds from this account.  Please give me a call in the morning to discuss.  I can be reached at 713-853-1439.


Thanks,
Theresa
