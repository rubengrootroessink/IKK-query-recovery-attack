Lisa and Liz;
I am very concerned about the way that credit is handling and coordinating =
with us on margin issues.  For over a week we have been waiting for them to=
 compile and send to us information on LC's that are due to expire at the e=
nd of December.  We finally received a very cryptic spreadsheet this aftern=
oon which requires alot of follow up in order for us to determine what our =
rights are.  I get the sense that credit assumes that since we are in bankr=
uptcy we will never have the right to draw on LC's that we are holding when=
 in fact we know that this is not necessarily true.  For example, this afte=
rnoon I found out that we are holding an $8 million LC for trades done with=
 Enserco under an ISDA.  The drawing condition is a failure to pay.  Under =
the ISDA, they were required to renew this LC within 20 Business days of th=
e expiry date which is 12/31.  If they don't renew I'm hoping that we can d=
eclare an Event of Default, terminate, request payment of a termination pay=
ment and if they don't pay draw.  I'm not sure that by following all of the=
 cure periods in the ISDA we can be in a position to draw on the 31st.  Tha=
t's just one example.  Do you have any thoughts on this?
