Subject:	Chase Master Agreement - "no more confirms"

Tanya:

EOL is asking for the Chase master to be amended to eliminate the need for confirms on EOL trades.  Do we need to meet to determine which Chase master (i.e., Chase or JP Morgan) should be amended (or both)?  Do we want to begin the upgrade process?   Please call.

Also, are you available for the 9:30 Hanover call?
