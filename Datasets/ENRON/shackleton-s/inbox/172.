if the margin was a letter of credit and the contract has been terminated and we agree that we owe them money and letter of credit only covers that contract so could not draw if they owed us other money somewhere else, i think we will need to return. my view as to cash is likely to be different and thinking about that. do you all agree re the letter of credit??
