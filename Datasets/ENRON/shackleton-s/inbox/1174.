Hi, Sara. I hope you had a wonderful holiday weekend.

During our discussion on 11/14, you asked that we provide you with a prime
brokerage fee schedule. I'm working with one of the trading assistants to
find one for you, but we're having some difficulty.

If I'm unable to supply you with a fee schedule, is there a specific way you
would like to word Paragraph 9 "Fees and Charges" (other than the phrase "as
agreed by the parties from time to time")? If you would like to keep your
previously proposed wording, I can run it by Legal one more time with an
explanation of the difficulty we're having.

Thanks so much for your patience,

Regan Grice
