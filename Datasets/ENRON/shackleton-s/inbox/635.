Veronica,
I assume that since you did not get back to us that there are no LC's expiring in January for non-terminated masters or trades where we are in the money.  If that is the case then we need to start looking at those LC's for February and March to avoid any time constraints in getting replacement LC's.  Please revert back to Sara with copies of the LC's that expire in February and March for the non-terminated masters and contracts that are in the money.

Regards, 
Brent

I am trying to determine if there are any of the LC's expiring in January that we can request renewal for.  Veronica were you able to narrow down the list to ones that are non-terminated where Enron is still exposed?  Please call to discuss.
Regards,
Brent
