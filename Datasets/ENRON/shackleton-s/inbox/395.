Sara,

We have a Master Agreement with NAB Limited.  However, we are doing our FX trades with NAB London.  Presumably, this is simply a branch of NAB Limited which is headquartered in Australia.  Is this a mulitbranch agreement?  Does it cover trades with the London branch?  Let me know what you think.  Thanks!
