Sara:

Please confirm that Sheila Glover and Gary Hickerson are authorized to sign
the wire transfers requests we are receiving on the ECI, ECTI and ECTEF
accounts.  I have just left you a voicemail with the same request.  It is
fairly urgent as we are trying to get the wires out today.

Thanks and regards.
