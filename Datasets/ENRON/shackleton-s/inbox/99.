What is traded under J. Aaron vs Goldman? If J. Aaron has liquidated, why is(are) there a position(s) under Goldman Sachs?

Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only:

Goldman Sachs & Co.

Laurel and Clara are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.

I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.

We can discuss further at 2:30.
