Sara,
I want to wire the Hedge book to the account below where we always wire to.  Is there a problem since ENA is in bankruptcy and eCT Investments is not.  The hedge book is in an ENA grouping at Goldman Sachs but is included in financial reporting with ECT Investments Inc.
			ECT Investments Inc.
			Citibank NY
			Acct # 4069-5791
			ABA 021-000-089

Enron Credit Inc. want to wire to Enron Credit Limited, Bank of Scotland
Do you see a problem?
Please advise.

Thanks. Sheila

Rich,
I would like Goldman Sachs to release the following funds based upon balances as of December 10, 2001.  We will wire out the Hedge and Credit balances.  I would like to transfer the Convert balances to the Convert book.

I will prepare wire requests and send to you.  

Thanks. Sheila
