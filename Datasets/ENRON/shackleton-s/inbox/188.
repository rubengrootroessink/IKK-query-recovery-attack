Pursuant to the below email and our discussions today, pls find attached the list forward by Todd Delahoussaye, Financial Deal Compliance, which includes all the deals entered into with Morgan Stanley Capital Group. The deal no is QH4715. 

I am also forwarding you the confirms which we have executed with CSFB and MS, last year, which I had earlier forwarded to Bob last week. 

The contact person at CSFB is James Moran. His email address is james.moran@csfb.com

We still have to hear from CSFB whether they can provide a tax rep on their Cayman Islands entity. As per my understanding, that is the only relevant credit issue for this transaction. 

Looking forward to hearing from you on the confirms necessary for the roll-over. Could you give me a call sometime later today, when you have finished going through them. 

Thanks & Regards

Rajaram Jamadagni

Rob/ Sara, 

As indicated in the other email of today, Todd has sent me a separate list which Morgan Stanley sent to Enron. I have gone through the list and this particular deal is indeed there. The confirms for this particular deal were sent by me sometime last week (both the CSFB and the MS confirms). Will call today to discuss further. 

Thanks

Rajaram

 Todd,

The Deal number for the below deal is QH4715.  Can you tell me if it is included in the list Morgan sent back to you?


Raj,
Morgan does not actually sign and return documents per the Master Agreement.  They send a reply type of message which states that they agree to a certain deal number or numbers.  Todd will let us know if this particular deal has been agreed to in this manner.
FYI, today is my last day in this group.  Going forward you can contact Diane Anderson for anything related to Confirmations.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Larry, 

You may have received a voicemail regarding the above. I am working with Treasa Kirby here in Global Finance and was wondering whether you have signed copies of the Morgan Stanley confirm for the above $150m oil prepay executed in Dec 2000/Jan 2001. We need to roll-over the oil prepay and need to discuss with the lawyers to understand whether any changes need to be made to the confirms. If you do have signed copies, kindly send both of us a copy of the same asap. 

Thanks & Regards
