Tim - we are comfortable with the changes to the definition of "material"
given that Lehman is not entering the market as a result of "rolling" the
transaction.  Should we amend the transaction in or enter in any future
transaction where we enter the market on behalf of ENE, we would require the
"standard" definition of "material.
