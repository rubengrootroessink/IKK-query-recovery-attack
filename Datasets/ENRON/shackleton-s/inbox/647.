I don't think so.  Do you need it?  I found out that it is not generated by Clara's group.  Plus, the margin position is aggregated with all other futures held in the account; therefore it may not be specific to IRFX.  We did verify the positions before we sold them, but I do not have an accurate number for margin positon.  Please let me know if we need to get in touch with the people who have this information.  Thanks!

Jurgen--

I received a call from Sara Shackleton (our in-house lawyer) yesterday.  She asked us to close out our remaining futures with Carr.   Can you please close out the EURIBOR and Short Sterling futures we have left with them?  I have enclosed a list below of the positions that we show the London desk as having.  Please confirm this amount, and close out the positions.  If there is a discrepency, please give me a call tomorrow and we can discuss further.  Hope you had a good vacation.

Sep 02		100
Dec 02		106

Short Sterling
