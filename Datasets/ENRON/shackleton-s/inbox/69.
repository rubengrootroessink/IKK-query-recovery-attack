Simon,

We may have problems with this because the Credit book is still under the ENA family of accounts.  ENA is bankrupt so they most likely will be unwilling to wire the funds somewhere else.

Do you have any documentation which suppots that the Credit book was being moved to Enron Credit as a stand-alone account at Goldman Sachs?  Does GS have anything?

Regards,

Sheila

Rich,
I would like Goldman Sachs to release the following funds based upon balances as of December 10, 2001.  We will wire out the Hedge and Credit balances.  I would like to transfer the Convert balances to the Convert book.

I will prepare wire requests and send to you.  

Thanks. Sheila
