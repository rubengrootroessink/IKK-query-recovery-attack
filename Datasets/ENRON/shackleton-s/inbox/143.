Sara,
As per our conversation, I will wait to hear back from you.  

As part of the ongoing process, I will discuss with you any wire requests where we do not have an exact match between the MSDW account name and the account where the funds are being wired to.

In October we sent $8.2MM from the EBS Ventures MSDW account to this Cherokee bank account because the EBS investments in this MSDW account are in the Apache tax structure and therefore have to go through this bank account.  Since the $12K pertains to the same investment as the $8.2MM, I knew that we would have to send it to the same account.  Danny Wilson and Marian Brisco are familiar with the Apache structure and can better answer any questions relating to the Cherokee account.

Paul and Kristi,
My concern is that the EBS Ventures does not match the name on the account.

Kristi you may check with Danny Wilson in Tax he usually make a quarterly payments to Cherokee. Those payment were intially not made this month.  There may be some changes but maybe we should check with Danny because he is familiar with the transaction.

Sheila-

Please send the $12,272.30 to the Cherokee bank account.  I believe this amount pertains to interest income from the Hewlett Packard short.

Thanks,
