Our 3/4/02 demand letter only included a Feb02 invoice.  NPC responded that they had already made payment and our investigation proved the same.  Going through the ARRedList I see that we have NPC delinquent on a Jan02 invoice in the amount of $1,694,770.00.  Before I call NPC please make a search of our systems to verify that they have not paid.  

Thanks
