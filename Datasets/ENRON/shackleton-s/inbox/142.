In October we sent $8.2MM from the EBS Ventures MSDW account to this Cherokee bank account because the EBS investments in this MSDW account are in the Apache tax structure and therefore have to go through this bank account.  Since the $12K pertains to the same investment as the $8.2MM, I knew that we would have to send it to the same account.  Danny Wilson and Marian Brisco are familiar with the Apache structure and can better answer any questions relating to the Cherokee account.

Paul and Kristi,
My concern is that the EBS Ventures does not match the name on the account.

Sheila-

Please send the $12,272.30 to the Cherokee bank account.  I believe this amount pertains to interest income from the Hewlett Packard short.

Thanks,
Kristi Voinis
