To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa
