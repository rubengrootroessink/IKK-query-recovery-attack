CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Based upon yesterday's meeting, we discussed where R& C is in the money and we are the only Enron counter party involved, Pushkar and Stuart could contact these entiies to reach closure to get $ in the door after the appropriate approvals regarding the settlements.

The attached confidential listing shows exposure at 12/12/01.  Any liquidated amounts not settled will need to be taken into account.  

Based on yesterday's discussion, I have sorted the counterparties regarding course of actiion.

If you do NOT agree, please advise ASAP.
Sheila
