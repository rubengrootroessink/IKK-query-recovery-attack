Dear Ms. Sara Shackleton,

'99 DRCs; Other top Burgundies

We have our (extremely tiny) allocation of 1999 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti.
Prices are high (but a good bit less than some we've seen).  I've indicated
the number of bottles available.  These are due in a couple of months.

Plus some other outstanding 1999 Red Burgundies which have just arrived.
All are net priced.  Some (i.e. Mugneret and Pousse d'Or) are even
reasonable.

1. '99 DRC Vosne "Duvault-Blochet" (12) $149.99 net
2. '99 DRC Echezeaux (6) $179.99 net
3. '99 DRC Grands Echezeaux (6) $249.99 net
4. '99 DRC Romanee-St.-Vivant (6) $299.99 net
5. '99 DRC Richebourg (6) $399.99 net
6. '99 DRC La Tache (6) $499.99 net
7. '99 DRC Romanee-Conti (3) $2299.99 net

The DRC's director, Aubert de Villaine, considers these among the best wines
he has ever made.  In fact, as Burghound explains, he doesn't think it is
possible to have better grapes than he had in 1999.  These are historic
wines, and the demand for them unprecedented.

8. '99 de Vogue Chambolle-Musigny $59.99 net

Just one case left.  As you probably know, much of this is from very fancy
de-classified fruit.

9. '99 Mugneret Vosne-Romanee $39.99 net
10. '99 Mugneret Nuits "Chaignots" $49.99 net

Nobody makes purer, classier or more classic red Burgundies than Mugneret,
and these '99s are just beautiful.  The Nuits "Chaignots" is always a
favorite, and this is probably the most delicious I can remember.  And as
Tanzer says, the Vosne-Romanee is "rich and fine, with lovely fruit and
plaint texture.  This has superb fruit for a village wine."  These are red
Burgundies for purists, and are still quite affordable given the esteem of
this estate.  (At least they're affordable here; Tanzer prices them at $55
and $80.)

11. '99 Pousse d'Or Santenay "Clos Tavannes" $27.99 net
12. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "Clos de l'Audignac" $39.99 net
13. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "60 Ouvrees" $44.99 net
14. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "Bousse d'Or" $49.99 net

1999 is the comeback vintage for this historic estate.  And the prices are
still remarkably reasonable for what's in the bottle.  Burghound (the only
American critic to review them so far, and a quite conservative one) rates
the Santenay "Clos Tavannes" 90 points.  It's absolutely delicious.  The
Volnay "Clos de l'Audignac" is 89-92: "positively effusive with its
exquisite nose of sexy, seductive black fruit and perfumed aromatics
followed by sexy, beautifully detailed and rich flavors of juicy, succulent
crushed berries and cassis.  Yet for all the fireworks, it somehow manages
to remain completely Volnay in character.  Lovely stuff."  If this sounds
good, it is.

And believe it or not, the top two Pousse d'Or monopolies, the famous "Clos
des Soixante-Ouvrees" and "Clos de la Bousse d'Or" are even better!  Once
again, these superb wines are among Volnay's elite.
