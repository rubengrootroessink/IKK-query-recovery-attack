Brent -

I have attached both the Williams and Bank of America amendment forms for you to take a look at when you have a chance.  It is interesting to note that the Williams schedule skips Part 5 and contains the general provisions in Part 4.   Also, with the BofA document, there were some terms in Part 5(h) that looked to have been negotiated terms.  These have basically been incorporated into the Amendment so that the integrity of the agreement remains intact.

Please take a look at the attached is necessary.  I have both files in my office if you should need them.

Thanks.

Mark
