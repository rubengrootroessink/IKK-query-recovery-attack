fit of the parties and their successors.  In the event that Morgan Stanley =
(i) merges with another entity, or (ii) ceases to be a FCM or (iii) is requ=
ired by Applicable Law to transfer its Customer accounts to another FCM, Mo=
rgan Stanley shall have the right to transfer or assign this Agreement (and=
 thereby the Account) to any successor entity or to another properly regist=
ered futures commission merchant in its sole and absolute discretion and wi=
thout obtaining the consent of Customer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in=
 the event of items (ii) or (iii) immediately above, if permitted by Applic=
able Law and in the event that Morgan Stanley's position would not be jeopa=
rdized thereby, Morgan Stanley will make reasonable efforts under the circu=
mstances to consult Customer for its preference of FCM before assigning thi=
s Agreement.  Customer may assign this agreement provided Customer obtains =
Morgan Stanley's consent by using Morgan Stanley's version of Assignment an=
d Assumption agreement (a copy of which will be provided to Customer) signe=
d by the Customer, the party to which the Agreement is to be assigned, and =
Morgan Stanley.
