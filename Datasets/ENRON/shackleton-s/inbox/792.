Hi Sara
How are you? hope you are doing well. I just got off the phone with my dad so i was thinking about you and wanted to say hi. I am comign home next weekend (March 22) and will be happyy to see you that saturday. I am only in town for like 40 hours so it is a short visit but i am looking forward to it. 
So I am sure my dad told you but i am taking another job. Starting Monday, I am the new Merchandising asst for Old Navy women's division and i am really excited about this. So Friday is my last day at Entertainment Weekly so this is a huge change.
I also have some other news but this is just btw you and me for now. I am working on ways to tell my dad so I wanted to see what you would suggest and advise. Park has asked me to move in with him and so I have decided that I want to do that. He and I are not ready to get engaged at all and not ready to get married but we are so in love and pratically live together now so this just makes sense. But i do not want to make my dad upset and am not sure how he would feel about this..... and so I was hoping you could give my any advice or suggest a way to tell this to him.... I hope that this does not put you in an awkward position and if so, then pelase tel me and I will not ask you anyhtign about it again. 
 
Thanks Sara. I hope you have a nice Monday and I am excited to see you in two weeks. Talk to you soon
Scottie
