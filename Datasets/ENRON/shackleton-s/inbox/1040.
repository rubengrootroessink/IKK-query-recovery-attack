Russ -
I spoke with Dave Bizer a few minutes ago, and he said that you guys were still going to send the shares to us today even though nothing will happen with the fee and the note until Friday.  I understand from Tim that he and Skip agreed that you guys would keep the shares, and we'd deal with everything on Friday.  So, why don't you guys just hold on to the shares, and we will settle the entire trade all at once on Friday.  I think that would be the easiest and cleanest way to deal with this.  Talk to you soon.
