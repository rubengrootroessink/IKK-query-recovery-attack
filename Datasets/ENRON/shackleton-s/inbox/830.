Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, March 21, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $4,000)	=	$4,000
One Short Tier 2 NG or NN (1 * $3,500)	=	- $3,500
Net Scan Risk ($4,000-$3,500)		=	$   500
Spread Rate	(1* $500)			+	$   500
Total Requirement				=	$1,000
Scan Risk Example Summary
Margin on a Spread Between a Tier 1 and Tier 2 Futures Contract
