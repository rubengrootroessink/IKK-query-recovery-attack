> I left you a voice mail this afternoon with regards to establishing an

> options. At the request of Shane Dallman and Aaron Armstrong in
> London, I have quoted rates for all relevant exchange traded products.
> They have expressed an interest in using Deutsche Bank for their
> futures trading so that we are arranging to have documentation drafted
> and sent to Houston as soon as possible.
>
> I have asked one of my colleagues, Rob Manders, to contact you to
> establish the names of the legal entities that should be on the
> contracts, and the name and address of the person/people to whom all
> documentation should be sent. Rob will be coordinating all the
> documentation and will assure that your operations department is happy
> with the service that Deutsche Bank will offer. To that end, he has
> organised a video conference with Kimberley Hopley in London and Jason
> Fisher in Houston for the week of 8th October.
>
> I hope that these arrangements meet with your approval. Should you
> have any questions, please feel free to call me on 44 207 547 3486.
> Equally, you can reach Rob Manders on 44 207 545 2005.
