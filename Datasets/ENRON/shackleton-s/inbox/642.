Jaime:

As I told you before, Sara Shackleton is the lawyer of the Estate in charge of all financial trading matters.  I prepared a memo to her that included the MTM you gave me and also the status of the contract with each counterparty.  One question Sara had was about the date of the MTM valuation you sent me.  I know it is a bit old but cannot recall the exact date.  Could you please let Sara know the date and who exactly prepared the valuation (I am talking about the MTM you sent me).

Also, please let Sara know all your contact info.

Sara, Steve Irvin is also helping on Mexican matters.  Steve, is located in Houston and he works with Don Miller
