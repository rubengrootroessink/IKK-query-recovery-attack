Thanks for the explanation.  We'll mark Belco Oil and Gas as terminated and inform the risk group so they can move the positions into the correct risk book.

Stephanie: May I suggest that you add a row to the Master Letter Log for the subject CP name and simply note "see Westport Resources Corporation."

Maria: Please update our data and inform risk group.

Thanks to all.

Louis,
Last fall Westport and Belco merged, with Westport being the surviving entity.  We had Master Agreements in place with both entities and had not yet reached agreement with Westport as to which Master would remain in place.  Therefore, we received one letter from Westport terminating both Masters.

In the Master Letter Log (version 3/20/02) Belco is included with the early termination made by Westport Resources Corporation.  We currently have Belco as a live (non-terminated) CP but this may be incorrect.  Please review the Master Letter Log AND the termination provided by Westport Resources to determine whether Belco is included in that early termination.  

Thanks
