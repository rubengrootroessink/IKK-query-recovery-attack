Mark:
 
You should get with Sara on this. I assume he will be using the contract review form that has been developed internally.

Mark Quaglia, an associate in the capital markets group from New York, will be flying here either tonight or first thing in the morning to review confirmations.  He is planning to stay overnight on Thursday.
 
Will there be a checklist for him to use in gathering information from the documents, or should we meet to develop something?
