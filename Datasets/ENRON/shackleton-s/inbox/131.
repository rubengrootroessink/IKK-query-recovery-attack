Sara

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks
Simon
