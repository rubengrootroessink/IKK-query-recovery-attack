Susan,

Did Greg say that the cash is still in ERMT or was it "swept" back up into ENA or Enron Corp.?

I just confirmed with Greg Whiting in Accounting that RMT made $ 250 MM contribution to ERMT.  (RMT obtained such funds through a capital contribution from ENA, which in turn received a $250 MM contribution from Enron Corp.)

Best regards,
Susan

Stuart,

Would you please send me your fax number so I can fax you the November 30th Trial Balance for RMT?

Thanks,
Susan
