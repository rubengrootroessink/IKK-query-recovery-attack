Bryan,

Deuthsche Bank served a credit notice to ECT Investments Inc. for the "triplets" trade.  This trade is not ECT Investments Inc.'s.  All the Credit business was transferred to Enron North America on November 2000 and the Credit book was transferred to Enron Credit Inc. in February 2001.  This trade should not be in ECT Investments Inc.'s name and should have been transferred by Enron Credit.

I would expect Enron Credit Inc. to settle the financial liablility of this trade and not leave it as an obligation to ECT Investments, Inc.

My understanding is that the obligation is around $800,000.

Please advise.

Regards,
Sheila
