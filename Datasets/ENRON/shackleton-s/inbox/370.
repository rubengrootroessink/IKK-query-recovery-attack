John, FYI
Nora, If you could review the other provisions to make sure that they picked up our changes.
Sara, Could you please give a general review?  If you are not the correct party (Jeff Nogid gave me your name), could you give me guidance as to who could assist?


Thanks to everyone.

Maggie -

Attached is another revision of the swap confirm.  Ken wanted to make some
clarifying changes to the copy we sent to you last week.  Sorry for the
confusion and please feel free to give me a call to discuss.  If this is
acceptable let me know and I will send a clean copy.  Thanks.

Steve
