"THE ENRON DEBACLE: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM", a new course by Texas Bar CLE, will be presented March 1, 2002, at the Radisson Astrodome Hotel in Houston.

Course directors Richard Orsinger and Craig Ball are presently recruiting a top-flight faculty for this timely and important program, which promises to examine discovery issues; employees as plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses, and whistleblowers; class actions; shareholder remedies; insurance; the collision of criminal and civil matters; juror focus groups; managing the media; and jury selection in a high profile case. Obviously, many important facts about Enron are yet to be determined, so the program topics will be presented in the hypothetical voice.

Register for  $195 and receive extensive written materials.
MCLE Credit: 6.25 hours (.5 hr. ethics credit)
