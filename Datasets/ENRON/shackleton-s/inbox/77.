Carol/Alan:

Attached is a spreadsheet which contains details of the AirCanada deals we would like to unwind and receive payment.

We are unwinding a Dec01-Mar02 WTI calendar month average swap that we sold to AirCanada.
Rob Fuller's bid to unwind this deal is $18.97 and it is discounted at Libor-flat.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Sheetal
