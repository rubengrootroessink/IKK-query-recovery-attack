Sheila - As far as proving the money belongs to Credit, have we had anything back from
Goldmans on docs opening a new ECI bank account? From Credit Trading's perspective,
I think we can demonstrate that ENA had no economic interest in this account:

- Credit traders directed all of the trading activity in this account
- all trading positions and P&L were reported in Credit's DPR and in Enron Credit Inc
- all margin requirements were funded from Credit's Citibank account in London

  
Thanks
Simon

Sheila - Attached are revised faxes to send to Bears and MSDW - could you co-ordinate signatures in the US again,
or would you like Bryan and Markus to sign? I have changed the MSDW and Bears payments to pay into Enron Credit
Limited's account at Citibank.

We have $10,924,975.00 in the main ECI account, and $630,258.41 in the ECTEF Inc account, and have asked for
$10.9m and $0.6m to be paid to Citibank. We also have some more funds coming into the account from the sale of
Loral bonds & MLM shares on Tuesday or Wednesday. We can move these amounts when the trades have settled.

Can you ask Bears to let us know as early as possible on Monday whether they will be able to pay the money over?

Thanks
Simon

Subject:	Bear Stears Wire requests of 12/14/01

Mary, Bryan and Simon,

Bear was able to get out the $3.9 million to ECT Investments out to us via fed wire.

The two wires for Enron Credit Inc. and ECT Europe Finance Inc. were via Swift which has an earlier cut-off.   Additionally, Mike Nierva said that the wire requests were not in good form.  He said his wire department usually sees a US bank with a FOR FURTHER CREDIT to the foreign bank. 

I would appreciate some help in getting this revised to send to Bear Stearns early on Monday.  

Mike Nierva is consolidating the balances in the main account,  102-25786-2-7.  Additionally, he completed the FX trades today.

I also need this for MSDW for the $131,000 wire request.  MSDW has a policy not to send money to foreign banks.

Thanks. Sheila

Rich,
I would like Goldman Sachs to release the following funds based upon balances as of December 10, 2001.  We will wire out the Hedge and Credit balances.  I would like to transfer the Convert balances to the Convert book.

I will prepare wire requests and send to you.  

Thanks. Sheila
