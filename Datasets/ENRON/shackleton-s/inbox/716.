I appreciate all the helpful tips I've received from networking with my
good friends regarding my present job search.  I thought I'd pass along
this example regarding the importance of an attentive interview response.

The Job Interview

Steve, who was born without ears, needed to hire a new manager. The next
day
he had set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew everything
he needed and was very interesting. But at the end of the interview, Steve
asked him, "Do you notice anything different about me?" And the gentleman
answered, "Why yes, I couldn't help but notice that you have no ears."
Steve
did not appreciate his candor and threw him out. The second interview was
with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. But he asked her
the same question, "Do you notice anything different about me?" She
replied:
"Well, you have no ears." Steve again got upset and tossed her out. The
third and last interview was the best one of all three. It was with a very
young man who was fresh out of college. He was smart, he was handsome, and
he seemed to be a better businessman than the first two put together. Steve
was anxious, but went ahead and asked the young man the same question: "Do
you notice anything different about me?" And to his suprise, the young man
answered: Yes, you wear contact lenses. Steve was shocked, and said, "What
an incredibly observant young man. How in the world did you know that? The
young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, "Well its
pretty hard to wear glasses with no f---ing ears!!!"
