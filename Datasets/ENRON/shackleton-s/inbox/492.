Attached is the account opening documentation in order to open an account
at Fimat Derivatives Canada Inc.

(See attached file: KITANGLAIS.DOC)

Please have this documentation completed and signed by authorized people at
Enron.

In order to open the account today, you could fax to my attention only the
signed pages and thereafter send the whole package by courrier to my
attention.

For any questions on these papers, you or your legal department can contact
me directly via e-mail or phone.
