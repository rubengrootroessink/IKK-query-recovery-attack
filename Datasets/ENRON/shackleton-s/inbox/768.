We are attempting to complete the missing information on our spreadsheet.  To that end, below are live CPs that have been reviewed for the purpose of sending demand letters.  However, because they are live we cannot determine what type of contract they have.  (Our source for this information has been the Master Terminated Log.  These CPs are obviously not included therein.)
