Good morning, Sara.

My legal contact just got back to me with her comments on your proposed
changes to the standard Agreement for Prime Brokerage Clearance Services.
Here are her comments regarding those changes she finds unacceptable:

"1)  Section 9 -  I think many of the fees charged are prevailing market
fees and not necessarily agreed to by the parties.  I'd prefer to keep this
language as is.

2) Section 11 - the representations in this agreement are fairly basic and
I would therefore consider any breach of a rep as material.  Therefore, I'd
prefer not to make the suggested change to clause (ii).  Also, please do
not delete the language 'together with interest earned thereon from the
date of such Event of Default' at the end of this section.

3) Section 14, paragraph (a) - you can add the word 'reasonable' but please
do not add the word 'materially' to this paragraph."

Please let me know what you think. I'll work with you in every way I can to
reach a consensus on the terms of the agreement.

Thank you,

Regan Grice
