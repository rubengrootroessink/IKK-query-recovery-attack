All:  We sent this ISDA for execution and now the lawyer has come back with MORE CHANGES.
The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.  
Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?
Please respond.  Thanks for your help.
