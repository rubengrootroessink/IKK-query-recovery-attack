The meeting is at 1:00 p.m. today.  Aaron, if you come to my office we will walk over to Sara's office and have the meeting there.

I have spoken to Francisco and got a good data dump from him - - there is no need for him to join us this afternoon.  I have the trader's name - - we should call him during our meeting.

In order to move forward we need three things:

		1. 	The PwC valuation of the financial contracts;
		2.	A better understanding of the physical contracts and what happened;
		3.	A good data dump from the trader.

Once we have this information we should approach SDGE.  Let's aim at having "first contact" tomorrow morning.
