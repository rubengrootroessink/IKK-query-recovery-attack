I think Bonneville is a terminated physical deal.  Regardless, I need an address for them to use to notify Enron Estate of their request.  Do you want to use the same address for both physical and financial contracts?

Thanks

The company we discussed is Bonneville Fuels.  I'll provide them with the notification address once you give it to me.

Thanks
