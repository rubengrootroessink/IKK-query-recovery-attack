Attached hereto are first drafts of the form of swap documents we propose to use in connection with the prepay transaction with Chase and Mahonia.  Since we do not have a Master ISDA in place with Mahonia, I have drafted the ENA/Mahonia confirmation in the form of a "deemed ISDA".  

You will note that the business terms of the swaps as well as the calculation of collateral posting amounts have been left blank.  These will be filled in as soon as the parties have agreed to them.  

Please be advised that none of the members of the business team at Enron have had a chance to review the form of documents attached hereto.  Therefore the documents remain subject to further change based on their input.  

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Gentlemen,

As my voicemail to Rob this evening indicated, we will be sending the documents for your review on Sunday afternoon.  They will not have the transaction specifics (pricing etc) as our model is being finalized now that we received your approval.   I also want to speak with Jeff on Monday about it.  However, there is enough boilerplate to review and comment on as necessary in the interim.

The plan is to have documents at least 90% finalized by end of day on Tuesday; have a dry run on Wed so we have time to adjust calculations, etc.; close and fund on Thursday.

We look forward to successfully executing another transaction with Chase.

If you need to reach me this weekend you may leave me a message at work - 713 853 1703; or at home - 713 426 5705.

Regards, Lisa

PS.  It would be very helpful to receive the requested Mahonia information and signoff on Monday or at least let us know that it is all ok and will be delivered on time.
