Sara,

Point #1: I have not yet reviewed your comments but I will soon.

Point #2: We accept to put New York in the give-up. Please make the change
directly in the file and forward the three signed copies to my attention.

Thanks.

Jean Pierre:

(1)  Have you been able to review comments to the FIMAT Canada Futures
Agreement?

(2)  Enron North America Corp. would like to change Paragraph 10
(governing law) of the Give-Up Agreement to New York.

Please contact me about both agreements and logistics.

Regards.  Sara
