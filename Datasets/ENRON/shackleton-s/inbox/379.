Forwarded, as discussed.  I put a new call into Cinergy attorney Jeff Gollomp on this Friday Oct 5th.  Marcus Nettelton is assisting Woody on the specific ICAP term deal.  I understand that swaps attorney Sara Shackleton is currently trying to complete an ISDA with Cinergy as well, and is delving into agency issues wth them.
