I am one of the attorneys with AIG Energy Trading Inc., which currently has
various financial gas transactions with Enron North America Corp. and
physical power transactions with Enron Power Marketing, Inc., subject to
Enron's general terms and conditions.  We have been approached by a
third-party  which would like to discuss with us the possibility of having
us assign some or all of our positions to them.  We would be interested in
pursuing these discussions with the third party, subject to Enron's consent
to waive the confidentiality restriction in the general terms and
conditions with respect to these discussions.  For your information, the
third party has a credit rating of AA-/Aa3.  We recognize, of course, that
any assignment would be subject to Enron's consent.

Please call Brent Gundlah in our credit department at (203) 861-3368, or
me, at (203) 861-3349 to discuss this.

Regards,
Barbara Morgen
