As we discussed in our meeting last week, I will be initiating a project to
capture all of our confirmations in an "inventory format" as you mentioned. 
Our
log captures the major elements of each deal to keep our group organized with
regard to deadlines, etc.

When you have a minute, please elaborate on some of the specifics which
you would like to see. I have an idea, but wanted to receive your input as 
well.

Thanks David
