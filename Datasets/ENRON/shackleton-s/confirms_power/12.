Joe:

I think this list below which Dow Jones sent to me is what MEGA wants to see 
(using Telerate) instead of our
PowerTrax language for the MC deal.

Dale,

I requested the following updated list from Dow Jones on the pages within 
"Telerate"
to update our power pub code file.

Also, as the first email from Gunter describes below, he is adding my name to 
the
"daily broadcast list" from Dow Jones, with daily pricing information.
