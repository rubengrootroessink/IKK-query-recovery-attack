Hi Sara, I believe I made all of the changes.  Holli said there is not an 
exercise date for this deal.  Let me know if this looks OK.

Thanks!

for "Cash Settlement Amount":

the Strike Price, an amount equal to the product of (i) the Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Strike Price 
over the Floating Price, which amount shall be due and payable by the Seller 
on the applicable Payment Date for such Determination Period.

P.S.  Melissa:  In the future, send me the deal ticket for review.
