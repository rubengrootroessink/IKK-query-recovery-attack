If I understand you, we need to contemplate a quoted negative price; so, I 
would suggest that we incorporate the langauge into the Floating Price 
definition, something to the effect of:

"the average of the prices (whether positive of negative) for each Off-Peak 
Hour ......"

Dale:

Greg Woulfe and John Zufferli, East Desk Power traders, requested that the 
following language be deleted on
their confirms.

"In the event that a price for any Off-Peak Hour determined as set forth 
above is equal
 to or less than zero, then the price for such Off-Peak Hour shall equal 
Zero".

Sara Shackleton, however,and I think that this statement should be modified 
to reflect the trader's comments:

to maintain a negative price if indeed it should occur.

Joe Hunter and I met with them yesterday morning, and they are still 
interested in removing this sentence.

Please let me know your thoughts on the origin and "philosophy" of why this 
statement was originally incorporated
into our language. Sara said that this may have been introduced as part of 
the West Desk confirms on previous deals.

Thanks!
