Rolo and I just had a meeting with Amy at Duke, regarding the=20
misunderstanding of the Floating Price assumed in the swap.
There is a difference between their definition of Index and ours. Duke was=
=20
assuming the "monthly average of the monomic spot price published by Cammes=
a"
to be the one which includes:
Weighted average of hourly energy prices
"Energia Adicional"
Capacity (including: Base, Confiabilidad, Reserva de Potencia and
Servicios Asociados)
This is published by Cammesa as one monthly price.

I was assuming the "monthly average of the daily monomic prices", which
includes:
Simple average of hourly energy prices
Capacity (including: Base and Confiabilidad)

The difference between Duke's Index and ours is that Duke's usually trades =
at=20
approx. $2.50-$3.00 above ours. Clearly there was a confusion here.

So, there is no deal at this point. But Duke is evaluating taking a positio=
n=20
by which they claim that the exchanged e-mails are clear enough to enforce=
=20
the swap, and therefore they might not be willing to let it go so easy. The=
y=20
are awaiting to check with Erik and legal and will get back to us shortly. =
I=20
believe there is room for misunderstanding in the e-mail were Amy defines t=
he=20
Index, in which she agrees with our definition of Floating Price, and adds=
=20
the other wording.

Below is the sequence of e-mails exchanged with Amy during the proposal=20
period. The title of the proposal I sent says "Financial Swap Indication" a=
nd=20
For discussion purposes only.

Any thoughts?

Amy,

It appears there has been a misunderstanding in what each one of us referre=

to
as "Average Monomic Price". I suggest we get together and discuss this issu=
e.
Are you in BA? You can come to our offices or we




=01%ll step over.

Julian,
Please refer to attached emails where we agree that the floating price will
be
the "monthly average of the monomic spot price published by CAMMESA."  The=
=20
monomic price published by CAMMESA is found in the MEMNET under the icon
Informe
Mensual titled Precios Medios Monomicos Mensuales or in the Boletin Mensual
del
MEM.
Please adjust your confirmation language to reflect this.
Thanks,
Amy

Julian,
Yes, I agree with those terms.  I would like to add that it will be the
monthly
average of the monomic spot price published by CAMMESA.  Also, the
transaction
will be settled monthly.

Amy,

While waiting for the Master Swap Agreement to be signed, I want to confirm
the
general terms for the swap.
Attached is a file describing the deal.

Let's make sure our US lawyers are moving forward with the MSA.

(See attached file: Duke.ppt)
Regards,

Julian
