As a result of our recent reorganization, we are continuing to refine our=
=20
corporate structure to best support our business.  The corporate Human=20
Resources function is very important to our company=01,s success.  To refle=
ct=20
our commitment to a strong Human Resources function, we are naming Cindy=20
Olson as executive vice president of Human Resources and Community=20
Relations.  Cindy will report to the Office of the Chairman, and she will=
=20
join Enron=01,s Executive Committee.

Cindy will coordinate with Rick Causey on key issues, primarily=20
compensation.  With the expansion of our global businesses and the=20
acceleration of our financial activities, Rick will focus on the leadership=
=20
of Enron=01,s accounting and financial reporting activities, as well as=20
overseeing risk management systems, Y2K preparations and our SAP=20
implementation.

Given our rapidly growing communications business and the enormous potentia=
l=20
to further develop that business, Enron Communications will require its own=
=20
HR resources.  To support that need, Rocky Jones will move to Enron=20
Communications as senior vice president of Human Resources to focus on the=
=20
staffing and HR needs of our communications business.  Rocky will report to=
=20
Ken Rice and Joe Hirko, co-CEOs of Enron Communications.

Cindy=01,s current responsibilities of diversity and community relations wi=
ll be=20
combined in the new HR organization.

We are confident that these organizational changes will strengthen our=20
corporate support of our business functions.  Please join us in=20
congratulating Cindy, Rick and Rocky on their new responsibilities.
