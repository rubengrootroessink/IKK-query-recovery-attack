Would like to discuss the budgeting strategy for Gas Logistics; one company allocating out to the pipelines, collapsed cost centers, i.e. one Gas Logistics cost center per company, what triggers a plan restatement versus a variance explanation, 2002 target - at a functional level or company level or both, budgeting true O&M costs and not count on capital projects to offset costs, other related topics.
