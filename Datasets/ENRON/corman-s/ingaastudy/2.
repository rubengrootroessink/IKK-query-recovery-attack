Subject: INGAA Capacity data request for NNG.

Here is the NNG data for Shelley's INGAA request, due 12/21.
I agree with Linda's contract & release information.  The Capacity Available 
& Unsubscribed Capacity from Bob Johnson in Facility Planning comes from the 
GISB & 637 required capacity information on the Internet. The totals are 
consistent with the contract holders' capacity reported.
