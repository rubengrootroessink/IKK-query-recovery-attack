CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEDGED 
ATTORNEY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT 

Yesterday, we had a conference call with the pipeline transportation analysts 
to determine whether John Morris, the economist who will conduct a market 
power study for INGAA, had crafted a data request that would gather the right 
sort of information nececessary.? Columbia, Enron, and Koch did not have 
representatives on the call.? I'm available this afternoon to give you all an 
update on what was discussed?? We decided to take a snap shot in time on firm 
pipeline transactions that occurred during the month of November 2000.? John 
Morris will be sending out a revised data request (through me) that reflects 
some of the suggestions proposed by the group.? He is very open to tallking 
to your transportation folks directly to answer any questions you may have.? 
You have his telephone number from an earlier email.???
