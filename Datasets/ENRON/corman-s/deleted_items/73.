>> > >> All in all ... a pleasant bunch.

>> > >>

>> > >> When the menus were presented,

>> > >> We ordered salads, sandwiches, and soups.

>> > >> Except for Mae who circumvented,

>> > >> And said, Ice Cream, please: two scoops.

>> > >>

>> > >> I was not sure my ears heard right,

>> > >> And the others were aghast.

>> > >> Along with heated apple pie,

>> > >> Mae added, completely unabashed.

>> > >>

>> > >> We tried to act quite nonchalant,

>> > >> As if people did this all the time.

>> > >> But when our orders were brought out,

>> > >> I did not enjoy mine.

>> > >>

>> > >> I could not take my eyes off Mae,

>> > >> As her pie a-la-mode went down.

>> > >> The other ladies showed dismay,

>> > >> They ate their lunches silently, and frowned.

>> > >>

>> > >> Well, the next time I went out to eat,

>> > >> I called and invited Mae.

>> > >>

>> > >> My lunch contained white tuna meat,

>> > >> She ordered a parfait.

>> > >>

>> > >> I smiled when her dish I viewed,

>> > >> And she asked if she amused me.

>> > >> I answered, Yes, you do,

>> > >> But also you confuse me.

>> > >>

>> > >> How come you order rich desserts,

>> > >> When I feel I must be sensible?

>> > >> She laughed and said, with wanton mirth,

>> > >> I am tasting all that's possible.

>> > >>

>> > >> I try to eat the food I need,

>> > >> And do the things I should.

>> > >> But life's so short, my friend, indeed,

>> > >> I hate missing out on something good.

>> > >>

>> > >> This year I realized how old I was,

>> > >> She grinned, I've not been this old before.

>> > >>

>> > >> So, before I die, I've got to try,

>> > >> Those things for years I had ignored.

>> > >>

>> > >> I've not smelled all the flowers yet,

>> > >> There's too many books I have not read.

>> > >>

>> > >> There's more fudge sundaes to wolf down

>> > >> And kites to be flown overhead.

>> > >>

>> > >> There are many malls I have not shopped,

>> > >> I've not laughed at all the jokes.

>> > >>

>> > >> I've missed a lot of Broadway Hits,

>> > >> And potato chips and cokes.

>> > >>

>> > >> I want to wade again in water,

>> > >> And feel ocean spray upon my face.

>> > >>

>> > >> Sit in a country church once more,

>> > >> And thank God for It's grace.

>> > >>

>> > >> I want peanut butter every day,

>> > >> Spread on my morning toast.

>> > >>

>> > >> I want un-timed long-distance calls,

>> > >> To the folks I love the most.

>> > >>

>> > >> I've not cried at all the movies yet,

>> > >> Nor walked in the morning rain.

>> > >>

>> > >> I need to feel wind in my hair,

>> > >> I want to fall in love again.

>> > >>

>> > >> So, if I choose to have dessert,

>> > >> Instead of having dinner.

>> > >>

>> > >> Then should I die before night fall,

>> > >> I'd say I died a winner.

>> > >>

>> > >> Because I missed out on nothing,

>> > >> I filled my heart's desire.

>> > >>

>> > >> I had that final chocolate mousse,

>> > >> Before my life expired.

>> > >>

>> > >> With that, I called the waitress over,

>> > >> I've changed my mind, it seems.

>> > >>

>> > >> I said, I want what she is having,

>> > >> Only add some more whipped-cream!

>> > >>. Be happy.

>> > >>

>> > >> "Be mindful that happiness is not based on

>> > >> possessions, power, or prestige, but on relationships

>> > >> with people you love and respect."

>> > >> Money talks. Chocolate sings.
