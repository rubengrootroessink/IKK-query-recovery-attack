I sure enjoyed dinner last night -- ice tea and all. For what it is worth, I
believe you made the right choice, recognizing it was not an easy one. Your
judgment is sound and you should believe in it. I hope you are feeling more
confident in your choice now.

Thanks for your words of wisdom to me. I am admittedly a bit scared -- since
I cannot control this situation very much. 

Just how did we get to be so Type A?

Have a wonderful trip. I will have my cell phone with me if you need to
reach me -- 713-557-8667. Also, the contact information for our condo in
Jackson Hole is Jackson Hole Racquet Club at the Aspens, 307-739-9050 (main
reservations number).

Take care, C
