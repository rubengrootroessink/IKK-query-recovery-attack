Ricki may tell you that the Board was voting while you were out of the room.  IT WAS ONLY A STRAW COUNT for support of three voting members at a promotional rate.  It was not a real vote and we've moved on.  Boswell is taking the issues one at a time to determine support each -- an attempt to move us forward.
