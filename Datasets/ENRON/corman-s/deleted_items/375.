Shelley,

Lack of ratification may be the reason for no vote today.  We'll see what Rae says.  If it isn't clear, you could ask whether the changes have been ratified and whether ratification will take place prior to the report being brought before the Board for approval.

Leigh just told me that Rae told him there is no vote to be taken on the report.
I told him it needs to get on the record that in any event that the report is
not sent until ratified as it sets a bad precedent. If he doesn't mention in
his presentation, can Shelley bring it up?
