	      ?	If you already have Internet access away from your office, i.e...high-speed internet connection such as DSL or cable modem: 
		You need to install the attached eConnVPN.exe client.
							  
	      ?	If you are dialing in: 
		You need to create a Dial-Up connection (Please see instructions attached Dial In Instructions.doc) using either number listed below. You must be 		            sure to append the domain name to the user id (i.e.. CORP\rbarker) for the connection to be successful.
