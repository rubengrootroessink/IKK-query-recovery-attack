1. Changing jobs? What about your 401(k)?
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
A new job means lots of  packing and unpacking, different 
business cards, changing your e-mail address - and figuring 
out what to do with your 401(k). There's a lot riding on this 
decision, and you ought to consider all the factors, such as 
taxes, withdrawal penalties and flexibility.  Here's an 
excellent overview of the four basic choices you have for a 
401(k) when changing jobs, with a straight-forward description 
of the pros and cons of each alternative.

2. Your 401(k) Bill of Rights 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
In just over 20 years the 401(k) plan has taken a central 
position in our personal finances. For many Americans, the 
assets in their 401(k) rank second only to their homes in 
value. Do you fully understand what you are entitled to in a 
401(k)? This clearly-written overview sums up the major rules 
and regulations of 401(k)s, and spells out your "401(k) Bill 
of Rights" -- what you should expect both from your employer 
and the IRS in such areas as withdrawals, loans, and 
contribution levels.

5. Tax information you need in one place: Schwab's Tax Center   
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
The Tax Relief Act that became law last summer brought important 
changes to the U.S. tax landscape. While it's typically not easy 
to keep pace with the complexities of tax regulation and reform, 
now you can locate most of what you need in just one place - 
Schwab's Tax Center. 

At the Tax Center under Tax Planning, you can examine how the 
new tax laws apply to you. The Tax Relief Act has been analyzed 
through the eyes of experts. You'll see how these changes could 
affect you and your money.  

There are also tax tips galore at the Tax Center, plus online 
calculators and easy-to-use tools that will help you estimate 
your taxes, deductions and credits. For example, you can try 
different stock-selling scenarios to estimate the impact of 
realizing short- or long-term capital gains and losses. 

Whether you do your own taxes or work with a tax professional, 
you'll benefit from a visit to Schwab's Tax Center.

my parents in their later years?

Through discussion and in-class exercises, you'll learn 
strategies and solutions designed to help you meet a variety 
of financial objectives.  You'll come away with a better 
understanding of your financial priorities and a personal 
action plan tailored to your financial needs and life goals.
