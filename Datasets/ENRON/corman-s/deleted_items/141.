Shelley-

Hewitt said the two 401k withdrawal checks, one to your benefit at SmithBarney and one directly to you, were generated on 12/10/01.  

If you do not receive your check in the mail, and if the SmithBarney check is not deposited by this coming Friday, December 21, let me know, and I'll call them back and let them know.

Hope all is well!
