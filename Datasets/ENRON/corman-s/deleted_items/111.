Mike Ellington, Sr. Gas Controller, submitted his resignation this morning. He is moving to Tulsa to be closer to his and his wife's elderly parents. I need to replace Mike to help reduce overtime costs and to keep from Controller burnout. What process/steps do I need to take to seek approval to replace? thanks. sj
