The Board meeting minutes for 1997 are no longer posted.  I have electronic copies only for late 1997.  The only paper copy for 1997 in the file room is the Board book and someone's meeting notes for the May 13, 1997 Board meeting.  That means that I don't have the outcome (minutes) of the May meeting.

I'll look through my notes on changes to the Certificate, but we don't have anything official.  After today's meeting, I can get the May minutes from NAESB if we want them.
