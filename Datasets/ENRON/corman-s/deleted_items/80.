Dear Amazon.com Customer,

The holidays are over, but that doesn't mean the giving has to
stop--only now, you can treat yourself. Just in case you didn't get
everything you wanted, we're offering $5 off any purchase of $50 or
more from the items remaining on your Wish List.

Or if you'd like, go beyond your current list: just click the Wish
List recommendations button to find some more items you might like,
and add your favorites to your Shopping Cart. Then use the claim code
below to take $5 off your purchase of $50 or more.

Grant yourself a final holiday wish today, and don't delay--this
offer expires January 18, 2002.
