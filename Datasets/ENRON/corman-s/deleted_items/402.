Shelley,  I've discussed further with Paul Cherry.  He has reached his contact at El Paso who confirms they have purchased 100% of the Orlando Cogen plants from Air Products.  He is in the process of getting new guarantees from El Paso.  It's surprising that Air Products didn't get this change made quickly, since they held the guarantees previously and are held liable should El Paso default.  I have a call into Nancy Bastida to find out if she's seen any paperwork from El Paso changing contract ownership.  Sheila

Okay - so I see that it's Orlando Cogen (not Orange).  I'm unclear what the relationship is with El Paso.  Do they own 100% of Orlando Cogen?  Are they the designee?  Have they sent correspondence to us that El Paso is now owner or contact party for this contract?

Jimmy,  we could use a helping hand in collecting about $518 K from Orlando Cogen for their January reservation billing.  Marion has called them on several occasions this week and they simply are not responding to her messages.  We have several small customers we're still chasing, but Orlando is the most significant outstanding issue we have left.  Could you give me a call in the morning so we can discuss.  Thks! Sheila
