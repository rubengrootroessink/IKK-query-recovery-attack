Dear Shelley,

Spring is in the air...which means spring break can't be far behind. 
Have you made your plans yet? Why not? Don't let the cost keep you 
from it--with Real Deals and Last-Minute Deals, you can still save 
a bundle, even if you've been procrastinating on your planning. 
Not a student? That's not an excuse either--everyone deserves a 
break now and then. So what are you waiting for? Book your spring 
travel now!

Speaking of spring break, did you know that two out of three members 
who took our last member poll told us that they've already planned 
for spring break vacation? Check out where they're going and what 
they'll be doing!
