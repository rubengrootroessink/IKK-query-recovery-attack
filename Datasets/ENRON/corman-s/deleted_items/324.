Besides Teb, who should I get approval from to change invoice due dates of the 11th or 20th that fall on a Saturday or Sunday to a due date of Friday, based on the tariff.  Or should I simply put out a message to marketing, Teb, Fraizer to announce the planned change?  Currently we're sending invoices out with the Sat/Sun date.
