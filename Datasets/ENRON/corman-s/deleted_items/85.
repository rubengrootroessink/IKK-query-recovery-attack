Quick question:

I was wondering if you know anyone who could benefit
from a better understanding of energy derivatives, risk 
 management policy, gas-to-electricity arbitrage, statistics or 
 electric power trading.  
 
 If you do, please make them aware of  PGS Energy Training's
upcoming seminars in downtown Houston (in February) and
downtown Philadelphia (March).

Available seminars include:
    1) Fundamentals of Energy Futures, Options & Derivatives
    2) Fundamentals of the Electric Power Industry
    3) Gas-to-Electricity Arbitrage & How to Maximize the
        Profitability of Electric Generation Assets
    4) Developing Effective Risk Management Policies
        & Procedures (John Wengler)
    5) Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis (Dr. Ken Skinner)

 You can also save money by bringing a group of 4 or more. 
 With a group rate, your cost for $1,295 seminars is reduced 
 to $895 per attendee-- a savings of $1,600 from regular 
 prices. The group price for the $695 programs is $495.
 
As you know, successful people invest the they time need to
improve their career prospects and increase their value to
their organization.  Hope to see you there!
