I spoke to Michael Goldenberg at FERC, and the hold up with the issuance of
the GISB final rule (RM96-1-019) is at OMB, not at FERC.  The Office of
Management and Budget has to assess, then sign off on, the rule as not
constituting a major rule, which they are expected to do but haven't yet.

Michael was hoping to hear back from OMB today or tomorrow, and issue the
rule right after that.
