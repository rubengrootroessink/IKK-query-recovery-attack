Shelley,
How about meeting Tuesday, Jan. 15 at 3:30 pm?  I realize your schedule is subject to change and I will make myself available at your convenience if this doesn't work out.

 Donna,  

Attached is the written comments that I prepared while I was traveling.  I can't remember if I already sent this to you or not ...please forgive me if I already sent this to you (sinus congestion is not conducive to sound thinking).  Let me know when you want to sit down and talk.
