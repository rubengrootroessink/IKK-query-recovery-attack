Does Fri at 10 work for you?  I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.

Next week sounds fine for vacation.

I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan. But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.  The neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number.

Playdate sounds great

Talk to you tomorrow.
