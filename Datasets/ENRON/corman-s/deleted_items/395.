The note below from Kevin describes the communications issues we are having with the MOPS system. Apparently we are hopeful that comm will be re-established, on a temporary basis, this afternoon. We have also checked into the device types on the MOPS system to determine how much data can be stored locally. As you can see from the attached file, there are 7 of the 29 field units that will only store up to 7 days of hourly data. After that, we would begin losing data. To avoid losing data, if communication isn't available, we would have to collect locally using laptops.

Gary.

Subject:	NNG Mops, Offshore SCADA Outage Update

As of this morning, the latest information on the telecommunications outage for the NNG MOPS offshore platforms is;

Sometime on Friday 3/1 a Contractor at the direction of BP- Amoco, terminated the BP analog microwave system that NNG contracts for service to connect Platform 703 back to the coast and installed an new digital microwave system. I appears at this time BP did not plan for the NNG service during this upgrade.

ETS field personnel diagnosed this outage as if it were a equipment failure. The discovery of no equipment was made Monday late morning after flying out to the platform. Communication with BP platform personnel has been ongoing. (BP contracts all comm. support)

As we understand the issue this morning; The BP contractor is on its way from Louisiana and is planning to temporarily reinstall the analog system to allow the NNG data transmission back to the coast. The ETA is later this afternoon and is only a temporary fix.

Additionally, we are checking on the terms of the existing contract and if the payments are current.
We are also looking at other communications options for 703, but any other option will require a capital expenditure for equipment, transportation and a new or updated contract with BP.

If you have any questions, please contact myself or Cliff Basha.
