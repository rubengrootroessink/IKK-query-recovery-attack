Hi Shelley,

Thanks so much for the pictures.  You sent the films along, though.  I will 
return them to you.   (One packets of pictures is missing, which means one of 
your films must still be at Walgreens.  Have Kim check that out.)

I will send the information that came here for you from Associated Realty 
about giving proxy to a home owner here for a meeting in early February.  I 
will try to attend the meeting when we return. (I believe it's Feb. 7th.  We 
hope to be back by the 5th.)

We'll call you tonight.

Love,
Mom
