The projectors in Gas Control are wearing out and cost approximately $5000 each to replace if you can find the parts. Gary Kenagy is working with Henry Terech in Facilities to replace with excess large Panasonic flat panel screens. We should be able to get them for little or no cost--just installation cost, which should be minimal. This was a good heads up move on Gary's part. sj
