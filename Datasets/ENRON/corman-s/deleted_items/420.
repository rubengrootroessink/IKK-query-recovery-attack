Per a request from Stan in this morning's ETS staff meeting, we have scheduled a Systems Update Meeting for next Tuesday, March 19, from 2-2:30pm in Stan's office to discuss money spent, timetable-move forward or slow down, etc.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this meeting.
