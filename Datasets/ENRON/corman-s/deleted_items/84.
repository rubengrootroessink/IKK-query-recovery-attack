FYI -- Below is Scott's response to my question of whether Northern Border will renew their GISB membership.  They have renewed their membership for 2002.  I'll continue to work with Northern Border as I do now -- which is the same as I do for the Houston-based pipelines.

Theresa:

Recognizing we have two interstate pipelines (Northern Border and Midwestern), two gatherers/processors (Crestone (US) and Border Midstream (Canada)), and a producer (Bear Paw) within the NBP family who are impacted by GISB, we opted to pick up a membership for Northern Border Pipeline for 2002.  This way, what ever happens on the Enron front, NBP will have at least one membership that we can use.

A check was cut late last week and sent to GISB.
