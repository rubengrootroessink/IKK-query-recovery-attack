Big Banks Dominate iDTV - Report
Benjamin Ensor, December 2001
Related to: Financial Services UK Market Focus; UK Internet Commerce;
UK On-line Finance
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,11725,00.html

     Leading financial firms rushed to pioneer iDTV in the UK -- but
     low uptake and tech limitations prevent short-term ROI. Big banks
     will outlast rivals by combining interactive advertising with
     walled-garden services.

Managing Auto's Demand Chain - Report
Baba Shetty, December 2001
Related to: Automotive Market Focus
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,12211,00.html

     Auto demand chain costs devastate OEM and dealer profits. By
     2003, leading OEMs will unveil second-generation locate-to-order
     systems -- not to sell online, but to dramatically reduce demand
     chain costs.

Rehabilitating B2B Content - Report
John P. Dalton, December 2001
Related to: Site Technology Market Focus; Corporate Technology;
Internet Commerce; Applications, Development, & Data; Business
Trade On-line; Healthcare On-line; On-line Retail; Commerce Technology
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,11183,00.html

     Sell-side firms struggle with complex -- and expensive -- content
     management challenges. To succeed, firms must either master
     application integration and content classification or find a hosted
     solutions provider.

Reinventing Technology Management - Report

Related to: Technology Leadership Core Skill; Corporate
Technology; IT Leadership; European Corporate Technologies;
IT Organizations & Budgets
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,11984,00.html

     Today's stand-alone IT can't manage externally sourced and
     business-owned technology. To thrive, firms will adopt exT
     structures to manage and deliver technology that drives measurable
     business value.

Specialize Your Site's Search - Report
Kyle Johnson, December 2001
Related to: Site Technology Market Focus; Corporate Technology;
Internet Commerce; Applications, Development, & Data; Business
Trade On-line; New Media; On-line Financial Services; On-line Retail;
Commerce Technology; Site Design & Management
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,13322,00.html

     Site managers struggle to bring the quality of search in line
     with rising expectations. Questing for all-in-one search doesn't
     help -- firms must optimize engines to help users locate products
     or get help or find documents.

The Secret To Device Success - Report
Bruce Kasrel, December 2001
Related to: Media Market Focus
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,13493,00.html

     Device makers should: 1) focus on a common, cumbersome behavior,
     and 2) maximize usability, not technology. These criteria give PC
     makers an edge in new devices.
