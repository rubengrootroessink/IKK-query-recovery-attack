site (http://www.naesb.org/naesb.htm).  Additional instructions for how to 
communicate your willingness to sign on to the filing as a signatory are

<< In response to many concerns, the date on the filing will be changed to 
reflect the appropriate date before the filing is made.  The filing that was 
sent out yesterday afternoon does reflect changes that were agreed upon at 
Friday's meeting at FERC.  Attachment A of the filing will be the signatory 
page.  Attachment B, Wholesale Electric Standards Proposed Consensus Process 
Diagram, was inadvertently left off and is attached to this email.
