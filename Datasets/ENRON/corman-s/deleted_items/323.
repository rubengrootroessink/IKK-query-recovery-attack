Shelley,
Please see the note below.  I recommend taking all the company numbers back to the original plan and any reduction that occurs during the year be viewed as a current estimate.  What are your thoughts?

Donna,
In a Dynegy meeting this afternoon, we were instructed to change the Gas Logistics Dynegy Plan -- which we had submitted at $6.363M --
back to the Original Plan of $6.864M.  They viewed the reduction as more of a Current Estimate, so from this point, we will use the $6.864M as the official plan number for future comparisons.  (At least for Dynegy purposes.)
I will resubmit the plan to Steve Kleb this afternoon.   Please inform Shelley about this latest development.
Thanks,

Nancy
