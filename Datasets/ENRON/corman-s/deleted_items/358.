	I would like for both teams to review coverage for the the time period of
	March 18 - March 26th.  That is the crunch time for getting all the information
	reviewed for the SLA Refund.  It is critical that we have enough people available
	to review all the necessary reports as well as keep the day to day business
	going.

	I would like a person on each team to be designated as the point person for
	Raetta and Larry as well as the team to be sure all the bases are covered.
	That person needs to be working the whole time from 18th through 26th.
	(We will get the weekend off!!)  

	Please let me know by Tuesday, March 11, who your point person is and if you
	have sufficient coveragefor Gas Logistics to be successful on the effort.

	Thanks. Lynn
