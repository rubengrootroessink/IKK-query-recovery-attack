Dear Attorney General, 

           Re:   19 December 2001 ltr. subj:   "Complaint Against Enron," from Office Of Attorney General, Jeffrey M. Dikman, Assistant Attorney General, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.   A copy is provided for your convenience (as item 6) via the site index page at: 

<http://members.fortunecity.com/corruptioningovernment/> 

           The referenced letter stated, "The Florida State Board of Administration, which administers Florida's public pension plans, will be seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff in the pending Texas class action against Enron and others." 

           Such action appears to be joining to administer a death blow to Enron stockholders as a service to International Organized Crime whose agents, as Wall Street Market Operators, have severely and extensively watered Enron and other securities through the sale of bogus, counterfeit receipts.   Whereas, the real responsible entities (in the case of Enron) are the New York Stock Exchange officers and specialists serving those profiting via the secret omnibus accounts through which funds from the sale of bogus, counterfeit receipts are distributed to secret unidentified parties.   The existence of those secret omnibus accounts has been documented in US Congressional Reports. 

           Certain officers of Enron Corporation obviously have been privy to certain aspects of the aforecited illicit activities and deliberately helped to set up Enron Corporation for bankruptcy.   In doing so, they were privy to planned negative manipulation of Enron securities prices and rewarded by early and profitable sales of securities held by them. 

           Again, may I caution against actions detrimental to Enron stockholders while transferring blame and liability to the Corporation and naive officers (fallguys) thereof while ignoring the real criminal parties whose actions are ultimately robbing all citizens. 



Sincerely,

Mr. Dana E. Brown
