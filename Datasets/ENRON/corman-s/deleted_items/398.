	Per our discussions today, here is my understanding of the status of the
	implementation of the PGAS calculation for 31 Day Charts and & Meter Cards.

	Beginning with March Production (April Billing), GMS will have the new
	calculation in PGAS for 31 Day Charts and Meter Cards.  This calculation
	is to give NNG a better daily number to bill the customer.  Once the 
	31 Day Charts are in, then they will be delineated with the fixed
	delineator.  The meter cards will use the calculation only.

	At this time there will NOT be a daily PGAS calculation for 7 day and 16 day
	charts.  These charts will be (1) tracked for timely receipt; and (2) integrated for
	daily volumes when received. 
	
	Any charts received after the required deadline, will be processed as a PPA.

	Gary, if we need to clarify any of the above, please let me know.  If anyone has
	any questions, please let Gary or I know.  Thanks. Lynn
