Shelley,  Shannon asked me to help her get Kathy set up in Hottap & TMS at the customer meeting last week.  Deborah w/the Help Desk called Shannon several times & left phone messges to get her request in motion.  Kathy called in yesterday & Deborah is completing the setup today.  Either Lanny or Maggie will follow up with TMS/Hottap training.
