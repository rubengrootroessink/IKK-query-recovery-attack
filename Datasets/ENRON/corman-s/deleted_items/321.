Shelley,

I have checked the system and find that the only changes made to your record during 2001 are as follows:

1/1/2001 - 4/15/2001 - VP Reg & Gov. Affairs - Co. 0366
4/15/2001 - 12/16/2001 - Title change to VP Gas Logistics - no company change
12/17/2001 - 12/31/2001 - FMLA Leave - no company change

1/1/2002 - to present company change to 179E.

I have nothing indicating a company change for 2001.  

Let me know who in payroll you spoke with and maybe I can work with them to determine their conclusion.

Rita

Shelly,

As soon as SAP is back up, I will look to see what the changes made to your record were.   I'm thinking your Tax company is Corp and that perhaps you are listed as deferred comp.  That's just off the top of my head.  Again, once the system is operating again, I will check into this.

Rita,

I was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co. (366) all year.  Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year.  Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both Enron Operations Services Co & Enron Corp. in 2001?
