Under the tax law, Enron is precluded from taking a tax deduction for certain expenses incurred in conducting lobbying activities.  Each year, Enron's employees must keep records of their time associated with these lobbying activities.  

For your convenience, I am attaching a questionnaire with a memo from Marilyn Doolittle that has further details on completing the form.

Everyone on this email must return the completed form even if you performed no lobbying related services for the year 2001.  Additionally, your help in reviewing the email list and forwarding to anyone who should receive a questionnaire that is not listed, with a copy to the tax department so we can track the additional people's response would be greatly appreciated.

Please submit the completed 2001 Lobbying Time Report to me, Debbie Doyle, at EB1753a on or before Wednesday, March 13, 2002.
