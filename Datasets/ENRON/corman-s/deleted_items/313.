We've been talking on our Computer & Video Games Discussion Board <http://f=
orums.prosperotechnologies.com/n/mb/listsf.asp?webtag=3Dam-compgames> about=
 the most overlooked game of 2001. The ground rule for judging is simple: t=
he title has to have missed out on its fair share of attention or critical =
praise (games like Pikmin <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Q8L=
Y/ref=3Dmk_del_267765_21>, Golden Sun <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/AS=
IN/B00005OARM/ref=3Dmk_del_267765_22>, and Super Smash Bros. Melee <http://=
www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Q8M0/ref=3Dmk_del_267765_23> don't me=
et this criteria for obvious reasons). Two games for Nintendo systems kept =
popping up in our discussion: Paper Mario <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obido=
s/ASIN/B00004U1R3/ref=3Dmk_del_267765_24>, which was released last spring f=
or the retiring Nintendo 64, and Super Monkey Ball <http://www.amazon.com/e=
xec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QDQ1/ref=3Dmk_del_267765_25>, which came out for the =
GameCube late last December. One could say that both games suffered from po=
or timing. What do you think of these two games, or, better yet, what do yo=
u think is the most overlooked game of 2001? Drop by our discussion board a=
nd share your opinion. Game on! -- Porter <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obido=
