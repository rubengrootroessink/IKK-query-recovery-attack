Two of the games featured in this newsletter star characters who debuted 10=
 or more years ago. Frogger, that old traffic dodger, has seen a recent res=
urgence on the Game Boy Advance and other platforms, while Sega spokesmasco=
t Sonic the Hedgehog is soon to debut on both the GameCube and the GBA in t=
wo games that work cooperatively. Other characters who've made recent comeb=
acks include Pac-Man, Pitfall Harry <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN=
/B00005BJ9C/ref=3Dmk_del_248439_22>, and the vampire hunters of Castlevania=
 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005BJ9G/ref=3Dmk_del_248439_23>=
. These games aren't just retreaded classics, either--they incorporate mode=
rn game elements and up-to-date graphics. So here's my question: which long=
-lost video game or character would you like to see make a return? Let ever=
yone know on our Computer & Video Games Discussion Board <http://prospero.a=
mazon.com/n/mb/listsf.asp?webtag=3Dam-compgames>. Personally, I'd love to s=
ee versions of Spy Hunter for both the GameCube and GBA. Game on! --Porter =

Why did the frog cross the road? If you guessed to regain mystical elements=
 that nourish his marsh, give yourself two points. Frogger's Adventures: Te=
mple of the Frog <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NCAD/ref=3Dm=
k_del_248439_27> has our hero chasing the evil Mr. D through 15 levels to g=
et the goods. Contributing writer Raymond Padilla had this to say in his Am=
azon.com review of the game: "The simple gameplay of the original Frogger i=
s intact, but the developers have added clever levels, bright graphics, and=
 modern game mechanics to the mix."
