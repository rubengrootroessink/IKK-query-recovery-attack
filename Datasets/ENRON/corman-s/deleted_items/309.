I just got back from the eye doctor.  My eye wasn't scratched.  I had a rusty piece of metal in it!  I tore down my garden (which is framed and covered in chicken wire to keep out the critters) on Sunday and a piece of the wire must have lodged in my eye.  I will spare you the gross details of him using a needle to dig this rusty piece of metal out of my eye like a splinter...  It was numb and still hurt.  I won't be in this afternoon.
