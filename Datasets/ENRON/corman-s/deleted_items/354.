Rod, Shelley mentioned that you indicated there were written procedures that we needed to check to see if being followed in regards to Measurement.  A lot of new procedures came out of the Continuous Improvement effort and I have a copy of some.  Is this what you are referring to?  Do you happen to have a complete copy of the final report from all the areas?  cvb
