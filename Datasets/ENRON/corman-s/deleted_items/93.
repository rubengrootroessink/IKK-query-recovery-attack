	Gary, could you let me know the status of the NOVEMBER PPA's which would
	be billed with December commodity billing (actually billed in January)?  I want to be sure 
	you received all of the information from the field to make the November PPA adjustments 
	for December production close.  

	My assumption is that you have received all required PPA's since I did not receive a list of
	outstanding meter information you need from the field.

	If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks. Lynn
