Karon, Shelley is also out until January 7th and I do not have this information.  Again, you might want to check with Fawn Borger because she set-up both of our Black Berry's.

Thank you, Ricki

Shelley and Steve,

I am moving all ETS Blackberry devices off the Corp Invoice onto a new Account for ETS that I have set up this week

I need your Pin No to move your device, it should be a number that starts with 877

Thanks, Karon
