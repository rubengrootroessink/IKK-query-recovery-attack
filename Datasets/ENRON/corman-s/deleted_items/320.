Your group has been using Debbie Moore for graphics services and design work.  We want to be sure that you are aware that we are eliminating our graphics services and design work capabilities effective March 11.

As a result of the December layoffs, the services of Bowne Graphics are not available on-site either.  

Some units have expressed alarm at the loss of Debbie. However, absent strong expression of need and willingness to pay for services, Debbie will leave Enron on Monday, March 11, and we will no longer have the capability to provide graphic services and design.  Consequently, you may want to identify other sources for this support.

Please let us know if you have strong concerns about this action.

John Ambler and Gina Taylor
