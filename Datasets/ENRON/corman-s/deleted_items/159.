When asked about the source of my decorating and design inspirations, I recall fabrics and wood I have touched, smells I have enjoyed, and of course, people who have made impressions, and places I have been.

One such person was a woman, at least 85 years old, who lived in a most unlikely place--her antiques store. It was from another time and place, certainly not from the Southwest, which is where I happened upon her.

Upon discovering her quaint store, I banged the huge door-knocker a few times before she slowly opened the door. Her silver hair was pulled tightly into a bun, not unlike (I thought at the time) Katharine Hepburn. Her aura of elegance showed and her face sparkled with a bright smile. Who was she? Had she always lived in her store?

She let me in. Although it was not the holiday season, whispers of light were everywhere, high and low. The place was packed! She had the best and rarest antiques the world had to offer. Each piece was more polished than the previous. She loved living with her things; this was apparent.

After I had made a couple of twists and turns from one room to another, she approached and kindly offered tea. I declined her invitation. After I purchased an unusual bottle of sterling silver and ruby-colored crystal we said our good-byes. She opened the door, and I returned to the "real world."

It has been 24 years, and I've often thought of this elegant woman and her inviting shop. Whenever I do, I regret not having accepted her invitation for tea. The stories she could have told...

A place that has inspired my decorating sense is a wonderful old inn in upstate New York. High tea in the grand salon is replete with scones, light cookies and English tea, which guests savor as they relax in buttery-soft leather chairs, which are nestled by a huge stone fireplace. I've sat in those chairs for hours at a time watching the other guests -- always certain they were dressed in Victorian ball gowns (my husband, however, assures me they're were wearing blue jeans!)

This grand inn is just one of a thousand places that have inspired my decorating with its unique style and atmosphere -- I could have sworn it was haunted by kindred spirits -- I hope so.


Tips by Julee!!!

Tip #1. No cupboards near the kitchen sink? Install three glass shelves just above the sink or to the side of the window. Great for drinking glasses.

Tip #2. Have a contemporary powder room but prefer country-French?
* Remove the door to the vanity
* Strip the finish from the cabinet
* Paint in French blue, yellow or melon
* Hang a gathered French fabric in place of the door
* Pull one favorite color from the fabric and use for wall paint


Questions

I adore color, but my rooms are small. What can I do in choosing window coverings, lighting and furniture that will ensure my use of color will not make the rooms look smaller?
A small but effective trick I use is staying monochromatic. Do not allow a color from the smallest lampshade to the largest window treatment to jump out at you.

Julee, I have a small budget to update my bedroom. What can I skimp on and what should be an investment?
Invest in the finest rugs, art and furniture your budget allows. Now, go and have fun with linens. They're always affordable, so one can have many different looks and not break the bank.

Even though it's only January, I am ready to decorate for spring. What do you recommend? 
Nothing says spring like flowers and pastel colors. Choose bedding in a floral pattern like daisies that complements your existing color scheme. Hang lightweight, gauzy window treatments in lace or a sheer material too, and arrange a vase or basket of fresh-cut flowers. The light colors and sunshine will warm any room, even in the middle of winter!


Time has run out again! I enjoyed receiving all the letters and comments from my devoted readers last year. Keep them coming in the new one! 


As always,
