Ricki,  would you please forward this message to the NNG & TW teams. 

Last Thursday evening, Mary Lou was in a car accident and was bumped around pretty good.  She was taken to the hospital, but sent home that evening w/cuts and bruises.  The following morning, one of the doctors at the hospital called to ask her to return to the hospital for another MRI as they suspicion a brain aneurysm, which was nothing to do with the accident.  Friday evening, Mary Lou called to tell me she does in fact have a very small aneurysm, and she is to go to a neurologist today, Monday.  Either Mary Lou or one of her children will call me later today with another update, which I will forward on as soon as I am notified.  Sheila
