Can they come in the afternoon on Feb 18 (President's Day)?  I have an appointment with the tax lady in the AM.

Can you see about getting Alina a Dentist appointment on Mar 1 at 8 AM  (or at 1 PM) ?  Is it time for Chad to have an appointment again?  Chad has off school on Mar 1 & I plan to take a vacation day.  Alina has an appointment for more vaccinations with Dr Kline at 10 AM.  We may go to the zoo after that.
