Peggy,

Your email notice was timely as I was just thinking about you.  I have wanted to congratulate you on your promotion.  I am so happy for you.  I find it validating, especially at this time at Enron, to know that good things do happen to good people.

Give me a call if you can ever break free for lunch.  I would like to catch up with you on business matters, and more importantly, on international adoptions.  I know that you have already navigated these waters and I am looking forward to travel to Kazakhstan to adopt a little girl.

Best wishes to you and your family for the holidays.

Shelley Corman
