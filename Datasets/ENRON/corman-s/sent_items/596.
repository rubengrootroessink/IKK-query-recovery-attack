Please plan to get together tomorrow, March 20 from 3-4 PM in 39C1 for a staff meeting.  We can talk about the new Enron severance policy, the return of the personal best award program or anything else that is on your mind.  If you have issues that you know that you would like me to address please drop me an email today so that I can do some research and be better prepared to answer your questions.

Shelley
