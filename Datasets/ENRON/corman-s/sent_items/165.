Here are my edits to the FAQ document.  Sorry but I don't understand the pool allocation response.  

 

My notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions
- where storage allocation notices appear 
- why storage allocation notices come out at a later time.

Fixes already put in place
In the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback.  Can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items:

- Make customers aware that they can call HotTap Helpdesk for calls
- Raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings
- Haven't we taken a step to notify EDI customers about system downtime
- We have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages
- Aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators
- Can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors "storage analysis completed" vs "storage allocations completed"  {See my suggestion in FAQ}
