Greg,

Typically I sign all these EDI trading partner agreements with Lee Huber's initials.  Can we get the proper agency/delegations in place so that I can continue to sign without further ado so long as the agreements are identical to the GISB standard agreement.  We can put in place a separate procedure for any non-standard TPAs?

Shelley,

Will you be able to continue executing the Northern Natural Gas Company TPAs?  If not, can you tell me who will so that I can update the TPA on the website.

Thanks,
Mary
