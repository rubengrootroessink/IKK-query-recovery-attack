I guess we'll cancel the direct report meeting since this means that Lynn, Steve & Mike will be absent.

Shelley, there is a meeting to discuss the SLA meeting today from 9:30 until 11:00 with Lynn, Steve, Mary Kay & Dave Neubauer.  Will you be attending or do you want to continue with your direct report staff meeting?

Thank you, Ricki
