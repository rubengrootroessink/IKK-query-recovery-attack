Rick,

When I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with Keith Higginbotham).  I have been working on Gulfstream OBA & interconnect agreement with Frazier/Dot/ Sharon for several weeks.  I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too.   What is your team working on on Gulfstream?

Also can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.  I think I had the outdated  one prior to the latest printing.

Thanks

Shelley
