Dates all work great.  As you mentioned, I will likely be traveling in late November or early December

You probably noticed that I will be out this Friday for the Mylogram.  This outpatient procedure will determine if I will require surgery on my neck to remove the bone spurs that are pinching nerves.

November 5th - 7th I will be on vacation in Phoenix.

November 14th Jury Duty that I rescheduled from July.

Still working on the holidays and at the moment I'm trying to stay here for Thanksgiving and out the week of Christmas.  I'm purposely scheduling this so I will be here while your out of the country, so please let me know if things change.

Will these dates work for you?

Thank you, Ricki
