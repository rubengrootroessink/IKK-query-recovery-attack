Shelly:

Don Hawkins and Sarabeth Smith would like to get together with you to discuss the Citizens deal and how things are going for you and your group with the business that is being generated by EAMR.

Don will be traveling starting Tuesday, Oct. 23 through November 1st.  Therefore, they would like to set up the meeting sometime Monday, Oct. 22  afternoon - anytime from 1:30 - 4 (however, he has a meeting starting at 4pm - so would have to conclude by then).

Please let me know if you can do this on the 22nd.  Thank you!
