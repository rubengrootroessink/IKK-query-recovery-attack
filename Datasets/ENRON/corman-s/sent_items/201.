When it comes to commitments involving website postings, scheduling or balancing, could I please ask that my group be copied on settlements and proposals.  It is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts -- just to make sure that I understand what is involved in complying.

In the case of the Transwestern setttlement offer -- my only comment/concern is that I would hope we could coordinate our posting formats with the GISB rules -- otherwise we will have conflicting requirements & have the expense of having different posting formats for our different pipes. 
"Transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting formats on its electronic bulletin board,
consistent with the GISB formats for informational postings. " 

Is there an SLA settlement/proposal that I can get a copy of?
