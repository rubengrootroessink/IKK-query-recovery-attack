If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity. We would disclose entities above TW in the corp chain for informational purposes.  FERC is interested for two reasons - to understnad that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW,s capital structure and return in a rate case.  !
