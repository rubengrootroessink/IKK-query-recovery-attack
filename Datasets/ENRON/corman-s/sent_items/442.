I love Aigerim and visited with her on my recent trip to Taraz.  I took lots of pictures of Aigerim and
if you send me your mailing address I'll send them.  I am very interested in Aigerim's placement.  Let me know either way about your decision.  If you decide not to adopt her I would love to continue to advocate for her.

Hi, how's it going? Anything new on your end?
We heard from Ginger that a child named Aigerim who is from Taraz became
available.  She is from a different orphanage in Taraz.  She stayed in
the HOuston Area.  She is Kazak and speaks only Kazak.  She is five and
will turn 6 in March.  Did you meet any the kids from the Houston area.
Tonya Hoppe has sent me lots of pictures.  We are unsure and want to
wait until we are over to find a sibling for Anastasia.
I asked if they had a travel date, and Atwa told us no.  My work is
wanting to know when so they can find a replacement doc.  One of the
ATWA staff is due to travel on FEB 15th and she still does not have a
travel date.  Is this crazy or what?  I wonder if the other agencies
keep you hanging like this or if this is just our luck.   never boring,
tina
