Hi Mrs. Traylor,

Obviously things have been a bit chaotic in our family life as we try to get Alina ("Chad's new adopted sister) settled into our routines.  We have been trying to keep Chad's routines as normal as usual, including bedtime and homework time.  While he seems happy with school, I have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests.  This especially concerns me with respect to his math -- where he has always been an excellent student.

Do you have any suggestions to help Chad with timed practice tests?  Do you recommend any particular classes (Kumon, etc) or workbooks?  If you think it is appropriate to meet to talk about Chad's progress, I could come to school anytime this Friday, February 1 for a conference.

Thanks

Shelley Corman-Erb
