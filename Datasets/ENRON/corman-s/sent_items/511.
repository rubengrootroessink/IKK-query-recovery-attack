Hi! I hope you enjoyed the rest of your weekend. The weather was simply
beautiful. We did some extensive yardwork. Luckily we didn't plant much
since it is supposed to be chilly this week.

Brianna and I loved the sing-a-long Sound of Music. It was great fun. I'd go
again next weekend!

Let me know which day is best for us to have lunch --Wednesday or Thursday.

C
