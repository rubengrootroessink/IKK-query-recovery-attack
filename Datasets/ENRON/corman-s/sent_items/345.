Godspeed to you and your family as you make this trip.  My younger child is adopted and it has been a wonderful blessing and experience -- he is about to celebrate his 27th birthday!  

These are difficult days -- all of us may not understand everything that is taking place but we remain committed to diligently performing our jobs.  Have a safe trip!
