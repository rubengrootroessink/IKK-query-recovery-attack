Almost 100% certain that its just me.  I'd rather have good flights and spend the money on just me (i.e. we can share hotel costs).

Shelley,
I also found out that Luth. did fly out of Houston. They were sold out on the 
10th and only had 3 seats on the 11th.  I will do more looking when we know 
for sure the dates. If the prices are really high, then Fred may stay home, 
and I will go. Is it looking like just you, are is Kim going also?
