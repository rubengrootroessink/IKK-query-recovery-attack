Yes,  I volunteered to continue to keep up the flower beds again this year.  I was planning to pick up some flowers early Sat. morning at plant at the church.  If you want to meet me there around 8:30 AM or so that would be great (but please don't feel obligated).  I think we could get the planting done in about an hour.

Congrats to you on your recent wedding.  I am so thrilled for you both.

Hello Shelly,

Jim Keesling advised you were going to replant the flower bed by the
Sanctuary entrance. I mulched it last week and was going to do something
this week or  Saturday latest.

Please let me know if you need help in any way.




Thanks/Regards
