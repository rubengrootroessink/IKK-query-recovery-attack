I think it sounds worthwhile -- since Linda Breathitt and Stacy Girard are participating.  If Stan is unavailable, I think Phil Lowry or Mike Nelson would also be great choices.

Stan's been invited to present at a broadcast that SGA is hosting.  Apparently, Jerry Halverson indicated to this organization that Stan would be a great person to represent the industry.  Would you both take a look at the agenda for the broadcast and let me know if you think this is something that Stan should participate in?

If it is something that you think is worthwhile, I would work with INGAA on exactly what message they want Stan to communicate.

Thanks for your insight.

Can I get your opinion by Thursday?

Gina
