I just got this message.  I assume it is an old message or do you have a new injury?

Shelley,

I scratched my cornea playing basketball or have a conjunctivitis infection in my eye.  I have a doctor's appointment for 11:00 on Tuesday.              
                         
My home number is 281 359-6258 if you need to reach me.

Rick
