I'm back.  I was gone all of two minutes.  I needed a bathroom break.  I figured out that the straw was simply the 2 or 3 issue and so I didn't bother to chime in when I returned.

Ricki may tell you that the Board was voting while you were out of the room.  IT WAS ONLY A STRAW COUNT for support of three voting members at a promotional rate.  It was not a real vote and we've moved on.  Boswell is taking the issues one at a time to determine support each -- an attempt to move us forward.
