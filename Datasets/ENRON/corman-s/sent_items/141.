I don't think that it is absolutely imperative to attend.  However, we may =
be able to help Joe define some of the customer benefits of electronic serv=
ice.  Can one of the Tobys attend?

Subject:=09Summary of NOI


Attached is an executive summary of the NOI on Electronic Service of Docume=
nts, RM01-11. Essentially, FERC wants to expand service electronically to a=
llow individuals to receive documents through email without the need for in=
terventions just to be kept informed of the proceedings. FERC is making two=
 proposals, one for service to parties and one for service to individuals f=
or a cost (FERC states cost recovery but no specifics).

Comments are due November 2. Joe has asked that I coordinate comments for o=
ur pipelines. Let me know who you wish to participate.=20
