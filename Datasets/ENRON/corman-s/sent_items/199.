Thanks looks good.  I guess I just have a chip on my shoulder these days about being relegated to the world of details!

Here's the latest draft--this is on the way over to staff right now. I'll make sure all future settlement stuff goes to you. Thanks.

Per discussion with Drew and Joe, here are some mods which I think mitigate our internal issue on an interactive open season and what that means.   Please provide any comments asap and then Robyn can take the document, unredline and submit to Staff for us.  Which should be doable today,   Mary Kay << File: TranswesternSettlementOffer1.doc >>

I agree.  We need to get moving if we stand any chance at all of beating the ID from the Judge.  If we are ready w/ the document, I move we have Robin send and call as discussed.

Here's what I'd like to do on this--we'll just take out the word
"interactive" in describing the open season we're proposing to use for
operational capacity.  I think Staff will come back and ask for an
interactive process, but we can address that issue when and if we get to
the next step.  Again, this initial offer is mostly designed to simply
get the process rolling and to flush Staff out on whether they are
serious or not.  We won't start putting meaning into the very broad
concepts in the outline unless Staff comes back with a serious interest
in settling.  Thanks.  df
