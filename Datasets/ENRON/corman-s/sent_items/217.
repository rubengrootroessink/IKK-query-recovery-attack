Sarah,

Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.   At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.  

For example, for calendar year 1997:
Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT & PNR revenues
Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.


Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.

Call me at x37083 if you have questions.
