When I called Ginger's house today to see if she received my INS approval, one of her children answered and said that she is at Chris' house -- so I guess that means Chris has returned.  If your process estimates are in line, our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of November date.  I am very concerned that we will slip to Christmas time travel.

While I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at Ginger or Chris this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in.  After all, your paperwork has been turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.  Since I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to complain about timing.

Shelley,
I'm sure she already thinks I'm difficult. I'm pretty sure the Kaz government 
sets the court date after your dossier is registered  there. So, if our 
paperwork is not there yet, then how can she know that our court date will be 
in the time frame she thinks it is?
The more I try to understand everything she had told me the more confused I 
get sometimes. It's really hard not understanding and being in on everything 
involved in the process.
I don't know if she even knows how long the paper work will take. Chris told 
me, when I sent mine in 5 weeks ago, that the estimate was 2 weeks for 
translation, 2 weeks for the Kaz embassy, 2 weeks to be sent to Kaz and 
registered. As of Monday mine is still in translation.
I really don't know what to do right now. Should we just wait until the first 
of next week and call again and find out the status of everything?
