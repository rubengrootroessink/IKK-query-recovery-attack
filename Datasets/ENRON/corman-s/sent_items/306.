Shelley;
Sorry to hear of all the Enron problems topped off by your bus experience
on Friday. It was obviously a professional who preys on victims every day.
I assume you are going to Kazakhstan on Thursday, probaly arriving in
Almaty late Friday night. I hope your flight goes direct from Frankfurt or
Amsterdam direct to Almaty. It saves a little hassle if you avoid Moscow,
unless you plan to do some touring before going on to Kazakhstan.
I have been to Almaty two times. It is a beautiful city surrounded by snow
capped mountains. If you have a vivid imagination you can see China just
across the mountains.
You can contact the following folks who can help you if you get stuck. Elza
Utegenova spent a semester with us last year. She teaches at The Kazak
State Agrarian University. She speaks excellent English and is a wonderful
person. She does not have a car or telephone. She could help arrange city
travel. You should make arrangements before you depart, unless you are
taking a lap-top with you.
You could also contact Daulet Chunkunov, country director for WINROCK
INTERNATIONAL in Kazakhstan. He has been to Pennsylvania
and we have visited with him on both of our trips to Almaty. He speaks good
English, has a car, email, and telephones. His email is
dc@winrock.lorton.com. Cell phone 8 333 210 8320. Other phone 3272
63-05-56. Fax(3272)63-15-55.
I am completing this after talking with you by telephone.
Good luck and keep in touch,
Lou
