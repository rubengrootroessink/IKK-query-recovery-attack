With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:

1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.

2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well....
