She has absolutely everything.  A gift isn't necessary.  I'm working on family pictures for her -- so a recent one of you guys would be great.  And, if you want she could use a photo album or scrapbook for her story.

Call me anytime for info.  I'll let you know the next time I'll be in DC and you are always welcome to hop on down to Houston for a weekend.  Tracey is coming next weekend.  We'll be in State College around July 4.

Keep me posted!
