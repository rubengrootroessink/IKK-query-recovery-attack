Caroline - I think you captured the right projects, but please look at the bottom line on total reductions.  You show $3 Million in savings.  I think that the schedule should reflect over $6 million of reductions from the original cap. budget.

In my mind there is still a question on whether the meter bounce and PNR projects should be included.
