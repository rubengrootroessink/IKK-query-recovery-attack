Hi Cindy,

I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance.

For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb.  (unsual bonus time).  Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead.  I can't seem to get back into the system to change this.   ????
