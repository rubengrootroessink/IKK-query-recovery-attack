Boy do I have a lot to fill you in on job wise.  Here is the short version.  Yes I have a new job.  But, surprise, it's still at Enron.  I am just swamped and will not have the 2 weeks off I expected so there is definitely no weekday San Marcos trip in my future.

We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church.  The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun.  On the other hand we could just relax pool side.  We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy.  Just let me know your leisure preferences.

Hi. How was your weekend? I hope you had a nice visit with your guests. 

As you can imagine I spent most of the weekend caring for John. He actually
slept quite a bit on Saturday but I thought I should stick around in case he
needed something. Yesterday, he started to get a little more mobile but it
is going to be a while before he is "back on his feet." He did go to work
today and starts physical therapy today as well.

I hope to see you all sometime soon. What are your plans for Easter?
