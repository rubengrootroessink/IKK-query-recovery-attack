Thanks!

Saturday was great.  Yesterday was not a banner day for me.  I just kept having feelings of remorse and then guilt that I was feeling remorse.  You're probably the only person that can understand how I'm feeling.  Talk to you tonight.  If you and Chad are gone to Karate before we get home -- we'll go to the store and have dinner ready.

Q,

I've confirmed that all four of us are covered under the TSF health plan as
of 1/1/02.  Furthermore, inoculations are covered 100%, so you should only
pay the $10.00 co-pay.

Love Kim
