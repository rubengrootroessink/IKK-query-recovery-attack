Brian & I have been in contact with you for quite some time and we would
like to express our sincere concern for you.

In light of all the recent events that have taken place, we want to let you
know that we are available at all times to answer any questions, or to be a

however, please feel free to use my personal pager (281.270.4901) 24 hours a

Lastly, we would like to send a packet of information to you that I am
