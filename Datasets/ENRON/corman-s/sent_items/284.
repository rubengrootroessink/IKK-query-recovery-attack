I know that we are all under a lot of stress and I probably shouldn't send this note, but I just have to get this off my chest.  Have I done something to undermine your faith in me?  

- When I worked on due diligence matters, you asked me why was I working on due diligence
- When I prepared the demand letters you asked me why I was sending the demand letters
- And, today, despite the fact that we oversee the  day to day transactions, there is no mention of my group in the customer letter.

I wish someone would just fire me if I'm incompetent, because I live in a hell worse than being fired -- at least I'd have time for my family.
