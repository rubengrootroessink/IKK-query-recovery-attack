Let me point out, this is NOT sucking up.  

However, congratulations on your new endeavor.

I know it's too early to consider, but in the future, if you decide there is a position available in your new group, please consider me.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not unhappy where I am, just seeking opportunities to expand.

I bring 28 years experience in a variety of areas both in TW and NNG including Contracts, Scheduling, and Gas Control.

Again congratulations and good luck.



Dennis
