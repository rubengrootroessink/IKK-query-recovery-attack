Would you guys be amenable to signing up the boys for Nature Explorer Camp July 29-Aug 2.  The Audubon lady said that I can sign Chad up with the 7-8's if he's going to be with a 7-year old buddy.

Summer Schedule
I'm not planning any camps for Chad the week of June 3 because of Swim Team (really busy first week of June).  

June 10-14 is Grace VBS

We'll be on vacation week of July 1-7

Ashford VBS July 22-26

Hopefully Nature Explorer Camp week July 29 - Aug 2.


I'd like to sign him up Biron's or some other camp 1 or more weeks (either):
June 24-28
July 8-12
July 15-19
