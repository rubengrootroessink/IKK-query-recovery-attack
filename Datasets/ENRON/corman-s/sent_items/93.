Shelley,
 
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is probably going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.
 
Sorry for the delay. 
 
Suzanne

Dear Suzanne, 
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please 
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite 
102, 
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in 
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital 
section. 
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned 
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is 
the 
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to 
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is 
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that 
"the 
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would 
be 
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian 
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a 
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan. 
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any 
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to 
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a 
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends 
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything 
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me. 
Chris
