Attached is a draft of FGT's proposed response to the Commission's request for data with regard to FGT's posting of changes to (1) List of Names and Addresses of Marketing Affiliates and (2) List of Shared Facilities due to the sale of HPL.  This draft has had input from Dot, Shelley and Joe.  Please review and provide comments.

Also attached is a copy of our revised posting.  We should go ahead and post it today, if it is ok with everyone.

Finally, attached is a copy of proposed procedures to make sure there is communication when we to start to share facilities or when we cease sharing.
