It's been canceled.  There were no unauthorized withdrawals.  It very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home, but I didn't want to take any chances.  It's inactivated & I'll have to go to the local branch if I want a new ATM card with non-debit features.  The automated service only offers replacement cards with debit features.

Q,

We may end early today (about 1:00 or 2:00).  I can address it then.  When
did you lose it?  Thank God it is not a Debit Card.
