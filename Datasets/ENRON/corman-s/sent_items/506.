Yes I can either meet you at noon or at 3 PM take your pick.  I have to take the Kid's to a b-day party from 1:30-3PM -- Kim can watch them afterwards.

I'd like to go to Neiman Marcus last call.

Subject: Coffee Time Tomorrow?


Hi! I hope your week has gone well. I'm checking in to see if you have time
tomorrow afternoon to meet for coffee or to otherwise get together. John and
I are doing some yardwork in the morning and he and Miss B will go to his
hockey game in the afternoon -- thus I'llb be free then.

Take care, C
