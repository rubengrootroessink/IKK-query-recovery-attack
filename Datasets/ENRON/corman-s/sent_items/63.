Okay sounds like we are the first Taraz group and the Almaty group is before us.  That is the group that she said is not traveling until Nov. 15.  Sergei is the guide to both the Almaty group and to us.    

I am so much praying that we will be home before Dec. 15. On that date my nanny returns to Bolivia for Christmas and I will be lacking childcare for Chad at home.  Wow this waiting is stressful.

Based on current est. travel times, I think that we will both travel over.  Kim will probably be the one to stay the two weeks, so that I can come home to tend to Chad & his obligations.   We definitely don't want to leave Alina to come with an escort.  But, the issue we still need to work through is the fact that Alina is still scared o Kim.

Ginger,
I was able to get Ginger on her cell phone. She said, that we were the first 
to go in, that the other group was a different region, and that they had to 
go in order and that their paper work was in before ours. She said she was 
not sure what Chris had told me, but would get with her about it when she 
gets back. I do NOT like it all, but will try to give them the benefit of the 
doubt that this is the best that can be done.

I also asked about the 2 weeks prior to court date, and the 2 weeks after 
court date, and she said as of now only the 2 weeks prior is being waived, 
but that Sergei is still working on it and will not have the answer until he 
has our court date and papers.
I also asked (again) about only 1 parent travelling and she said that to her 
knowledge there has been no law change to allow that, and I asked (again) 
what about a waiver or something and she did say they have been asking that 
question of Kazakhstan but no answer yet.

There is the option of having your child escorted back by future family, 
Ginger didn't think I would want to do that, and she is right, but I guess it 
is an option.

Well, at least we for sure will be able to do the conference.
