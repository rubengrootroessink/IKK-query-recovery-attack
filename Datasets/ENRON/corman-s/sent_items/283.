Both Kim's parents & my mom will be at the house on Christmas eve/Christmas day -- so I think they'll eat their Christmas meal at our house.  I'm sure that Kim, Chad, Mom and Nevin would appreciate a Christmas evening dessert invite.  You can coordinate when you see them for Mexican food on Sat. night.

Have fun at the violin concert.

Hi. Just checking into see how you are doing. As you know, other than
putting up lights and wrapping gifts, I am here to assist (shopping, baking,
card playing, Lego building, dog or cat sitting, Mother entertainment). Do
you think your clan would like to come over for Christmas dinner or at least
in the evening for some dessert? ( I realize you are probably not focused on
food now, but...)
I ordered the phrase book and John, Brianna, and I will start studying.
Tonight, we are going to Miss B's Christmas violin concert!

Take care,
CJB
