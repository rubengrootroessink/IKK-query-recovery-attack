Thanks.  Yes, I forgot to mention how sad I was to learn about Cuba.

SHelley: I feel AWFULLLL!!! What can I do? YOu are just about the best friend I have ever had in my whole life and I feel like I am absolutely falling short on supporting you right now. I am sorry about the wallet snatching - that is incredible --- How in the world could those charges  have occurred so quickly since it is the holidays, I would think that the cashiers are being extra careful. Anyway... I am glad that you are going on the trip; My mom and dad said that they are going to pray for you every day (they go to Mass now everyday at St. Joseph's Villa in Philly) - same with my sisters -- they have all been asking about you. Lunch really was great and was definitely needed by me! I am also sure by now you have heard the news about Cuba --- I am so sad about his passing - my understanding was that the chemo was working on his cancer (which had recurred from last year) but when he was supposed to be discharged, he came ! down with pneumonia and died shortly after. 

I will keep in touch with you via email and if there is ANYTHING I can do --- even wiring funds if you need it while you are travelling, let me know... 

Take care, 

Rosemary
