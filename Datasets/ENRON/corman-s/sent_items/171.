Below is the 2001 schedule for the Houston Aeros.  These tickets will be available on a priority basis for customer entertainment .
 
Customer Entertainment
If you have specific plans to entertain a customer, you can reserve the tickets for any upcoming game by e-mailing  me with your game selection, company and customer name.
 
Personal Use
Tickets for personal use will be distributed periodically for games that have not been reserved for business use.  I will  periodically e-mail  a list of  the available games.  These tickets will be distributed on a first come, first serve basis  following the email notice.   Reservations for personal usage will not be accepted in advance of the email notice.
