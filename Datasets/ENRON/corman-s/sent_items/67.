I am feeling pretty blue today with all the Enron stuff.  Finances being what they are -- we need to do some serious soul searching on Royal Oaks.  Can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck.  Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options.  I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses.
