Glad you had fun -- but sorry the Astros didn't do their part!

Shelley I just wanted to thank you for giving us the chance to win a ticket to the Astros playoff game the other day.  I know my name was not drawn, but I still had the opportunity to attend because Christine McEvoy called in sick.  It was my first time at Enron Field and I loved it. 
Thanks again,
Chris Miller
