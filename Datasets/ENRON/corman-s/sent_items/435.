Shelley,

What do you think?

Beez,

Since our telephone conversation concerning the special SPRC meeting, I have
prayed/thought about the topic and have the following opinion.

While I agree that this decision has to be made with the good of the entire
congregation in mind, I would like to say that my family and I feel that our family and the
congregation have benefited from Ernie's practical and humble approach to Christian living.

We have witnessed Ernie handle delicate situations with compassion and
consideration.  We also appreciate Ernie's support during Alina's difficult
transition to our home and at ACEC.  

Ernie may not deliver the most inspiring sermons, may not be as outgoing as prior pastors at
the church, and may not display managerial qualities in dealing with church staff. Certainly these are important considerations, and perhaps the most important considerations for a pastor of a church the size of AUMC. 
But, I just want to make sure I raise up those gifts that I think Ernie has brought to the
church.  Ernie is the type of person that helps to fix a flat tire, helps pack up the folding chairs after
an event, or gives a stranded member a ride home.  In some ways it seems to me that Ernie is more comfortable
leading by quiet example than being a formal leader.  I believe that it has been good for our congregation to
see that a pastor can get his hands dirty in the process of pastoring to his congregation.

Having said this, both Shelley and I realize that we don't have the day to day contact with
Ernie in the church office setting and don't see the managerial issues that have been raised.  Furthermore, we don't
believe we can afford to have AUMC's membership adversely affected if we intend to grow this church to minister to the needs of our growing community.   In summary, Ernie has my family's support if there is any opportunity to work through the concerns that have been raised, but AUMC is our home and whatever is best for AUMC, that is the direction we should take.  I will support the SPRC's decision.
