Yes Thank You -  The Home Study arrived yesterday in the mail and I'm shipping it off to the INS today.
 
I just go back in town last night from a business trip and am anxious to Liz today.

Shelley,
 
Did you get the home study yet?  It should have arrived by now.  
 
Also were you able to email Liz?  I am still looking for her phone number.  I will email it if I find it.
