Do you have any problem with my paper being published in the "Oil & Gas Journal"?

You had previously approved this for publication.  They would like to know by tomorrow.

Here it is again:

Mr. Bryant:

I am reviewing the papers of the recent Congreso in Merida with a view
toward publishing a few in English in Oil & Gas Journal. Is your paper
(OAM-17) available in English for me to review? If so, please follow the
guidelines on the accompanying checklist and forward it to me.

The form mentions author photos and biographies; you may just send the
manuscript materials. If I accept the paper for publication, I'll notify you
so you can gather and send the rest.

Thank you.
