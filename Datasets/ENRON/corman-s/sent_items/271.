Bob,

FYI.  The statements about Transco not honoring EOL contracts doesn't make sense to me.  I don't understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations.

I had a call from Shawn Amaya from Duke Energy who relayed information that Transco was not honoring any EOL contracts to flow.  He asked if we would post a notice if NNG was not going to flow EOL/ENA gas.  I indicated that we are presently doing business as usual with all our customers.
