Alina's Dr. appt is at 10 in the medical center.  We'll have to have her go first at the dentist in case the dentist appointment runs long?

I was planning pasta for dinner.  I am not going to the Bunco game until 7 PM.

Chad should be in a really good mood -- since I put the treasure map in his lunch to find his post Stanford 9 Test present (Battletops) when he gets home.

Q,

I will be ordering pizza tonight, so please don't make other arrangements.

What time is Alina's doctor appointment tomorrow?
