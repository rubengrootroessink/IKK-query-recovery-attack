I have heard back from Danny and he wants us to cancel the event.  Get whatever money back you can & see if we can forgo  any other current payments by postponing the event until next year, rather than canceling.

Shelly,
I am obligated to pay the full $2850 to the Casino company.  I have not actually paid, but per the agreement that is what I would owe.

Alma/Lisa,

I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party.  What will lose?  What have we not paid back?
