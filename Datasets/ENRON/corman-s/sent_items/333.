We found no cross-default provisions in the material contracts.   Moreover, FERC standards of conduct required pipelines to keep contracts, books and records separate from other Enron entities.

Shelley, I am reviewing the TW and NNG Credit Agreements to determine what was triggered by today's activities - one question that my review raised is whether there are any cross-default provisions in the Material Contracts (as defined in the credit agreements).  Dorothy said that you looked at them and might know the answer - any chance??  Thanks, Kim
