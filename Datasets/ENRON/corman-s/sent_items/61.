I signed up for the class today.  I live on the far west side of town (just S. of 1-10) so we'll have to leave around 7:15 AM to make it to class in time on Sat. Nov 3.  

Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.  The good thing about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour drive from Austin.   I'll give you better directions later.

Chad has a soccer game at 9 AM on Nov. 3 -- so they'll be out and about very early.  I can drive to the conference so that your husband can have the car for a day of sightseeing.
