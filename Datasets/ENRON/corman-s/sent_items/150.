Thanks for you voice message.  I have been traveling the last couple days and thought Tim forwarded the memo & invoice on Monday.  In reality, he was on a trip with some Gulf South folks & just returned to the office today.   He sent the attached memo and invoice this morning.  I was a bit off with my timing -- as September accounting close is tomorrow.  Thanks again for your help in resolving this matter.
