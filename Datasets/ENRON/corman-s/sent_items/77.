I am out of town on business tonight.  I saw you called but thought it is probably too late to reply.  Yes I would like to attend the conference and would love to get together while you are in town.  I will give you a call tomorrow night when I get back to town.  I didn't hear from Ginger this week.  I did talk to Connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from Chris Ivins.  Suzanne emailed me that Randi Thompson the head of Kidsave is in Kazakstan right now and will be sending out an email to the Kidsave families.  Regards.  Shelley
