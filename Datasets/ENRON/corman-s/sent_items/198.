Jackie,

Here is the Children's Church newsletter article:

Children's Church Update

A children's worship service is held each Sunday (except for Communion Sundays) during the 11:00 worship service.   Children attend the first part of the regular worship service in the Sanctuary and then proceed to children's church after the children's sermon.  Please tend to your child's personal needs before worship, so our children's church leaders can focus on teaching.

The mission of children's church is to help prepare children (ages 3 years through 3rd grade) to participate in worship.  This Fall the children are learning that our "church backpack" is filled with things that help us worship -- our bibles, hymns, offering, and prayer.  Ask your child about how to make a prayer sandwich!


Thanks
Shelley

P.S.  Please send me your daughter's email when you have a chance.
