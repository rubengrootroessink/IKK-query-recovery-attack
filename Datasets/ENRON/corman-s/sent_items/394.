Did ETS officially make a bid to the bankruptcy court for abandoned equipment?  Any computers or just flat screens?

    Shelley,

         I was shut-out of the click-at-home program before I got a P.C. ordered and was wondering what the status, is on some of the surplus
computer equipment that is still in the building. I am guessing that there is some left of the same quality or better, than that offered in the
program. Maybe you could start a after Chrismas gift sale. Because it was my idea you could give me mine for free  Ha!

                                                                                                                                                   Thanks Ron Spain
