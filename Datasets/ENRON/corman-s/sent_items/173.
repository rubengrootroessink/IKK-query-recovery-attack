Hi,

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  Chad had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight.  I'm taking the day off tomorrow.  Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow?  When is Tom home from school - so he and Chad could play.  Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with Kathleen or the kids anytime this weekend.

Two other items when you get a chance:
-Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets?  I can't recall the date.
-Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at Enron.  I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby.

Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Shelley
