Jo, Kent & Dave,
 
Per our joint meeting in Omaha several weeks ago and subsequent conversations with Jo and others, the morning meeting report has been revised to:
 
- Remove unnecessary line pack and yesterday's plan info.
- Add additional interconnect points
- Add fuel and a system balance computation for the Market, Midcontinent and Permian area
- Improve formatting and readability.
 
Dale will shortly forward a draft of the new report.  Please confirm that it meets with your expectations. We would plan to put this new format in place mid-week next week.
