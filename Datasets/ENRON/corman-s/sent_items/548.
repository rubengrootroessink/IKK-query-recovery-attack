Rita,

I was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co. (366) all year.  Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year.  Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both Enron Operations Services Co & Enron Corp. in 2001?
