Houston, TX 77057
 
Dear Mr. _____________,
 
By prior correspondence dated ______, we notified you that we  you were notified of Ashford United Methodist Church's concern over the proEarlier this year AMaintenance of Houston currently provides janitorial service to Ashford United Methodist Church and Ashford Child Enrichment Center under a month to month contract.   Under this arrangement, Maintenance of Houston provides an on-site janitor.
 
In our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids, we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week.  We explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility.  We also asked Maintenance of Houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures.
 
It has recently come to our attention that Maintenance of Houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that Maintenance of Houston currently has assigned to our facility.  It is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours.
 
Please furnish such employee screening information to us by April 30, 2001.  To the extent Maintenance of Houston is unable to provide documentation for the current individual assigned to our facility or furnish another individual that does have appropriate documentation by April 30, 2001, we are hereby providing notice of our intent to terminate the month to month agreement effective May 31, 2001.
 
 
 
 
Sincerely
 
 
 
Shelley Corman, on behalf of
Ashford United Methodist Trustees
