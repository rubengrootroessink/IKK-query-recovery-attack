Mr. Chad is sick today with a 102 fever.  Kim stayed home this AM, but I have to relieve him and work from home this PM...so I need to reschedule lunch.  I really need to talk to you though.  Could you go for coffee or a quick dinner this evening on your way home assuming John is headed to Kingwood?
