Thanks.  I got your voice message. 

 I'm good with getting together on Tuesday, but I would also like any major formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can walk away from the meeting on Tuesday with the final product.  Otherwise, I'm concerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback & differences in preferences of formatting style.
