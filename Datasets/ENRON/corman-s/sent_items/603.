Shelley:
Thanks for your comments - we got an extra day to work through these so your timing was good.  I have attached the revised business plan that incorporates more formatting changes than anything else.  I will incorporate your changes in the next turnaround along with the Batchelder comments, due tomorrow.  Thanks for your assistance on this.

Kevin

ps - Thanks for lunch yesterday.
