It has been terrific to correspond with Liz & satisfying to help her get info on Oksana from my correspondence with Larisa.  My dossier is with Ginger, hopefully being translated.  I have not yet received my INS approval and I'm scared that I'll anger them if I start calling.

Hi Shelley,
 
I just wanted to check in and see how everything is going.  Did the home study come back from INS yet?  Were you able to get in touch with Liz Gras?  Let me know if there is anything I can do.   I am thinking of you and your family...all of them... here and in Kazakhstan.
