I'm not sure, Alma, but I thought it is Ricki.

Shelley, Alma coordinates the pager activity for most of the people in the group, but yours is not one of them.  Would you like Alma to track down the person at Skytel to return your pager to or would you prefer she just hand it over to Ricki?  We do not want to continue to pay for your pager now that you have a blackberry.

Rick

Fawn Borger was told by Ricki to return Shelley's Pager to me.  Do you have any idea who pays for Shelley's pager?
