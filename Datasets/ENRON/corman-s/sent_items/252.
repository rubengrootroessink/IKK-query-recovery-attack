Hope your holiday was a fantastic one.

My dossier info was not picked up from the embassy last week, so now I'm another week behing in the process.  But, the delay does perhaps give me a chance to take care of my sinus problem.  I've still been feeling cruddy and want to have a specialist look at the sinus polyp.  Can you recommend an ENT?

Looking forward to seeing you soon.
