Dot - 

I think Frazier did understand and was representing my view.  I'd rather that there were no tolerances in the OBA -- only the concept of reasonable balances.   With this point located in the makret area, it is quite possible that we'll be the ones with the swing (especially since we'll have flow control).  

If you prefer a tolerance in  both the termination and tolerance paragraphs I guess that's fine -- since the only remedy in either case is termination of the OBA.  The existing balance (even if over 100,000 cum) will be settled up under the OBA.

	Shelley -- 
	
	Frazier did not seem to understand my changes in the tolerance sections (4c and 4d).  
	So, to clarify:

	On the tolerances, my concern was twofold -- that we only have the 100,000 dth limit in 
	the "termination" paragraph (and not in the tolerance paragraph), and that it was not clear 
	that, even if the cumulative daily imbalances totaled only 5% of the scheduled volumes for 
	the month, the parties would work to keep it below an actual volume of 100,000 dth (or have 
	a right to terminate the agreement if it were over that amount).

	--Dot

Attached is our markup of the Gulfstream OBA with all of the changes we discussed today.
Sharon's goal is to send it out by COB today.
Please provide input to accommodate the schedule.
Thanks.
