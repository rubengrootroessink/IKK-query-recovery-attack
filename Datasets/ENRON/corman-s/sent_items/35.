Shelley, I was going to call you regarding this Partial Day Recall NOPR.  I=
 spoke with Anna Cochrane today, and she said that in terms of INGAA's plan=
s for answering the NOPR, the GISB pipeline group already has mobilized to =
work on INGAA positions (the GISB folks got together on their own, accordin=
g to Anna).  Since this is a GISB issue, can I assume you are in this loop?=
  Also, for Enron we should discuss how to develop comments, between your f=
olks and Joe's group.

Thanks,
Nancy
