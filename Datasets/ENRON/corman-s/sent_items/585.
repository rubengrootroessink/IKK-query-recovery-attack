Florida is great.  We have been on the go all day and its been after business hours when I've gotten back to the house so I didn't get to talk to you.  But I have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week.  And we can send out an email on our staff meeting on Monday.

Disney was great and I've been to 8 baseball games. Today we're going to an Astros practice and then we catch our flight home.

See you Monday
