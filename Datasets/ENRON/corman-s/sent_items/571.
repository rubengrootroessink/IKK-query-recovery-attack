Subject:	NAESB Certificate - Budget Deficit

According to the Certificate changes, which are filed with the state of Delaware, Article VII, Section 1 was deleted in its entirety and replaced.  The replacement language is consistent with the latest copy that I gave you earlier today.

In this same filing, a change was made to Article V, Section 6.  It states that the determination of how to fund a budget deficit will be made via a super majority vote of the Board.  The language is:

Section 6. A vote of at least seventy-five percent (75%) from the Board, including an
affirmative vote of at least forty percent (40%) from the Directors representing each Segment
within each Quadrant, shall be required to determine how to fund a budget deficit or to
establish or modify a promotional dues program.

The filing is dated August 3, 1998.
