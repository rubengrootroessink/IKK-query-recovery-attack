I was afraid she'd think I was being difficult if I mentioned my displeasure at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe, not to mention my concerns about missing Chad's Christmas events in December and our nanny holiday issue.
My gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to Kazakhstan.  Because frankly telling us that we can travel 10 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasn't been turned in sufficient time.

Shelley,
No, she didn't, and I was too upset about the late November time frame to 
ask. I was thinking about emailing her and asking her when the documents 
would be sent and about how long before we have a court date. I didn't even 
confirm that the 15th was a set date for the other group, but I assume it is. 
If we leave a week or so after them, that puts us leaving right at 
Thanksgiving, which means higher airfare etc...
Should one of us email her or call her and ask?
