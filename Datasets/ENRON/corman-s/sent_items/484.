I am looking for a way to assist a co-worker that is under stress with a wife with health problems, a baby and two other children at home.  I am interested in getting details about how I might pre-pay for a two-week personal chef service.  

Could you give me a quote on two-week service to this family located in the Copperfield area? 
Could the gift recipient select the menu items?
