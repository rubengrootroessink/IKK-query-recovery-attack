We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers.  The kids were pretty wild.  It wasn't one of our better days.  Oh well!
 
If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?
 
Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there).

Hi Shelley: 
I hope all went well on Sunday.  One thing I forgot was to ask you or Elizabeth to take a count of children/adults attending Children's Church and get it to Jackie in the office.  If you want to email the info to me, I will be happy to call Jackie.   
Take care, 
Barbara 
P.S.  Will you be there next Sunday to handle music?
