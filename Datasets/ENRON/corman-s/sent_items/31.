Just got home from work ... but that is funny, cause I'm still working -- now at home.  Guess you've probably heard about events at my company.
 
If you couldn't see the red -- the editorial notes were also in parentheticals
 
You dickens -- you were only supposed to get Chad 1 item from the list.  Then I pass it on to Tracey, Pat, Arliene etc.

Didn't see an editorial notes in red but I did really enjoy the article.  
Thanks for sending it to me. 

I'll send you this e-mail but I may talk with you tonight.  I'll try in a 
while. 

We went to Sam's Club tonight and later, we went to the Mall to look for 
"Chad stuff."  Got the Backyard Football Game...hope I got the right one.  It 
says "Back-yard Football 2002 NFL.  Win/Mac CD-ROM ...was $19.99.  Also found 
a Harry Potter item at B. Dalton bookstore.  Not sure if this is one of the 
things on the list.  I bought the Harry Potter Trading Card Game (Two-Player 
Starter Set)..it was $12.00.  The Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows) 
comes out 11/16.  I'll get it when it comes out.  But, tell me if the other 
items are O.K. 

Love, 
Mom
