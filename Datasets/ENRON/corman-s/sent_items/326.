Just got off the phone with the hotel.  If we postpone the event the cancellation fee still applies and fee cannot be used toward future events.  The cancellation fee consists of anticipated revenue, however, the hotel has agreed to gives us a 20% discount.

Anticipated Revenue:
		 Food:		$1,055.00
		 Drinks:	   $800.00
				$1,855.00

$1,855.00 with 20% Off =  $1,484.00
				 296.80   (20% service charge)
			          	 146.92   (8.25% Sales Tax)
                           $1,927.72

Please call.  I'm confused about the hotel amount.

Alma - we will hand out the prizes in a raffle on the date of our holiday luncheon on Dec. 11.

Alma/Lisa,

I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party.  What will lose?  What have we not paid back?
