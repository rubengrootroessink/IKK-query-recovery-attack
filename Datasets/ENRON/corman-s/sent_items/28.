Kevin/Rod - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.  The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PG&E for transportation.  This is because PG&E released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PG&E was due a credit.  This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties.
