Mike -
I'll be out at the Ops. conference until 9 AM.  Could you please coordinate the meeting time at the Enron building with Jude/Bill.  Ricki I'm assuming that you have set our travel to ballpark.
 
Also, I want to make sure that we make the trip worth their while.  Mike - Can we quickly pull together dinner/happy hour plans (casual) downtown after the game (perhaps Ricki could reserve a spot for 10 at the old Irma's over by the ballpark) where Dannis, Steve, Jack, Rachel, schedulers, etc. meet us.  I need to leave downtown by 7 PM for a meeting this evening and I want to make sure that we have entertainment reinforcements.
