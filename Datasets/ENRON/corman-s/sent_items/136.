Hey all,

Can I get a copy of the settlement bullets sent to FERC staff and indicated shippers.  Lynn, Darrell, Brad & I are working on ideas on how we could revised current posting and customer point/path/segment look-up capabilities and are interested in learning whether our revised capacity procedures are any more specific than in the earlier draft we looked at.
