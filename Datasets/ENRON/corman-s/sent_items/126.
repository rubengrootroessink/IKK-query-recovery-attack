Danny,
 
Thanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.  On Monday afternoon I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.  It turned out great.  Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winners turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.  I also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.  Yesterday Brad took Jodie Floyd, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and Lanny Cramer.  Today Dannis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and Steve Chambers are going to the game.  It was a great morale builder.  Thanks.  We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).
 
Today, Bill Murphy of FPL and Jude Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town to go to the game with Mike Bryant and I.  I'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game.  Perhaps at Irma's where hopefully Jack and Rachel will join us.  I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by.
 
Early this AM I'll be out speaking at Phil's Ops conference.
 
I'm going to call Julie to get on your calendar to brief you on some key logistics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangements.
