Barbara,

Received your message.  I can't promise that I will attend, as things are pretty much ad hoc at my household at this time while I try to establish some new routines.  I'll try.

See you Sunday.

Subject: Children's Ministry Meeting on Monday, 1/14


Hi Everyone:
It has been a crazy first week back after the holidays, and I failed to get a 
meeting notice sent out.  Nonetheless, we will have our last meeting of the 
2001 Children's Ministry Team on Monday, January 14, at 7:30 in the 
Fellowship Hall.  This will be an informal hour-long meeting at which we will 
celebrate and review the past year as well as share dreams for the future.  
We also will have something good to eat, i.e. a low-fat (maybe) dessert!  I 
hope everyone will be able to make it.  
Happy New Year!
Barbara Thompson

P.S.  Please reply to let me know you received this message, and I would 
appreciate knowing that you are planning to attend.  Thanks!
