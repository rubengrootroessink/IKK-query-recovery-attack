I didn't get much of a chance to talk with you on Sunday.  Hope you had a
great Thanksgiving - and got some rest.

Did you get my e-mail with the inside of the program?  Will you be able to
print them up?  If not, just let me know and I can get them done.  Since we
didn't take pictures or get pictures drawn, we could just put "The Case of
the Missing Christmas" on the front wiht a magnifying glass and a manger
scene.

Also, I have found 3 of the angel costumes that we used last year and we'll
have to use something else for the 4th.  I'm making new halos that the
girls can keep if they want to.
