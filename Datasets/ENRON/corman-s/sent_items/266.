Fran,

I need to straighten out a few personal payroll matters before I leave town on Thursday.  I was able to revise my bank deposit instructions on ERonline (my wallet was stolen over the weekend and I had to change bank accounts).  I was also able to adjust my EFCU deductions.

I am unable to complete the following changes online and I'm hoping that you can help me work these issues:
- Stop PAC contributions
- Stop Savings Bond automatic purchases
- Stop 2002 United Way deduct.  I had selected to make one time contribution in Feb (around bonus time).  My plans are to stop the automatic deduct and have the United Way bill me directly instead.

Thanks in advance for your help.
