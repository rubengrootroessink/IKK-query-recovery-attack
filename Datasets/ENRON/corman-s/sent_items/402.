I forgot to send the address list before we left for Austin.  I'll give it to you tomorrow.

Alina, Chad and I will meet you and Miss B tomorrow at 1:30 at T and C Starbucks.  Then we can go to Zainy Brainy.  How long can you guys shop?  I have some gift certificates for Ann T, Gap and Gymboree.

What is the shower at Patsy's for? When do you have to be there?

Kim has to travel to Indonesia on business Feb 8 to Feb 19.
