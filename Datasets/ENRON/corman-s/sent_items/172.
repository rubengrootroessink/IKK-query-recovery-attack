Yes, I'm taking off tomorrow.  Wish you could too.  I'm planning on taking Chad to the Zoo.

That will work for me.  I assume you will be taking tomorrow off.  Good for
you.  I love you.

Hi Cyndi,

Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for
dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends
at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How
does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound? 

 Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take
Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her --
as I have given her the day off tomorrow.
