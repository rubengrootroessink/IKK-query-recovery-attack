Upon repressurizing the Station 13 yard piping it was discovered that the new side valve installed has a leak.  We have instructed the team to go ahead and try to resolve/fix this problem now.  The market continues to underburn and we will have no problems today making all deliveries while they continue to work at station 13.

The bad news is that if they can not resolve this valve problem today, then there is a strong possibility that we will have to do this outage again.

Gary Smith asked me to come by his office before noon.  I am in gas control now -- I stopped by your office with Connor.

The Phase V team has completed their work at Station 13.  Currently the operations crew at Station 13 is purging and packing the 30" mainline at Station 13 to the first valve section.  They are about one hour from completion.  We will return our mailine valves and horsepower to normal operating status when they are done.

The market only took a 1375 on the 1550 schedule; thus, we were able to keep the market well packed up, and we are in great position for making all deliveries again today.

FP&L only took 700 yesterday and they only want to target 720 today.  They have 783 scheduled today.  They had orginally nominated 850+ with the anticipation that they might lose some gas this weekend.  I think they are happy so far this weekend with our flexibility afforded to them.

I will email you when the line is completely turned back to us at Station 13.

If you are church, please do not respond to this email -- I would not want responisiblity for causing you to stumble into 
the sin of not listening to the sermon.
