	Shelley, we have been working with a number of Business and IT managers with the termination of IT Consultants.  In some cases, major IT projects have been cancelled and consultants have been eliminated.  There is one project at ETS, the rewrite of the contracts system, that was being staffed by some outside IT consultants ( Valtech).  Has that project been put on hold or discontinued?  If it has and the consultants are no longer here, GSS needs to be in the loop to send termination letters to the supplier.  There is specific termination language in the Master Services Agreements that we manage.  

	Please let me know the status to the project or direct me to the person who can help me.


	Thanks
