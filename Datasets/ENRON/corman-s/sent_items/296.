Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some 
steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  

1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities
	- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.
	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.

	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South
	hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard
	will be checking everyones card prior to entry. 

	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and
	IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.

	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation
	Center (EB42C1). 

2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone 
	
	We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared 
	to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS. 
	
On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics
business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, 
and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to
support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured
for approximately two weeks, depending on events.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary
