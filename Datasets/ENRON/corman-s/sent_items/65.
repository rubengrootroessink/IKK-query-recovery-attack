Liz,

I spoke with Ginger today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in the mail.  She said she is really busy because Chris is on vacation.  She reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Almaty before us.  They are not traveling until Nov. 15.  We will be after that -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.   

This journey is certainly full of ups and downs.  I was thrilled to receive INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November or early December.  

I was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group.  What do you think?  Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for Oksana.
