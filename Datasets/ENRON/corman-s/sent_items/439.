I copied the children's church materials yesterday and will have Gaby drop them off at church tomorrow.

We agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting.

Would you please check to see that VBS is penciled in July 22-26 on the church calendar.

Thank you
Shelley (making good use of my jury duty time)
