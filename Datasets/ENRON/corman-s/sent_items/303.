I know you were being nice and I am sorry.

I really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.  It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.  

I shouldn't have been so mean to you.  I know you were being nice.  I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times -- I just need some space when I'm getting ready in the morning.  

The heat and the fact that I couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge.

My physical was ok.  Listen to this, because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics.  So then, I couldn't get my travel vaccines, until I find out whether I have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics. 

Am I just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life?

Q,

I'm sorry about this morning.  I really was trying to be nice by making some
coffee and turning up the heat so it would be easier for you to get out of
bed.  How was your physical?  Did they give you an antibiotic?  Let me know.

Love Kim
