Shelley,
 
For the guardianship...can you pick someone but not have it notarized?  It does not have to be an agreement that is signed between the two of you (ignore what I wrote on the list I gave you).  It is just to make clear that you guys have thought about this and have a plan just in case.  You can officially do something later.  For now ie.  "we plan to use either ____ or _____ if something happens..."
 
Also, be sure and request a packet from Ginger.  The other family, Gras, that I am working with has this.  There are forms for the medical, etc.  
 
Apparently, Ginger wants two things.  There needs to be a Texas approved homestudy and then a shorten version that is under 5 pages to send to Kaz.   Ms. Gras was telling me this over the phone today and is going to send me the requirements.  
 
Hope you were not too tired today.
