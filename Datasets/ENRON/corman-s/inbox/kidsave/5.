Shelly,

The guardianship is not a Texas requirement that I am aware of so if Across
the World does not need it, then lets not worry about it.  Please do use AtW
forms, just make me a copy.  Let me look back at the requirements for the
letter regarding Chad.

I am going to forward on a post from a coordinator who saw the Austin kids
at JFK.  She has pictures of one of the Austin kids so she may have a
picture of your daughter.  She can probably tell you how she was doing at
that point.  Just email her and ask her.

Suzanne

Suzanne,

I received the Across the World adoption package.   Most of the info
that you asked for our your homestudy document checklist is also
required for the dossier.  I am assuming that if I use the Across the
World employment letters, income verification and medical screening
forms that these will be okay for you too.

The dossier does not ask for a letter from Chad's dr. -- so I don't have
a form for this one.  Is it sufficient to have a letter on the Dr's
letterhead that states that he is in good health and free of
communicable disease?

Also -- the dossier does not ask for a guardianship form.  Is that a Tx
requirement?  Do you have a sample?
