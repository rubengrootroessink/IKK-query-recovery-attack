Steve and I have been asked whether we will be signing the documents that you previously signed or whether they should continue to go you.  If the officer status is not required for TPA's, Electronic Information Access, Transportation Contracts etc, we'd be happy to pick up the responsibility.   

Let us know which direction you'd like to go and we will inform the group.
