The first week in April has been set up for the headquarters part of this year's inspection.  The OPS inspector would like to come to Houston to review the gas control and scada facilities and engineering records handling.  He expects to travel on Tuesday and spend Wednesday and Thursday here at Enron Central.   I'll get a copy of the inspection checklist off the web and attempt to highlight the headquarters questions that will be the focus of the visit.  If anyone has already done this task, let me know.
