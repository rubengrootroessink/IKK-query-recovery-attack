In reference to our conversation the following are the customers that must prepay prior to the month of service

Frito - Lay $ 10, 370.43 received 12/26/01 for January transportation

Multi Fuels $ 5,329.92 received 12/24/01 for January transportation

The following are customers that due to their internal funding procedures pay early. Example the payment received in early January is for the January demand that will be invoiced the first of February. Also, the following customers have posted Letters of Credit to secure their creditworthiness.

Orange CoGen
Polk Power

The following customer has satisfied the creditworthiness requirements and is no longer required to prepay.

Total Gas and Electric.
