Lunch w be provided

Alan Smith, CFO of Common Vision, a software company, and 2-3 others from his firm will be here to informally discuss
what software/other tools we use to make business/operating decisions. They have developed decision making software in the
electric power arena, and are contemplating expanding into gas.  

Alan is a friend of mine (yes I do have one!), and this meeting is strictly informational...no business obligations intended by any parties.
