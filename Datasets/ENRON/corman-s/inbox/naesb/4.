Dear NAESB Board Members:

During the FERC meeting on December 19, the Commissioners addressed the 
creation of a standards organization within the context of its standardized 
market design effort and issued an order providing guidance on the formation 
of a standards development organization for the wholesale electric industry.  

FERC noted in the order that they expect a single, industry wide organization 
by March 15.  If the industry fails to reach a consensus on its own, the 
Commission will either choose or set up one itself; or institute proceedings 
to accomplish that.

There was specific reference to the confidence that the FERC has in GISB and 
its process -- including voting and the relationship with the FERC when 
policy disputes arise.  Further noted was the recommendation that the 
wholesale electric standards setters should ensure similar consensus building 
processes.  Coordination with reliability, retail electric and natural gas 
standards setting and wholesale natural gas standards setting activities is a 
necessity.

The order providing guidance is attached.

Best Regards,  Rae
