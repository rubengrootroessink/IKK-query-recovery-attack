Dear Industry Participant, 

The email message sent to you earlier this afternoon from the NAESB Office 
incorrectly noted that the NAESB Board of Directors was Friday, March 8 (see 
below original message).  The meeting date is Thursday, March 7.  We 
apologize for any confusion this error may have caused.  

Best regards, NAESB Office
