I spoke with Rae McQuade about the type of vote that will be taken on the quadrant procedures.  She had noticed the same inconsistency that I mentioned during the pre-Board call.  She believes that all voting on quadrant procedures should be super majority because they are part of the bylaws.  Rae has discussed with Jay Costan and he is in agreement.  Today's Board vote will be a super majority.

Section 18.1 of the bylaws states that quadrant procedures can be amended by majority vote of the Directors representing that quadrant.  Rae and Jay believe this is a mistake and needs to be changed.  There will be other items in the bylaws that need to be corrected.  Jay is keeping a list of inconsistencies / errors that are discovered.  If we find errors, we should send them to Rae to be added to the list.  She suggested the new Parliamentary Committee address the list -- possibly after NAESB has been up and running for one year.

Thanks,
