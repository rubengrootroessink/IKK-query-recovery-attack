Shelley,

You should receive the Board book in the next 2 - 3 days.  It will be mailed directly to you.

The NAESB office has not yet set up the conference call.  When available, they'll send the phone number and passcode to me.  I'll forward to you.

I'll watch for any additional Board meeting materials and make sure you receive a copy.

Theresa
