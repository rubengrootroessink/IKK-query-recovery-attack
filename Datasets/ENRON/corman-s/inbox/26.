Shelley, I have been looking throught Galen's numbers for July 01 and I have found four cash out payments with quantities totaling 1,457,146 mmbtus.  These were payments to Dynegy and Texaco Natural Gas.  I am running the invoice log to see if it will tell me what kind of payments these were -- I suspect these are for ParkNRide and maybe OBA cash outs in the supply area. 

Shown below (and also attached) is a spreadsheet to reconcile the July 01 numbers.   Galen, I think we will need for you to go back through the numbers you provided for each month and exclude any quantities that have to do with PNR and with supply area OBA cash in/out payments.   

I will still need to reconcile the original market area imbalance numbers that I provided earlier with any PPAs and other adjustments that are included in the Balance Before Bookout imbalance quantities for each month.  My original list of market area imbalance quantities did not include any PPAs.  Thx, Jim   

July 01 Imbalance Quantities vs Cash In/Out Summary Quantities										
										
Dkts										
(210,403)	Net DPOA imbalance for July 01  (this is the number I originally provided)									
85,349 	PPAs included in the Balance Before Bookout stmts for July 01 (mostly measurement adjmts)									
(125,054)	Net Subtotal Market Area Delivery Imbalances for July 01 including PPAs (from BBB stmts)									
										
12,784 	Net Subtotal No Notice Imbalance for July 01 (from BBB stmts)									
										
44,262 	Net Subtotal Receipt Imbalances (Supply Area) for July 01 (from BBB stmts)									
										
7,535 	Net Subtotal Western Div Delivery Imbalances for July 01 (from BBB stmts)									
										
(60,473)	Net Total - Actual July 01 net imbalance for all imbalance types									
										
										
1,457,146 	Possible PNR and OBA cash out quantities for July 01 pmts to Dynegy and Texaco									
										
1,396,673 	Net of above two quantities									
										
1,390,164 	Net from Galen's Cash In/Out summary for July 01									
										
6,509 	Unreconciled difference (I have not been able to figure out this difference)

Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.
