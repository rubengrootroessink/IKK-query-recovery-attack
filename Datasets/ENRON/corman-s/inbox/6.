Shelley,

By tomorrow morning I am pretty sure I can have the period Aug 2000 through Jul 2001 Cash In/Out reconciled (roughly) with the PNR and the large PPAs accounted for for each month.  

Attached is what I have summarized so far.  Please go to the last worksheet tab called "SummaryCashInOutStats".  I have also finished summarizing within each month the total Cash Out qty and the total Cash In qty and priced each at the appropriate cash in/out price.  Since the imbalance quantities are broken out, the actual cash settlement per customer will vary some from actual as the cash in/out mechanism nets the quantities by customer first before applying a cash in/out rate to that customer.  

Thx, Jim
