Shelly -- Here's the pre-filed rebuttal testimony.  The second file I sent earlier was the transcript of yesterday's hearing.  There was a virus attached to it when Ace Federal sent it over, but our in house people said they were able to extract it out.  Let me try to send it again.  This version was one we were able to open and print without difficulty.  -- Robin
