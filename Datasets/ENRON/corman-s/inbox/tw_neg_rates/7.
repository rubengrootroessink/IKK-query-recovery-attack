TK, I have attached all the completed data responses in the file below to allow you to print a copy for yourself today.  CPUCattmt#20part2.xls. is approximately 470 pages so it needs to be directed to a high speed printer.  The rest of the responses are approximately 1 - 20 pages.  The following are the instructions to unzip the file.

The attached file is a self extracting Winzip file. Please double click on the file icon and follow the instructions to save it to the directory of your choice. After the file is saved, open Explorer to find that directory, select the file and double click on it to execute the unzip program. At this point the program provides a browse function to allow you to select the directory in which to unzip the file. Select the directory and then select unzip. If you have any questions on this process, please contact me at 402-398-7066.

Lindy and Mike, I am sending via overnight United Parcel, paper copies of all the data responses with the exception of IS-28. I think you both currently have copies of it.  If this is not true, please let me know as soon as possible.

Mary Kay, as noted above there will be a paper copy of the data responses in Washington, DC and also the attached file.  We have a departmental copy of the data responses but I have not made a copy for you.  Is this acceptable to you?
