CMS Energy (Bill Grygar and Kim Van Pelt) are asking whether the pipelines want to meet to discuss the NOPR and its affect on pipelines.  And, whether the pipelines want to file comments.  They say they haven't heard anything from INGAA or whether INGAA has plans to discuss or comment.  They've suggested meeting the week of Oct 29.  This notice was sent only to the GISB EC reps.

If INGAA is addressing, we won't want to duplicate their meetings.  Shelley -- have you heard from INGAA?  I've told CMS that we'll get back with them next week.
