Subject:	Status - NNG PD chart processing

Listed below is the status of the different projects that were initiated to improve the processing of NNG PD charts.

1.	Upgrade the delineator's to support integration of 31 day charts plus setup a second delineator. - This work was completed on January 18th.

2.	Implement calculations within PGAS that will provide a flow-weighted daily breakout of index read PD meters.  PGAS was contracted to implement these equations mid December.  They are currently 65% complete with the development.  Estimate development and testing will be completed mid February and implementation into our system before February business close.

3.	Implement express-mail service at the field locations.  Currently working to setup an account with the US post office.  After this account has been setup, the postal service will need about 4 weeks to print labels.  Estimate March as the first month which express mail could be implemented.
