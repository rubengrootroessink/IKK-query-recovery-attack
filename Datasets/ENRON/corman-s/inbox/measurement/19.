Closing the December business is first priority for GMS. Due to just comple=
ting the October PPAs, nothing will be done on the November PPAs until afte=
r the close of December's business. Conceivably, we could have two or three=
 or more months of PPAs to process during any given commodity close, depend=
ing on when the charts are received, and the necessary time allocated for p=
rocessing that does not interfere with the current month's business. As I a=
lso mentioned, we currently have no way to systematically determine which s=
tations that charts have not been received from, and require PPAs. This is =
a labor intensive process to make the determinations and complete the PPA p=
rocess. To my knowledge, the field is still working on a plan to expedite c=
harts to Houston for processing. Until such time that the charts can be rec=
eived for processing prior to close, we will have to continue to process th=
e data twice; closing with the index readings to accommodate the GISB 5th w=
ork day requirements , and again when the charts arrive to accommodate dete=
rmining the daily values. We probably need to look at this entire process, =
starting at the field level,  to completion of the billing process to ensur=
e that the expectations are realistic for all involved, and we are pursuing=
 the best course of action. Additionally, some of the existing timelines an=
d deadlines in the process may need to be changed until physical equipment =
is installed in the field to eliminate the problem. A note of observation: =
no charts for the last half of December, with the exception of the ones tha=
t are over-nighted from Minnegasco, has been received by GMS for the close =
on 1/08/02.=20
Thanks-
Gary
