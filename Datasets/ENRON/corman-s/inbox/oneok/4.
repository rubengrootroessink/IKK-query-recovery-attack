Below is the cumulative imbalance on our books since April 2001 on OBA contract 103135 with ONEOK at the Bushton Plant.  As you can see, NNG owes ONEOK each month with a cumulative payable dollar amount in the amount of $1,118,372.95 through July 2001.  

I also have copies of their most recent PVR Imbalance Statement through July 2001.  It does not acknowledge our August 1st cash out to ONEOK in the amount of $1,143,231.01 for the period of July 1998 through March 2001.
