FYI - Included but hidden are the contracted rates (demand plus commodity) for all firm contracts on the 'Profile' spreadsheet.

Rick,

Attached are two files for your review:
list of all firm contracts with the top 15 separately grouped
profile of all transportation contracts with October 2001 avg price and locations (for firm contracts)


 	 


Let me know if any modifications are necessary.
