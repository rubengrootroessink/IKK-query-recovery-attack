This is the information Nancy is turning in which ties to NNG's approved budget to-date of $6,363,605.  The original numbers that were turned into Dynegy by Tracey showed the original 2002 Plan of $7,032,574.  This was inclusive the following:
	ETS Communications	$  168,168
	NNG Gas Logistics	$6,864,406
			Total	$7,032,574

Worksheet 2 labeled "variance" explains the difference between what they currently have and the new numbers.  Please let me know if you would like to make any adjustments once you review.

 
Thanks,
Donna
