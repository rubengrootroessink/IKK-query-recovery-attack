Here are the updated files with the total throughput for both TW and NNG as well as the TW  EOT Revenues.  

Note that the Burlington contract #25025 under the SJ tab really should belong under the EOT tab.  However, since you already provided the SJ spreadsheets, I went ahead and deleted from the EOT spreadsheet that Jeanette forwarded to me).  Please let me know if you have any problems.
