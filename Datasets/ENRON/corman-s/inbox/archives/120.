Apparently, my BlackBerry message from last evening informing you of me not coming into the office this morning didn't go through... 
 
I scratched my cornea playing basketball on Sunday evening and my eye has been very sore since.  I have an eye doctor's appointment at 11:00.  If he allows me to drive in, I will be in this afternoon.  If not, I will log on from home and do what I can related to our project.
