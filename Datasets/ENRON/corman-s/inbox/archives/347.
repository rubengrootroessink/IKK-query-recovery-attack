Power Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference

March 26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia

 

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.  The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.  The processes of Asset management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset owner.

Ancillary Services Conference

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

 Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment

May 14-17, 2002, Westminster, CO

 

OVERVIEW

 

Managing an electric distribution company, or any part of a distribution company, is a difficult endeavor in today's operating environment.  Customers and regulators demand reliable service.  Stockholders require more return from capital expenditures.  Training and retention of capable employees has become a major concern.   Selection of the investments and expenses that provide the most return is a continuous challenge.  With increasing constraints, and more-demanding performance expectations, distribution managers need new ideas and concepts to lead their companies.

 

"Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment" focuses on solutions to the issues that have made electric distribution such a challenging business.   It covers a full spectrum of topics, from distribution planning, load management services, reliability, customer relationship management, and management of aging assets.   Details from case studies are presented from utilities around the country.  Leaders in the distribution business present both novel and proven concepts, which participants can take home and apply in their business.  Coupled with a pre-conference workshop "Maximizing Performance Under Budget Constraints" and a post-conference workshop "Implementing Reliability-Centered Maintenance to Reduce Costs", the conference gives valuable insights and the edge that participants need to be successful.
