 =09  =09 Spring's just around the corner - time to throw off our coats, sh=
ed our scarves and gloves, and let that happy feeling take over. Something =
truly does come over us, giving us a renewed vigor that puts us in a festiv=
e mood.=09
 =09=20

At this time of year it doesn't take much for some of us to think it's part=
y time! Some of us prefer to be guests, while others prefer to entertain. W=
e label ourselves partygoers or -givers!=20

Recognize yourself? Are you the one who always gives the parties, or the on=
e who loves receiving invitations? If you're the latter, by the time you fe=
el the need to host your own soir?e the former is already having another on=
e! You'll never catch up-these people live to entertain, so enjoy them whil=
e you can!

I have a friend who is a consummate party giver. We were recently invited t=
o a formal affair at her home on the banks of the Hudson River.

She had painstakingly prepared for her annual gala but fell ill just before=
 the guests were to arrive. She was so ill she went upstairs fully dressed,=
 never to return, without having greeted a single guest!

The party had been in the planning for months. The sprawling home was fully=
 decorated. The sit-down dinner for 28 guests was elaborate. Three incredib=
le appetizers, fabulous assorted salads, rack of lamb, and individual choco=
late mousse cakes were to be served.

We all inquired about our hostess's health, but a guest who happened to be =
a doctor checked on her and concluded that, though it was nothing serious, =
she was too ill to come down. Our hostess, however, asked that her door be =
kept ajar so she could hear the laughter from below as she orchestrated the=
 party from her bed!  =09=20

The elegant dinner went off without a hitch and we enjoyed game after game =
of charades with the music playing and the champagne flowing until 4:00 a.m=
.!=20

Elaborate planning is one of the ingredients that make parties and entertai=
ning exciting, but the most casual and impromptu events have remained neare=
st to my heart.

I was about eight years old and lived in a white clapboard house with a pre=
tty green lawn at 1030 Douglas Avenue. One spring day, my best friends and =
I were sitting on the lawn with some cookies when we spotted Buzzy Gerard, =
who lived catty-corner to me.

Buzzy was setting up his lemonade <http://www.domestications.com/product.as=
p?product=3DD370224zz&dept%5Fid=3D16200&parentname=3DTabletop&featurename=
=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML03-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> stand. It was his sprin=
gtime thing. It wouldn't matter much, and I certainly wouldn't be rememberi=
ng this now, except for the fact that Buzzy and I were great competitors. W=
hat began with entertaining my friends that afternoon turned into enterpris=
e.

Now, as we all know, summer is the traditional season for a lemonade stand,=
 and of course it did begin as a summer idea until Buzzy moved his set-up d=
ate from June to May, forcing me in turn to put my little red wagon out in =
April!

Buzzy was quite polished, organized, and more than a little vocal when he s=
aw someone coming. Frankly, the only thing that extended the life of my bus=
iness was my mother's idea to include oatmeal cookies with my watered-down =
lemonade as Buzzy adamantly stuck to his "lemonade-only" policy.

However, this vicious competitor's established reputation and aggressive ap=
proach eventually led to me caving in. I didn't mind that he proved victori=
ous. I decided it was much more fun sitting on the front lawn with the girl=
s, giggling, entertaining ourselves with cookies, lemonade and a front-row =
seat as Buzzy trapped every car, bicycle and occasional pedestrian who ente=
red his "victim zone."

Whether your entertaining is formal with kings, or relaxed with the kids on=
 your street (I imagine it's really somewhere in between), the first step i=
s to send out the invitations. Sending the invitations first will make you =
realize the show must go on!

Keeping your entertaining simple, light and casual is a great way to start.=
 People will be more inclined to return the invitation when they're not so =
intimidated.

Here are a few easy-to-implement party ideas to get you started:

Pick a theme - This will make your selection of invitations, d?cor, and men=
u much easier.
Engage your guests - Specify a dress code that complements your theme (like=
 Chinese New Year!). This will energize your guests before they even arrive=
.
Keep it simple - Select food that you can make ahead so you won't be spendi=
ng the whole party in the kitchen.
Go for ambiance - Candles <http://www.domestications.com/product.asp?produc=
t=3D376200zz&dept%5Fid=3D13450&parentname=3D&featurename=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL=
-030602-AHTML04-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> are inexpensive accessories with an atmosp=
here that goes a long way. Back them <http://www.domestications.com/product=

=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML05-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> or underscore them with mirror=

-030602-AHTML06-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> to reflect the romantic lighting.
Enjoy yourself - Remember to make time to enjoy the party and your guests. =
You can host a party without feeling like a caterer.

Julee's Tips

Tip #1. Short on glasses for a multi-course dinner? Bring out the long-stem=
med glasses a second time. Fill them with sorbet mixed with fruit and toppe=
d with a decadent chocolate sauce! From champagne to dessert, they truly ar=
e multi-purpose!

Tip #2. Spread your hardware around while creating new looks! Use antique d=
resser-drawer pulls for the bathroom vanity. Go shopping without reading th=
e "standard uses" labels! Ignorance can be bliss.


Questions

I love to cook and entertain in our apartment but am not very good at decor=
ating a pretty table. Help!
Have fun with this one. Plan a fun theme based on your meal, cowboy chuck w=
agon, Mexican. When you invite your friends, assign each the task of bringi=
ng one thing with which to decorate the table (i.e., tablecloth <http://www=
.domestications.com/dept.asp?parentname=3DTabletop&dept%5Fid=3D16250&code=
=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML07-macs=3DD2BNEWSA>, placemats <http://www.domesti=
cations.com/product.asp?product=3DJ372584Bzz&dept%5Fid=3D16250&parentname=
=3D&featurename=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML08-macs=3DD2BNEWSA>, chopsti=
cks, florals, confetti, bricks piled up). They will have a good time seeing=
 the end result and the decorating onus is off you!

I'm having a small luncheon to celebrate my daughter's return from culinary=
 school in France. I want it to be pretty, not too rustic, and yet fitting.=
 Any ideas?
Why not go with a champagne theme? Use placemats with elegant gold threads =
running throughout, and top them with pretty layered plates <http://www.dom=
estications.com/dept.asp?dept%5Fid=3D16100&code=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML09-=
macs=3DD2BNEWSA>. For the centerpiece, how about bunches of "gold" grapes o=
verflowing from a cake plate? Think sparkles and bubbles with each step and=
 ingredient. Hang gold tassels from each chair back <http://www.domesticati=
ons.com/parent2.asp?product=3DK349566x&dept%5Fid=3D16250&parentname=3D&feat=
urename=3D&or%5Fsub%5Fparents=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML10-macs=3DD2BN=
EWSA> and wrap each napkin <http://www.domestications.com/parent2.asp?produ=
ct=3DB11126x&dept%5Fid=3D8040&parentname=3D&featurename=3D&or%5Fsub%5Fparen=
ts=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML11-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> with miniature gold r=
opes.

We have a baby on the way but will be moving just a few short months after =
his or her birth. I want to decorate the nursery so the baby feels at home,=
 but don't want to go overboard since the d?cor will only be temporary. Wha=
t do you recommend?
You can invest in linens and window coverings <http://www.domestications.co=
m/dept.asp?parentname=3DHome+D%E9cor&dept%5Fid=3D11100&code=3DDOM-EMAIL-030=
602-AHTML12-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> because you can take them with you? and they g=
o a long way in creating a "look" for the room. Wall art, too, can add a lo=
t of color to a room without painting the walls, especially if you select m=
atting for the framed art <http://domestications.artselect.com/cgi-bin/frSh=
owDepartment?13> in a great accent color. The baby will have lots of toys s=
o why not put them to good use? Hang a high shelf <http://www.domestication=
s.com/parent2.asp?product=3DH376552x&dept%5Fid=3D13550&parentname=3D&featur=
ename=3D&or%5Fsub%5Fparents=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML14-macs=3DD2BNEW=
SA> around the perimeter of the room, about 12 inches from the ceiling, and=
 display all the little stuffed animals, toys, and blocks until junior is o=
ld enough to play with them. Many large hardware stores sell contact wallpa=
per border that can be hung and removed with ease. This is also a great ide=
a for dorm rooms! Best wishes as your family grows!


May you all have a party to attend this spring. If not, throw one of your o=
wn!
