I've asked Emily to set up a meeting on Thur. or Fri. this week to push for=
ward the discussion we started at Stan's half day staff meeting last week o=
n employee allocation to Dynegy.  Please complete, as best you can, the org=
. chart for your groups that Stan originally asked for and bring them to th=
is meeting for discussion by the group (my recollection is that we were all=
 asked to come up with a list of the people we needed to run our groups ass=
uming NNG doesn't come back, along with a budget based on that headcount). =
 The people you don't use for your proposed organizations are the ones that=
 will go to Dynegy under this approach.   At this meeting, we will discuss =
our org. charts and try to come up with a consensus proposal that we'd ask =
Stan to sign off on and that we'd then propose to Dynegy.  I understand tha=
t there are some unresolved issues on how to do this (Phil's question about=
 how many officers his new group should have, for example) but we need to s=
ort it out as best we can and then run it by Stan.  DF
