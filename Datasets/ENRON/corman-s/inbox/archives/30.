Hi Shelley!

Just a note to let you know that I have been looking for work and have applied and interviewed for several positions in gas control.  If you have any other openings available within the pipeline group in scheduling, contracts or accounting, I would appreciate any assistance you can offer. 

As you well know, I have a good work history and would be anxious to hear any input from you.  I really do need a job.

Thanks for your time.
