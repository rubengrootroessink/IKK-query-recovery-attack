Anita / Marc,

I have investigated the procedure for picking up Aeros' tickets at the "Will
Call" window, thinking it would be conveniently located at the Campaq
Center.  Much to my surprise, the Aeros' "Will Call" window is located in
their office at Wilcrest and Richmond.  They have four tickets for the Erbs
and three tickets for the Kudlas.  I drive right by their location on my way
home and I plan to pick up my tickets on Thursday evening.  Would you like
me to pick up your tickets also?  If so, do you want all three?  I remember
Marc saying that Anita was not sure if she would be attending.  I still
don't know if Shelley and Alina are going either, but I think they may.
Also, I was going to offer the four Enron tickets to Terrell Hemphill and
family.  Game time Friday is 7:30.  We may be a little late, but that is no
big deal to me.
