I know money is tight and I'd like to address our attendance at upcoming GISB Board and Executive Committee meetings.  Per the new NAESB Bylaws, our seats, and therefore voting rights, are dependent on attendance.  Below is the information I know thus far.

The NAESB Bylaws include minimum requirements for meeting attendance of Board and EC members.  The requirements are the same for Board and EC reps.  Members must attend, in person, at least 25% of scheduled meetings and must participate in at least 75% of such meetings.  Attendance will be reviewed each March 31 and September 30 for the preceding twelve months.

The 2002 meeting schedule has not been finalized (neither dates nor locations).  In the past, all Board meetings and most EC meetings have been held in Houston.  For NAESB, this will change.  For 2002, none of the Board meetings will be in Houston and possibly none of the EC meetings will be in Houston.  Starting in June the EC meetings will probably move to two-day meetings (as they were in the past) because more than one quadrant may be in attendance.  New standards will be brought before the EC for vote.  New quadrants will probably have a flurry of new standards -- hopefully not to the extent we had at the beginning of GISB.  Below is the meeting schedule as I know it thus far:

BOARD
March 7 --- Washington D.C.
June 28 --- TBD
Sept 18 --- Baltimore, MD
Nov 21 --- TBD

EC
Feb 21 --- FP&L in Palm Beach, Florida
April 18 --- TBD
June 13 --- Boeing in Seattle, WA
Aug 8 --- TBD
Oct 17 --- Phoenix, AZ (tentative)
Dec 12 -- looking for host in New York, NY

The Board still has some transition issues to address, but I think a good deal of the transition has been taken care of.  For a while issues will continue to arise as we move through our processes, such as the one regarding GISB Operating Practices that I mentioned in my last update e-mail.

Activity in the EC slowed almost to a stop due in part to the Order 637 work being done by various subcommittees.  This held up the work on requests.  BPS has only a few requests on their plate.  In January, IR should finalize their work on Order 637 and resume work on their backlog of requests.  ETS has approximately 30 requests submitted to GISB; most are in IR.

One thing to watch for in the EC is standards that spill over into the wholesale gas quadrant from other quadrants.  If a standard is being adopted by another quadrant, EC reps in our quadrant can decide that the standard should apply to our quadrant as well.  The vote needed to have our quadrant address the standard is simple majority, which does not require support by the pipeline segment.  The final adoption of the standard requires a 17/2 vote.

New NAESB procedures may also be raised by other quadrants that affect adoption of standards or the organization as a whole.  These would be addressed by either the Board or the EC, depending on the nature of the procedure.

Thanks,
Theresa
