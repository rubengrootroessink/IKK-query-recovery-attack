Yes.  Of course I'm still here.  I think my NNG friends are spreading the rumor that I'm out of here!  But, I just keep busy with my day to day work and try to put of making any decisions...

Are you still here?  Haven't seen or heard from you in a couple of days.  Hope you weren't upset at me for digging you about the TV
