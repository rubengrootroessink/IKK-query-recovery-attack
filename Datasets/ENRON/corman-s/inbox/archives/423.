An action item coming out of our tour and discussion at the Hangar on Wednesday was for the two of you to discuss what offsite testing activities we need to pursue this year. On the table are the annual Technical Test and the Business Test for the Omaha Offsite, and a Drill
for the new Interim Offsite at the Hangar. We generally start preparation for the Technical Test several months in advance, and it is a fairly significant effort for both the Gas Control and Business systems.

I do feel strongly that we need to complete a Technical Test of the Omaha Offsite. It is important for Business Continuity, but probably more important to insure that we have a stable and fully configured production environment prior to beginning any activities to split out NNG or move out of the Enron Building. 

Let me know how to proceed.

Thanks, Gary
