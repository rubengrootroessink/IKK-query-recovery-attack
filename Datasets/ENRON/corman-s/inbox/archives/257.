Shelley,  There were no penalty invoices issued to Peoples/Teco for the month of January.  The only item that has occurred recently (which really doesn't appear to have been a problem)  Their Jan. reservation invoice was revised and billed with a due date of 2/20 (this is an automatic defualt in TSS & must be overriden).  Thus, they delayed payment until Cynthia followed up when they didn't pay timely.  Otherwise, Cynthia indicates she hasn't had anything significant occur.  Sheila
