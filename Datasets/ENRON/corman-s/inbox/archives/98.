This conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.  The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.  The processes of Asset management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset owner.

Ancillary Services Conference
 
April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado
 
OVERVIEW
 
 
 
As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 
 
 
 
This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.
