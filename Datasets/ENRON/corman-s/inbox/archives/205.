The attached is prepared on a monthly basis and shows the throughput West, East, & El Paso.  What you are requesting is in column Q, Line 58.

Total West thruput for  2001   388,736,743 
Average daily thruput                       1,065

The average daily thruput is calculated as follows:  Total West for the year divided by 365.

Debbie

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Kevin Howard suggested that I contact you regarding some data for the attached slide.  I am looking for average throughput for four pipes in 2001.  Please let me know if you have this information.

Thank you,

Michael
