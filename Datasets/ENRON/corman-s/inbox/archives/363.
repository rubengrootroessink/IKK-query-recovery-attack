Subject:=09RE: Elevator Maintenance

Gary,

Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the go=
vernor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is desi=
gned to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than r=
isk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over tod=
ay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The inter=
com in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explai=
n why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the=
 intercom is repaired.

There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the=
 bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance=
 levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by=
 the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which w=
e previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our s=
taff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequate=
ly staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on=
 site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had=
 over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of proble=
ms just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3=
,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we=
 have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac=
complished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise bui=
ldings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was=
 tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.=20

While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practi=
ce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei=
r functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security o=
r Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall =
them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past =
Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are i=
nterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately=
 this time it was significant.=20

This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need=
 corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time =
it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security cont=
acted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then =
proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried uns=
uccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked=
 Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learne=
d that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler=
 at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Sch=
indler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elev=
ator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin=
dler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted=
 in an extra hour before help arrived.

I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are =
no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent=
rapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele=
vators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if=
 the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for =
these inspections since they have people here at night. =20

I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes=
terday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does=
 not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasi=
onally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not a=
cceptable.

Randy

Randy,

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in=
 an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the interc=
om were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was=
 stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became=
 concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours bef=
ore they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 ho=
urs to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the g=
uards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performe=
d on Saturday, as scheduled. We also were led to believe that the level of =
maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.=20

As you know, the Gas Control Center on EB42 is a 7X24 operation. It goes wi=
thout saying that this type of situation is unacceptable and that a post-mo=
rtem of the event is required to correct any maintenance or operating defic=
iencies that may exist. Please research the event and let us know the root =
cause of the elevator failure, the intercom failure, and any changes in mai=
ntenance and monitoring that may have contributed.=20

Thanks, Gary=20
