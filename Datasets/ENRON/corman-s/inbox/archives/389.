Shelley,

Mid-La schedules all of their gas at the Port Allen point but they may split their takes during the day across Port Hudson, Port Allen, and/or E. Baton Rouge. All 3 points are in the same area and combined under the OBA ofr a net imbalance.

Thanks,  Tim

Tim,

Is the activity at the MidLouisiana points normal.  How did we build up a 156,000 MMBtu balance at Port Hudson.  Is this a measurement or a scheduling mismatch?  How big is this point?
