Just in case I don't see you this p.m., Gina Taylor brought around reporters for the the Los Angeles Times and USA Today for a tour of Gas Control this morning. They were in for an interview with Mr. Cooper. The USA Today had a photograher with her and he took several pictures of Gas Control. Gina thought the article would be in Monday's issues. thanks. sj
