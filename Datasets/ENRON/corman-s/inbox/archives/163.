Hey guys,

	I sent an amendment to Dan McCarty, for signoff by the NNG President. last week (before the memo) and was told that Danny would no longer be signing agreements for NNG; Danny instructed me to send the agreements to Dan Dienstbier.  Well, Dan Dienstbier just told me he can't sign them either.  Who is the interim NNG President/General Manager?  Any suggestions?

Craig
