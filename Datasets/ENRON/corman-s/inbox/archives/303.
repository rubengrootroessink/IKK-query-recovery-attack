	Shelley, have you had a chance to look at the PG&E agreement I gave you?
	We probably need to get an answer back to PG&E pretty soon.  We appreciate
	your help.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,
Have you heard from Shelley on the PG&E contract agreement for access to their nomination system for TW's for off system storage?

Thanks: John Buchanan
