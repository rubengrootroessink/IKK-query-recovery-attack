Suzanne Vann with Corp Development got my name from Gary Fitch and called t=
o discuss our use of the Hangar. Corp Devel is reviewing the benefits and c=
osts of the remaining 2 planes, as well as the Hangar. If they decide to se=
ll the planes, then they will cancel the lease for the Hangar. If they deci=
de to keep 1 plane, it could go either way. If they decide to keep both pla=
nes, the assumption is that they will keep the Hangar. The lease is approx.=
 $180K. I described our use of the Hangar as the Interim Offsite for Gas Lo=
gistic's Business and Gas Control functions and will send her the Visio dra=
wings showing the configuration of the rooms we are using. I also described=
 the T1 network connections between the Hangar and downtown and the Hangar =
and Omaha. She said that our use of the facility would probably be listed a=
s one of the benefits and she assumed there would be some costs to relocate=
 the Interim Offsite if they cancel the lease. Although she didn't offer an=
y hint as to what the decision might be, she said it would be a while befor=
e the decision was made, and she suggested we might want to think about alt=
ernatives just in case. I did tell her that Shelley may want to give her a =
call as well.
