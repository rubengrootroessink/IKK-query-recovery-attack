Subject: Tour & Review of the Gas Logistics' Interim Offsite at the Hangar - Reminder



This is a reminder for the Gas Logistics' Interim Offsite Tour and Review at the hangar tomorrow.  We will be heading out to the hangar around 11 AM for a tour and lunch(Jason's Deli).  Please make arrangements with your team for car pooling.

I will be coming around this afternoon handing out a laminated BCP Process card which includes a map and directions to the hangar.


Thanks,
Bob Hagen
