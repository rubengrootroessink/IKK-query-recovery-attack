Sandy

Please move the attached AR lines items to Enervest - customer #4000002858

These invoices had been billed to Enervest but recorded under ENA's customer number.  In the past, the invoices were paid by ENA; however, the invoices for November and December 2001 will be paid by Enervest.

thanks
