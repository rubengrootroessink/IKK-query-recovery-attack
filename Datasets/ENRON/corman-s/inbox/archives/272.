Please mark your calendars for September 5th and 6th for the NNG Winter Ops Meeting at the Fairmont in Kansas City. Details will follow, of course, as we begin working with you to structure an agenda. Dr. Douglas has agreed to return again. He indicated he was pretty proud of the forecast he gave us last Fall. thanks. sj
