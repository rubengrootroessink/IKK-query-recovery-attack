Jayshree,

Shelley asked me to pass along representative revenue data for a NNG north-end power plant and a south-end power plant.  We chose the Great River Energy/Pleasant Valley #1 Power Plant in Minnesota and the West Texas Utilities/San Angelo Power Plant in Texas.  The total 2001 transportation revenues generated from these power plants are approximately $1,050,000 for Pleasant Valley #1 and $129,000 for San Angelo.  

I have attached two Microsoft Word excel spreadsheets to support the revenues generated from these two examples.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.
