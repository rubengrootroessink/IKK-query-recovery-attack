Thank you very much for your continued use of the Capitol Connection's Internet service that connects you to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meetings live from Washington, D.C.

The Capitol Connection is pleased to announce a new level of enhanced 
Service using Real One?.  It allows you to view meeting agendas while simultaneously viewing the archive of the meeting.  As soon as possible, please visit the following link (<http://www.real.com/>) and follow the directions to download Real One ? (at no charge), it is the latest version of the Real Player.   

Updating to Real One also will allow us to provide better customer service by assuring all our patrons are using the latest technology to view Capitol Connection programming.

In the future, archives of FERC meetings provided by the Capitol Connection will be edited using the meeting's agenda, when available. This will allow you to access a point in the archive where a particular item of interest, as shown on the agenda, is to be addressed.

We always welcome your suggestions for ways to improve our service. Currently, we are researching making the archives searchable and would like your feedback  Would this service be of interest to you and what features or functions would best serve you?
