I've enjoyed my share of Super Smash Bros. Melee <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Q8M0/ref=mk_del_256924_21> since it came out, but it wasn't until I got into a four-player melee with a few other Amazonians one evening that I truly appreciated the brilliance of the game. The fists fly even faster here than in the Dreamcast's revered Power Stone games, and that speed, combined with the unique humor Nintendo lathers throughout this title, had us laughing our heads off while trying to keep up with the riot. 

Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks this game is the GameCube's killer app. As of this writing, Super Smash Bros. Melee is ranked No. 2 in sales among Amazon.com video games, has an average customer rating of five out of five stars, and has more than 290 unique customer reviews. Bottom line: If you have a GameCube, you've got to get this game. If you already own it, pick up some more controllers and share it with your friends--you won't regret it. Game on! --Porter <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-glance/-/ATE2O3KMNTSKJ/ref=mk_del_256924_22>

Sonic Boon
 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/255765/ref=mk_del_255765_232207276> Even if you've spent the last decade with one or more of the Big N's controllers in your hands, you probably still know who Sonic is. However, knowing the character is not the same as knowing the game. We're introducing the Nintendo Nation to the little blue hedgehog by showcasing the first two Sonic games for Game Boy Advance and GameCube, which will respectively acquaint you with both the first and most recent installments of the series. We're also including our selective history of Sonic <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/255765/ref=mk_del_255765_242207276> to fill you in on what happened in between.

by Nintendo 
Adapted from the SNES classic, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005UK88/ref=mk_del_256924_33> boasts all 96 levels from the original--from cheery Yoshi's Island through the sprawling Vanilla Dome to the grueling Star Road--as well as the first game's mix of action and problem solving. Perhaps best of all, you can network up to four GBA units via link cables for multiplayer fun.

Accessory Self-Test
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005UWMC/ref=mk_del_256924_552207276>You need this accessory if... 


Indigo GameCube controller <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QEFM/ref=mk_del_256924_56>: ...you have friends, siblings, neighbors, or someone special in your life. Many GameCube games support up to four players. Don't be a system hog--learn to play well with others.
Memory Card 59 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QEFG/ref=mk_del_256924_57>: ...you do anything other than play video games (such as sleeping or going outside). Without a memory card, you'll either have to re-tread the same ground over and over again (like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U8EM/ref=mk_del_256924_58>) or set your GameCube on pause for days at a time. In either case, this little number will pay for itself in saved electricity and frustration. 
5-inch monitor (indigo) <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005UWMC/ref=mk_del_256924_59>: ...the family TV is occupied with The Sopranos, ER, or some other program. This screen attaches to your GameCube and makes it much more portable. It also includes a cigarette lighter adapter, so you can play in the car (if necessary).
GameCube RF switch/RF modulator <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RL4L/ref=mk_del_256924_60>: ...you're playing on an older TV that doesn't have component (round red, white, and yellow) RCA ports. If you can plug a cable line into that heirloom TV of yours, you can use this product. Of course, you might just want to pick up a new TV <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/172659/ref=mk_del_256924_61> instead. You'd be surprised how good these games look in color.

Feed Your Ears
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RG4O/ref=mk_del_256924_832207276>MP3 players have grown more and more affordable over the past year, and we're featuring two players right now at fantastic prices.
