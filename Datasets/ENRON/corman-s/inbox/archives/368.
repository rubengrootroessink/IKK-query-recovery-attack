Don't know either, but the way the question was asked was very complimentary towards what you add here.  I'll make sure things settle down, at least regarding this issue, here on 40.

I don't know who/what got everything stirred up today.  It is true I have other offers, but none are new -- I've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind.  I'll let you know when I figure it out!
