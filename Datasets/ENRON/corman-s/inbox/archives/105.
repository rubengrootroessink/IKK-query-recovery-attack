Power Plants Outages: 
Real-time Update service and database! 

A Must have for ANY Energy professional!  
  _____  

Dear Shelley Corman 

Energy Argus' Power Plant Outages service now comes complete with real-time updates, sent to you immediately via instant messenger. Now, not only do you get to search and query the Argus site of plants information, including: 

Nuclear units; 
Fossil-fired units; 
New generation; 
Existing capacity; 

You now also get instant updates sent by messenger to you - on the platform of your choice - so can act on the news virtually as it happens. 

Who need this information - and why? 

Analysts and traders need this information: Many of the new proposed plants that were expected to come on line are being cancelled or delayed - meaning that supply will tighten and operating costs will narrow. Each plant outage now has a more severe effect - spiking prices and decreasing supply.

Energy Argus' Power Outages updates give you instant notice of these outages so you can prepare immediately and determine ramifacations on power and fuel prices. 
  
Power industry vendors: Outages mean opportunities - immediate notification means you get your foot in the door first.
