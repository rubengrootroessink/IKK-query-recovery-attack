"Alternating theory with
hands-on investigations of
applications works great."

"Course spurred many ideas,
very good discussions - liked
the small size of the session."

"I liked how you demonstrated
how the different instruments
related to generation, retail
load, etc."

"Excellent examples and
discussions of hedges."

"I thought that the examples
were on target to what
actually occurs."
