Hi! Are you going to get a ticket for the Best Dressed Luncheon?  Do you want to buy a ticket? $500 each.  Rosemary said she would get us good seats!  The luncheon is Tues. April 2.  Would Cindy want to go too?

I just bought a ticket from Rosemary.  It benefits the March of Dimes (and we probably aren't going to have an Enron team this year).  Also, Rosemary said we could sit at Nancy Kinder's table.
