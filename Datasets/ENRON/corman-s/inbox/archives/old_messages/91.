Whether 'tis nobler to face the sunshine and warmth of spring or take shovels to driveways of snow, and by opposing end them...

Dear Domestications Shopper,

"To be or not to be..." though not quite as philosophical a dilemma as Hamlet's, this is the question that will confront the world's greatest prognosticator, Punxsutawney Phil, a.k.a.-the groundhog-as he makes his annual prediction between winter and spring on February 2. 

Regardless of Phil's forecast, spring is already in the air at Domestications. Our newest catalog will be arriving in your mailbox any day. It's filled with great new products like our Down-in-a-Bag set, a down-filled revision on the classic Bed-in-a-Bag(R); Concerto Comforter Set, a woven jacquard comforter set that beautifully combines textures; and our luxurious 100% cotton Sateen Bed-in-a-Bag(R) sets that capture the richness of sateen at an incredible price!

Plus it's also your chance to stock up on bedding basics like mattress pads, bed skirts, featherbeds, down comforters and pillows - ALL at savings of up to 25%!

But you don't have to wait to receive the catalog to take advantage of our Basic Bedding Sale or to take a peek at our new products, just visit Domestications.com and start saving today!
