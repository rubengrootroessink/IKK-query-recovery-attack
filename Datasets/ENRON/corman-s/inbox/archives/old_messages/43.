Received your thank-you letter and appreciate it, especially with the picture.  My prayers are with you and your family.
Just wanted you to know what a great job Alma Carrillo did in planning your shower, ordering the cake and punch, and collecting money for the gift.  I think she deserves a very special thank-you.
See you tomorrow at the staff meeting.
