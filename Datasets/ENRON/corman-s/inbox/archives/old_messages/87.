Shelley,  While I'm out of the office 2/1 thru 2/11, Mike will work directly with the Reps for setting scheduling capacity or any pipeline issues that arise.  TMS issues are addressed though the Hottap Help desk.  Galen has the reservation billing under control and Jim Studebaker will continue with the meetings for defining requirements on FGT's segmentation, EPSQ for ID1 & ID2 cycles and the Gulf Stream market allocation process.  I will have my Blackberry unit with me and should be able to receive emails (except when at the ski resort in Colorado) and pages with no problem.  (Blackberry phone number is 877-550-7985.)  Sheila
