Building Tier Zero Auto Collaboration - Report
W. Daniel Garretson, January 2002
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,13024,00.html

Canada's Collaborative EBPP Future - Report
Ron Shevlin, January 2002
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,14374,FF.html

     Today, Canadian companies and consumers eschew online bill
     presentment. To spur growth, epost and e-route must build a

     the right online partners.

Nastasja Senn, September 2001
