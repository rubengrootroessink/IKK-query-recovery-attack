Friends,
 
David Duff's mother (73 years old) was killed in a car crash this morning at around 9:30 in Denver, CO.  He will be flying out tomorrow and will fly back next Thursday.  He will be out tomorrow and all next week.  
 
David's dad has died previously.  His mother was apparently on the way to pick up one of the grandkids, accidentally ran a red light, and was hit by an SUV.
 
Please remember David and his family as he travels to Denver.
 
Andy Brady
