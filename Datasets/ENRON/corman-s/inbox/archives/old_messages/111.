	NNG - Called SOL Sunday morning for Sunday's Gas day.  The Reps
	called as many customers as they could to let them know.  We had
	the SOL posted on the WEB before 9:00 a.m.  We also did a pop up
	on TMS for any customer logging into the system.

	New TW HOTLINE will be implemented this week.  We are working with
	Kim Watson and TK.

	We did a production migration last night (Sunday).  So far everything is
	OK.  

	TW was quiet this weekend from a scheduling perspective.

	Thanks. Lynn
