	My change would be:
	Negotiated and implemented the EAMR Citizen's Service Agreement providing Citizen's with Gas Control and transaction management services with no addition to staff and generating $100,000 in payments for the service provided by Gas Logistics.

  	I have a question about Elizabeth Brown being promoted to a Coordinator.  Last year there was a big deal made about changing all the Coordinators to Specialists	which upset some of the personnel.  Are we going to start using the job title of Coordinator again or should her title be Sr. Contract Admin Specialist?

Please review and add appropriate information into the attached draft 2001 accomplishments.  I'd like to circulate this document on Monday to fulfill the promise that I made at staff meeting.

FYI - I'm taking a day of vacation tomorrow because my babysitter is unavailable.  I will be around the house most of the day if you need me.  You can also call on my cell or send me an email.
