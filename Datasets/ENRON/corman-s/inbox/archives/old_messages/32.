Shelly 

Thanks for sharing the infomation in the meeting this morning.  I realize these are uncertian times, but now I feel a bit more positive about things.  I am not a meeting person. but in these times it is good to be informed.  If the morning is too difficult for you, maybe you could have the meeting at the 6:00 pm crew change.  Thanks and look forward to working with you with the  challenges that we face.

Thomas
