Shelly:

I have a visitors luncheon on this Sunday but can meet between 1:30 and 
5:00pm if
Sunday would be good for you. I have the Covenant College on Saturday. I can 
meet during the day most times...I can shift my schedule to meet yours 
anytime. I am thankful for your continued work in this ministry!  I am hoping 
we can proceed with our ministry team for children's church as we discussed 
prior to Christmas.  I will meet with you whenever the others can meet. Okay? 
 Thanks!
Patty
