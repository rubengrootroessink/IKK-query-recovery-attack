Steve and Shelley,

Included in our 2002 general plant capital was a $50,000 item to replace UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) A which provides the power for Gas Control on EB42 and also serves Enron Security. Within Gas Control it supports the Gas Control Center, the Computer Room, and the Mux Room. Randy Lord had recommended that we plan on replacing UPS A in 2002 due to it's age and other issues. UPS systems generally cost a good deal more than $50K but we hoped to leverage some of the UPS equipment in the Enron building that would become available. 

For the past 2 months we have been working with Charles Upshaw to determine what existing equipment we could utilize and what the cost would be. For various technical reasons the newer, available UPS systems could not be used to replace UPS A without costly modifications. In the end, a much cleaner, cheaper, and effective approach was to leverage the 50KVA UPS on level EB44 and simply run a new feeder to a new panel on EB42. Option A below describes the recommended approach and the estimated cost. Instead of replacing UPS A, we will simply provide a redundant power supply to the computer room and mux room equipment, continuing to maintain UPS A for as long as it makes sense.
The UPS on Level 44 will also provide conditioned and reliable power to several small areas on level 44. In addition to being very cost effective, this approach gives us redundancy for several single points of failure in the existing system. 

Charles Upshaw, James Sumpter, John Wilhelm, and I recommend proceeding with Option A. Please reply to this note with your approval and/or any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary x33094

Gentlemen,

Here are the options that we have evaluated to date.  The Engineering Cost is a hard price. The Electrical and Acoustical numbers are estimates at this time. Once an option is chosen and the engineering is complete, we will review the drawings for any unexpected  surprises and  communicate changes to you(if any) prior to proceeding. The estimates are based on services being provided during normal business hours only and all payments must be made prior to service being provided. Once Engineering and drawing review is complete, I would anticipate the project to take 2 weeks complete. Please review and contact me if you have questions or require further information.

Option A:

Provide a new 120/208 volt panel board in the data center on the North side of level 42 of the Enron Building.  Provide new feeder from existing 120/208 volt panel on level 44, being served from the existing 40KW/50KVA Powerware UPS system also located on Level 44, to the new 120/208 volt panel board on level 42. Provide (4) quad outlets to be located in the MUX room on level 42 with whips fed from the new 120/208 volt panel in the data center.  Also provide (20) new whips from the new panel to existing equipment located in the data center.

Engineering Cost                      $3,900.00
Electrical                                 18,800.00
Acoustical/Protection/Clean        3,031.00
Total.....................................$25,731.00

Option B:

Relocate existing 40KW/50KVA Powerware UPS system with associated 120/208 volt panel board from level 44 and reinstall in the old UPS room on level 42.  Provide primary feeder from existing 480 volt panel located on level 44 to the new location on of the UPS unit on level 42. Route 120/208 volt feeder from the UPS unit to the newly relocated panel.  Provide (4) whips to the MUX room and (20) new whips from the relocated panel to existing equipment located in the data center.

Engineering Cost                        $6,200.00
Electrical                                   32,500.00
Acoustical/Protection/Clean up     3,031.00
Total.......................................$41,731.00

Option C:

Provide new PDU in the data center on level 42. Disconnect and reuse existing UPS "B" feeder that serves MTS-42-1 to feed new PDU. Provide (4) new whips to MUX room and (20) new whips to existing equipment located in the data center.

Engineering Cost                             $3,900.00
Electrical                                        33,800.00
Acoustical/Protection/ Clean up            909.30
Total............................................$38609.30
