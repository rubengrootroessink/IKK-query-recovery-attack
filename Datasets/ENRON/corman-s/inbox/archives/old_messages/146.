FYI - 
The Dynegy team that visited last Friday will be on site this Thursday AM, to review items from the "NNG Request - Revised".

We do NOT plan on having a group mtg, but they would like to review individual items that are available.So...if you had items available for last Friday's mtg. but they were not discussed please put them in EB43C2. (As previously mentioned I will also send out assignments on the new items Dynegy added to the "NNG Request - Revised".)

To help facilitate data review, Bob Chandler and John Cobb will begin working more closely with Dynegy (Carolyn Stone and Biren Kumar), and they will contact you on an as needed basis.

Thanks for your continued assistance.

Call me if you have any questions.
