The market took very close to the 1550 schedule.

We shifted extra linepack East of Station 13 prior to the scheduled downtime.

In the middle of the night last night it became apparent that station 13 was not going to come back on-line -- vibration problems.

Allan Weatherford has another crew coming in who may have another idea for resolving the problem. He will notify Rick Craig first thing this morning.

If you see Rob or Bob you may want to mention this problem at 13 to them -- sometimes they call in.  Previously we had this same problem at station 13 because the station was incorrectly designed with too much pipe unsupported above ground.

The weather forecast shows mild weather, and we can continue to meet a 1550 market demand with station 13 down.
