Thank you, Shelley, for your offer.  Our clubhouse was not available, so I 
have decided to have the shower  here at my house.  I am dealing with my 
"problems" and have decided life goes on!  It will be fine.  I am looking 
forward to entertaining - we haven't done anything like this in a while - too 
long!
Yes, I will add those names to the guest list.  I am very comfortable with 
the number of guests.
Talk to you soon,
Barbara
