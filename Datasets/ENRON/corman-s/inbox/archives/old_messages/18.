Hi! The invites are nearly ready to go. I just need the map to Rosemary's
home. 

Also, Shelley -- we discussed that you may want to direct people to certain
things or places for gifts (e.g., books). Let me know what you the invite to
say and, if clothes are still an option, remind me what sizes.

Thanks!
