Hi Shelley:
I am getting out invitations for the shower today.  I am sending one to you 
and Alina so you can see it.  Here is the guest list so far:
Giok Boothe
Lisa Corder
Linda Corredor (co-hosting)
Jacque Daughtry
Sydney Free Duvall
Peggy Erwin
Nancy Ginsburg
Dawn Goddin
Ange Grout
Wendy Houghton
Barbara Howard
Stephanie Keesling
Carla McGinley
Kathy Mynarcik
Becky O'Reilly
Dorothy Pledger
Letha Russell
Pam Thyssen
Ann Turney
Patty Wehn-Glowski

I do need to clarify the following:
1)    Did you say yes to inviting Tami Head?  (My notes aren't clear.)
2)    You listed Cherie Otto on your list.  I know that she and Barbara 
Bakanic are very close friends.  Barbara is also in our S/S class when she is 
not teaching.  Do you think we should invite both of them?
3)    You were going to get me Gabby's (sp?) address.
4)    I thought of Maggie Van Syckle.  Are you close with her?

If there's any one else you think of, just let me know.
Thanks,
Barbara
