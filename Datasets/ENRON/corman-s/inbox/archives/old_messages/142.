Thank you so much, Shelley.  I, too, am sad that this all happened to Enron.


I have been in touch with Rick, Mike and Steve but I will send an email to
Lynn to cover all the basis and I appreciate your touching base with them
also.  
Thanks again... Georgi

Hi Georgi,

It's nice to hear from you -- although I wish it were under happier
circumstances from your end.  I know that your visited with Mike and Steve
on gas control openings.  Please also keep in touch with Rick Dietz for
contract group openings and Lynn Blair for potential scheduling openings.
I'll also touch base with them and let them know that you may be responding
to upcoming job postings.
