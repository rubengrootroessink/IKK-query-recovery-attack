Attached is an updated reherasal schedule, the handchime schedule is
included.  The worship committee approved Sunday, April 28 during the
Sunday School hour for our program.   We are finishing up a week earlier
than last year, but the Sundays in May are already booked.

I have moved our Saturday rehearsal to the afternoon instead of the
morning.  We lose a lot of kids to baseballl, swimming, dance rehearsal,
etc.  I have put the rehearsal from 3:00 - 5:00 on April 27.   After the
rehearsal, I would like to feed the kids dinner and have a little choir
party.   Because of our baseball theme, I would like to have hot dogs,
sodas, maybe some popcorn.    We can also celebrate our May birthdays at
that time.
