Here's your list. I still need addresses. Would you mind terribly if I
invite Patsy? She really wants to meet Alina.

Thanks.  I will be so glad to be home.  I have a 102 degree fever today and
am counting the minutes til I board that plane.

The shower idea sounds fun.  I would prefer a girl shower if that's okay.
Clothes would be my preferred gift -- she wears a 4T or 5T.  She is very
short for her age, but nearly normal girth.  Medium at Gymboree fits her
fine.

The 19th won't work though, because it's my brother in law Troy's 40th
birthday in Austin.  So hopefully there is another day.


Potential List:
Cyndi
Rosemary
Christi
Michele Turkington
Andrea Flynn
Anita Kudla
Cindy Dick
Vicki Smith 
Karen Ferrazi
Gina Taylor
Debbie Thompson
Rosalia Nolan
Peggy Holmes
Lynn Blair
Donna Scott
Sheila Nacey

This list includes a few ladies that work for me -- last 4 names.   But,
otherwise I decided to skip too many work or church friends.  I think a
small gathering would be more fun.
