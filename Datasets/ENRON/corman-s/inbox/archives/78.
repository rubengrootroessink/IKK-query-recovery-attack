Yes, I am feeling a whole lot better.  I still have one kidney stone in my right kidney that will be something special to look forward to.  This time with the knowledge I acquired from this first experience, my Urologist and I have a PLAN of ACTION prepared.  This should make the second episode less painful.  Or least it sounds good.
