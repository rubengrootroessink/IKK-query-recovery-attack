During the first few minutes of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Open Meeting today (2/13/02) there was an audio problem at the FERC that 
was beyond our control.  We will rebroadcast the first 15 minutes of the 
FERC Open meeting immediately after the meeting ends on our cable, internet 
and phone systems.

If you have any questions, please contact our office at capcon@gmu.edu or 
703-993-3100.

Thank you,
