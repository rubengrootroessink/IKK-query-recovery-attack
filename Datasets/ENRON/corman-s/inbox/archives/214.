That's fine. I was just looking for TW only for our rating agency package.
Thanks,

Kevin,
We can get ETS-related pipe throughput for 2001 (and Rick has subsequently sent the TW 2001 data).  But we won't have non Enron pipeline throughput until they publish.

I'm confused - I thought we had throughput data on a more timely manner? Is it the specific format that is the problem or the data itself? If we want to estimate it, that would be fine also.

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Kevin Howard suggested that I contact you regarding some data for the attached slide.  I am looking for average throughput for four pipes in 2001.  Please let me know if you have this information.

Thank you,

Michael
