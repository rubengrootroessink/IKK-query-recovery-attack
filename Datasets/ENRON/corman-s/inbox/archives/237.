Shelley:
Do you have any information on Project Max that we could use in the business plan for NNG?

Shelley may have some more info on Max.    Otherwise we should probably ask Dave Neubauer.

Have taken our info memo and broadened it substantially to pull in more info for the business plan (risks, liquidity/capital resources,selected historical data). I want to include a page on market strategy - is project MAX a real expansion and if so, who has data on it? The NNG bus plan is in very good shape thanks to the work jayshree and davis did on the info memo! I will have first draft by wed.
