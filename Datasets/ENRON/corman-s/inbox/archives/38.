SKI at Mt. Rose, Reno's closest ski area, averaging 34' of snow a year with a vertical drop of 1,500 feet. Stick around after the lifts close for the Apres-Ski Foggy Goggle Party. We'll provide the transportation and lift ticket, you provide the skis and courage.

Skiing not for you? Then be one of the 144 golfers at the Red Hawk Golf Course for an afternoon of "best ball" tournament play. Following the round on this Robert Trent Jones, Jr. designed course, join your colleagues for the 19th hole festivities. Once again, we'll get you there and pay for your greens fees. All you need to do is bring your clubs and your "A" game.

Or, if you prefer...We'll arrange for a 30-minute spa session to help you relax and enjoy the surroundings of the beautiful Nugget Hotel.
