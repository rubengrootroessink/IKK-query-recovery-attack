A wide array of experts will discuss the two most fundamental aspects of the transmission system at Transmission: Operations & Planning, to be held April 4-5 at the Wyndham City Center Hotel in Washington, DC. (www.srinstitute.com/cr219 <http://www.srinstitute.com/cr219>)

This leading event-dealing with the underlying issues of congestion management, market design and the cost associated with transmission restructuring-will feature top-flight speakers covering such topics as:

the locational marginal price (LMP) model as a means for addressing congestion by market means, 
the unique problems that arise when "load pockets" exist amid an otherwise adequate system, 
the virtues of Standard Market Design, 
the realities of operating a system under LMP, and 
the use of "hybrid" congestion management models that attempt to reconcile more than one transmission congestion paradigm.  

 Chaired by: Alvarado Fernando of University of Wisconsin  

SPECIAL KEYNOTE ADDRESSES: 
William Hogan, Director, Harvard Electricity Policy Group

Commissioner Stan Wise, Georgia Public Service Commission
