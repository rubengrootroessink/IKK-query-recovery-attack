Randy just called and wanted to let everyone know that he appreciates the coverage from the team.  He is back at home, but has not passed the 2 stones.  He is going to the urologist today.  I told him that everything has been covered for the weekend, so rest up and get better.
Scott

Team, 
1)  Harry has agreed to work the evening shift from Thursday through the weekend. He will be in at 9:30 on Wed.
2)  I let Janet know that she will be needed for the Wed. Evening shift. 
3)  Robert will come in at 9:30 Thursday to cover the late shift for Thursday only.  
4)  Someone will need to cover the late shift on Friday, since Robert has the day off.

Randy does have a kidney stone and the doctor told him to be off his feet for 48 hours.  As far as I know, he was going to be sent home from the hospital tonight.

I do believe this covers all of the shifts accept for Friday.  If there are any questions, please ask.

Thanks,
Scott

Team,

Randy became quite ill this afternoon with what is suspected to be a kidney stone.  The paramedics took him to St. Joseph's Hospital.  Thanks to Randy's creation of the team emergency phone list, we were able to contact his wife who is now at St. Joseph's with him as well as Robert Benningfield who followed the ambulance to the hospital.

Since Randy was scheduled to work evenings this week and weekend, we need to rearrange people. Scott has agreed to stay tonight.  I have called Harry since he is the backup for the weekend but he is out of pocket now.  If we hear from Harry and he can work nights, I will take a comp day tomorrow.  If we do not hear from Harry, or he cannot work the evening, I will come in and work the night shift for Wednesday.  Someone will need to pick up the Timely Process for me.  I'm not sure how I got in that slot, since I checked Cara's draft, but there you are.  

If Harry is unable to work nights, we will need volunteer(s) for Thursday through Sunday.  We will also need for Robert to continue his 10 to 7 or 9:30 to 6:30 shift for Thursday and Friday or get another volunteer for that time slot.

I will be at home tomorrow morning.  You can reach me at 713-665-7206.   

Thanks for your help in solving this dilemma.

Janet
