As this issue impacts all of our applications (operations and commercial) I have asked Tony Mayer to spearhead this effort for us.

Caroline, 
We need to get together to discuss the ownership and rights to use for our new software products like Contracts, Capacity Release, Capacity Analysis and Rates & Revenue.  My assumption is that NNG has the rights to use and will be able to get the source code for customization of this software because of the financial contribution that they have made; however, after talking to Colleen Raker today, she said we need to get together and create some type of written agreement between all the pipes for who owns and has the right to the source code for these software products.  I know you are out until the 14th so let's plan to get together the following week to address.  Thanks.
