Jim, in connection with your interest in identifying a top notch litigator
in California to look after Enron's interests in California, I would
recommend you consider David Balabian and Chris Hockett of the firm of
McCutchen Doyle Brown and Enerson LLP. McCutchen is a 300+ lawyer firm with
its main office in San Francisco and offices in Los Angles, Palo Alto and
Walnut Creek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commercial
litigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IP
litigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on some
power plant matters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockett (who
I have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur that
Chris (a 40ish commercial litigator) is a very impressive individual. David
Balbanian, more senior than Chris, is apparently widely known as one of the
leading commercial litigators in  Northern California. Establishing a
relationship with David and Chris would give you the judgment and access I
assume you would want. Let me know if I can provide any additional
information.  Joe
