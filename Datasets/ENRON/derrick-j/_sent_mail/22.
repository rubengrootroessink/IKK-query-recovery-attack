Dear Rob:

   I am going to be in Houston on business next week from Wednesday on.  I
wondered if there might be a convenient time to stop in to say hello and if
possible take you up on your offer of an introduction to Jim Derrick.  I
have a series of meetings downtown over the three days.  Any one could
easily be moved.  

   Thanks for your help.

   Kindest regards.


                  Chris Allegaert
