Joe:

I just returned to town and picked up your message re Enron General
Counsel's son and SMU. I am going to Washington early in the morning,
returning Wednesday evening.

I would be delighted to send a letter of recommendation to SMU Law School.
As a member of the School's Board of Visitors, I have had some success with
admissions, and would be happy try to help here. If he will send me a copy
of his college summary, I will prepare a letter and send it this week.

Hopefully, it will help. As you know, SMU is a long-time client, and Kay and
I, as well as the Firm, are significant money contributors to the School.

Regards.

Ray H.
