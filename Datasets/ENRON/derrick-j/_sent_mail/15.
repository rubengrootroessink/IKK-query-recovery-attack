Ray, Joe Dilg has informed me of your very kind offer of assistance with 
regard to my son's (James V. Derrick III) interest in applying to  the SMU 
School of  Law; I am most grateful. SMU is his first choice.   We are 
currently working on his application and hope to get it to the school within 
the next ten days.  He  graduated from the University of Mississippi and is 
currently enrolled in a university in Madrid, Spain studying Spanish. I will 
send you a copy of his application as soon as it is completed.  All the 
best.  Jim
