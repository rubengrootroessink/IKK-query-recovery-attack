Tom, the memo is fine, but before sending it we need to get confirmation from 
John Beckworth or Mike Perrin that Senator Bentsen will be able to attend the 
dinner at which the award will be given.  I left messages for John and Mike 
last Friday.  Jim

Hello, Mr. Derrick--Nancy asked that I send you this draft memo for your
review/approval.  Please let me know if you have difficulty opening it
and/or what changes need to be made to it.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Tom
