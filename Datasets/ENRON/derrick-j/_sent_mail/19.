Subject: External Legal Counsel

Jim
 
I would like to instruct the following firm in Bulgaria  Djingov Gouginski 
Kyutchukov & Velichkov, 10 Tsar Osvoboditel Blvd, 1000 Sofia to review the 
enforceability of a commercial representative agreement for Enron Metals & 
Commodity Corp. Enron Europe Limited have recommended this firm. 
 
If you are uncomfortable with this firm please advise and I will seek out 
another, unless of course you have a preference for a particular firm in 
Bulgaria.
 
Many thanks.
 
Kind regards.
 
Marcus
