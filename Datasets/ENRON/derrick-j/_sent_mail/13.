Jim:  please see the attached, from Joe Halprin.  Does the Enron family have 
any relationships with the Klett Rooney law firm that we should bring to 
their attention?  In all events, please be aware that they are taking a 
particularly adverse position.  Thanks.  Marc

Subject: Outside Counsel - Klett Rooney

Marc:  In connection with a dispute regarding a commercial arrangement 
between NewPower and Campus Dimensions, Inc. (also known as College Credit 
Card Corporation), Campus Dimensions, Inc. ("CDI") has engaged the law firm 
Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling - headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA - to 
represent them against NewPower.  Klett Rooney has conducted themselves in a 
fashion that I would consider to be particularly unreasonable.  I would like 
to know if Enron has a relationship with Klett Rooney or CDI. If they do, I 
would recommend that the firm be removed from further engagements. Thanks.
