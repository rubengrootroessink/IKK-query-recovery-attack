Jeff, I have an Enron Board of Directors Meeting that may extend until 
approximately 1:30 p.m., and I have another meeting that begins at 3 p.m.  We 
could meet in my office from 2 to 3 on that date.  If an hour is not 
sufficient, we would need to select another date.  All the best.  Jim

Jim,

Carrin asked me to see if you would be available to meet on Tuesday,
December 12 at 2 p.m.   We would meet downtown to begin discussing plans
for the Karen H. Susman Jurisprudence Award Luncheon, now confirmed for
Monday, April 23, 2001.
