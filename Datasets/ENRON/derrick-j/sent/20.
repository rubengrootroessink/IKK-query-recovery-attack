If you have already answered this request, please disregard.

In case you do not have a calendar, the following was emailed:

Jack Urquhart has requested a Conference Call be placed during the week of 
December 11th to discuss the current contract with British Nuclear Fuels and 
the Trojan decommissioning.  This conference should last for approximately 
one hour.

Please advise the date and time you are available during that week via email 
to linda.s.trevino@enron.com, or if you prefer, I can be reached at (713) 
853-7223.

Thank you,


Linda Trevino
