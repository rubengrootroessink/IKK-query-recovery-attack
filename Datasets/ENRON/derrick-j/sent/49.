Subject: Your Calls on My Behalf




Jim,

This is a note to let you know what happened as per your calls on my behalf.

The short answer is not much.

I had lunch with John Keffer and Randy Coles of King & Spalding.  We had a
cordial conversation, but I concluded and stated that the firm was well
covered regarding the skills that I might offer.

John Klauberg and I had a most enjoyable breakfast.  He seemed interested.
However, I haven't heard any thing.

Pat Oxford didn't return my call. I spoke with Lynn Coleman, but didn't hear
any thing back.

Vicky Price and I have exchanged calls, but haven't had a chance to speak.

On another fronts, I was contacted by Strasburger regarding their Mexico and
other Latin work.  They claim to have done a little work for Enron.  Also, I
am still in discussions with Shook, Hardy & Bacon, the Kansas City firm with
about 40 lawyers here in Houston.

Before anything get finalized, I would like to run it by you just to get an
independent reaction.

Thanks for your support and help.

Mont
