Jim,

We are currently reviewing a new business opportunity with EES to enable 
EECC  to provide technical and commercial due diligence services for global 
infrastructure project financing.  If the new business opportunity receives 
approval from EES management, we see the need to retain outside counsel 
experienced in internet/web based issues.  Presently this need would be with 
the web, structuring, IP, and antitrust areas.

In an effort  to find a firm that Enron has used recently for web related 
matters, I spoke with Mark Taylor and Marianne Castano.  For Enron Online 
development, Mark used Sullivan and Cromwell and Milbank, Tweed for the 
web/trading effort and V & E for IP matters,  For a recent EES internet 
project Marianne used Vivian Polak of LeBeouf Lamb for web/transactional 
issues and V & E for IP matters.  She was very pleased with Vivian's 
support.  After discussing our specific requirements with Mark and Marianne 
and reviewing this matter with Vicki Sharp,  I spoke with Vivian briefly to 
confirm if she had the experience we needed.  I found she had exactly what we 
needed and subsequently discussed this with John Schwartzenburg.  John 
agreed. 

With your approval I would like permission to engage Vivian Polak of LeBeouf, 
Lamb for web, structuring and transactional related issues and Scott Brown of 
V & E for IP matters.  

If you should need any additional information concerning the TECASO Project 
or this request, please let me know.

Thank you,

Randy
