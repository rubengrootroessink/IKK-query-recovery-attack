Subject: Re: Outside Counsel - Klett Rooney  

Vicki:  I am familiar with the firm, but we have never used them to represent 
any of the EFS companies to my knowledge.  I am certain that we do not have 
any current matters with this firm.  You will note that they do not appear on 
our list of approved counsel.  We typically use Reed Smith in Pittsburgh.

 I do know some people at this firm if I can be of any assistance.  I went to 
law school with Artie Rooney at Duquesne University.  You may know that his 
family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Let me know the particular attorney you 
are having difficulty with and I will help in any way can.  By the way, New 
Power's ads have hit the airwaves in Pittsburgh.  I am enrolling as a New 
Power customer!  Thanks, Marty

Marty,  I assume we do not have a relationship with this firm.  Please let me 
know if I am incorrect.

Jim:  please see the attached, from Joe Halprin.  Does the Enron family have 
any relationships with the Klett Rooney law firm that we should bring to 
their attention?  In all events, please be aware that they are taking a 
particularly adverse position.  Thanks.  Marc

Subject: Outside Counsel - Klett Rooney

Marc:  In connection with a dispute regarding a commercial arrangement 
between NewPower and Campus Dimensions, Inc. (also known as College Credit 
Card Corporation), Campus Dimensions, Inc. ("CDI") has engaged the law firm 
Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling - headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA - to 
represent them against NewPower.  Klett Rooney has conducted themselves in a 
fashion that I would consider to be particularly unreasonable.  I would like 
to know if Enron has a relationship with Klett Rooney or CDI. If they do, I 
would recommend that the firm be removed from further engagements. Thanks.
