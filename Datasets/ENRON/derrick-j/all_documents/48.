SAP SYNCHRONISATION AND ALLOCATION PROJECT

What's changing?=20

New Project Codes:  =20

We will be moving from the current project tracking mechanism, Internal=20

=20
facilitate better project reporting and are grouped hierarchically into=20
structures. These groupings are based on project organisation, phasing or=

provides for a common template offering some key advantages: =20

 -  provides consistency across projects and business units=20
 -  facilitates comparison between projects=20
 -  provides a logical grouping of code structures

This tracking mechanism will also be used for capital projects or expense=
=20
projects that require cost tracking.=20

What about training?

To ensure your comfort with the changes listed above, training materials ar=
e=20
