You asked about suggestions for agenda items for this meeting.  Here are a 
couple of thoughts:

     1.  The to-be-issued rewritten policies on FCPA, Antiboycott Laws, and 
U.S. Trade Restraint Laws (you'll have the latter two soon);

     2.  Standardized clauses for arbitration, choice of law, forum selection 

     3.  Attorney-Client Privilege Legend on Enron Lawyers' Email

     4.  OneEnron Policy on retention of email (Richard Sanders and I are 
working on this with IT--its in Richard's court right now)

     5.  Hiring between business units' legal departments (lawyers, 
assistants, and legal specialists)

     6.  Standardization of PRC and compensation between business units' 
legal departments.
