Attached is a revised version of the Q&As, which incorporates many of the
changes suggested by Rob Walls, Jane Wilson and Paul Kraske. The new and
revised sections are shown in italics. (Please note that the second answer
indicates that Phase II is 80 percent complete, but the proposed
presentation to Sharad Pawar indicates 70 percent complete.  Confirmation
of the correct number would be appreciated.) Your early review, comments
and approval would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

John
