??? As I think I said when this came up  earlier, you can give to the general 
fund but alternatively can give to the  scholarship fund set up by Lee in 
honor/memory of his father:? Thomas  Godfrey Endowed Presidential 
Scholarship.? It all counts the  same.
?
If you  will commit to give $1000 for each of the next five years, you will 
be named a  Keeton Fellow.? That gets you a rubber chicken dinner once a 
year.?  Many of our UT grads are Keeton Fellows and it would be a nice thing 
to do when  our client Derrick and our ex-colleague Powers are in charge of  
fundraising.

The Law School  says that it has no record of your giving this year, or last 
for that  matter.? Derrick is trying to get us to 100% participation.? 
Please  consider a contribution.? If you do not make one, I will assume you 
have  decided not to and make one in your name so that we can be  100%.
