Hello, Mr. Derrick--Nancy asked me to email these letters to you.  One is
to you from Nancy, sent on 11/20 and concerning the Executive Committee
meeting in San Antonio next spring.  The other two are draft letters for
your approval--one sent to the Executive Committee, the other to the firm
contacts after the first of next year.  Please let me know if you have
trouble opening these documents, and I'll fax them to you.

Best regards,

Tom
