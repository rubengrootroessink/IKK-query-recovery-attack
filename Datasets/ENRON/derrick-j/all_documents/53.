Committee members,

The Fall Meeting of the Corporate General Counsel is past, and from all
appearances it was a success.  It was good to meet many of you that
attended.  I wanted to take this opportunity to give you an update on some
initiatives Mr. Morgan is looking to implement and how we're going about
implementing  them.

The Committee's web site (see
http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/corpgen/home.html), as Mr. Morgan announced,
will be going through some modifications to enhance its usage.  The first
item to report is that the web site will be secured, in that it can only be
accessed by its members.  You will be asked to login with your ABA id
number, and also provide a password which is your last name.  Access to the
site will only be for current ABA members, who belong to both the Section
and the Corporate General Counsel Committee.

The second item to report is the posting of past and upcoming meeting
agendas.  You'll be able to see what was discussed at previous meetings, as
well as what is upcoming by clicking on the links.  Also to be included on
the site will be the materials that were distributed at your meetings.  Some
of the materials from the Fall Meeting have been posted and can be viewed at
the following link by clicking here:
http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/corpgen/fallmeeting2000.html

The third development to report is the implementation of a member profile
page and a foreign outside counsel searchable database, which I discuss in
length below.

COMMITTEE MEMBER PROFILES

The page will have all committee members listed, and will require the
submission of a photograph and a resume as follows:

*       Photographs -  A black and white or color photo should be submitted.
Photos should be no larger than 3 x 5 or 4 x 6.  Anything larger will not
scan properly for the web site.  You may also send a photo via e-mail (if
you have the capability), with the attachment consisting of your name, and
saved with an extension of .gif or .jpeg format (e.g. Charles Morgan
photo.gif or .jpeg).

*       Resumes - The easiest way to send these is via e-mail in either a
Word or WordPerfect format.

You can send these items to me at the following:

FOREIGN OUTSIDE COUNSEL SEARCHABLE DATABASE

Mr. Morgan solicited comments from members at the Fall Meeting regarding the
implementation of an on-line searchable database, consisting of foreign
counsel that committee members have used.  The purpose would be to take the
guess work out of contacting foreign counsel should the need arise.  The
database would be on the committee's web site with a link, and would have
searchable criteria like country, firm, expertise, clients represented etc.
The idea was received well with members present who attended the Fall
Meeting.

The only caveat to this is that the project needs to be approved by the ABA
Board of Governors.  In discussions with the Policy Office of the ABA, there
is a concern that this might imply an "endorsement" of sorts, and I was
advised to have Mr. Morgan submit this idea for approval by the Board.  We
will be taking the necessary steps to get the approval, with the hope that
we can move forward to implement.  You will be updated about the status of
the approval.



Please let me know if I can answer any questions for you.
