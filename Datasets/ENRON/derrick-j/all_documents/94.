Jim,

Attached you will find the press release announcing the opening of our
Houston office, effective from January 1, 2001.  This is an important step
for the Firm and, in particular, the continued development of our oil, gas
and power practice.  Once the office formally is opened, we will look
forward to inviting you and others from the legal group over to meet the
people who will be resident in this office and have a look around, but for
the moment I just want you to know of this development as we announce it
publicly.  Please feel free at any time to let me know if you have any
questions.

Brad Keithley
