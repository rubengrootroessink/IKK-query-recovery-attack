Jim,

The proposed structure chart I sent you a few days ago has changed following 
some comments received from lawyers and commercial people. I attach the new 
version. The changes are in groups 1 to 3 which have been rearranged, both in 
terms of work allocation and people.



I am also proposing, as part of the same exercise, to make 5 new assistant 
general counsels:

Mark Elliott
Robert Quick
Martin Rosell
Sarah Gregory
Marcus Von Bock .

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of this. 



      Mark
