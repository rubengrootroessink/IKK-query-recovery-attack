You have been  added to the CORPGEN mailing list  (Committee of Corporate
General Counsel  of the Business  Law Section) by BLS  List Administrator
<bllserve@ABANET.ORG>.

Please save this message for future  reference, especially if this is the
first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list. If you ever
need to leave  the list, you will find the  necessary instructions below.
Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all
future subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail
folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you
are subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on
vacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up
your  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  "welcome
messages" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after
subscribing to a new list.

To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list,
just send mail  to CORPGEN@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. This is  called "sending mail
to the  list," because  you send  mail to a  single address  and LISTSERV
makes  copies  for all  the  people  who  have subscribed.  This  address
(CORPGEN@MAIL.ABANET.ORG)  is also  called the  "list address."  You must
never try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributed
to all the people  who have subscribed. All commands must  be sent to the
"LISTSERV  address," LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.  It is  very important  to
understand  the difference  between the  two, but  fortunately it  is not
complicated. The LISTSERV address is like  a FAX number that connects you
to  a machine,  whereas the  list  address is  like a  normal voice  line
connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number
when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone, you will quickly realize
that you  used the wrong  number and call again.  No harm will  have been
done. If on the other hand  you accidentally make your FAX call someone's
voice  line,  the  person  receiving the  call  will  be  inconvenienced,
especially if your FAX then re-dials  every 5 minutes. The fact that most
people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow
the FAX  to go through  and make  the calls stop  does not mean  that you
should continue to send FAXes to  the voice number. People would just get
mad at you.  It works pretty much  the same way with  mailing lists, with
the difference  that you are calling  hundreds or thousands of  people at
the same  time, and consequently  you can expect a  lot of people  to get
upset if you consistently send commands to the list address.

You may leave the list at any time by sending a "SIGNOFF CORPGEN" command
to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. You  can also tell LISTSERV how  you want it
to confirm the  receipt of messages you  send to the list. If  you do not
trust the  system, send a "SET  CORPGEN REPRO" command and  LISTSERV will
send  you a  copy of  your own  messages, so  that you  can see  that the
message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while
you  may find  that this  is getting  annoying, especially  if your  mail
program does not  tell you that the  message is from you  when it informs
you that new  mail has arrived from  CORPGEN. If you send  a "SET CORPGEN
ACK  NOREPRO" command,  LISTSERV will  mail you  a short  acknowledgement
instead, which will  look different in your mailbox  directory. With most
mail programs you  will know immediately that this  is an acknowledgement
you can read later. Finally, you can turn off acknowledgements completely
with "SET CORPGEN NOACK NOREPRO".

Following  instructions from  the list  owner, your  subscription options
have been  set to "REPRO"  rather than  the usual LISTSERV  defaults. For
more  information  about subscription  options,  send  a "QUERY  CORPGEN"
command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.

Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a
list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX CORPGEN" command
to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. You  can then order these files  with a "GET
CORPGEN LOGxxxx" command, or using LISTSERV's database search facilities.
Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more information on the latter.

This  list is  available  in digest  form.  If you  wish  to receive  the
digested  version  of the  postings,  just  issue  a SET  CORPGEN  DIGEST
command.

Please note that  it is presently possible for other  people to determine
that  you are  signed up  to the  list through  the use  of the  "REVIEW"
command,  which  returns   the  e-mail  address  and  name   of  all  the
subscribers. If  you do not  want your name to  be visible, just  issue a
"SET CORPGEN CONCEAL" command.

More  information on  LISTSERV  commands  can be  found  in the  LISTSERV
reference  card, which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an "INFO  REFCARD"
command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.
