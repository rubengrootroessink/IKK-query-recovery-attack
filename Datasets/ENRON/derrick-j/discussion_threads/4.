Jim:

At the smaller group lawyers' meetings on Tuesday-Wednesday April 4-5 in San 
Antonio, I would suggest the following topics to be added to whatever else 
you have in mind:

status of update of Enron Corp. legal dept. guidelines/policies
status of preparation of Enron Corp. legal dept. guidelines on FCPA
review of Enron lawyers' compensation in light of changes in marketplace

Stephen.
