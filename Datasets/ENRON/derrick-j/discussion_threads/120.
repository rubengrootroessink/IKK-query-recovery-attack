fyi--clearly, this was the "right thing to do."  But keep in mind that 
Transredes does not have a great credit rating.

Subject: Garner litigation

Guys:

Just wanted to let you know that the Transredes board approved today to 
indemnify Enron for any legal expenses incurred in connection with the suit 
filed in Texas by Garner in exchange for a taking an active role in managing 
the litigation. The vote was 6 against one.

Fernando will be working together with Eileen and the gas pipeline guys in 
drafting the final agreement.

I guess this is good news for all the parties involved in this case.

Regards,

Miguel
