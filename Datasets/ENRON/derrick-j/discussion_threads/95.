Rob:

I'm having trouble accessing my email but here is the latest.  There are more 
newspaper articles which make me believe that GOM's position is hardening on 
reviewing the project.  I met with two of our outside lawyers today.  Atul 
recommended that we review the possibility of a challenge based on 
unconscionability or void as against public policy.  

The lawyers are universally pretty pessimistic regarding the possibility of a 
satisfactory outcome for Enron.

I'm meeting with the rest of our India lawyers tomorrow, including Robert 
Mathis.

Bruce
