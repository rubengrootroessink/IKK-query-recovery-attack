Jim-  I was out last week and am just now making it through e-mails and 
responses.  Hope this is timely for you to craft the agenda for Tues/Wed next 
week.  The following is a list of potential topics to discuss with the group, 
should you decide that is appropriate.

1.  Brobeck's and V&E's increase in associate salaries and our response ,if 
any , to it; and

2.  Revisit/ discuss policies re: waiver of jury trial, arbitration and 
indemnities. 

Kristina
