Rob, attached is the list of Legal VPs across Enron.  I have tried to get a 
confirmation from each of the Enron companies but have not been successful 
yet.    There are several employees such as Bob Vote, Robert Eickenroht and 
Chuck Cheek who are classified as Asst General Counsel which is a Sr Director 
job group and not VP.  

I am in training all day on Friday, Nov 10th and from 3-5 on Monday Nov 
13th.  I have HR PRC meeting on November 14th but I will be trying to keep up 
with e-mails and voice mails at night if you have any questions.


Sheila  Walton
