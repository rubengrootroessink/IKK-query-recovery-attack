fussiness; it defies wrinkles, even after days of packing and=20

elasticized shoe pockets. The two spill-proof plastic cases - ideal=20
for toiletries - are conveniently removable for trips to the=20

supple that you can easily pack it, and so versatile you'll wear it=20

everything we make.=20

Airplane Comfort Kit
The airlines' idea of comfort just doesn't measure up: Scratchy,=20
handkerchief-size, shared-with-strangers blankets and tiny, lumpy=20
pillows are a recipe for jet lag. Next time you fly, pack your own=20
Airplane Comfort Kit instead. The cloud-soft fleece pillow unzips to=20
reveal a generous (36" x 60") double-faced fleece blanket that=20
surrounds you (and only you!) with heavenly softness and lightweight=20
warmth. There's even a thoughtfully placed pocket at the bottom in=20

great comfort add-on. $38=20

actually rainproof!) Made of suede-soft microfiber, with a frankly=20
sensual texture, they weigh just 26 ounces. Best of all, each folds=20

fashion trends as it is to rain and wind. Generous fit. $159=20

These lightweight carriers are the answer to every frequent packer's=20
prayers. Not only do they organize your travel wardrobe by category=20

in less space because the Pack-It compresses its load. Three colors=20
