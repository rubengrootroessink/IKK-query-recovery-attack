Dear TI-USA Corporate Supporters:

We are delighted to report that yesterday the OAS General Assembly approved a
resolution calling for the creation of a follow-up mechanism for the
Inter-American Convention Against Corruption.  As you know, TI has been
working toward this goal for over two years.

The agreement provides for a Committee of Experts to select the provisions of
the Convention and countries to be reviewed and for the possibility of
consultations with civil society.

TI has called for additional steps including:

-Clear instructions to enable civil society participation in the follow-up
monitoring and guarantee a transparent and participatory process, with the
publication of questionnaires and responses, and consultations with civil
society organizations, professional organizations, academia and the private
sector;

-Funding to underpin civil society input;

-In-country visits by experts to provide the best possible objective and
independent technical expertise to act on any shortfalls in the
implementation and enforcement of the Convention;

-Meetings of experts by the Fall of 2001, and evaluations before the end of
this year;

-An annual progress report.
