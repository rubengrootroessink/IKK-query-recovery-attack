CHENEY SAYS HIGHER FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS STILL UNDER
CONSIDERATION

Vice President Cheney tells the heads of four national
environmental and public health groups that the Bush
administration will consider increasing the standards for
auto and truck fuel efficiency and for renewable energy, but
will not support requiring power plants to cut carbon
dioxide emissions. The chief executive officers of the four
groups meet with Bush administration officials to discuss
alternatives to the administration's national energy policy.

CHEMICALS USED AT SUPERFUND SITES TO BE REPORTED TO TOXICS
INVENTORY

EPA must report by July 1 to the Toxics Release Inventory
certain hazardous chemicals used to clean up superfund
sites. Under a new policy, any EPA regional office
performing a remedial or removal activity at a site that
results in the release of a TRI chemical over the allowed
threshold must report that release to the inventory. To be
covered under the new policy, the site cleanup must be
funded solely by the Superfund Trust Fund. . . . Page A-2

EPA TO WITHDRAW 1999 AMENDMENT ON USE OF PCB-CONTAMINATED
MATERIALS

EPA will withdraw a 1999 standard governing use of porous
surfaces, such as flooring materials, contaminated with
polychlorinated biphenyls, an EPA attorney tells BNA.  The
attorney does not know when the EPA issue the withdrawal
notice, which results from a federal appeals court ruling in
January.  Meanwhile, companies that wish to use porous
surfaces, such as concrete or wooden floors, contaminated
with PCBs must comply with requirements in a 1998 PCB rule
from EPA that requires companies to clean and paint the
PCB-contaminated surfaces. . . . Page A-8

HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS URGED TO REJECT FUNDS FOR ARCTIC OIL,
GAS EXPLORATION

Led by Rep. Markey, 58 House Democrats urge colleagues in
charge of appropriations for the Department of Interior to
reject a White House request for funding to explore the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas. A similar
letter, initiated by Rep. Johnson, is expected to be sent
from House Republicans today. A Johnson aide says the
letter, currently signed by eight Republicans, is being
circulated to gain more signatures. . . . Page A-2

AGREEMENT ON PESTICIDE REASSESSMENTS SAID TO LACK REASONABLE
DEADLINES

A consent agreement reached in January between EPA and
environmental groups does not allow enough time to review
data generated by pesticide makers, according to comments
submitted to the agency. A federal court in California is
expected to decide at a hearing next week whether to approve
the agreement, which would partly settle a lawsuit filed by
the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups on
pesticide reviews under the Food Quality Protection Act. . .

RESEARCH SEEN NEEDED ON USE OF NATURAL ATTENUATION AT WASTE
SITES

A federal advisory committee concludes that although EPA's
monitored natural attenuation program produces
scientifically sound research, a lot is unknown about the
program and its effectiveness in cleaning up hazardous waste
sites.  In particular, the report from EPA's Science
Advisory Board cites contamination by MTBE as an area
needing more research. Monitored natural attenuation is a
waste site cleanup remedy that relies on microbes, the
weather, and other naturally occurring environmental
processes to rid an area of hazardous contaminants. . . .

REDUCED INSECTICIDE USE CITED AS BENEFIT OF GENETICALLY
ALTERED CORN

EPA should register a new plant-incorporated protectant to
reduce insecticide use and to attack the corn rootworm, U.S.
growers, states, and seed companies write in comments filed
on an application by Monsanto Co. to register "Bacillus
thuringiensis" Cry3Bb protein and the genetic material
(Vector ZMIR13L) needed to produce it in the corn. . . .

TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ANNOUNCES GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
INITIATIVE

Several multinational telecommunications companies and the
European Telecommunication Network Operators Association
unveil a sustainable development initiative they expect to
be a key part of future environmental initiatives. AT&T
Corp., Lucent Technologies, and Telcordia Technologies are
among the companies that are part of the Global
e-Sustainability Initiative. . . . Page A-4

CLIMATE CHANGE PROTOCOL DOMINATES WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY
MEETING

Although the agenda of the World Environment Day talks in
Turin, Italy, does not specifically address the Kyoto
Protocol on global warming, the controversial accord
nonetheless becomes the dominant topic under discussion at
the meeting. . . . Page A-3

DOT TO ALLOW MARYLAND PIPELINE TO RESUME OPERATIONS AFTER
2000 SPILL

pipeline operator's request to restart a southern Maryland
pipeline closed for more than a year following an oil spill.

APPROVAL OF PESTICIDE-TREATED UNIFORMS PENDING BEFORE ARMY
UNIFORM BOARD

Army uniforms factory-treated with the insecticide
permethrin await approval by the Army Uniform Board. An Army
spokesman says a chemist with the Army Soldier Systems
Center developed and patented the process to treat the
uniforms by machine. EPA and the U.S. Surgeon General have
approved the use of permethrin on textiles, according to the
Army. . . . Page A-10
