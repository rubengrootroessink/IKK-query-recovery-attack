David and Jim:

I spoke with Joe Hubach today and he is very interested in becoming a part of the new Tech Law Center.  Joe is expecting your call, Jim, and David you might want to follow up and invite him to lunch.  He said he would do his best to attend the ICLC Advisory Board meeting and the Symposium this year, too (no doubt mainly to hear Jim's talk!)

His contact information is as follows:

Joseph F. Hubach

Let me know if we can provide you with any additional assistance in this regard.

Best regards.
