CHANGES CONSIDERED TO RELAX RULES FOR CERTAIN WETLANDS
PERMITS

Rules prohibiting development activities affecting 300
linear feet of stream bed would be relaxed in certain
circumstances under changes to the wetlands program being
contemplated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The corps
is considering changes to several of its nationwide permits,
which authorize activities in up to a half-acre of wetlands,
according to a corps spokesman.  The revisions come slightly
more than a year after the corps published its package of
new and revised nationwide permits, which included lowering
the allowable amount of wetlands that could be impacted from
three acres to a half-acre. . . . Page AA-1,  E-1

SUPREME COURT DECLINES REVIEW OF DECISION UPHOLDING PCB
DISPOSAL RULE

The U.S. Supreme Court announces that it will not review a
federal appeals court decision that upheld an EPA regulation
on polychlorinated biphenyl use and disposal. The court
leaves standing an August 2000 decision by the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals, which largely upheld the rule, known as
the PCB Mega Rule. The Supreme Court denies review without
comment. . . . Page A-1

BUSH PRAISES EVERGLADES RESTORATION, CALLS FOR 'NEW
ENVIRONMENTALISM'

President Bush seeks to firm up his environmental
credentials by pointing to his administration's request for
$219 million for restoration of the Everglades and by
calling for a "new environmentalism." The money is part of
the federal government's commitment to an Everglades
restoration effort enacted last year. Bush points to
cooperation in the Everglades project as an example of the
"new environmentalism for the 21st century." . . . Page A-1

REFINERY FOUND LIABLE FOR VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW, DESPITE
STATE ACTIONS

A petroleum refiner is liable for violations of various
federal laws despite the initiation of a state enforcement
action, a federal district court rules. The U.S. District
Court for the Western District of Wisconsin grants partial
summary judgment to the federal government on its claims
that Murphy Oil USA Inc. is liable for violations of the
Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act at its refinery in Superior,
Wis. The court rejects Murphy's claims that the initiation
of state enforcement actions precludes EPA from bringing its
claims. . . . Page A-2

EPA PLAN FOR GREAT LAKES TARGETS PERSISTENT BIOACCUMULATIVE
CONTAMINANTS

EPA's new strategy for cleaning up the Great Lakes Basin
places a heavy emphasis on reducing persistent
bioaccumulative substances, including mercury and dioxins,
according to a notice scheduled for publication today. In
its notice, EPA says it will host a series of public
meetings to coordinate federal, state, and local cleanup
efforts. . . . Page A-3

EPA CIRCULATES DRAFT OF ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES FOR FISCAL
2002, 2003

EPA is putting the finishing touches on a list of
enforcement priorities for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 that
builds on progress made in six major areas during the
previous two-year period, but budget cutbacks will force
some consolidation in programs, an agency official tells
BNA. The Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance
sends a draft version of a memorandum of agreement guidance
to EPA's 10 regional offices. . . . Page A-4

NINTH CIRCUIT HALTS TIMBER SALES TO PROTECT SALMON HABITAT,
WATER QUALITY

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upholds a
lower court's ruling that halted a number of federal timber
sales in Oregon because of endangered species and water
quality concerns. The ruling affirms a 1999 ruling by the
district court which directed federal biologists to do more
site-specific studies of the impact of the timber sales on
salmon habitat and water quality. . . . Page A-10

EPA ASSIGNS LOW ENFORCEMENT PRIORITY TO AQUATIC HERBICIDE
DECISION

EPA will not change its civil enforcement priorities on
pesticides applied to water until the agency develops a
concerted national approach to regulate such activities,
according to a memorandum from EPA's Office of Enforcement
and Compliance Assurance. The memorandum refers to a federal
appeals court ruling that an irrigation district in Oregon
may be subject to liability under the Clean Water Act
because it failed to obtain a permit to spray aquatic
herbicides on its canals. . . . Page A-5

RESEARCHERS COULD HELP EPA IN USE OF MODELS TO PREDICT PEST
RESISTANCE

A panel of researchers is advising EPA on a framework that
could help enhance the time genetically engineered,
pesticidal corn is effective against pests, an EPA official
and panel members tell a workshop. The EPA Office of
Research and Development convenes a two-day workshop to
address the management of insect resistance to Bacillus
thuringiensis corn, which fights pests through the
production of proteins--pesticidal toxins. . . . Page A-6

ENERGY DEPARTMENT LAUNCHES INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE NATURAL
GAS PIPELINES

The Department of Energy announces that it will provide $4.4
million over the next three years to 11 new
government-industry collaborations to improve the safety and
performance of the nation's natural gas delivery system. . .

RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS INCLUDED IN $3.5 BILLION ENERGY
PLAN IN ILLINOIS

Illinois legislators put together a $3.5 billion package of
financial incentives for electric power companies and coal
mining operations as a strategy to boost the sagging coal
industry and to improve the reliability of the state's
electric power generating network. The package also includes
an environmental initiative aimed at financing renewable
energy projects and a commitment to review regulations
pertaining to emissions from older coal-fired power
generating stations. . . . Page A-4
