James: I hope you were not offended when I wrote to you directly several
weeks ago (without introduction) about my hopes to talk to you about a
transactional lawyer position on your team.  Might you need another
hardworking, big firm trained lawyer with lots of complex outsourrcing and
transactional experience?  I think my training and experience would suit me
well to hit the ground running. I would be thrilled with the chance to
talk. Let me know and I can resend my resume. Look forward to talking soon.
