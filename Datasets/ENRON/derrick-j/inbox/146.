Transparency International USA is pleased to invite you to a Private Sector
Luncheon Briefing on November 28, 2001, from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. in
Washington, DC.  Our speakers from the Administration will be Under Secretary
of State Alan Larson and Under Secretary of Commerce Grant Aldonas.  IIE
Director Fred Bergsten has generously offered to host this event and will
share his views on the continuing importance of the fight against corruption.
 TI Chairman Peter Eigen will bring participants up to date on the growth of
the TI global network.

TI is playing a key role in the monitoring process designed to assure
enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.  With the economic downturn,
effective enforcement is now even more critical to dissuade those who would
use bribes to secure business.  With US attention turned to mounting a global
coalition to address the terrorist attacks of September 11, we must redouble
our efforts to ensure that the Administration and the Hill provide adequate
political and financial resources for the anti-corruption agenda.

The private sector must continue to play a central role in this effort. This
timely and important meeting will provide a forum for the private sector to
share its views with policy makers.  We will also devote time to a frank and
informal discussion of TI-USA priorities and how to meet the challenges
ahead.

Please let us know if you plan to join us.
