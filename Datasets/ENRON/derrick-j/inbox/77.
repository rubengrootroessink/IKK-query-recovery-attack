SENATE BILL WOULD EXCLUDE FROM INCOME TAX AMOUNTS RECEIVED
IN PAYMENT OF DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) introduces legislation to
exclude from taxable income awards received in judgment or
settlement for claims of discrimination or violation of
civil rights. The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2001 also
would eliminate the double taxation of attorneys' fees under
contingency fee agreements and allow income averaging for
back pay and front pay awarded for discrimination claims. A
companion bill is pending in the House.

The legislation would correct an unintended consequence of
the 1996 Small Business Job Protection Act, which made
damage awards that are not based on physical injury or
physical sickness taxable to the plaintiff. "Because most
acts of employment discrimination and civil rights
violations do not cause physical injuries, this provision
has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who
successfully prove that they have been subjected to
intentional employment discrimination or other intentional
violations of their civil rights," Collins explains. . . .

NLRB ADOPTS BRIGHT-LINE RULE FOR DECERTIFICATION ELECTIONS,
PROHIBITS INCUMBENT UNIONS FROM USING NONEMPLOYEES AS
OBSERVERS

The National Labor Relations Board adopts a "bright-line
rule" prohibiting incumbent labor organizations from using
their nonemployee agents as election observers for
decertification elections. The board overturns a
decertification election despite the lack of any evidence of
misconduct by the union agent, citing neutrality of the
election process as the reason for its bright-line rule.

The board distinguishes decertification elections from
initial representation elections, in which nonemployee union
observers are allowed providing the agency does not engage
in misconduct and the agent's presence does not interfere
with any party's rights. "In our view, it is more likely
that an employee would be influenced by the presence of a
person who is an agent of a union that "is" his bargaining
representative than by a person who is an agent of a union
that wishes to "become" the bargaining representative." . .

FTC CLEARS AMAZON'S REVISED PRIVACY POLICY,  APPROVES
TRUSTE'S COPPA SAFE HARBOR PROGRAM

The Federal Trade Commission concludes that a change in
Amazon.com's online privacy policy concerning the
circumstances in which the company might disclose personal
information about its customers does not violate the FTC
Act. The FTC's conclusions are in response to a petition
alleging that the electronic retailer deceived consumers in
its representations about privacy of personal information. .

The Federal Trade Commission approves the safe harbor
program for children's online data proposed by TRUSTe, an
organization that grants privacy seals to Web sites. Firms
adhering to guidelines established by TRUSTe will be
presumed to be in compliance with regulations implementing
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which require
that Web sites directed at children post comprehensive
privacy policies on their sites and obtain parental consent
before collecting personal information from children under
the age of 13.  . . . Page 2744
