 I keep this little message around to help remind  myself  what a truly blessed life I have had when things aren't going the  way I think they should. After reading the paper the last few days I thought you  might need a Hug.  Jan, Corby, Holly, Tanner, Gunner and I all love you. What more could anyone ask  for? Hang in there.

> Today, when I awoke, I suddenly realized that this is the best  day of my  
> life, ever!  
>  
> There were times when I wondered if I would make it to today;  but I did!  
> And because I did I'm going to celebrate!  
>  
> Today, I'm going to celebrate what an unbelievable life I have  had so  
> far: the accomplishments, the many blessings, and, yes, even the  
> hardships because they have served to make me stronger.  
>  
> I will go through this day with my head held high, and a happy  heart.  
>  
> I will marvel at God's seemingly simple gifts: the morning dew,  the sun,  
> the clouds, the trees, the flowers, the birds. Today, none of  these  
> miraculous creations will escape my notice.  
>  
> Today, I will share my excitement for life with other people.  I'll make  
> someone smile. I'll go out of my way to perform an unexpected  act of  
> kindness for someone I don't even know.  
>  
> Today, I'll give a sincere compliment to someone who seems down.  I'll  
> tell a child how special he is, and I'll tell someone I love  just how  
> deeply I care for them and how much they mean to me.  
>  
> Today is the day I quit worrying about what I don't have and  start being  
> grateful for all the wonderful things God has already given me.  
>  
> I'll remember that to worry is just a waste of time because my  faith in  
> God and his Divine Plan ensures everything will be just fine.  
>  
> Tonight, before I go to bed, I'll go outside and raise my eyes  to the  
> heavens. I will stand in awe at the beauty of the stars and the  moon,  
> and I will praise God for these magnificent treasures.  
>  
> As the day ends and I lay my head down on my pillow, I will  thank the  
> Almighty for the best day of my life. And I will sleep the sleep  of a  
> contented child, excited with expectation because I know  tomorrow is  
> going to be ......
