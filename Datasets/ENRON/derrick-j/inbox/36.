Rob:

We'll save:  

Annual Renewals: $25,000
Library Rent:         $10,000  ( $25 x 400 sift free up approx. 400 sift for office space)
Labor Cost:           $  9,600  ( 40 hrs. a month, $20 an hour)
____________________________________________________
Total:                    $44,600

We'll enjoy higher discount and benefit more from our current flat rate contracts with Lexis and Westlaw if internet and online services are our only options.   Lexis is set as $55 per ID per month for unlimited usage.  We have 175 users in Legal, pay about $9,625 while our actual usage is $35,000 - $40,000 a month.  Westlaw is set at $8,000 a month for usage up to $16,000 a month.  We pay $8,000 - $9,000 to Westlaw while our usage is about $14,000 a month.  

Best of all, federal and state statues and rules are more current with government and state websites and on Lexis/Westlaw than printed books.  I have custom weblinks of Lexis and Westlaw on our portal.  Trainings are offered to let folks to see how we have made search Lexis and Westlaw so easy.  My goal is moving us towards a virtual library.  

I've not gotten any objections with my weeding proposal.  I'll wait to Tuesday, 5/22 to proceed with my plan.  I welcome your suggestions and advice.


Have a nice weekend!

Thanks,
Sylvia

Dear General Counsels:

For Your Attention

With the launch of our legal portal - Enron Legal Edge http://legaledge.corp.enon.com, all our legal people now can easily access corporate records, research tools, core legal publications and many other business tools needed to perform our work from the portal anytime anywhere around the world.  I would like to take this opportunity to discontinue paper susbscriptions of many titles that are now available on the internet and on Lexis and Westlaw services.  I'll weed the following titles and make office space for Corporate Secretary's staff.  If you are interested in keeping any of the books in your office, let me know by Friday, 5/18.  I will have the books boxed and shipped to you. Your office then will be reponsible for renewal and update with your budget.  Any books not claimed by Friday will be donated to the public library or discarded.    

Discontinued Titles -
