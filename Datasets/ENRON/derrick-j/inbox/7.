Mr. Derrick,

Like last year, we are preparing the Director's Disclosures in connection with our filing of the 2000 audited financial statements of our Singapore office.  This disclosure requires certain information regarding your holdings of Enron stock and stock options.  Regarding stock options, I have requested the necessary information from Elaine Overturf (Corporate Secretary's office), however, I need the following information regarding your Enron Corp (ENE) stock holdings:

Balance at beginning year?  (should be 69,013 shares, the ending balance shown on last year's disclosure) (please confirm this amount)
Acquired during the year?
Disposed during the year?
Balance at end of year?

Once I have obtain this information, I will forward the completed disclosure forms for your signature.

Thank you,
Frank Lobdell
