Jim, I do not know  if Ben or Kristina have counsel or if any other people who are getting worried  have made decisions yet but there is a former U. S.  Attorney  from Omaha, named Ed Warin at the McGrath North firm  with whom I've worked who is superb. I recognize that many of the Texas firms  may be conflicted and people may not be comfortable with all the Washington,  D.C. folks. This guy is an excellent lawyer,  knows his way around and is  very decent to work with.
