Jim, this is the latest inquiry into the existence of the Employment Practices coverage. You will recall we were trying to maintain on a confidential basis.  It is becoming more and more difficult to avoid talking about this insurance as the exposure is often discussed in the press.  Do you have any thoughts on disclosure to NEPCO?

Mike,  According to a recent decision by the Washington Supreme Court, a
supervisor can be held personally liable for job-related discrimination or
harassment.  We need to check out with Enron Insurance group to determine if
our current employment practice liability insurance covers a situation like
this.  The distinction is that if the plaintiff employee names the company,
we're covered, but he/she names only the supervisor "personally" would the
Enron insurance decline coverage?  

By copy to Dick Vincent, I am asking him to confirm this issue with our
insurance program.  If coverage exists, then should we document something in
the policy to specifically cover this new form of employment liability
unique to Washington State?

I am sending you our most recent ASAP.  Our ASAP's are our summaries of
recent developments in employment matters.
This ASAP addresses a recent case from the Washington State Supreme Court in
which that court held that individual supervisors can be held personally
liable for acts of unlawful harassment and discrimination.  This ruling
relates to the Washington state discrimination statute and not Title VII.
This ruling is contrary to federal law under Title VII where individual
supervisors are not personally liable for such acts.  Similarly, individual
supervisors are not subject to personal liability under the Texas Commission
on Human Rights Act.  It may be prudent for employers with workers in
Washington to review insurance and indemnity agreements to determine if
these contracts cover supervisors who may be sued for acts in the course and
scope of their employment.
