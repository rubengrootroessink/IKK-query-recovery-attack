Jim and Rob:
I hope you are both well and was really pleased to see that last week's
merger negotiations reached a successful outcome.This must have required an
incredible effort in the timescale and given everything else that is going
on.I very much hope this will allow  you to enjoy a more stable period after
the events of the last few weeks.You both have many friends at Linklaters
and we are all pulling for you at this time.
I also thought you may like to have a brief overview of the main areas in
which we are assisting at the moment.These are as follows:
1Merger:We are working with Robert Eickenroht on the UK/European anti-trust
aspects.This kicked off with a conference call today.Greatly appreciate the
instructions, Jim.
2Dabhol:We are continuing our role on Dabhol which is now primarily focused
on the litigation side and a major commitment for a 2 partner team-Chris
Walker is ,I believe, in Houston tomorrow to meet with Bruce Lundstrum and
others.Input from the projects side continues (principally in relation to
Sch 11,PPA) but is not likely to be extensive over the next month or so
given the current emphasis in India.
3Enron Europe:We are in close contact with Mark and have a number of ongoing
/ new matters.In particular, we have a dedicated team advising Europe on its
position and contingency planning for current circumstances-this team has
been liaising with Mark Haedicke and the Weil Gotchal team.We are also
assisting on some potential disposals in non core business areas.Our London
secondee remains in place.
4Other:We have a number of ongoing matters ranging from SEDCO litigation
through a bid for LNG purchases from Nigeria LNG.Given the understandable
emphasis on cost control at this time, it may be that we should review these
matters to determine whether you feel it appropriate to  scale back legal
spend in some areas?
On the question of payment,we have invoices totalling more than ?5 million
outstanding and this  level of commitment ,of course, continues to grow in
the light of our ongoing work.As mentioned on Friday, we do need to reduce
this to a more manageable level ( we are currently speaking with Mark and
Bruce, in particular, to find a way of achieving this) and your continuing
support in this effort would be greatly appreciated.
We really want to do all we can,at both a personal and professional level,
to support Enron at this time-I am particularly conscious of the support and
friendship you have given to me over the years.If there is anything else we
can do, please do call me at any time.For convenience my nos. are:
W:44 207 456 5912
M:44 7733 124030
H:44 1959 533292
Best Wishes
Stuart
