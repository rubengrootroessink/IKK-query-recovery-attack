EPA ISSUES TWO RADIATION STANDARDS FOR YUCCA MOUNTAIN
REPOSITORY

EPA upholds stringent radiation standards for the proposed
Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear waste repository in
Nevada. In its final version of radiation standards for
Yucca Mountain, EPA lets stand the 15 millirem per year
standard it proposed in 1999 for all pathways of exposure.
EPA issues a separate 4 millirem standard for radiation in
ground water. The EPA standard wins guarded support from
opponents of the Yucca Mountain facility. . . . Page AA-1

SCIENCE PANEL TELLS WHITE HOUSE GLOBAL WARMING LIKELY TO
CONTINUE

Greenhouse gas emissions are still causing the Earth to
warm, and more research is needed to curtail existing
uncertainties in climate change science, a committee of the
National Research Council advises the White House. "We know
that greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's
atmosphere, causing surface temperatures to rise," writes
the committee chairman. The committee says it was not part
of the committee's charge to make policy recommendations for
dealing with potential effects of climate change. . . . Page

NORTON PROMISES INTERIOR WILL HONOR BANS ON OFFSHORE OIL,
GAS DRILLING

The Bush administration will respect congressional bans on
offshore oil and gas drilling, but may investigate the need
to change the law, Interior Secretary Norton tells a House
committee during a hearing on the Bush administration's
National Energy Policy Report. . . . Page A-2

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT STRIKES MOST VIRGINIA RESTRICTIONS ON
TRASH IMPORTS

Provisions of Virginia's solid waste management law, enacted
to limit the amount of out-of-state waste that can be taken
to landfills in the state, violate the U.S. Constitution, a
federal appeals court rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit says four of five provisions, enacted in
1999 in response to the growth of regional landfills in the
state and an influx of municipal solid waste from New York
and elsewhere, violate constitutional restrictions on state
action.  . . . Page A-2

FUNGICIDE TASK FORCE SEEKS MORE TIME FOR CARBAMATE
ASSESSMENT

A deadline for grouping carbamate pesticides for a
cumulative risk assessment should be flexible, an industry
task force writes in comments to EPA. The Dec. 31 deadline
was set by EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council in
a consent decree, which also imposed additional deadlines on
EPA for its pesticide reassessments and which could be
approved by a federal court next week. . . . Page A-5

ADMINISTRATION REQUESTS FUNDS FOR CLEANUP OF URANIUM WASTE
SITE

Lobbying efforts by a bipartisan group of lawmakers lead the
Bush administration to add $1.4 million to its fiscal year
2002 budget request to plan the cleanup of a southern Utah
uranium waste site. Contamination from the site could
threaten the Colorado River, a major source of drinking
water for 25 million residents in western states. . . . Page

RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS DECIDE TO ALLOW IMPORT OF SPENT NUCLEAR
FUEL

Russia's parliament approves a legislative package that
would allow the country to import spent nuclear fuel from
abroad. The government, which strongly lobbied for the
bills, hopes to make about $20 billion by importing spent
nuclear fuel for reprocessing and storage in Russia. To
become law, the bills still must be approved by parliament's
upper house and signed by President Putin. . . . Page A-9

CONFIDENTIAL DATA SOUGHT ON EFFECT OF BIOTECH CROPS ON
BUTTERFLIES

The Union of Concerned Scientists asks EPA to release
confidential data on the effects of biotech crops on the
Monarch butterfly. In a Freedom of Information Act request,
the group seeks data generated by academic and government
scientists and submitted to EPA by makers of
plant-incorporated protectants. A substantial part of the
data being sought on Bt corn and the Monarch is claimed as
confidential. . . . Page A-6

SUPPORT OFFERED FOR DOT PROPOSAL ON SHORT HAZARDOUS LIQUID
PIPELINES

Pipeline safety experts and portions of regulated industry
file comments in support of a Department of Transportation
proposal to extend integrity management requirements to
shorter hazardous liquid pipelines. The proposed rule would
affect pipelines shorter than 500 miles that pass through
highly populated or environmentally sensitive areas. . . .

U.S., SINGAPORE TRADE TALKS COULD BE SLOWED BY ENVIRONMENT
ISSUE

The continuing dispute between Republicans and Democrats in
Congress over how to handle labor and environmental issues
in trade negotiations could slow talks now under way between
the United States and Singapore for a free trade agreement,
the first between the United States and an Asian nation, by
the end of the year. . . . Page A-11

CORROSION BLAMED FOR RUPTURED PIPELINE CAUSING OIL SPILL IN
BRAZIL

A ruptured pipeline spills 200,000 liters (52,000 gallons)
of fuel oil in a suburb of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city,
causing serious damage to several homes. The state oil
company Petrobras says the pipeline was carrying residual
fuel oil from one Petrobras refinery in southeastern Sao
Paulo state to another for processing. . . . Page A-8

STATE GRANTS: Draft guidance on a proposed state enforcement
grant program is being developed by EPA and may be published
for comment by the end of this month. As part of the fiscal
2002 budget request for EPA, President Bush proposed a $25
million state enforcement grant program. EPA is circulating
a draft framework for three options to administer the grant
program. . . . Page A-4

EMERGENCY PLANNING: Arizona Portland Cement Co. of Rillito,
Ariz., agrees to pay $82,442 in a settlement with EPA over
alleged failure to report releases of nickel and cobalt into
the environment between 1996 and 1998.  The violations were
uncovered during an EPA inspection of the facility. . . .

HAZARDOUS WASTE: Retroactive application of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act would withstand constitutional
scrutiny, a U.S. magistrate judge rules and refuses to allow
a defendant, Mallinckrodt, Inc., to amend its pleadings to
challenge the law's retroactive application in a case
involving mercury pollution in Maine. . . . Page A-7

treaties on hazardous waste, ozone-depleting chemicals, and
endangered species say that the growth in illegal trade
highlights the need for improved enforcement.  . . . Page
