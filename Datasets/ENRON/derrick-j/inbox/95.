jim,  sorry i could not stay in austin for the formal "thank you" to you for your leadership this past year.  i would add "well done" and please "stay around"!

i would like to follow up on knowing whom i should contact, with your advance permission, for securing legal representation from enron corp. for the firm.  candidly does vicki sharp's position inhibit our serving in that capacity?  i know you approved us 2 years ago but we have not been contacted at all for representation.  we have turned down putative claims against enron for multiple reasons, even those where our role would not have been apparent.
 i believe we can provide cost effective, quality representation in multiple areas of expertise (see our web site at www.gpsolaw.com) and enron would be well served.  let me know your thoughts, on a confidential basis, and i will act accordingly.  i enjoyed having lunch with carrin  as well and i wish you "patience and luck" on your home remodelling.  best personal regards,   roger
