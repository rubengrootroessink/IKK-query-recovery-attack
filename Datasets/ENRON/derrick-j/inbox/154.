Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Most pressingly, I'd like to discuss our ability to compete with a company with which we've been in discussions -- if possible by the latter part of the week.

Thank you.

Heath
