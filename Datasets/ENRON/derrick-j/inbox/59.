ALBANIA

-=09Grenade explodes in market, nine injured

In an example of the lack of safety in Albanian public life, Albanian polic=
e chief Bilbil Mema announced on Tuesday, May 29, that a grenade exploded i=
n a central Tirana fruit and vegetable market. The Chinese-made grenade inj=
ured nine people, two of them seriously. Although police have yet to determ=
ine a motive for the attack, it is likely related to ongoing battles among =
organized criminal elements in the country. Fueled by the active black mark=
et for arms that grew during the breakup of the Yugoslav Federation, Albani=
a over the past decade has become a hotbed for organized crime and a pictur=
e of instability. The consequent turf battles and bombings in public spaces=
 that endanger innocent passers by makes safety a major concern when travel=
ing to Albania. (Control Risks, May 31, 2001)

ALGERIA

-=09U.S. State Department Travel Warning

The United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens to evaluate caref=
ully the implications for their security and safety before deciding to trav=
el to Algeria. Although considerably fewer terrorist incidents have taken p=
lace in Algeria over the last three years, unpredictable attacks still occu=
r in rural villages, on roadsides and public transport, and at night. The m=
ost recent terrorist activity has occurred in rural areas in northern Alger=
ia. At the height of terrorist violence in Algeria, many commercial airline=
s cancelled service to and from Algeria. Since then, a number of carriers h=
ave resumed service, including one western airline. Most official foreign t=
ravel by U.S. Government employees and visitors is via chartered aircraft, =
although commercial carriers are sometimes used. The Department of State st=
rongly recommends that those Americans who travel to Algeria exercise maxim=
um caution and take prudent measures.  These include limiting use of regula=
rly scheduled commercial flights and being met and accompanied by pre-arran=
ged local contacts upon arrival and departure at airports. Nighttime and ov=
erland travel should be avoided.  Visitors to Algiers should stay only in t=
he large, internationally recognized hotels where security is provided. U.S=
. citizens should not move anywhere in Algeria unless accompanied by a know=
n Algerian companion. This applies to walking the streets of Algiers and ot=
her cities. U.S. Embassy personnel take all of the precautions mentioned ab=
ove. In addition, embassy employees and official visitors are restricted to=
 the embassy compound or their hotels except as necessary to conduct offici=
al business or limited personal business in the capital. All travel by offi=
cial Americans in Algiers is by armored car with appropriate security. U.S.=
 oil companies operating in the desert region south of the Saharan Atlas Mo=
untains have experienced no attacks in the past year. The Algerian governme=
nt and the companies themselves take stringent security precautions to ensu=
re their safety, including many of the measures described above. For furthe=
r information on travel to Algeria, please consult the Department of State'=
s latest Consular Information Sheet on Algeria at http://travel.state.gov. =
This replaces the Travel Warning dated March 31, 2000, to address the chang=
ing security conditions in Algeria. (U.S. State Department, May 31, 2001)

-=09Protests in Algiers and Oran as unrest in Kabylie continues

Peaceful protests took place in Algiers and Oran against the government and=
 in support of the Kabylie protesters on Monday, May 28. Riots and clashes =
with security forces in the Kabylie region continued over May 25-28, notabl=
y in Tizi Ouzou, Bejaia and Bouira, and unrest spread to the Boumerdes regi=
on. The protests in Algiers and Oran were both against a restrictive draft =
press law against the actions of the security forces in the Kabylie region.=
 The unrest in the Kabyle region is expected to continue in the short term.=
 There is a possibility that the cycle of mass protests, repression and unr=
est could spread to Algiers and Oran. Personnel planning trips to the count=
ry should monitor the situation closely and should postpone travel to Kabyl=
ie until the region stabilizes. The unrest will not affect the oil-producin=
g regions of Hassi Messaoud and Hassi R'Mel. (Control Risks, May 29, 2001)

ARGENTINA

-=09Protesters threaten to block international flights

Members of the Aeronautic Workers' Association (APA) on Monday, May 28, att=
empted to block Iberia flight 6844 out of Ezeiza International Airport, wer=
e demanding payment of April salaries. Protesters threatened to block all i=
nternational flights from May 29 if the national airline Aerolineas Argenti=
nas continued to refuse to pay the salaries. This is likely to create delay=
s, with particular focus on Spanish airlines SpanAir, Air Plur and Iberia. =
However, all business travelers are advised to contact their airlines for t=
he latest information and to establish whether alternative travel arrangeme=
nts have been made. Furthermore, it is expected that disruption to Aeroline=
as Argentinas flights and to those of its domestic subsidiary Austral will =
continue. Personnel are advised to monitor the situation, expect demonstrat=
ions and a heavy police presence at the airport and avoid all protests to m=
inimize their exposure to incidental violence. (Control Risks, May 29, 2001=

BAHRAIN

-=09Heightened terrorist threat alert for US military=20

US military forces in Bahrain are on a higher state of alert after a weeken=
d threat against American targets there, US officials reportedly said. The =
roughly 1,400 US military personnel were ordered to move to the Pentagon's =
second-highest state of alert after "a specific threat," the officials said=
, and are meant to warn that some form of terrorist action is imminent; alt=
hough, the particular target had not been identified. Pentagon officials to=
ld media the alert is not related to the May 29 conviction in a New York co=
urt of four terrorists believed by the US to be connected to terrorist susp=
ect Osama bin Laden. The four were convicted of conspiracy in the 1998 bomb=
ings of two US Embassies in East Africa in which 224 people died. US forces=
 in the Persian Gulf region were last ordered to Threat Condition Delta, th=
e highest alert, after the October terrorist bombing of the destroyer USS C=
ole in the Yemeni port of Aden that killed 17 US sailors and wounded 35 oth=
ers. No equivalent warning has been issued by the US State Department; alth=
ough, it cautioned of a sustained threat of possibly politically motivated =
violence in Bahrain arising from continuing regional tensions. (Control Ris=

BANGLADESH

-=09Islamist protests possible at conference in Dhaka on June 1-2

A conference entitled 'Fundamentalism and communalism in South Asia', which=
 is being held on Friday and Saturday, June 1-2, at the Osmani Memorial Aud=
itorium in Dhaka, is expected to attract protests from conservative Islamic=
 organizations. Religious organizations in Bangladesh are extremely sensiti=
ve to criticism and the authorities' efforts to restrict their role in soci=
ety, and will object to the conference, which has been set up to discuss th=
e ways in which the spread of religious extremism can be prevented in the r=
egion. Personnel should avoid any protests that take place to reduce the ri=
sk of being involved in any clashes between protesters and security force p=
ersonnel. (Control Risks, May 31, 2001)

BOLIVIA

-=09Farmers' union threatens further action for July 1

Leader of the Bolivian Confederation of Rural Workers' Unions (CSUTCB) Feli=
pe Quispe on Monday, May 28, warned of renewed direct action after July 1. =
The warning comes over the government's inability to keep promises that it =
made to end the previous round of protests that paralyzed much of the count=
ry between April 9 and May 3. This inability will cause further protests an=
d social unrest will remain high. If the main trades union confederation th=
e Bolivian Workers Confederation (COB) fails to receive concessions from th=
e government on its separate demands, protests are likely to once again mak=
e travel and communication extremely difficult. The COB has shown recently =
that it has the organizational power to cause major disturbances when it ch=
ooses, though these are largely peaceful. Protests are likely to continue u=
ntil a satisfactory solution can be found. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

BRAZIL

-=09Veteran political leader resigns from Senate, attacks government

Veteran political leader and key government ally Ant?nio Carlos Magalh?es o=
f the centre-right Liberal Front Party (PFL) resigned his Senate (Upper Hou=
se) seat on Wednesday, May 30, rather than face expulsion over allegations =
of breaking the secrecy of a Senate vote. The government hopes that such a =
high-profile resignation will satisfy opposition parties who have been push=
ing for a full congressional inquiry into high-level corruption allegations=
. However, as corruption will become a key campaign issue, it remains to be=
 seen whether several key pro-business reforms that are currently before Co=
ngress will be passed before campaigning begins in earnest. Magalh?es may n=
ow be tempted to reveal his extensive knowledge of public corruption and he=
 is unlikely to back the coalition candidate in the 2002 presidential elect=
ion. Travel Up to 50,000 people are expected to demonstrate on May 31 and J=
une 1 in the central Lago de Pelourinho area of Salvador (Bahia state) in s=
upport of Magalh?es. Business travelers should expect some disruption to tr=
ansport and avoid demonstrations if possible, because of possible criminal =
activity. (Control Risks, May 31, 2001)

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

-=09U.S. State Department Travel Warning

The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to defer travel to the Central =
African Republic due to the uncertain security situation following an attem=
pted coup in the capital city of Bangui. On May 28, military forces loyal t=
o former President Kolingba launched an attack on a number of government an=
d military installations. There are reports of sporadic fighting in Bangui =
and its suburbs; other regions of the Central African Republic remain calm.=
  Bangui's international airport is under government control but is closed =
to regularly scheduled commercial air service. Although the conflict does n=
ot appear to be directed toward U.S. citizens or the general civilian popul=
ation, the U.S. Embassy has advised U.S. citizens in Bangui to review their=
 personal security situations and to remain in their homes until the situat=
ion stabilizes. The Embassy has temporarily suspended operations to the pub=
lic, and its ability to provide consular assistance to U.S. citizens in the=
 Central African Republic is severely limited. American citizens needing em=
ergency assistance should contact the Embassy by calling (236) 61-0200. For=
 further information on travel to the Central African Republic, consult the=
 Department's latest Consular Information Sheet for the Central African Rep=
ublic available via the Internet at http://travel.state.gov. (U.S. State De=
partment, May 30, 2001)

-=09Nationwide curfew, military operations in southern Bangui follow attemp=
ted coup

President Ange Felix Patasse declared a curfew in the capital Bangui on Mon=
day, May 28, following the suppression of an attempted coup. Reports on the=
 morning of May 29 suggested that automatic weapon fire was taking place am=
id continuing military operations in southern Bangui. Personnel should main=
tain a low profile and where possible remain indoors, observing the terms o=
f a nationwide 6:00 am to 6:00 pm curfew. All visits to the south of the ca=
pital, and to the vicinity of the presidential residence at which the coup =
attempt took place, should be postponed until the level of uncertainty has =
decreased. The possibility of further fighting and instability is credible.=
 The reports of shots being fired in southern Bangui on May 29 almost certa=
inly reflect the security forces' efforts to eliminate the source of the co=
up attempt. Business travelers scheduled to visit Bangui may wish to defer =
travel until the situation stabilizes. (Control Risks, May 29, 2001)

CHILE

-=09Major crimes up sharply

Serious crimes increased significantly in Chile during the first trimester =
of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000. The number of reports of viole=
nt assault rose 42.4 percent while cases of murder or rape rose 51 and 42 p=
ercent respectively. Robberies rose by 10 percent while burglaries increase=
d 18 percent. Overall, crimes against persons rose 43.6 percent, while crim=
es against property rose by 12.9 percent. The year before, assaults had ris=
en by 31.7 percent in 2000 over 1999. Santiago and its suburbs were the are=
as hit hardest by the increases in crime. The number of arrests also rose, =
but by smaller percentages. Chile remains one of the safest countries for v=
isitors in Latin America. Nonetheless, as these statistics demonstrate, the=
 rate of crime is increasing in Chile. Victims who do not resist are usuall=
y not harmed. Street crime is a problem in metropolitan Santiago in general=
 and specifically in the city center. In 1999, thirty-eight people were kil=
led in robbery attempts; of these 23 were shot, 11 were stabbed, and four w=
ere killed with blunt objects. (Pinkerton, May 30, 2001)

COLOMBIA

-=09Attack leaves eight dead

On Wednesday, May 30, approximately eight people were killed in the norther=
n village of Los Tupes when a group of armed men dressed in camouflage thre=
w grenades at homes during an early morning attack. The region has a heavy =
National Liberation Army (ELN) presence. (Air Security, May 31, 2001)

-=09Small bomb attacks in Cali continue fears of urban terrorist campaign

Two small bombs exploded in Cali in the early hours of Sunday, May 27, inju=
ring one man. The first device exploded outside a suburban police station. =
No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks though government and s=
ecurity force installations are favored targets of leftist insurgent groups=
. The spate of recent car bombings and attempted car bombings has raised fe=
ars of an urban terrorism campaign similar to that mounted in the later 198=
0s and early 1990s by the large drug cartels. Consequently, security has be=
en stepped up in Bogota, Medellin, Cali and other urban areas. Business per=
sonnel face a credible risk of incidental exposure to such attacks. Personn=
el should remain vigilant at all times and (especially in Cali and Medellin=
) may wish to limit their activities in central areas, above all in high-pr=
ofile commercial and entertainment venues which appear to be favored target=
s. (Control Risks, May 29, 2001)

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

-=09Violent protests raise concerns of prolonged unrest

Residents of Licey al Medio on Tuesday, May 29, used strike action and road=
blocks to protest at the jailing of Victor Breton, spokesman for the Broad =
Front for the Popular Struggle (FALPO), and other leaders from the northern=
 town of Naverrete. FALPO threatened to continue protests if the jailed lea=
ders are not released. The protests follow demonstrations in the northern S=
antiago region and renewed violence in the Capotillo suburb of Santo Doming=
o. Deteriorating economic conditions are likely to provoke further protests=
. Recurrent social unrest will raise concerns among foreign businesses oper=
ating in the Dominican Republic and could deter investment. The escalation =
of civil unrest comes as the government hopes to attract foreign investment=
 in the reopening of the Pueblo Viejo goldmine. While unrest is unlikely to=
 delay the project, political and economic instability could deter investor=
s. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

Cathay Pacific pilots are scheduled to meet on June 20 to decide on whether=
 to take industrial action from July 1. Strike action in July is likely to =
cause extensive disruption to the busy holiday air traffic. Personnel inten=

o change their flight arrangements. (Control Risks, May 31, 2001)

INDONESIA

-=09Legislators vote to impeach president

Indonesian lawmakers voted on Wednesday, May 30, overwhelmingly to seek a s=
pecial meeting of the Peoples' Consultative Assembly (MPR) that would have =
the power to impeach President Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur). Security forces=
 were on full alert in Gus Dur's East Java stronghold, where thousands of l=
oyalists have clashed with police and vandalized buildings linked to his op=
ponents. Since the most likely date for the MPR to convene is early August,=
 these developments leave the current government in limbo. The most likely =
scenario is that the MPR will vote to impeach the president and install Vic=
e-President Megawati Sukarnoputri as his successor. Frustrated in their att=
empt to stop the legislative vote, the president's supporters are likely to=
 step up the pressure on their political foes by engaging in more violent d=
emonstrations, particularly in East Java. Although major instability is unl=
ikely, foreign personnel should remain vigilant because events may lead to =
an escalation in the security situation at short notice. Jakarta and East J=
ava were tense but calm on May 31 following the impeachment. Protests remai=
n likely in Jakarta and Gus Dur's heartland of Surabaya and other parts of =
East Java over the next few days. Control Risks continues to advise that bu=
siness personnel undertake essential travel only to these areas. (Control R=

ISRAEL

-=09Palestinian extremists "kidnap" later release U.S. and British journali=
sts

A British photographer and an American journalist have been released after =
being detained by Palestinian group calling itself the Fatah Hawks. The pai=
r was held for five hours in south Gaza, along with a local translator and =
driver. The group described the detention as a kidnapping, undertaken to pr=
otest against the British and US governments, who they accuse of supporting=
 the Israeli government, as well against what they claimed was biased weste=
rn media coverage of the Palestinians in their confrontation with the Israe=
lis. The group also warned that other British and American citizens in Pale=
stinian areas might be kidnapped or killed in the future. The official Fata=
h movement has condemned the action and disassociated itself from the incid=
ent. The photographer said he and his colleague, chief of Newsweek's Jerusa=
lem bureau, had arranged an interview with the Fatah Hawks for midday on Ma=
y 29 and after about an hour of talking they were informed they had been ki=
dnapped. "They said the kidnap was largely symbolic," he said. "It was to s=
end a message to Bush and Blair that they held them responsible for the sit=
uation of the Palestinian people and once that message had been broadcast w=
e would be released. Apart from the striking demonstration of ineptness in =
dealing with western media, the incident is also indicative of the growing =
radicalization of the Palestinians and the proliferation of ever more extre=
me splinter groups. Palestinian Administration Chairman Yasser Arafat appea=
rs increasingly unable to control both his own Fatah subordinates and these=
 young extremists effectively and for sustained periods. Arafat has obtaine=
d no concessions from the Israelis who, under Prime Minister Sharon, have a=
lso retracted key territorial concessions for an eventual Palestinian state=
 that had been offered by his predecessor Ehud Barak. Indeed, on May 29 the=
 Israelis announced approval of construction bids for 496 new housing units=
 in settlements outside Jerusalem. (Pinkerton, May 30, 2001)

-=09Bomb placed on major Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway; Netanya again targeted=
 for bombing=20

On Tuesday night, May 29, a road maintenance crew discovered a bomb on the =
major highway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The bomb consisted of a gas c=
anister that was connected to a timing device. The bomb exploded as police =
officers were preparing to dismantle it, using a remote-controlled robot. A=
uthorities had to close the highway temporarily. It was the first time that=
 a bomb had been placed along this highway and the incident represented ano=
ther escalation in the violence related to the Palestinian uprising. On Wed=
nesday, May 30, an explosion occurred in an industrial area located in the =
eastern part of the city of Netanya. Two people were injured in the inciden=
t, which, according to a police official, appeared to be a terrorist attack=
. Netanya is located near the Palestinian-controlled town of Tulqarm and ha=
s witnessed terrorist attacks in the past, most recently on May 18, 2001, w=
hen a suicide bomber set off an explosion outside a shopping mall in the ci=
ty. In two other separate incidents yesterday, Palestinian gunmen killed th=
ree Jewish settlers in ambushes near Nablus, located in the northern part o=
f the West Bank, and near Bethlehem. Both attacks occurred in areas of the =
West Bank designated as Area C, meaning that they are under full Israeli co=
ntrol. Elements on the right of the Israeli political spectrum are putting =
renewed pressure on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to end the unilateral cease=
-fire he declared last week and retaliate against the Palestinians. Thus fa=
r, however, Sharon has insisted that he will continue to exercise restraint=
. (Air Security, May 30, 2001)

-=09Risk ratings reduced in West Bank, Gaza

Control Risks has reassessed the travel and security risks in the West Bank=
 and Gaza and has reduced the risks from EXTREME to HIGH. Although the conf=
lict between militant Palestinian activists and Israeli military forces con=
tinues and is not expected to end in the foreseeable future, it is confined=
 to certain locations and does not generally affect foreign business person=
nel in the occupied territories. Gun battles generally take place in areas =
near Israeli settlements or roads leading to the settlements, and clashes s=
ometimes take place at Israeli military posts near Palestinian refugee camp=
s. Essential business travel to most Palestinian towns, including Ramallah,=
 Nablus, Jenin and Gaza City, is possible with appropriate planning, includ=

-=09Manila imposes news blackout on resort kidnappings

On Tuesday, May 29, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo imposed a news blacko=
ut on Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) operations against Abu Sayyaf G=
roup (ASG) rebels who kidnapped 20 persons, including three Americans, from=
 the Dos Palmas beach resort off Palawan early May 27. She announced the bl=
ackout at her weekly news conference just hours after the ASG threatened a =
mass killing of the hostages if the military launched an assault on its bas=
es in the south. The same day, a spokesman for the US Department of State c=
alled for the unconditional release of all the hostages, including the thre=
e Americans among them. Asked if Washington shared Manila's position of not=
 paying the kidnappers, and promising to use force to free them, the spokes=
man said, "I think everyone is familiar with our policy, which is against p=
aying ransom." (Pinkerton, May 30, 2001)

-=09U.S. State Department Public Announcement

A series of security-related incidents has made travel unsafe in certain ar=
eas of the Philippines. Violence during recent political demonstrations, ki=
dnappings of foreigners, and bombing incidents call for Americans to exerci=
se extreme caution throughout the Philippines. A group of tourists, includi=
ng Americans, were kidnapped from a resort on Palawan Island on May 27 by u=
nknown gunmen using boats. A similar incident was foiled with the loss of s=
everal Filipino lives at a resort on Samal Island, Davao del Norte on May 2=
2, 2001. While no one has claimed responsibility for these incidents, the A=
bu Sayyaf terrorist group (ASG) has taken hostage a number of Filipinos and=
 foreign tourists since April 2000. Some of these hostages were killed by t=
heir captors. In August 2000, the same group took credit for kidnapping a U=
.S. citizen. There is concern that the ASG or other groups may take additio=
nal actions against U.S. citizens and other foreigners. Americans should ex=
ercise great caution when considering travel to resorts on Mindanao and Pal=
awan. Violent political demonstrations on May 1 in the Malacanang area of M=
anila reportedly left two police officers and several protesters dead. Alth=
ough the violence has been brought under control, the possibility exists of=
 further such demonstrations. In late December 2000, a series of bombs expl=
oded in the Metro Manila area, including the cargo terminal at Ninoy Aquino=
 International Airport (NAIA), on December 30, 2000, killing 18 people and =
injuring 100. There have also been sporadic incidents of violence in southe=
rn Mindanao, including bombings in General Santos City and at the Cotabato =
Airport in Maguindanao Province, as well as bus hijackings on national high=
ways. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front reportedly has claimed responsibili=
ty for these actions. U.S. citizens are strongly cautioned to avoid all tra=
vel to the southern and western areas of the Island of Mindanao, to include=
 Zamboanga City, due to incidents of terrorism and violence. U.S. citizens =
should avoid travel to the islands of Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Jolo lo=
cated in the Sulu archipelago in the extreme southwest of the Philippines. =
American citizens should exercise great caution when considering travel to =
resorts in other parts of Mindanao as well as Palawan. For other informatio=
n on terrorist activities in this region, refer to the Department of State'=
s Public Announcement on Malaysia dated April 9, 2001. In view of these inc=
idents, and the possibility of future attacks, Americans are also urged to =
be particularly cautious in outdoor public areas and not approach or linger=
 in the vicinity of a bomb-related incident. Americans are cautioned not to=
 disturb suspicious objects or packages and should report any incidents to =
local authorities. If you are involved in or observe a bomb incident, immed=
iately notify the Embassy. For further general information on travel to the=

-=09Security, business revival foreseen in Johannesburg Central Business Di=
strict

Gauteng Province Finance and Economic Affairs representative Jabu Moleketi =
on Tuesday, May 29, forecast that within three years Johannesburg's Central=
 Business District (CBD) would experience a boom in business and property v=
alues. The city's business and security community cautiously endorses the p=
rovincial government's optimistic forecast, which reflects a gradual decrea=
se in crime levels in the CBD. Control Risks continues to advise that where=
 possible businesses should focus their operations in, and travelers should=
 stay in hotels in, the safer northern suburbs such as Sandton. However, th=
e gradual reduction in the incidence of crime in the CBD, lower property pr=
ices and problems with logistics and traffic circulation in the northern su=
burbs means that a revival in business interest in central property is like=
ly to take place gradually. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

TAJIKISTAN

-=09US embassy reissues warning against travel

The US on Wednesday, May 30, renewed its warning that US citizens should no=
t travel to Tajikistan in the face of a possible attack from Islamic milita=
nts. The warning underlines Control Risks long-standing advice about the ri=
sks of travel to Tajikistan. Fighters for the Islamic Movement of Uzbekista=
n (IMU) are currently preparing for annual summer attacks into Uzbekistan a=
nd Kyrygzstan as mountain passes clear. Hence, Control Risks has raised the=
 security and travel risks in Tavildera district in central Tajikistan, whe=
re the IMU is currently based, and the border areas with Kyrgyzstan to EXTR=
EME from HIGH. The Garm district, where the IMU has long been based, and th=
e Afghan border are also at EXTREME security and travel risk. Control Risks=
 continues to advise against travel to these areas during the coming months=
. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

-=09U.S. State Department Travel Warning

The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to defer all travel to Tajikist=
an. Due to threats to Americans and American interests worldwide, instabili=
ty in Tajikistan, and the limited ability to secure the safety of embassy p=
ersonnel at the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe in their current facility, the Dep=
artment of State suspended Embassy operations there and temporarily relocat=
ed all American diplomatic personnel to Almaty, Kazakhstan in September 199=
8. Although the political climate has improved, the situation remains unpre=
dictable. During the summer periods of 1999 and 2000, Tajikistan experience=
d incursions of armed militants loyal to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan=
 (IMU), which the Secretary of State has designated as a foreign terrorist =
organization. In both years, IMU forces took foreigners hostage. There have=
 been reports indicating an incursion by the IMU into Tajikistan may occur =
again this year. Americans should in particular avoid areas along the borde=
rs with Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan, the Karategin Valley, and Tavildara Dis=
trict. The "suspended operations" status of the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe ha=
s been lifted, with U.S. Embassy American personnel currently residing in A=
lmaty, Kazakhstan traveling periodically to Tajikistan. Consular services f=
or Tajikistan are handled in coordination with the U.S. Embassy in Almaty a=
nd emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Tajikistan may be limite=
d or unavailable. American citizens resident in Tajikistan are urged to con=
sider their personal security and safety in view of this warning. For furth=
er information concerning travel to Tajikistan consult the latest Consular =
Information Sheet for Tajikistan, available on the World Wide Web at http:/=
/travel.state.gov. This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning for Taji=
kistan issued August 30, 2000, to update the security situation. (U.S. Stat=

VENEZUELA

-=09Coup rumors circulating freely

An anonymous ad in the conservative Washington Times on Thursday, May 24, h=
as stimulated new rumors of a military coup d'etat against populist Preside=
nt Hugo Chavez. The ad said that a "National Emergency Junta" was seeking C=
havez's immediate resignation. It accused Chavez of being responsible for t=
he high level of insecurity in the country, for the economic crisis, for ma=
king military personnel work on civilian projects, for corruption, and for =
supporting a covert Cuban communist intervention in the country. Since the =
ad rumors of military plots have circulated so widely that Chavez, currentl=
y on a visit to China, felt he had to address the country to denounce the r=
umors. His Minister of Defense, widely unpopular with the military, said th=
e government knew who was trying to destabilize the country, charging that =
the plotters were counting on US government support, but he knew that Washi=
ngton would never support a coup because it was not interested in "adventur=
es" of this type. Local analysts state that there is clearly considerable a=
nti-Chavez sentiment among various levels of the military and the upper cla=
sses. Moreover, Chavez's recent talk of declaring a state of emergency, whi=
ch would give him even greater powers, has provided additional ammunition t=
o anyone disposed to a military takeover. However, one can safely presume t=
hat Washington, despite its differences with Chavez, would not support any =
effort to overthrow Venezuela's democratically elected president. (Pinkerto=

WORLDWIDE CAUTION=20

-=09U.S. State Department Public Announcement

The U.S. Government learned in early May 2001 that American citizens abroad=
 might be the target of a terrorist threat from extremist groups with links=
 to Usama Bin Ladin's Al-Qaida organization. In the past, such individuals =
have not distinguished between official and civilian targets. As always, we=
 take this information seriously. U.S. Government facilities worldwide rema=
in at a heightened state of alert. On May 29, the defendants in the case of=
 U.S. v. Bin Ladin were found guilty on a number of counts in connection wi=
th the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar Es Salaam, =
Tanzania. The U.S. Government is not aware of any specific threat in respon=
se to the verdicts. Nevertheless, U.S. citizens are urged to maintain a hig=
h level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their securi=
ty awareness to reduce their vulnerability. Americans should maintain a low=
 profile, vary routes and times for all required travel, and treat mail and=
 packages from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. In addition, American cit=
izens are also urged to avoid contact with any suspicious, unfamiliar objec=
ts, and to report the presence of the objects to local authorities. Vehicle=
s should not be left unattended, if at all possible, and should be kept loc=
ked at all times. U.S. Government personnel overseas have been advised to t=
ake the same precautions. In addition, U.S. Government facilities have and =
will continue to temporarily close or suspend public services as necessary =
to review their security posture and ensure its adequacy. U.S. citizens pla=
nning to travel abroad should consult the Department of State's Public Anno=
uncements, Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets, and regional trave=
l brochures, all of which are available at the Consular Affairs Internet we=
b site at http://travel.state.gov. We will continue to provide updated info=
rmation should it become available. American citizens overseas may contact =
the American Citizens Services unit of the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulat=
e by telephone or fax for up-to-date information on security conditions. In=
 addition, American citizens in need of emergency assistance should telepho=
ne the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate before visiting the Embassy or Con=
sulate. This Public Announcement supersedes the Public Announcement - World=
wide Caution of May 11, 2001 to inform Americans of the verdict in U.S. v. =
Bin Ladin. This Public Announcement expires on August 29, 2001. (U.S. State=

WORLDWIDE TERRORIST THREATS

-=09Embassy bombing convictions unlikely to lead to retaliation against bus=
iness targets

A New York (US) jury on Tuesday, May 29, found four men guilty of conspirin=
g with Saudi-born Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden to bomb the US embassie=
s in Nairobi (Kenya) and Dar es-Salaam (Tanzania) in 1998. Although all fou=
r face life in prison without parole, two defendants may face the death pen=
alty. Islamic extremist groups associated with bin Laden may plan retaliato=
ry attacks in response to the verdicts. Should the two receive the death pe=
nalty, their date of execution would provide a date around which attacks mi=
ght be expected. The bin Laden networks focus on US and British military, d=
iplomatic and defense company targets. Those facilities and personnel in th=
e Arabian peninsula have faced a MEDIUM security risk since October 2000. H=
owever, the networks are unlikely to target business interests in retaliati=
on. Tourist targets are also unlikely to be targeted, with the exception of=
 tourist sites in Jordan. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

ZIMBABWE

-=09Departing travelers face currency confiscation

The commissioner of the Zimbabwe Department of Customs and Excise Ranga Mun=
yaradzi conceded on Wednesday, May 30, that a large amount of foreign curre=
ncy has been seized from travelers leaving the country at both Harare inter=
national airport and the Beitbridge land border crossing. A rarely publiciz=
ed law relating to maximum cash removal is being enforced against all indiv=
iduals attempting to depart with sums of cash in excess of $500 or its equi=
valent in other foreign currency. Travelers are advised to take foreign cur=
rency out of Zimbabwe in the form of traveler's cheques, which are not subj=
