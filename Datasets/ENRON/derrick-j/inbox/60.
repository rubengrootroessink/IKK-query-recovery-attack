JEFFORDS, LIEBERMAN URGE SPEEDY IMPLEMENTATION OF NITROGEN
OXIDES RULE

Sens. Jeffords and Lieberman write EPA Administrator Whitman
to urge speedy implementation of a rule to control nitrogen
oxide emissions that affect the Northeast. The senators say
the rule's reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions "will
deliver tremendous public health and environmental
benefits." Their letter follows a federal appeals court
ruling upholding the EPA rule requiring power plants and
other large industrial air pollution sources in the Midwest
and Southeast to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. . . . Page

JEFFORDS TO LEAD SENATE ENVIRONMENT PANEL, FAVORS NEW
POLLUTION CONTROLS

Sen. Jeffords will chair the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee. Among the environmental issues of interest
to Jeffords are stricter controls on air pollution from
utilities. He introduced a bill in March (S. 556) to
regulate emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
carbon dioxide, and mercury from electric utilities. . . .

BUSH EXPECTED TO EMPHASIZE ENVIRONMENT IN SPEECH NEXT WEEK
IN FLORIDA

Following a call for improved maintenance of national parks,
President Bush is expected to emphasize other environmental
proposals at a speech in the Florida Everglades next week.
Speaking at Sequoia National Park, Bush announces a National
Parks Legacy Project, seeking to eliminate a maintenance
backlog in the national parks system over the next five
years. Bush also uses his remarks at Sequoia to cite
environmental progress made in recent decades. . . . Page

MOTOROLA WINS JURY VERDICT IN LAWSUIT OVER TRICHLOROETHYLENE
CONTAMINATION

An Arizona Superior Court jury returns a verdict in favor of
Motorola Inc., in a decade-long, class-action lawsuit
concerning the company's dumping of trichloroethylene at its
Scottsdale facility. The ruling means Motorola will not have
to pay damages to about 20,000 homeowners and business
owners located near the facility. Plaintiffs in the case had
argued that the dumping of the trichloroethylene and
subsequent contamination of ground water in a six- to
eight-square-mile plume lowered property values. . . . Page

ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS MAY RUSH WETLANDS PERMITS FOR ENERGY
PROJECTS

With the Bush administration focusing on increased energy
production, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is bracing for
the onslaught of permit applications associated with
drilling and power plant construction. The chief of the
regulatory branch of the corps, which issues Clean Water Act
permits for activities that disturb wetlands, says his
office will try to expedite the permit process for the
construction of power plants. . . . Page A-9

INDUSTRY SEEKS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ENERGY, POLLUTION CONTROL
INNOVATIONS

Developers of innovative environmental technologies urge the
federal government to toughen energy efficiency standards,
expand incentives for innovations, and make regulations more
flexible. Testifying at a field hearing of the Senate
Environment Committee in New Hampshire, industry executives
describe how their firms are developing fuel cell
technology, power plant pollution controls, and ocean wave
and solar power. . . . Page A-2

NEARLY HALF OF STORAGE TANK TRUST FUND SPENT ON
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Nearly half of the funds from the Leaking Underground
Storage Tanks Trust Fund used by states to clean up leaks
went to administrative expenses for the first half of fiscal
2001, according to a semiannual government report. EPA's
report reveals that 43 percent of the trust fund's money
spent by states during the first half of the year went to
administrative needs. . . . Page A-9

EPA ADVISORY PANEL ON ARSENIC EXAMINES TWO ESTIMATES OF COST
OF RULE

An EPA advisory panel ends the first round of meetings to
review the costs of tightening the arsenic standard in
drinking water by listing differences between the EPA
estimate and the higher cost estimates from the American
Water Works Association. The review, along with a
corresponding National Academy of Sciences study of health
benefits, was ordered by EPA Administrator Whitman after the
Bush administration suspended a new arsenic standard issued
during the closing days of the Clinton administration. . . .

STRONGER AUDITING SAID NEEDED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS

Businesses and public agencies seeking accreditation and
registration of their environmental management systems
should consider strengthening auditor requirements and
certifying auditors and consultants, according to a report
prepared for EPA. The report, written by a panel of the
National Academy of Public Administration, is intended to
promote understanding of how the International Standards
Organization's "ISO 14001" accreditation, registration, and
auditing system works in the United States and to identify
areas where it needs to be strengthened. . . . Page A-4

CONGRESS, EPA URGED TO INCREASE SHARE OF AGENCY FUNDS USED
FOR RESEARCH

A federal advisory committee wants Congress and EPA to
increase the share of the agency's budget that goes for
research. The Science Advisory Board says the current
9-percent share of EPA's funding used for research should
grow to a 12-percent share of the agency's budget. . . .

BUSH TO NOMINATE TRANSPORTATION EXECUTIVE FOR DOT HAZMAT
POST

The White House announces President Bush's intention to
nominate Ellen G. Engleman, an executive with an alternative
transport research group, to be administrator of the
Department of Transportation's Research and Special Programs
Administration. RSPA is responsible for hazardous materials
regulation and pipeline safety. . . . Page A-8

SUPERFUND BILL WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL COMPLIANCE WITH STATE,
LOCAL RULES

Legislation (H.R. 2016) that would ensure the federal
government's compliance with federal, state, and local
hazardous waste laws is introduced in the House by Rep.
DeGette. The bill would amend the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to
subject federal facilities and agencies to all federal,
state, interstate, and local requirements regarding response
or restoration actions taken after releases of hazardous
substances, according to the legislation. . . . Page A-7

UNITED KINGDOM: The Lord Chief Justice of Great Britain
proposes an environmental court to handle a broad array of
cases before specialist judges. Chief Justice Woolf says the
court would need to be backed up by a regulatory system that
could evaluate the work of scientists. The judge says he
supports such a court because he is frustrated with
incompetence over issues such as genetically modified crop
experiments, mad cow disease, and foot-and-mouth disease. .
