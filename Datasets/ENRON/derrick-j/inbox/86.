Part One

The New Power Company BOD 9/5/2001 - the directors requested an offsite strategy meeting after the BOD meeting on 9/5/2001.  Will you be available between the hours of 1 - 4:00 p.m. EST?  

Part Two

Joanne Gregory - Winston & Strawn

She said the date of June 27th is good for herself and all these people.  She said there are more people she wants to bring.  To date, she wants to bring:  

Herself
Bruce Toth - Corp.
Jerry Farano - Broadband
Steve Molo - Litigator
Chris Mcisaac - Energy Project/Facility Deals
Chris Chase
Charlie Papavizas - Maritime
Tim Oxley - Finance
Andy NcDonough - Finance

Who do you want to invite from here?
If you want a conference room meeting, I need to get a room she can use Power Point, which means either the Dining Room or the Board Room - which do you want?

Any help you can give me with regard to these two "Parts" would be gratefully appreciated.
