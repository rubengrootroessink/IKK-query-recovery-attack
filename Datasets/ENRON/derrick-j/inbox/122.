Dad,
As far as I know I will be coming back to the States around July 1. My last
day of school is June 23. I can?t say that I am looking forward to leaving
Madrid. It really takes a long time to become acclimated in a city like
Madrid. They say Its Like New York the first year is tough, but after a year
you can?t leave. I think I know how Woody Allen feels about the Island of
Manhattan. I realize though that my time here is coming to an end and I know
that I will cherish the memories of the good times and bad times resulting
in my 9 months here in Madrid. I really appreciate you giving me this
opportunity. I think it has been a very positive experience. love  Son.
