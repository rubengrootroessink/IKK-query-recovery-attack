I don't have Jim's or Robby's email address.  Steph, will you forward this to  
them along with the attached. 
I get the impression that from time to time different law firms court Enron  
to obtain a significant portion of the company's legal work. 
The attached paper which I received from my subscription to Law.com,  
discusses the future is now concept by which large companies like Enron will  
select law firms to provide services. 
If the time is not right, it might be a good idea to place this in a file for  
future reference.
