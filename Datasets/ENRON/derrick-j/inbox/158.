dear c & j~~~~the following FYI is based on hours of research i did out of the goodness and generosity of my [IMAGE] in preparation of our " Griswalds do NY Christmas 2001."  of course you can thank me later but for now here are some suggestions :
              date:    dec. 22-dec.27
      Having reviewed several (and i do mean several) hotels the Park Lane seems to be the most reasonable. (yes, we are looking at the economics of this adventure[IMAGE]) (rooms vs. suites)  this would mean reserving 5 rooms (car and jim; jan and bob; hol and tan; jim and cor; jo-jo).  room rates:  standard:  park view $251.00  city view $  205.00         play suggestions (based on seeing 3 plays; one on broadway; one off broadway and the radio city music hall christmas show)   on:   the producers   or   aida;    off:  blueman troop;  and radio city xmas show.  
          on broad: $230   off:  150   radio c m  $150
             after reviewing, please adivse either by phone or mail as to the next step.  i suggest we reserve our room accommodations, theatre tickets, plane reservations etc. ASAP[IMAGE]     keep in mind that what you have just reviewed is open
to discussion and any and all suggestions you elves might have.   upon finalizing our plans i will provide trip agendas for all good little boys and girls~~~~sorry jim, i guess you'll have to look on with carrin[IMAGE]             x0x0x0x0x0[IMAGE] jdg
