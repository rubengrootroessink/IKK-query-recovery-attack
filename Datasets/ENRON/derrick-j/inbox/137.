Rob, I am very sorry Enron is experiencing difficulty. If you need help and  I can help in any useful way, I can suspend seminary studies and keep full  credit for what I have done by way of course studies since the end of 1999. It  seems we need to focus on having credible people get to the bottom of things  they were not involved in, and act urgently to sustain remaining confidence, and  in time restore confidence. I still have my law license, and I am not particular  about titles etc. I invested a lot of time and effort in the Company working all  across its markets and assets. I am in excellent health, and can keep my lip  zipped and report to you if you want me to. 
 
Not proud,
