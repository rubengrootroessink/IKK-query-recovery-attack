Karen:  Did we send this release out today? (I haven't found it, if we did).  If we have not sent out, but may do so later, would you include me on the distribution?  These kind of releases have a huge impact on the legal representation and advice  that I am asked to give Enron and its executive management on a daily basis.  Thanks for your help, and have a great weekend.  Rex.
