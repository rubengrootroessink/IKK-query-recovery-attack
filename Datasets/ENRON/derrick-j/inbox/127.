Rex -- I don't normally pitch for my old firm, but GD&C has a pretty good group of SEC enforcement folks in their D.C. office and one of my former partners called asking if there would be any opportunity for them to assist in any way.  They understand that Enron has already retained counsel but are interested in any related representation of officers, directors, affiliates, etc.

I told them that I didn't think there was likely to be any opportunity for them at this point, but at Rob's suggestion I thought I would check with you to see if it would be useful for them to contact you.  

Hope things go well for us and that we can put this behind us and move on as quickly as possible.

Regards,
	John
