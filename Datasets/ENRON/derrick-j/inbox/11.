Below is the response from our broker commenting on the coverage issue posed by NEPCO.  Our confidential approach to this policy is in jeopardy as more and more people are creating a need to know and the "traffic" on this topic (internally and externally) has increase considerably. On this Nepco inquiry,  I suggest that I speak with David Lund on the coverage and request that he keep same confidential and advise his operations people that they need not pursue the issue any further.  Please advise if you concur?

On this same subject, I have received a request from Michelle Cash to notify our insurers of a potential "age discrimination " claim.  EEOC has made an "inquiry",  which means (according to Michelle), that they have received a complaint and want information. I have discussed with our broker, and they recommend, based upon review of the reporting provisions in the policy, that we file a report of a potential claim with underwriters. I do not have the all facts nor do I have copies of any of any documents, however, understand that this arises from the "Performance Review process". This is one we should discuss, as it could involve a large class of people.  Please give me a call.

Jim,
Your coverage, with AEGIS, does extend to the individual employees should
they be named as a defendant in employment related litigation. This was done
as there are other states where the courts have adopted a similar position.
Regards,
Paul

Have you been made aware of this decision?  What is the view on coverage
under our program?

Mike,  According to a recent decision by the Washington Supreme Court, a
supervisor can be held personally liable for job-related discrimination or
harassment.  We need to check out with Enron Insurance group to determine
if
our current employment practice liability insurance covers a situation like
this.  The distinction is that if the plaintiff employee names the company,
we're covered, but he/she names only the supervisor "personally" would the
Enron insurance decline coverage?

By copy to Dick Vincent, I am asking him to confirm this issue with our
insurance program.  If coverage exists, then should we document something
in
the policy to specifically cover this new form of employment liability
unique to Washington State?

I am sending you our most recent ASAP.  Our ASAP's are our summaries of
recent developments in employment matters.
This ASAP addresses a recent case from the Washington State Supreme Court
in
which that court held that individual supervisors can be held personally
liable for acts of unlawful harassment and discrimination.  This ruling
relates to the Washington state discrimination statute and not Title VII.
This ruling is contrary to federal law under Title VII where individual
supervisors are not personally liable for such acts.  Similarly, individual
supervisors are not subject to personal liability under the Texas
Commission
on Human Rights Act.  It may be prudent for employers with workers in
Washington to review insurance and indemnity agreements to determine if
these contracts cover supervisors who may be sued for acts in the course
and
scope of their employment.
