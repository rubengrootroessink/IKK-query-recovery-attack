Gail,

Andrew Rogers QC called me from Jakarta an hour or so ago to say that he had
reached agreement (by telephone) with Quentin Loh SC (the GOM's arbitrator)
that Lord Mustill should be appointed as the presiding arbitrator in each of
the 3 arbitrations between DPC and the GOM.

A letter will come out of Lord Mustill's Clerk confirming his acceptance of
the appointment. That will probably appear from London tommorrow.

The next round of conversations to be undertaken by Andrew Roger QC will be
with Mr Justice Pendse in relation to the arbitration between DPC and the
MSEB.

I attach Lord Mustill's curriculum vitae. Although Mustill is a busy man,I
think that his appointment is to be welcomed. Mustill was and is a
commercial lawyer to his fingertips. At the bar his practice was one
involving applied contract law (dry
shipping,commodities,insurance,reinsurance and banking,very much a
traditional Commercial Court practice). Along with Stewart Boyd QC he wrote
the standard text on the law of arbitration. Mustill's reputation as a judge
and an arbitrator is a strong one. His only drawback is that he is popular
arbitrator in London,and,for that reason,he is busy.

Can I ask that you circulate Lord Mustill's curriculum vitae to whoever
ought to receive it within the sponsors' group
