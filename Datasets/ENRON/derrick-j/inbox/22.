Jim, I am so glad that the 2001 law conference went so well -- we have received many favorable comments from the attendees.  Today we had a post-conference meeting with the group that worked on the conference, and we went over what worked well and what didn't.  It was very productive.

One of the things that came out of our meeting was the need to promptly appoint next year's Chairman of the CLE committee.  Michelle feels that putting that person in place now will greatly aid in the transition from this year to next year's planning.  As a matter of fact, she is meeting with her committee for the last time next week and would love to announce the new chair at that time.

So, could you please think about to whom you would like to give that distinct honor?  I've asked Michelle to e-mail you information about her committee and her suggestions regarding a chair.

Thanks so much for your help and input.
