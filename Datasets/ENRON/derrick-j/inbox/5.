Dad,
I really loved your response. I thought that it was extremly well written.
Fermenting grapes of wrath that was really well done. I appreciate you
putting up with my occasional lapses of judgment. MY time in Madrid is
rapidly shrinking away. Soon I will be boarding an airplane back to the good
ol USA and depending on my law school acceptance I will be coming to a fork
in my path. I will miss living in Madrid tremendously. It takes a while in
city such as this to feel at home and relaxed. I have been spending a lot of
time with a group of Spanish friends and have many good friends here that
because of geographic proximity will not see much of for some time. I had
this crazy dream last night that me and you had purchased a good size
sailboat and a huge box of hand carefully chosen novels and were setting off
on a sailing adventure around the world. That would be some adventure. I
have a book recommendation for you. A french writer by the name of Jean
Echenoz. The name of the book is Im Off. You might look for it if your in
the Book store. Once again I really enjoyed your response and keep me
update. Love, son
