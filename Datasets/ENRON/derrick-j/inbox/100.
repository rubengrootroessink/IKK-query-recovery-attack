This is the "near final" draft -- and the one Jim M. reviewed.  I'll send you the final when I receive my copy.  Thanks.

Subject:	Dabhol Power Project - Writ Petition

I attach a revised draft of the Writ Petition.  This is in its final form
subject to a final read through for typos (I am aware of the small glitch
with the paragraph numbering which is beyond my rudimentary typing skills)
and reformatting into legal size.  I will arrange for this to be done at our
open of business Wednesday and I expect to be able to forward a final
version of the document to Bombay by 8:30am Bombay time.  I should be
grateful if DPC would see to the few figures that still need to be inserted
into the draft.

You will note that we have removed the reference to the PPA as an exhibit to
the petition.  Exhibiting the PPA would, in our view, make the petition
unnecessarily bulky.  In any event the relevant provisions of the PPA are
set out in the PPA itself.

If you have any questions in relation to the draft, please let me know.

Kind regards
Andrew House
