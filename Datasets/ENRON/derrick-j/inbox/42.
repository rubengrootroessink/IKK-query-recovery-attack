j-i've seen several articles recently re enron and india and have thought of
you. in some ways it's hard to realize that one of us is involved in a
matter of such great significance in the affairs of a major world power.
what would jim roach think. i hope that all continues well with you and your
family. it's hard, i know, when work and travel are so demanding; but as we
have discussed on numerous occasions there is no substitute for family and
friends. i've little to report in the way of any interesting reading
recently; i've been spending time on books relating to bioethics and spanish
literature[actually, il've taken a liking to spanish mysteries; although
i've run out of our friend perez-reverte and am getting involved in some
suggested by my spanish teacher]. deborah and i are immersing ourselves in a
serious summer program of hiking and gardening and just enjoying our time
together; it's a great feeling to have lived with someone for 30+ years and
discover new and wonderful things.  hopefully you'll find occasion to share
a hike with us this
summer.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
