Subject:	Re: MSEB ltrs

Folks -

We received a copy of the MERC order granting interim relief.  The order grants the interim relief requested in Paragraph 202 (j) (no DPC pursuit of existing or initiation of new arbitration proceedings against MSEB) and (l) (no DPC actions under the escrow arrangements).

In my opinion, this grant of relief does not affect DPC's ability to (a) deliver Transfer Notices or further PTNs or (b) continue or initiate arbitrations against GOM/GOI.

MERC also indicated that it thinks that it has jurisdiction to consider the matters raised by MSEB in MSEB's petition but has reserved final judgment on the issue.

The next hearing is set for June 14.

We will scan the order and forward later today.

Bruce

Bruce,

Attached are letters received today from MSEB that reaffirm MSEB's rescission of the PPA and declare that MSEB will not make any payments to DPC and will no longer draw any power from DPC with effect from noon today.
