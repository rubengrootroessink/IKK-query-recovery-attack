EPA DELAYS PLAN TO STREAMLINE REGULATIONS FOR TREATING
WASTEWATER

A final rule to streamline regulations governing the
wastewater pretreatment program will be delayed until 2003
to allow EPA time to obtain and review additional
information pertaining to the regulation, according to the
director of the EPA Office of Wastewater Management. He says
that in addition to needing more information on the question
of acidity, the agency has had to divert resources away from
the rulemaking to other areas. EPA proposed changes to its
national pretreatment program in July 1999 to provide some
regulatory relief to industrial users and the publicly owned
treatment works into which they discharge wastewater. . . .

QUICK ACTION SET FOR PROPOSED HAZMAT TRANSPORT LOADING,
UNLOADING RULE

Despite industry opposition, the Department of
Transportation intends to move "as expeditiously as
possible" on a proposed rule clarifying hazardous materials
transportation regulations on loading, unloading, and
storage. In a notice slated for publication today, the
department's Research and Special Programs Administration
extends until Feb. 1, the comment period on the proposed
rule. Citing security concerns in the aftermath of the Sept.
11 terrorist strikes, hazardous materials industry groups
asked DOT to withdraw the proposed rule, arguing that the
proposal poses security problems. . . . Page A-1

FUGITIVE EMISSIONS NOT COUNTED TO DETERMINE MAJOR AIR
POLLUTION SOURCES

EPA no longer will count certain fugitive emissions of
nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and
other air pollutants considered nontoxic in determining
whether a facility is a "major source" of air pollution
subject to state operating permit programs. Fugitive
emissions are those that are not emitted from smoke stacks,
process vents or storage tanks. EPA says fugitive emissions
of toxic air pollutants will still be counted to determine
whether they are major sources. The decision will allow EPA
to grant full approval to Arizona and New York for their
operating permit programs. . . . Page A-3

REPORTING GUIDANCE PUBLISHED FOR MONITORING UNREGULATED
CONTAMINANTS

EPA issues reporting guidance for drinking water systems to
submit to the agency the results of monitoring, surveys, and
other assessments of unregulated contaminants.  The guidance
includes schedules for monitoring based on the size of a
drinking water system, on the source of the water, and on
the likelihood of finding unregulated contaminants. It also
contains guidelines for sampling and procedures for entering
data into EPA's national database. The data, required under
the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, will be
used to determine whether EPA will study further or develop
regulations for a list of contaminants developed in 1999. .

FORMER EPA OFFICIAL NAMED TO SOLID WASTE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE
POST

EPA names a former senior agency official to the post of
associate assistant administrator for solid waste and
emergency response. Thomas Dunne is appointed to the
position in the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency
Response, where he will work under Marianne Lamont Horinko,
the assistant administrator for that office. . . . Page A-7

SENATE DEMOCRATS FINISHING ENERGY LEGISLATION FOR
INTRODUCTION THIS WEEK

The Democratic authors of a comprehensive energy package
that may include contentious vehicle fuel efficiency
standards and measures for greenhouse gas reductions expect
Senate Majority Leader Daschle to introduce the legislation
as early as Thursday. Meanwhile, Senate Republican leaders
are threatening to attach their own energy bill to every
piece of legislation that reaches the Senate floor. . . .

FBI ALERT ASKS OIL, GAS COMPANIES FOR EXTRA PRECAUTIONS
AGAINST TERRORISM

The FBI asks the nation's oil and gas companies to be on
heightened alert for possible retaliatory terrorist attacks.
Terry Boss, vice president for environment and safety with
the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, confirms
receiving the FBI alert and forwarding it to members.
Attorney General Ashcroft refers to an "uncorroborated
report of undetermined reliability about natural gas"
received "maybe 10 days or close to two weeks ago." . . .

STATE NEWS
__________

OREGON: The petroleum underground storage tank program is
shifting its focus from conversions of old tanks to the
inspection of new tanks, according to Oregon's Department of
Environmental Quality.  In operation since 1985, the program
is responsible for the closing of some 26,000 underground
tanks. Currently, the department holds permits for 6,077
tanks. About 300 underground tanks still need to be removed,
says the director of the state program. With the conversion
and decommissioning of older tanks nearly completed, the
department will now emphasize the safe operation of new
tanks. . . . Page A-4

MINNESOTA: An alfalfa-processing plant remains closed almost
two weeks after the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
ordered it shut because of its alleged failure to meet the
legal limits for dust. The plant, which is owned by the
Minnesota Valley Alfalfa Producers in Priam, could be
operating again within days, according to the cooperative's
general manager. He says the plant is in the process of
being upgraded to enable it to meet the standards. . . .
