DASCHLE SAYS YUCCA MOUNTAIN NUCLEAR WASTE REPOSITORY IS DEAD
ISSUE

Incoming Senate Majority Leader Daschle says his party will
block the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository
in Nevada. "I think the Yucca Mountain issue is dead,"
Daschle tells reporters in Las Vegas, where he went to
attend a fundraiser for Senate Majority Whip Reid. Reid
opposes efforts to expedite construction of the Yucca
Mountain facility, which would hold waste from nuclear power
plants. . . . Page AA-1

GROUPS CALL FOR EPA MORATORIUM ON OPEN MARKET EMISSIONS
TRADING

A coalition of 20 environmental groups writes EPA
Administrator Whitman asking her to impose a moratorium on
state "open market" emissions trading programs.  The groups
say the trading programs are unenforceable and impose
disproportionate impacts on minority and poor communities.
"Rather than balancing incentives with enforcement, these
programs simply concede enforcement to market participants,"
the letter states. . . . Page A-2

SCIENCE ADVISERS ISSUE FINAL REVIEW OF EPA'S REASSESSMENT OF
DIOXINS

A final report assessing the science EPA used to examine the
risks of dioxins is released by EPA's Science Advisory
Board, allowing EPA to complete its dioxins reassessment.
The reassessment, which has taken more than a decade to
complete, will be used by any EPA office regulating dioxins.
For example, the reassessment is expected to affect a
proposed rule EPA issued setting limits of dioxins in sewage
sludge applied to land. . . . Page A-1

DOT SAYS FEDERAL HAZMAT TRANSPORT RULES PREEMPT CLEVELAND
ORDINANCES

Three local ordinances that regulate the transportation of
hazardous materials in Cleveland are struck down in a
Department of Transportation ruling. The Cleveland
ordinances for hazardous material shipment routings,
shipment notifications, and police escort requirements are
preempted under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT ADVISORY PANEL PROPOSES STUDY OF NEW
OFFSHORE DRILLING

An advisory committee will recommend that Interior Secretary
Norton consider opening certain Outer Continental Shelf
areas for oil and gas drilling in a report expected to be
released this week. The panel will not identify any specific
areas that should be opened to oil and gas exploration, but
instead will ask the Interior Department to make identifying
such areas a priority. . . . Page A-9

141 PARTIES TO PAY $668,695 FOR CLEANUP COSTS AT COLORADO
SUPERFUND SITE

EPA and 141 parties that contributed small amounts of
hazardous substances to a Colorado superfund site reach an
agreement requiring the parties to pay a total of $668,695,
according to a notice to be published today. Under the
proposed administrative settlement, 137 private companies
and four federal facilities resolve their liability for past
and future cleanup costs at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park
site in Jefferson County. . . . Page A-9

MINNESOTA COMPANY PAYS FINE TO SETTLE ALLEGATION OF
UNREGISTERED PESTICIDE

A Minnesota-based maker of soaps and detergents agrees to
settle allegations that it had sold and distributed
unregistered pesticides. Ecolab Inc., based in St. Paul,
will pay a $277,953 fine to EPA, according to an
announcement from the agency's Region V office. . . . Page

NOMINEE FOR EPA WATER OFFICE MEETS SENATORS IN BID FOR
CONFIRMATION

George Tracy Mehan, President Bush's choice to head the EPA
Office of Water, arrives in Washington to begin meeting with
senators in his bid for confirmation. Mehan is the director

Environmental Quality. No date is set for hearings on
Mehan's nomination. . . . Page A-1

SOY INGREDIENT SAID TO CAUSE CANCER IN MICE EXPOSED DURING
INFANCY

A natural ingredient found in soy caused uterine cancer in
mice exposed during their infancy, according to a study
scheduled to appear in "Cancer Research". The study found
that organisms exposed during key periods of development to
chemicals that affect hormones may be harmed, says Retha
Newbold, the study's principal investigator. The question of
when to expose organisms to ensure that the adverse effects
of pesticides, industrial chemicals, and compounds in
drinking water are detected is a key issue in a screening
and testing program EPA is developing. . . . Page A-3

EPA SEEKS RECOMMENDATIONS ON COORDINATING PESTICIDE, WATER
LAWS

EPA asks its regional offices for recommendations on
coordinating the requirements of pesticide and water laws.
In a memo to regional offices, Stephen Johnson, the acting
assistant administrator responsible for pesticides, and
Diane Regas, acting assistant administrator for water, say
EPA does not have a national policy on how the Clean Water
Act would apply to pesticide applications. . . . Page A-6

DOT OUTLINES IDEAS FOR FASTER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS OF
AIRPORT PROJECTS

Establishing environmental impact statement teams for major
airport runway projects, increasing the number of federal
environmental specialists, and improving interagency
coordination could speed reviews and reduce air travel
delays, according to a Department of Transportation report
to Congress. The Federal Aviation Administration says an
environmental impact statement for a major new runway
currently takes between three and three and one half years
on average to complete. . . . Page A-5

U.K. AGENCY WARNS MILK DRINKERS OF CONTAMINATION FROM ANIMAL
DISPOSAL

Massive bonfires in the United Kingdom for disposal of
cattle in the wake of the recent foot and mouth disease
epidemic may be releasing dioxins into the air,
contaminating surrounding pastures and infecting dairy
animals grazing in the immediate vicinity, the UK's Food
Standards Agency warns. The advisory warning is aimed at
consumers of whole milk, diary farmers, and sheep and goat
farmers who produce milk. . . . Page A-3

ANNUAL JAPANESE REPORT STRESSES GLOBAL WARMING, OZONE LAYER

Japan will focus its environment policy on global issues,
including global warming and ozone layer depletion, while
promoting waste reduction, according to the Ministry of
Environment's annual White Paper. The paper says the
Japanese government will implement a broad array of measures
for reducing greenhouse gases. . . . Page A-5

NETHERLANDS TOLD TO RESTRUCTURE LIVESTOCK SECTOR TO IMPROVE
ENVIRONMENT

The Netherlands needs to restructure its livestock industry
to achieve environmental, food safety, and animal health
improvements, according to recommendations from a government
commission. The commission says fundamental reforms are
needed to address, among other things, nitrate, phosphate,
and ammonia pollution associated with raising livestock. . .

IN THE STATES
_____________

AIR POLLUTION: The governors of Georgia, North Carolina, and
Tennessee pledge cooperative efforts for improving air
quality in the region. The agreement requires environmental
officials from the three states to develop a multipollutant
strategy that addresses ozone pollution, acid deposition,
and reduced visibility. . . . Page A-8

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4g3n0r3_

ALASKA: Gov. Knowles says he will continue to push Congress
to approve oil and natural gas development in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge. Knowles tells reporters
development can be accomplished without major harm to the
environment or wildlife. Knowles is in Ottawa to lobby
Canadian officials on the construction of a natural gas
pipeline along the Alaska Highway. . . . Page A-4

MTBE: A court decision upholding New York's ban on the
gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether was a
significant victory for New York, claims the state's
governor and attorney general. The district court decision
denies a motion for summary judgement by the plaintiff in
