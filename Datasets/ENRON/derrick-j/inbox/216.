Jim, these are the individuals at Hughes Hubbard I mentioned yesterday.
Kevin will be in Houston while he's wrapping up his time at American
General. I'd be pleased to introduce you to him. It was great to see you
yesterday. My thoughts are with you.....

Mark:

As we discussed, attached please find the relevant biographical information
for Thomas Ferrigno and me. As you know, I plan to be in Houston to
complete my tenure
at American General from November 28-30.  I would be pleased to meet at
that time
or any other time that is convenient.  Over the course
of the next two weeks I can be most easily reached through my American
General  voice mail (713-831-8893) which I check frequently.
Alternatively,
messages can be left for me at Hughes Hubbard at 202-721-4770.
