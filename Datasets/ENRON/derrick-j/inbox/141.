I'm attaching a copy of Azurix's Request for Arbitration with ICSID in Washington relating to Azurix Buenos Aires.  The claim should be formally registered (i.e., cleared as valid for jurisdicitional purposes) today or early next week.

 

King and Spalding put together a summary of the various themes to emphasize in the arbitration.  Much of it is quotations from provincial officials, in official reports or to the press, demonstrating the political nature of the Province's decisions.  This should give you a flavor of our case.
