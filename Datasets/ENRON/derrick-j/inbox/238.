Jim - An update on the Owenreagh Power Partners letter that you received and forwarded to me for handling.  It appears from the below emails that it is a problem getting an auditor to prepare the accounts.  However I was informed that the file date has been extended to 12/31.  The following message re the file date is from Debbie Pritt: 

"FYI - I just spoke with Janet of Companies House and verified with her that the Form 233 I submitted is to extend the 2001 filing date from 10/31 to 12/31.  She indicated that this 14 month filing period will be approved and that all subsequent filings will be for the period ended 12/31."

I'll keep you informed as I hear more info.

Well, Gordon and I are certainly stunned!  D&T has refused to do the audit.  Gordon knows a UK Chartered Accountant located here in Houston so he is trying to contact him.  We are exploring any options at this time.
