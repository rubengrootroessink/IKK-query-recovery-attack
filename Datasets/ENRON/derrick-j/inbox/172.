NOTICES TO REFINERIES SAID TO INDICATE NEW SOURCE REVIEW
MOVING FORWARD

Notices of violation sent to two major oil companies by EPA
indicate the agency is moving forward with enforcement of
the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. The
agency sends notices of violation to ExxonMobil Oil Corp.,
and Sunoco Inc., for allegedly making major improvements at
refineries in Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas
without installing modern pollution-control equipment. The
notices inform the companies that EPA has detected alleged
violations and represent the first formal step in an
enforcement action. They come as the agency is completing
work on an examination ordered by the White House of new
source review enforcement and its effects on oil refining
and electricity production. Industry and environmental
groups were bracing for release of the EPA new source review
report in December, but agency sources now say the report is
likely to be released in January 2002. . . . Page A-1

REVISED EPA INVENTORY UPDATE RULE NOT READY FOR REPORTS DUE
IN 2002

A final, revised Inventory Update Rule that would change the
information chemical manufacturers and importers provide EPA
will not be issued in time for the 2002 reporting cycle,
according to William Sanders, director of EPA's Office of
Pollution Prevention and Toxics. He says EPA is still
developing a final rule which it intends to submit to the
White House Office of Management and Budget in 2002. The
Inventory Update Rule forms required for 2002 will contain
the same types of information EPA requested in 1998. . . .

ADMINISTRATION REVOKES RULE LINKING FEDERAL CONTRACTS TO
COMPLIANCE

The Bush administration revokes the rule issued during the
Clinton administration that linked the award of federal
contracts to a contractor's compliance with labor, tax, and
environmental laws. Several federal agencies, including EPA,
argued the rule would damage the procurement process. . . .

SUGGESTED REFORMS FOR PERMITS INCLUDES INDUSTRY ROLE WRITING
APPLICATIONS

A report from Resources for the Future suggests Congress
consider amending the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act,
and other environmental laws to make companies responsible
for writing permits required by the regulations.  Among
other things, the report finds permit applications often
require more information than needed. . . . Page A-2

OHIO STORAGE FACILITY WOULD PAY $400,000 IN PENALTIES UNDER
SETTLEMENT

Operators of an Ohio facility would pay $400,000 in fines
for certain hazardous waste violations under a proposed
consent decree. Under the proposed agreement, operators of
the waste storage facility, Clean Harbors Inc. in
Cincinnati, also must change certain procedures. . . . Page

DRAFT U.K. STANDARDS PUBLISHED FOR REFRIGERATORS CONTAINING
CFCS

The United Kingdom publishes draft standards for handling
discarded refrigerators that would require handlers to
remove insulation foam made from ozone-depleting substances
before scrapping or recycling the units. The draft standards
concern the removal of chlorofluorocarbons and
hydrochlorofluorocarbons from the cooling system and the
insulating foam. They follow the introduction of a European
Union directive banning the disposal of refrigerators unless
all the CFCs and HCFCs have been removed. . . . Page A-6

FRANCE: Prime Minister Jospin announces the permanent
closure of a chemical fertilizer plant in Toulouse where an
explosion killed 30 people in September. Jospin insists the
government does not aim "to ban the chemical industry from
Toulouse," but hopes to "permit a reconversion of the
chemical sector toward safer activities that do not pose the
same level of danger.". . . Page A-5
