SUPREME COURT SAYS CAPS ON COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN FEDERAL
JOB BIAS SUITS DON'T APPLY TO FRONT PAY AWARDS

Front pay awards in federal employment discrimination suits
are not subject to the 1991 Civil Rights Act's caps on
compensatory damages, the U.S. Supreme Court rules. The
unanimous decision resolves a circuit split in favor of the
majority view on the issue.

Front pay is money awarded either for lost compensation
between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement
or in lieu of reinstatement. The front pay remedy has long
been available under Section 706(g) of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act. Because the 1991 Act authorized compensatory and
punitive damages "in addition to" remedies already available
under Section 706(g), the court concludes that the caps do
not apply to front pay awards. . . . Page 1727

INNOVATIVE MAINE LAW MAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AVAILABLE AT
DISCOUNT TO UNINSURED SURVIVES CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES

Maine's novel prescription drug price control statute is not
preempted by the Medicaid statute and does not violate the
commerce clause, the First Circuit rules. The Maine program
makes prescription drugs available at a discount to
uninsured state residents who do not qualify for Medicaid,
and requires prior state authorization of the prescriptions
of drug manufacturers who decline to negotiate rebates with
the state.

Rejecting a conflict preemption claim, the court says the
rebate negotiation and prior authorization features are
"consonant" with the Medicaid program by making prescription
drugs more accessible to low-income people. Finding no merit
to the commerce clause challenge, the court says that the
Maine statute does not apply extraterritorially or
discriminate against out-of-state manufacturers, and that
its local benefits outweigh any burden on interstate
commerce. . . . Page 1729

JUSTICES ADOPT SINGLE-ENTITY APPROACH FOR CALCULATING
PRODUCT LIABILITY LOSS OF AFFILIATES FILING CONSOLIDATED
RETURN

The product liability loss for an affiliated group of
corporations filing a consolidated return should be
determined using the single-entity approach urged by the
taxpayer, not the separate-member methodology urged by the
government, the U.S. Supreme Court decides. The ruling
resolves a circuit split on the availability of the product
liability loss carryback under Section 172 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

In the government's view, affiliates that generate positive
separate taxable income should not contribute to product
liability loss eligible for the carryback. But the court
finds the taxpayer's single-entity approach a preferable
reading of the tax code and applicable regulations,
rejecting the government's claim that it will lead to tax
avoidance abuses. . . . Page 1733
