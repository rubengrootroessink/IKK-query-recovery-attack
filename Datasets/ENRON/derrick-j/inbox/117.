Jim -

We are still having daily India/Dabhol calls at 9:00 a.m.  Ken Lay has been
participating with some frequency on the Monday call (although we don't
typically know in advance if he will be on any given call).  He has not
been participating on many other weekdays.

If you wanted to call in on any given Monday(s), the following is the
call-in information:

888-689-5736 (US)
847-944-7277 (International)
Passcode: 6530874#
