Jim, I promised you some contact details.

Although I'm a little late with formal notification, as from the beginning of
the year I joined Societe Generale on a part-time basis.  I'm a Senior
International Adviser which means I do pretty much anything I want to turn my
hand to.  Jay Worenklein, who's the Global Head of Project Finance in New York,
is an old friend and we have always said that it would be fun to work together
if the opportunity ever arose.

In parallel with the SG role, I am continuing with the two roles for the British
Government I had previously mentioned to you: as adviser to the Deputy Prime
Minister and the Minister of Transport on the use of private finance in the
transport sector, and as non-executive Deputy Chairman of Partnerships UK, the
new merchant bank cum project developer the Government has formed to take
forward its well-known private finance programme.  So you can see that I've
finally ended up with the sort of portfolio we were discussing last fall.

Contact details are as follows:

Mobile              44 7802 655 605

At Partnerships UK  44 20 7273 8341 (direct)
               44 20 7273 8357 (my personal secretary - Carole James- who can
usually be relied upon to know where I am)
               44 20 7273 8383 (switch)
               44 20 7273 8367     (fax)
               e-mail:  adrian.montague@partnershipsuk.org.uk

At Societe Generale 44 20 7676 6821 (direct)
               44 20 7676 6881 (Nicola White - who tends to now where I am when
I'm at SG, or is a good point of call if Carole is not there)
               44 30 7676 6000 (switch)
               44 20 7667 2487 (fax)
               e-mail: as above

Since I move between offices a fair amount, if you send an e-mail, it's best to
send to both addressed at once.

All the best

Adrian
