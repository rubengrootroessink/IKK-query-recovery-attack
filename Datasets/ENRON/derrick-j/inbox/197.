Jim:  Please see the attached.  This was my attempt to get a more appropriate signatory to some of these financial statements that you have been inundated with.  With respect to EBS Belgium, as a practical matter I don't think we can expect to get employees who are no longer with the Company (Ken Rice, Steve Elliott)  to sign; indeed, I will try to find out why they are still on the list.  We'll keep trying to find other, more appropriate folks to address these matters, but my guess is that you will continue to receive some of these for awhile.  Rex

I do regret the time required for this.  Unfortunately the requirements of the Belgian tax authorities are that a director is required to this return.  They have Mr Derrick, Mr Rice and Mr  Steve Elliot listed as directors.  I was given to understand that Mr Elliot had left the company but found him on the Houston Intranet - would you prefer it if I approached him (or Mr Rice) for these returns?

With respect to the earlier return for EBS Italy, the Italian authorities require the Chairman of the Board of Directors to sign the tax return - which was Mr Derrick

Dont hesitate to let me know if you would like me to redirect my request to Mr Rice or Mr Elliot

Regards, Harveen

Thank you.  We will be expecting the documents.  As you know, Mr. Derrick has no direct involvement with EBS Belgium, and accordingly, must spend a significant amount of time and due diligence before signing these types of documents.  He wanted me to ensure him that there was not another more appropriate party to sign these documents (someone who is more directly involved with this company's activities and financial statements).  I assume there is no one else who can sign, but could you kindly confirm that for me?  Thanks you.  Regards, Rex Rogers

Sir, I am placing in tonight's (courier) post, for your attention, a Corporate Tax Return package containing

	- a cover letter to the Tax Audit office
	- corporate income tax return form 275.1 
	- investment deduction form 276.U

for the period ended 31 December 2000.  I have also enclosed English translations of the letter and the first return and the basis of the calculation for the tax incentive (investment deduction)

I would be grateful if you could clear the returns so that they can presented to Mr Derrick for his signature.  The papers have already been initialled by Jas Somrah, the tax manager responsible for EBS Europe.  The authorities have agreed to a further extension of the filing date of 9 November 

I have further back up such as the annual accounts - please let me know if you need anything else and I can fax it to you. 

With thanks, Harveen
