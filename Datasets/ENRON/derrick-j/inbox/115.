Karen:

Attached are my suggested revisions to your 3:00 PM draft of the intercompany memo to be released by the Office of the Chairman early next week.
		
This collective draft now contains many of the suggestions that have been received by Steve Kean, Jim Derrick, John Sherriff and the GSS team and the questions/clarifications forwarded to me yesterday by Kevin Hannon yesterday.

Air travel has been clarified  to read, "Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts."  This will assure coverage outside the US and access to the Enron-negotiated fares with the carriers.

The car rental services section has been clarified to include insurance coverage availability.

The language regarding XMS has been modified to say "Effective July 1 or the effective date of the rollout in your location, all employees will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses."  Also, we are currently investigating future release dates for those locations where XMS is not yet available and plan to include such information in the FAQ's that will support this memo.

The URL/Web reference in the Professional Services section has been changed to http://ibuyit.enron.com/tibco.  This is the URL for iBuyit.  We are currently creating the content (FAQ's, procedures, forms, and etc.) that will be available via iBuyit to support the initiative.

The Offsite Meetings section has also been clarified to cover domestic-US events only. 

George
