CONFIDENTIAL--rob, i had the same reaction in l996 and
voiced my complaint to cw. abrupt, not impressed with
me, criticizing enron, believed the other side, etc.
but after a while and a few scotches in his hotel room
with ar and cw, i came to the view that he was
exceptional and highly respected by the bench. he did
a very good job before the bombay high court and the
s. ct. in the cpil case, completely turning the court
around after they asked if we wished to give up. (jim
was there). he had a good grasp of the issues. i can
understand not understanding the misdeclaration issue.
but he has in the past been responsive. my bottom
line: i agree we need more than 1 senior advocate if
they can work together. i would hate to lose atul r.
or lose his enthusiasm--i trust satulvad completely on
the indian law. i do not know the other candidates,
but would not replace him on the basis of one
performance before the merc. finally, i would not do
anything without a personal discussion with cw. jim
