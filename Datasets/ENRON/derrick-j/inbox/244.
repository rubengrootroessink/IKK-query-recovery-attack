Hi Jim,

In response to your voice mail message, please know that you remain our
first choice to chair the new Institute.  As long as you are still eager
and able to lead it, we want you.

Please let me know if the e-memo below needs to be revised in any way.
Upon your approval, I'll shoot it right out.

Thanks.


TO: The Executive Committee of the Institute for Law and Technology

FROM: James V. Derrick, Jr., Chair

RE: Our Inaugural Meeting



According to our e-poll, the best date for our first meeting is
Wednesday, January 23, 2002.  So it shall be.

Please mark your calendars and make your plans now to join us at 12:00
p.m. on the 23rd at the Tower Club on the 48th floor of Thanksgiving
Tower in downtown Dallas, 1601 Elm Street.  We will begin over lunch,
work through the afternoon planning the organization and first
activities of the Institute, and conclude with drinks and an early
dinner at the Tower Club.

Please confirm your plans to attend the meeting and the dinner to David
Winn at dwinn@swlegal.org <mailto:dwinn@swlegal.org> .

An agenda and a draft organizational plan will be sent to you in advance
of the meeting.  In the meantime, as ever, please feel free to call or
email me anytime with your thoughts on this important new global forum.
I look forward to seeing you in Dallas on the 23rd and to building this
newest Institute of the Center for American and International Law.
