Robert- 
I imagine White & Case wants to review this.  Don't know if an electronic copy will suffice.  If it looks like they need a hard copy, we can fed ex one to Singapore or scan it here and email it out.  Let me know what you think.

I am forwarding soft copy of the WP ( Lodging No.1376/2001) as filed before the High Court. 
Instead fo scanned copies, i think this would suffice. 
Thanks & Regards.......Suhas.
