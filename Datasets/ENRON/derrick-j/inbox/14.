Subject:=09Friday Renegotiation Committee meeting and other events

Here is overview of day. I've tried to summarize most of what happened.

Mohan and I met early in morning with the lenders' observers to the meeting=
, Mr. Kharkanis and Abhay Ahuja. Both are attorneys who work for the same l=
awfirm, India Legal Advisors (previously affiliated with White & Case). Thi=
s firm has represented Dabhol lenders in the past. Mr. Kharkanis is former =
chief legal counsel at IDBI. Very pleasant meeting. Three points they made =
-- (a) very difficult to resolve unless someone is willing to take all the =
power, (b) this committee is probably not a proper committee to be renegoti=
ating with as it is comprised of all Review Committee members, who are alre=
ady biased in their conclusions, and (c) they asked about the misdeclaratio=
n issue. I told them we felt we had a strong case and were willing to go al=
l the way in arbitration or, assuming a big picture renegotiation could wor=
k, resolve it in context of that renegotiation. But I pointed out a renegot=
iation, while possible, was going to be difficult, and it would be an absol=
ute non-starter unless GOI stood up and said they could take power.

At Renegotiation Committee (RC) meeting, only 3 of 9 members from their sid=
e were present. Dr. Godbole, chair; Mr. Lal, Energy Secretary; and Ms. Bans=
al, MSEB chair. Notably absent was any GOI representative. Their offered ra=
tionale for this absence was that Mr. Gaukak (not Mr. Harish Salve as earli=
er reported) had been appointed only last night and could not make it. It i=
s clear to me that (a) GOI is still taking a hands-off approach and they de=
layed appointment until late enough so they could not make meeting, and (b)=
 GOI's commitment to finding workable solution is in question as they don't=
 seem to be giving this any type of serious consideration based on who they=
 appoint (Mr. Gaukak is former secretary in Telecom Dept.).

The press was allowed in at the beginning of the meeting only to take photo=
s. They left and the meeting began. We agreed after the meeting that neithe=
r party would discuss with the press about the meeting. As we left, we were=
 absolutely mobbed and we "no commented" our way through the mob and left. =
The mob was quite large and the walking space was small and going downstair=
s, so there were a couple of reporters who tripped and fell and dropped cam=
eras. Hopefully, the headlines will not read "Enron stomps Journalist."

The meeting lasted almost 2 hours. The RC opened up by saying their positio=
n was on the table through the Godbole Committee Report and wanted us to re=
spond. I read from my prepared notes, and told them we were open minded, wi=
lling to listen but we had serious constraints. My key points from my notes=
 were (a) who was going to buy the power from this 2184MW baseload plant th=
at had to operate at high PLF for it to be economical, (b) our project was =
out of money and would probably have to shut down absent further funding fr=
om lenders, which depended on favorable gov't response to lender letter (th=
is did not seem to bother them at all), (c) the main problem was their fail=
ure I told them I felt it was major issue that GOI was not present and not =
engaging in this dialogue. I said the absence of GOI meant that very little=
 would be accomplished today as the key to any solution involved GOI involv=
ement, and we needed to know what GOI's position was. The RC responded by s=
aying they were disappointed that we did not have representatives from shar=
eholders, lenders (and they objected here to the lenders' observer role ver=
sus an active participant role), fuel suppliers and others here and they di=
d not know whether to interpret that as lack of seriousness/commitment or n=
ot.

The most disturbing thing to me was the Dr. Godbole was very clear, to the =
point of stating this and repeating it again, that the original project was=
 a mistake and DPC should pay for that mistake. He said that DPC proposed a=
 2000 MW LNG facility with high PLF, and thus now that such a project is no=
t working, it is DPC's fault (his rationale being that without DPC proposin=
g the idea originally, it never would have come about) and we should pay. W=
hen I asked him what tariff he thought should be appropriate, he quoted fro=
m the Godbole Committee report -- the lowest tariff available to any gas-ba=
sed plant in the country, with no ToP. Since the whole LNG idea was DPC's, =
we should bear 100% of any LNG costs except for a reasonable per MMbtu pric=
e that MSEB would pay as if they had a natural gas pipeline running already=
 in place and running by their plant. Yes, folks, it was that ludicrous.

It's clear that among the 3 people there, Dr. Godbole was the firmest in hi=
s extreme positions. And he is firm in those positions. Mr. Lal and Mr. Ban=
sal were more conciliatory and trying to find some middle ground, although =
since they only represent MSEB/GOM, their ability to do this is limited to =
only one power block, and even on that, they are looking for tariff relief =
and ToP relief beyond our ability to handle. But they are trying to move to=
 the middle, whereas the chairman is not.

Even in absence of GOI, we talked at length about the fact that they had to=
 play a role. The RC said they were not sure if GOI was willing to play a r=
ole other than counter-guarantor, and even if they were, the GOI could not =
be expected to pay more than a "market" price -- whatever a SEB in India is=
 willing to pay. Currently, that ranges around Rs. 2.50. It is clear that D=
r. Godbole feels no responsibility whatsoever for 2 power blocks, and he th=
inks DPC should take responsibility, including convincing GOI to buy some a=
mount of this at the "market" price. On this market price issue, I made it =
clear that it was not our problem that the market price in India was an unr=
ealistically low price influenced by subsidies, lack of tariff rationalizat=
ion, etc. and we would not be able to meet their demands. We discussed the =
need for having a creditworthy buyer for power from DPC at 90% PLF, before =
we could talk any tariff relief, and even then, tariff relief expectations =
had to be reasonable (not the 30% they are asking for but less than 10%).=

LNG terminal separation from power plant: They asked if an LNG terminal spl=
it was possible, and we asked what did they think that would get them. They=
 said tariff relief and absence of ToP. We pointed out tariff relief had be=
en given in 1995 renegotiations when LNG terminal had been originally split=
, and even when the terminal was included added back, the tariff relief had=
 remained to MSEB's favor. We stated that the ToP would remain with the ult=
imate customer, even if the terminal was split. They said why should the po=
wer plant pay for all excess capacity in LNG terminal and we reminded them =
again that the LNG terminal capacity was built solely for the power station=
 as MSEB had required, and that 2 separate independent consultants had conf=
irmed this.

RC asked for various proposals on what our tariff would be at various PLFs,=
 assuming a certain reduced % tariff. We told them that since the project o=
nly made sense at a high (90%) PLF, the key was for them and GOI to identif=
y buyers for 90%, and then tariff is known.

Conclusion: they wanted to meet again and have a further discussion. We agr=
eed to meet on May 23, but agreed that in interim, we had to know what the =
role of the GOI was. We agreed that we would both go back and think about w=
hat had been said and see if solutions were there, but we said that key was=
 where were the buyers for this power.
