BUSH SAID NOT LIKELY TO OFFER PLAN FOR GLOBAL WARMING AT
SUMMIT

President Bush is not likely to take a detailed plan for
combating global warming to next week's summit meeting in
Sweden with European Union leaders, although the president
is concerned about climate change, says his spokesman. With
a Cabinet-level group still studying the issue, Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer says the president is likely to
engage European leaders on broad issues related to climate
change and to hold off on offering specific recommendations.
Fleischer says the White House finds credible this week's
report by the National Research Council that outlines how
greenhouse gas emissions are still causing the Earth to
warm. In Luxembourg, the EU avoids an embarrassing split
when the outgoing Italian government supports ratifying the
Kyoto Protocol. . . . Page AA-1,  AA-2,  A-9

LIEBERMAN TO SCRUTINIZE ADMINISTRATION'S ENERGY,
ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS

Energy and the Bush administration's environmental actions
will be among the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's
top priorities under Democratic leadership, says its new
chairman, Sen. Lieberman. . . . Page A-1

IBM ASKS TO USE SEMICONDUCTOR PLANT'S HAZARDOUS WASTE TO
MAKE CEMENT

EPA asks for comments on giving regulatory flexibility under
its Project XL to waste-handling operations at IBM's East
Fishkill semiconductor plant in Hopewell Junction, N.Y. The
principal objective of the project, EPA says, is to
determine whether the waste water treatment sludge resulting
from electroplating operations may be used as an ingredient
in cement without the regulatory controls of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. . . . Page A-3

WAL-MART AGREES TO PAY $5.5 MILLION TO SETTLE ALLEGED WATER
VIOLATIONS

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. agrees to pay $1 million in fines and
to set up a $4.5 million environmental management plan to
resolve allegations that it violated the Clean Water Act,
federal prosecutors announce. Wal-Mart allegedly violated
permitting requirements for storm water during the
construction of 17 stores in Massachusetts, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, and Texas. . . . Page A-1

EPA WAIVES $350,000 IN FINES AFTER RIGHT-TO-KNOW VIOLATIONS
REPORTED

EPA waives nearly $350,000 in potential fines for seven
mid-Atlantic region companies after they voluntarily report
violations of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-To-Know Act. The EPA Region III spokesperson tells BNA
all of the potential violations involved noncompliance with
reporting violations and not releases of toxins. Many of the
potential violations came to light as the companies hired
private consultants for self audits or to meet permitting
requirements. . . . Page A-10

EPA SEEKS VOLUNTARY EDUCATION PROGRAM ABOUT ARSENIC-TREATED
WOOD

EPA maintains its support for a voluntary industry program
to educate consumers about the safe handling of wood treated
with arsenic-based pesticides. At a public meeting, public
interest representatives and state health officials express
concern about arsenic leaching from the wood treated with
copper chromated arsenate. The EPA meeting includes a
presentation about the American Wood Preservers Institute's
efforts to teach consumers how to handle the wood. . . .

EXPOSURE LEVELS FOR PHENOL, PERCHLOROMETHYL MERCAPTAN CALLED
TOO STRICT

Some proposed Acute Exposure Guideline Levels for phenol,
another industrial chemical, and nerve agents are too
stringent, based on toxicological research of the compounds,
according to comments submitted to EPA in response to its
proposal for exposure levels for 13 chemicals and five nerve
agents. The National Advisory Committee for Acute Exposure
Guideline Levels is scheduled to discuss the proposed levels
next week. . . . Page A-6

FASTER REVIEW URGED FOR COMPLAINTS UNDER NAFTA ENVIRONMENT
PACT

An advisory committee urges the North American Commission
for Environmental Cooperation to expedite the process for
reviewing citizen complaints that the governments of the
United States, Canada, or Mexico are not enforcing
environmental laws. . . . Page A-8

EU ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS AGREE TO REQUIRE RECYCLING OF
ELECTRONIC GOODS

The European Union environment ministers agree to make the
manufacturers of electronic goods either take back used
products or collect them for recycling purposes. The EU
Council of Environment ministers also agree to phase out by
2007 certain hazardous substances used in making electronic
goods, including lead, cadmium, and flame-retardant
materials. . . . Page A-7

CHINA ISSUES NEW RULES FOR LABELING, TESTING GENETICALLY
MODIFIED CROPS

China issues new regulations, including labeling and testing
requirements, for genetically modified crops and other
organisms. The new regulations give the agriculture
administration under the State Council the power to ban the
import or export of any genetically modified products and
the right to quarantine or to inspect those products. . . .

RESIDENTS OF PHOENIX ALLEGE ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM IN CLASS
ACTION SUIT

A class-action lawsuit alleging environmental racism is
filed in Arizona Superior Court against Arizona and Phoenix
on behalf of residents of a neighborhood on the city's south
side. The lawsuit alleges zoning policy and tax incentives
turned the neighborhood into storage grounds for toxic
materials. . . . Page A-13

SENATOR SEEKS TO BAN OIL, GAS DRILLING, BALLAST DISCHARGES
IN GREAT LAKES

New oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes would be banned
under legislation to be introduced next week by Sen.
Stabenow. The legislation would be part of a comprehensive
package that would include restrictions on discharges of
ballast water designed to control further introduction of
invasive species, such as the zebra mussel and the sea
lamprey. . . . Page A-10

LEARNING PROBLEMS FOUND IN ADULTS WHO EAT PCB-CONTAMINATED
FISH

Adults who eat fish contaminated with polychlorinated
biphenyls have problems learning and remembering new verbal
information, according to a study to be printed in the June
issue of "Enviornmental Health Perspectives". The
researchers say their study may be of interest to workers in
the electric circuit manufacturing industry because their
exposure to PCBs can be much higher than that incurred by
the fish-eaters. . . . Page A-10

TEXAS: The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
settles a lawsuit that threatened to block implementation of
Houston's plan to meet requirements of the Clean Air Act.
TNRCC is settling with a consortium of Houston businesses
that includes several major oil and chemical companies. The
agreement is designed to ensure effective implementation of
clean air controls for the Houston-Galveston area by 2007. .

NEW SOURCE REVIEW: The heads of EPA and the Justice
Department are invited to tour communities near petroleum
refineries while their agencies review enforcement actions
against oil companies and power plants. Dozens of
environmental groups write EPA Administrator Whitman and
Attorney General Ashcroft inviting them on "toxic tours" of
the communities with petroleum refineries. . . . Page A-4

CALIFORNIA DESERT: A portion of the California desert
designated as not in compliance with Clean Air Act standards
for particulate matter would be split into three separate
non-attainment areas under an EPA proposal. EPA's Region IX
says it will ask for public comments on its proposed
redesignation of the Searles Valley non-attainment area into
three areas: Coso Junction, Indian Wells Valley, and Trona.
