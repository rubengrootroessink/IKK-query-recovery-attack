Jim:  We are close to making an offer to someone to replace Ann Ballard (of course, I will visit with you about this before before we extend any offers to get your approval).  Until then, we are a little short handed, and don't know that we could take on any extra work.  Perhaps Haedicke's group, which is obviously much bigger than ours, could continue to do this at least until we add another person and then reassess the situation.  That would be my suggestion, but of course we are ready to serve if drafted! (I spoke to Tom White yesterday and I am ready to enlist!  Lucky for us that I can't pass the physical).  Rex

James

Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Most pressingly, I'd like to discuss our ability to compete with a company with which we've been in discussions -- if possible by the latter part of the week.

Thank you.

Heath
