Rob/John:

In connection with the Section 5.21 (formerly Section 5.21) disclosure, attached are two pieces of information about ECT Strategic Value Corp. (I understand that 100% of the common stock is still owned by ENA) that I have received today from Stephen Douglas and Morris Clark of the ENA Tax Group. Let me know if you need any additional information about this company. ECT Strategic Value Corp.was formed in 1996, and I understand it is still in existence. Steve (office: 713-853-0938/cell: 713-817-5052) would be the best person to talk to further about this potential disclosure issue. Keep in mind that that Liabilities (essentially poor credit quality contract receivables) were transferred to ESVC in 1996.
