Christopher -

I agree with your observations.  It seems to me that we want to consolidate
our Dec/Jan/Good Interest into one arbitration against each of MSEB and
GOM, rather than separate the claims further and thereby encourage MSEB/GOM
to cure some claims (e.g., Dec/Good Interest) and leave the January claim
hanging out there alone.

I understand your issues with rag-tag but am assuming that the rag-tag
label does not apply to Good Interest.

Thanks,
Bruce

Subject:  Dabhol Power Project -  MSEB and GOM Arbitrations


Bruce,

I think that part of the plan discussed in London has simply been
superceded
by events. In particular,the corporate decision about what the end game and
desired end result are to consist in.

Accordingly,I now look upon the proposed GOM and MSEB arbitrations as
primarily a means of setting up the case for PPA termination in due course.
In the light of this:-

(1) The MSEB arbitration ought now to deal with misdeclaration and claim
payment of the January 2001 billing,as well as the December 2001 billing. I
expect that we shall also put in the subsequent misdeclaration episodes. I
see little value in putting in the older claims (i.e., the arrears and sums
withheld),mainly because Kelly Quinn's analysis of them tends to show that
many of DPC's claims are dud.

(2) There is no longer any useful purpose served in stripping the MSEB
arbitration down to misdeclaration only. Further,not merely I am more
convinced than I was that the MSEB was not entitled to withhold against the
December 2000 billing,but I think that DPC has a 50:50 case that the MSEB
was obliged to pay the January 2001 billing clean.

(3) As I see it,there will be two arbitrations against GOM (the SSA and the
Guarantee) and one against the MSEB. However,if we wish to harass the GOM
and set up further PPA termination grounds,we might well wish to do
something forceful and litigious when (as I confidently predict) the notice
under the escrow agreement is not responded to by the MSEB and the Indian
banks. The notice only really works as and when the Indian banks are
threatened.

Christopher -

Help me to understand the plan for the MSEB and GOM arbitrations for
December, January and Interest.  In how many pieces do we anticipate
submitting these arbitrations?  What strategy is behind the submission of
separate submissions?

I remember that we wanted to separate the MSEB January submission, at one
point, to hasten the disposition of the misdeclaration issue.  Does this
make sense given the events of the last few weeks and the sponsors'
sentiments about additional capital for the project?

Thanks,
Bruce
