Jim-I'm sorry to be bothering you about this again, but I need to get your
clearance for me to represent BP in a transaction in Bolivia where BP,
through its partially owned subsidiary Empresa Petrolera Chaco, will be
selling gas to Southern Cone Gas Ltd.  As I understand it, the gas is
intended for Enron's Cuiab? power plant in Brazil.

Thanks again.

Regards

John
