Our Committee has been asked to send a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, supporting the expeditious consideration of nominees for Federal Judgeships. Following is a draft letter for your review and comment. Please note that we take no position on individuals or partisan issues.

Please let me know if you are in support or if you have any objection to the letter. We are requested to send the letter right away, so would appreciate your prompt response. Many thanks.

The Honorable Patrick J. Leahy
Chairman, United States Senate
 Committee on the Judiciary
433 Russell Senate Office Building
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Leahy:

        I am Chairman of the Committee of Corporate General Counsel, which is part of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. Our membership is comprised of the senior-most legal officers of many of America's largest companies.

        Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning the importance of the Federal Judiciary.

        The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and protecting these freedoms.

        We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for Federal District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need for a fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts in determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as expeditiously as possible.

         If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.


                                        Sincerely,
