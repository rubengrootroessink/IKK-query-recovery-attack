Jimbo, Carrin and I were named the co-recipients of the Anti-Defamation Leagues' Karen Susman Jurisprudence Award, which was presented to us today in the Grand Ballroom at the Hyatt Regency.  Jo Jo, Jan, Bob, Holly, Tanner, Vicki, Laura, Bud, and Carrin's Mother and Father were in attendance, as well as several hundred others, including many of the judges.  I thought you might be interested in the text of my response.  Love, Dad
