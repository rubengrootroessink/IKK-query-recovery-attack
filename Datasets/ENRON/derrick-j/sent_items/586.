I know it seems like a long time ago but....Do you have a clear recollection of whether Dick Foster was in attendance at the Exec. Session of the Audit and Compliance Comm. on Monday., Oct. 8 at 7:45 p.m. at the Four Seasons when Joe Dilg reported?  I feel like my notes and recollection are accurate, but wanted to cross-check with you.  Thank you.  

Separately, I talked to Joe today.  For some reason, he did not receive the notice about yesterday's Audit Comm. mtg. personally.  He is awared of the related issues and will join us on Sunday.
