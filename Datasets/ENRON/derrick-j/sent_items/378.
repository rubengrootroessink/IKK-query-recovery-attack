Thank you for the message.  I am currently scheduled to be in meetings on the East Coast on October 11 and thus will not be able to attend the Houston meeting. Jim Derrick

Dear James:

I wanted to draw your attention to our upcoming dinner discussion on
America's Foreign Policy Tradition and the War on Terrorism.  Walter
Russell Mead, Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on
Foreign Relations, will lead the discussion and Norman B. Frankel,
Physician at the Medical Clinic of Houston, will chair and host.  The
dinner will take place on Thursday, October 11, from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m. at
the River Oaks Country Club, located on 1600 River Oaks Boulevard.

In light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration is
faced with the unique challenge of building a national consensus for what
could be the longest, most complex, and most difficult war in American
history.  Walter Russell Mead will discuss how America's foreign policy
tradition, defense culture, and diplomatic history will influence President
Bush and America in responding to the terrorist threat.  Walter has just
completed a study of the history of U.S. foreign policy at the Council on
Foreign Relations and written a book, Special Providence, due to be
published by Knopf in November.

Please let me know if you plan to participate.

Regards,
Irina
