Subject:	Administrators for ECAP

As it looks highly likely that the Administrators will be called into ECTRL and ECAP's funding comes from London we must "invite" the administrators to come in tomorrow for ECAP. In order to do this we need a signature from both George and Jim. I will fax you both or e-mail you a copy of the document tomorrow morning - please advise which is more suitable and relevant numbers then please can you do the necessary and return asap. Sydney Fax No is +61 2 9229 2350.

Thanks in advance
