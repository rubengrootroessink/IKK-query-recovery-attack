Rob - I want to let you know how much we need and appreciate Paulette Obrecht's technical assistance and to thank you for making her services available to us.  Geneva Holland had been working on several important software projects for the Corporate Services group before she left Enron and we need someone with similar or greater computer expertise to continue to work on these projects, refine and update them as necessary.  Paulette is filling the gap wonderfully well.  

Happy Easter!
Best regards Kate
