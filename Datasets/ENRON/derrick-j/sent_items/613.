I have used Baker & McKenzie for tax advice in setting up the Tokyo trading office and trading activities.  As a part of that effort, I used their Tokyo office and had a couple of questions to Stewart Lipeles of B&M's Palo Alto office.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Susan
