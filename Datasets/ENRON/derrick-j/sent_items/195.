Marc, thanks for the message.  I stipulate to having over-married--I'm very proud of that fact!  I'll pass the resume on to our Human Resources Group. All the best.  Jim

As you may know, Iam involved with Inprint Inc which very strongly supports
the Creative Writing Program and the U of H.  Chitra Divakaruni is a very
fine fiction writer who has been on the faculty and is now on leave.  We
very much want her to return.  The only stumbling block to her return is
her husband getting a good job here.  Attached below is his c.v. and a
letter of recommendation.  He appears to be very qualified and has good
experience.  If you have some suggestions for him, it would be greatly
appreciated.
Regards to Carrin.
I am looking forward to seeing you both honored by the ADL.  We all know
you over-married and are riding in on her coat-tails.
Best regards.
