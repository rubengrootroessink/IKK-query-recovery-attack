Rob/Jim -

B&M's affiliate in The Philippines has represented us for years.  They are
actively engaged in our efforts to sell Batangas and Subic back to The
Phillipines.

B&M's affiliate in Japan represented Enron in Japan.  Supervision of this
work is now out of London so I'm not sure of current status.

I believe that one of our Brazil law firms is also a B&M affiliate.  I'm
copying this to John Novak for more input.

I'll look into any others.

Bruce
