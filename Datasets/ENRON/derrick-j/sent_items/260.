FYI!  You might want to call John Barr when it's appropriate.  His direct line is 713/221-1242.  He is also a new partner in the law firm.  He is the one that so ably argued, before the federal judge in Louisiana, the propriety of our attachment of the vessel.  (As you recall, the judge ruled our way on that issue.)

I am pleased to report that we have successfully concluded our case against the M/V Titan 2.  Last Friday, Enron received the last outstanding payment of $1,665,059.37, bringing our recovery up to 100% of Enron's damages, including all attorneys' fees and costs.  Enron's total recovery was in excess of $9,000,000.  We were ably assisted by Gail Brownfeld, Randy Pais, Carlos Sole, and John Schwartzenberg of Enron, and by Jimmy Nieset of Plauche, Smith & Nieset of Lake Charles, Louisiana.
