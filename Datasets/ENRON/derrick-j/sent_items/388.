Jim,

I work in Government Affairs, supporting EBS.  I have been working with Steve Bowen of Blumenfeld & Cohen on issues in California relative to EBS as well as negotiating interconnection agreements with SBC.  Jeff Dasovich and Scott Bolton worked with Blumenfeld & Cohen prior to my entry into EBS issues.

Because Steve Bowen has recently broken away from B&C to form his own law firm, I was wondering if I need to get approval to work w/ Steve in this arrangement.

Please advise.  Thank you.

Mona

we are trying to tie up loose ends with Blumenfeld & Cohen, and they
have
asked for written verification for clients that have switched their
legal
matters to Bowen Law Group.  I've attached a short letter for that
purpose.  If
you are comfortable with the wording, please put the letter on MFN
letterhead,
sign and fax a copy to us (415-394-7500) and mail the original to the DC
office
at the address on the letter.  I'd greatly appreciate it if you could
fax the
letter to us today if possible.

Thanks much.  Anita.
