Jim:
 
I  apologize for the fact that I am repeatedly distracting you with self-serving  issues when I know you have much bigger things on your mind.  But when you  have a moment, I'd like to ask your help in connection with an outstanding bill  relating to a Supreme Court argument one of my partners, Lou Cohen, handled a  couple of months ago for Enron Power.  (I listened to the argument myself;  you were very well represented.)  I include what I know about the bill  below.
 
Again,  thanks for your help and my apologies for bothering you about  this.
 
Regards,
 
Chuck

The amount owed is $49,231.09.  This is almost all  on October bill for September time.  The responsible attorney in the Washington office, Sarah  Novosel  ((202) 466-9160 ; 828-3360-main), told me she had approved the  bill a couple of weeks ago.
 
At this time, we have not received notice of  payment.
