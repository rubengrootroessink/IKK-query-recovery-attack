Jim -- I've begun the pairings process for the golf tournament. At your convenience, could you please let me know your handicap and also if there is anyone in particular that you would like in your group. It looks like a handicap of 16 or lower will put you in the "A" player category.

Thanks for your support and guidance on the AFS memorial. I'm working with Fran Berg to make sure we handle the presentation appropriately.
