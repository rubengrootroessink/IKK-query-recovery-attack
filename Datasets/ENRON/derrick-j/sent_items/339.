Subject:=09FW: Organizational Change


One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organ=
ized in a way that allows all of us to provide quality services to our clie=
nts in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is t=
o modify our internal organization to better track the "functionalized" org=
anization that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial ar=
eas.  Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our res=
ources to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce=
 that Colleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediat=
ely.  Richard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Col=
leen's team will have primary responsibility for serving the "new business =
generation" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operatio=
ns group.  Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sa=
le transactions and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead re=
sponsibility on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each =
of these lawyers will also continue serving the numerous other clients they=
 assisted before this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the =
rest of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way a=
cquisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Gr=
eg Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory ac=
tivity on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Mond=
ay, as Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, an=
d will coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot a=
s he gets up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will con=
tinue its role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus=
/FGT.  Dot's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group=
, the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexib=
le.  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with pro=
jects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the =
challenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy! =20

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in=
 welcoming Bill to the group on Monday! =20
