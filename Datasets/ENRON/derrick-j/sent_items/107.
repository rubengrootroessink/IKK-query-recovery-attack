Subject:	Registration of Enron Corp. on the eLawForum Web Site

James,

Per Steve Wyatt's suggestion, I have taken the liberty of registering Enron
Corporation on the eLawForum web site.  In the course of completing the
registration, I accepted the eLawForum User Agreement on behalf of Enron.
Please let me know if you have any questions about the User Agreement.  We
would be happy to address any concerns.

I have created the 2 roles for you that are required to use our site.  The
first role is as "Client Administrator."  This role allows you to manage the
site, primarily by adding and deleting users and assigning them appropriate
roles.  Your login name and password for your roles as Client Administrator
are: Login - "jderrick" and Password - "enron".  Please note that both your
login and passwords are case sensitive.

I have also created for you the second role of "RFP Administrator."  In this
role, you can create a new RFP and/or manage existing RFPs.  You are
required to have a second Login name and Password for this second role.  I
have assigned you the Login in of "jamesderrick" and Password of "enroncorp"
in your role as RFP Administrator.  Once again, the login name and password
are case sensitive.

To logon and begin using the web site, go to www.elawforum.com.  Click on
"logon" and sign on in your role as RFP Administrator.  Let me know if you
would like a quick walk through the site.  In addition, please contact me
when you are ready to post your first RFP.  Our service includes providing
Enron hands on assistance every step of the way.

Sincerely,


Paul Pien
