Dear Sir,

Re: Request for urgent mutual business Transaction

It is a pleasure to introduce myself to you. I am Mr.
Douglas Akin, an Accountant by profession with the
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and a member of
the Presidential (Petroleum) Task Force Committee set
by the present democratic Government in Nigeria, to
supervise the sales and award of Crude Oil contracts
through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC).

The Chairman with the entire members of this committee
have concluded every arrangement and now agreed to
transfer out of the country a total sum of $85,
500,000.00 (Eighty five million and Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars Only) to a reliable corporate or
private account oversea for mutual disbursement, hence
my reason to contact you. This amount is the excess
sum realized from sales of Crude Oil above the
government regulated price margin as a result of price
fluctuation, which we never rendered accurate sales
figures to the government for reasons you now know.

Benefits: At the successful conclusion of this
business, your good self shall be entitled to 20% of
the total sum remitted into your account for your
collaboration, 5% shall be set aside to defray all
expenses incurred during the transaction by both
parties and the balance of US$75% for the committee.
If you are interested in this business as I hope you
will, please contact me urgently at any of  the above
e-mail address or fax number, quoting our existing
secret code of this business, as Black & White, then,
I will revert back to you with detailed information.

Note: When dialing our fax, you do not need to add our
country code of 234. Just dial your international
access code, then followed by   our fax number. If you
are in Canada or USA, and outside the area code of
801, then omit 1 but add the 801. You may equally
e-mail us at the above e-mail address.

Yours sincerely,
Signed:
MR. DOUGLAS AKIN,
FOR & ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.
