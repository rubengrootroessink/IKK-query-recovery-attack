Walt, the East Lake proposal sounds great IF it fits into your schedule.  I plan to return to Houston either Wednesday morning or Wednesday afternoon, depending on whether we do or do not play East Lake.  Please do not reschedule any meetings you have just to enable us to play Wednesday morning-- Austusta will certainly have been excitement enough.  I am leaving Houston tomorrow morning and will not be able to check e-mail after this afternoon, so if you need to reach me drop me a voice mail at 713-853-5550. All the best.  Jim

Here's the drill.
I understand that Jim will come here on Sunday night. We'll book him a room
at the Atlanta Ritz-Carlton, right next to the office.
Bobby will arrive Monday in time for lunch and we'll set up a few people
anxious to talk to Jim after lunch.
We will leave here about 4:15 to arrive and drive down Magnolia Lane at 6:30
p.m. Take a tour, have a putting contest or whatever, drinks and dinner.
Next morning we'll play 18, have lunch and play either the par 3 or another
nine, then leave about 4:30 to get Sam back to Atlanta in time for a dinner
he has here that night.Jim and Bobby could catch any plane after about 9 or
spend the night here. Let us know if you want hotel reservations for Tuesday
night. If so, do you want to play East Lake Wed. a.m.?
NO SHORTS,ONLY LONG PANTS at Augusta.
I think no cell phones, too. I have the caddies yardage book, which the
three of us can memorize on the way over.
Sam shot 69!!!! last weekend at a nearby course, so we'll see if the secret
can stay around that long.
This will be great fun and we are all looking forward to it.
