Dear All

You may have recently received a letter from Companies House regarding the overdue accounts for TME Engineers Limited, for the period ending 30 April 2000. This letter will be sent to all directors of the Company.

The accounts for this Company were due to be filed at the end of February 2001. Unfortunately a filing extension request (form 244) was never filed and the accounts must now be filed by 3 December at the latest to avoid penalties being incurred. 

The April accounts require a Letter of Comfort to be supplied from Enron, and in the current situation this will not be possible within the timescale for filing. (The Letter of Comfort is required as the Company requires inter-company loans to remain in place for the Company to remain solvent). 

To solve this problem, the Balance Sheet of TME Engineers Limited is being restructured to ensure the directors can sign on a going concern basis, and this will be arranged within the next few days. Peter Pentecost will be calling each of you over the next couple of days to explain the background to the problem more fully and to outline the solution/answer any questions you may have.  

In case for any reason the restructure of the Balance Sheet cannot be completed by the 3 December deadline, we are agreeing with Arthur Andersen an alternative basis for the audit opinion to be signed, such that the Accounts can still be signed off and submitted by the Directors in time. 

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue,  please contact Brian Muscroft on 0044 207 783 2703.
