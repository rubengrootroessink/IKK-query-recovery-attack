Hi Mark,
I am a former investor, and received a complaint in yesterday's mail from
Bernstein, Liebhard & Lifshitz.  Although their complaint may have some
merit, they fail to point out that in early 2001 (1/21/2001- I bought @ 70
1/8 & sold 9 days later @ 79.5), there was significant press relating to
the energy crisis- Lack of electricity in California, and shortages of
petroleum reserves, etc.  That is why I bought.  I saw an opportunity for
energy companies overall, with regards to sales volume & earnings
potential.
So, although their claims may (or may not) have substantive legal merit
(with regards to the  Limited Partnership debacle), I, and perhaps others,
bought and/or sold the stock due to circumstances related only to the
energy crises, and opportunities related therein.
Although I'm a small investor (traded only $ 1,540 worth of shares, as
noted above), feel free to write if I can help.
