	Jim -

	I think this is the final list.  If this looks ok to you we'll send it out and ask for topics.  Thanks.

Rob, the last time we spoke by e-mail about the general counsel group meeting before the law conference, you said you were checking with Vicki, Rex and Mark to see if they neded to add anyone else.  I have not heard anything more about that.  

Since we are having to firm up our reservation list at the hotel, I would like to get a final confirmation from you as to the attendees.  Here is the current list (which now includes Julia):

John Ale
Al Alexanderson
Rebecca Carter
Chuck Cheek
Jim Derrick
Mark Evans
Drew Fossum
Mark Haedicke
Elizabeth Labanowski
Mark Manley
Jordan Mintz
Kristina Mordaunt
Julia Murray
Eric Newell
Janet Place
Rex Rogers
Molly Sample
Vicki Sharp
Steven Wallace
Rob Walls

Jim said that he wanted this group to meeting on Wednesday, May 2.  Do you want lunch served in the room, or should we break for lunch?  Should either your assistant or Stephanie Harris be included?

Please confirm that this is the correct list.  Once I get that from you, I will send out an e-mail to the these people so that we can know how many rooms to reserve for Tuesday night.  Some people may want to come over Tuesday, while others may just fly over Wednesday morning.

Thanks for your help!
