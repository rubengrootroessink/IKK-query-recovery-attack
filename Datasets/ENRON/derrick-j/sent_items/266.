Hurray!  More good news from Argentina!  Today the Argentine Supreme Court granted TGS an injunction against payment of the stamp tax assessed by the Province of Rio Negro pending resolution of the matter.  Rio Negro recently rejected TGS's final administrative appeal against payment of the tax with penalties and interest in the amount of US $436 million!  Rio Negro had ordered payment by April 26 and threatened to commence collection proceedings.  Recall that 3 weeks ago, the Court also granted TGS an injunction against payment of the tax in Santa Cruz in the amount of US $17 million which was unprecedented.

Dodged another bullet!
Cheers!
Michelle
