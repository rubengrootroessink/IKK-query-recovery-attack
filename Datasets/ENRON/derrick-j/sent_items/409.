Subject:=09Taking it to the house


To my friends and colleagues:=20
        After 27+ years with Houston Pipe Line Company (under the successiv=
e ownership of HNG, InterNorth, Enron, and now AEP), I've decided to try so=
mething different.  As of September 30, I will no longer be getting up and =
driving downtown to work every day.  Much has happened in 2001, on personal=
, family, professional, national, and global levels, which has induced me t=
o act on my inclination to retire (I've been thinking about it ever since I=
 got that solicitation from AARP).  There is much that I will miss (daily c=
amaraderie with co-workers and colleagues, challenging work, interesting pr=
ojects, a paycheck), but there are other things that I can do without (rush=
 hour traffic, cumbersome regulations, long hours, irreconcilable conflicts=
, office politics, tedious paperwork, seemingly endless meetings, payroll d=
eductions).  On balance, it looks like a fair trade.=20
        I have enjoyed the very good fortune of having a challenging and sa=
tisfying career, and of having been able to do so in the company of many wo=
nderful people.  I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for your=
 friendship and support over the years, for contributing to my never-ending=
 education, and for being a valued part of my experiences and memories.  Th=
ere have been a lot of good times, and some less good times, but I wouldn't=
 want to start all over again and see how it turns out next time around.  I=
 am enormously grateful for all of my many blessings, and hopefully the sam=
e is true for you.  =20
        My general plan for right now is to contemplate the future and my p=
lace in it, which sound pretty good to me -- both the process of contemplat=
ion as well as the future itself.  I do intend to find some arguably produc=
tive and/or fun ways to spend my new otherwise idle time, and finding out w=
hat those may be should be half the fun.  Perhaps the biggest concern is ho=
w long Linda will be able to tolerate my not getting up and leaving the hou=
se every weekday morning, but she's at the church a lot of the time anyway.=
  I'm sure the boys are wondering how my being around the house more will a=
ffect their tranquility and privacy, and that remains to be seen, although =
I doubt that I'll be hanging out with them and their friends very much anyw=
ay.=20
        One of my specific resolutions as we go forward is to do a better j=
ob of keeping up with friends.  The wonders of e-mail will facilitate that =
endeavor, but I will also be available in person for lunches, happy hours, =
tee times, dinners, movies, and other consultations. I already know where t=
o find you; reciprocally, my contact information will now be tsheltont@aol.=
com; 3507 Plumb, Houston, TX 77005; phone 713-665-5315; and fax 713-665-741=
0.  As time goes on, I may self-indulgently send e-mail updates; if you con=
sider them "spam," you know where the "Delete" button is.=20
        Linda and I will be out of town on a trip to New England next week,=
 but when we return I will commence a substantially different way of life. =
 I am eagerly anticipating whatever the future may hold.  Like most people,=
 I'm anxious to spend more time with my family (they may be a little anxiou=
s about that, too).  Myriads of exciting new opportunities and challenges u=
ndoubtedly await, and I'm looking forward to discovering and pursuing many =
of them.  The list of things I want or need to do is already quite long, an=
d will likely grow even faster than I can check things off the list.=20
        As for the very immediate future, I'm going to click on "Send," pic=
k up my briefcase, and head for the elevator.  We have to get ready to go t=
o Brian's volleyball tournament in Dallas tomorrow.  So long for now, best =
wishes, and see ya around.
