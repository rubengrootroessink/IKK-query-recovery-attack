Thanks for the prompt reply, Jim.  I'm forwarding it to Pat now.  We will
run the final decision on this by the Executive Committee before we commit.

Incidentally, any word from Tom Green on the Tech Center?

David

Pat, as we know, February can be a very difficult month from the standpoint
of weather, which affects not only travel to and from the event but also
any outside activities during the event.  Do we have any flexibility with
respect to the month in which the institute is held?  If it is to be held
in February, I would opt to try Houston, New Orleans, or Santa Fe. I
suggest that, if possible, we avoid scheduling the conference on Valentines
Day or any holiday.  All the best.  Jim Derrick

   As you know, the Institute in San Antonio this year was the first
   Institute
   ever held outside of Dallas.  We are now planning next year's Institute,
   and
   we would appreciate your input -- as a member of the Advisory Board --
   on
   the best location for 2002.  Please reply to this email
   (dwinn@swlegal.org)
   within the next 2 days with your preference among the following options:

   Dallas
   Houston
   San Antonio
   Austin
   Oklahoma City
   New Orleans
   Santa Fe

   FYI:  The preferences of the Institute attendees who turned in their
   evaluation forms were as follows:

   Houston -- 15
   San Antonio -- 13
   New Orleans -- 13
   Santa Fe -- 11
   Austin -- 8
   Dallas -- 6
   Oklahoma City -- 4

   Thank you for your reply.  We'll let you know after we've tallied the
   results.
