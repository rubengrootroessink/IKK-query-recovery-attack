Hello Jim,
Boy, it must be quite hectic for you and your  staff.  I trust you are in a protected position, and that the buyout will  be advantageous to you personally.  You are a terrific person, and I know  you are invaluable to Enron; I believe you will do quite well, whatever  happens.   Just wanted you to know I'm thinking positive thoughts for  you. Toby
