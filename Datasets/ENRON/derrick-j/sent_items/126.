	Do you have any objection to Paulette moving with Elizabeth?

Don't know if you care about this, but my little group is moving to 50M in a couple of weeks (to your old area, i think).  There is apparently lots of empty space on 50M, so if you want to move Paulette over and let her be near us, that is fine with me.

Have a great weekend.
