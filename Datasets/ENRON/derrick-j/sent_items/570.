Steve, thank you for the message.  I have forwarded a copy of your resume to Bob Williams, the Enron litigation manager who is coordinating the effort.  All the best. Jim

Jim - 
 
I'm glad we got to say a brief  hello several Mondays ago, when I was in your shop for a couple of days  helping with a third party document production.  That was, I believe,  just the day before all hell broke loose at Enron.
 
As a strong admirer of the Enron  legacy, it has been sad for me to watch events unfold over the last month.   Also, I sincerely hope you will be OK personally and in good shape  professionally when all the smoke finally clears.
 
This note is also a reminder that,  with the enormous gatherings of inf0rmation facing your organization in the  coming months -- between investigations, due diligence, and  shareholder suit discovery  -- I am still available to come help with those  needs.  Over and above my self-serving interest in having the work, on a  very personal level I'd like to be able to help out.
 
In case it is needed, another copy  of my resume is attached.  
 
Good luck, Jim, and hang  tough.
 
Steve
