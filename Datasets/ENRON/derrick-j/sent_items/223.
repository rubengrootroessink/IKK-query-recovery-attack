===========================================================================
*  Investors appear to have been racing to sell ENE shares because of its
   apparent high P/E multiple (ignoring the considerable value of segments
   including Enron Energy Services, telecom and non-energy wholesale
   services) and misconceptions about a number of issues including its
   stalled asset disposition program (the Portland General Electric sale
   could be significantly delayed), the market position of its Indian power
   plant and California energy issues.  We believe that the current period
   of perceived uncertainly is actually an excellent opportunity to buy
   into a company that we view as virtually unique in the economy.  We
   believe that the energy industry in the United States and world is
   undergoing a major transformation and that a very few companies led by
   Enron are positioned to create efficiencies and provide the products,
   services and flexibility required by customers.  We believe these
   opportunities will lead to growth in earnings of 25% over the long term
   even if telecommunications makes only slow progress and does not come
   close to reaching our expectations.

*  Enron is likely to report strong results in Q1 and 2001 from all core
   businesses.  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf. call that
   it was 'very comfortable' with  ests of $1.70 to $1.75, we continue to
   be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our $1.80
   estimate.  Wholesale Services is likely to have an 'outstanding quarter'
   according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25% to 35% increase in natural gas
   volumes and a doubling of financial volumes.  Retail appears on track to
   achieve its $30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in
   2001 on a fully allocated basis.  Telecom has progressed at a slower
   pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to
   be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content
   business (now without Blockbuster as a partner) appears to also be
   developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000.  This said, the
   business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent.
