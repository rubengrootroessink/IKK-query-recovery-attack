I just spoke to John Sutton, who was calling from his home in Austin.

He asked that I inform you that he regrets that he will be unable to
attend the Jurisprudence Luncheon.  He was very much looking forward to
it, and visiting with you.  Unfortunately he just brought his wife home
from the hospital, where she had been treated for pneumonia, and needs to
stay with her at the present time.
