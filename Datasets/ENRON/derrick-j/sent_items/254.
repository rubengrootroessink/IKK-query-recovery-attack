Jim -

Pursuant to my e-mail, here is some information on one of the three
potential GOM/GOI arbitrator candidates that we want to approach.  I don't
have detailed information abou the other two but hope to have something
more by Monday.

Let me know if you have comments or concerns.

Thanks,
Bruce

Subject:  Indian Counsel


Bruce,

Justice PN Bhagwati
For many years he was the Chief Justice of India - and was responsible for
many of the landmark decisions passed by the Supreme Court. After
retirement
from the Supreme Court he has pursued a career as an arbitrator and has
been
involved on a number of international arbitrations. As a separate career he
provides legal opinions on commercial matters. He is currently recognised
as
one of if not the outstanding senior lawyers in India. He with Justice
Chandrachud are probably India's best known arbitrators.

Has an outstanding reputation as an intellect to be reckoned with - in the
conferences I have had with him (on Metgas) and in Chris and Atul's
dealings
with him you have to marvel at his speed of thought despite the years.

Our primary concern with him appearing on the other side either for GOI or
GOM as their arbitrator, apart from his capability, is the simple fact that
he is extremely busy. If GOI or GOM want to slow down an arbitration
proceeding then in Atul's words "there can be no better choice than Mr
Bhagwati".

He has chaired several commissions - eg he wrote the revised Takeover Code.
He has also been responsible for much of the insolvency legislation.

I don't have sufficient details on Justices Chandrachud and Chandurkar and
could I please ask Chris to forward these to Bruce.

Sandeep
