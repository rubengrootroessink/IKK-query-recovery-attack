Subject:	Dabhol Power Project - Notice of Arbitration (GOM/SSA)

I attach a more developed (if longer) version of the proposed Notice of
Arbitration.

I would be grateful if Paul Kraske and his team could assist Andrew House in
verifying the facts, dates or events etc. indicated in the text.

Assuming that the PFM notice is served tomorrow, I should be grateful if a
copy could be sent at that time to the GOM demanding written confirmation of
the immediate cessation of all adverse activities complained of in the PFM,
the confirmation to reach DPC by 12:00 hours 1ST on 9th April 2001 (failing
which an arbitration will be commenced immediately against the GOM). My
point is this no such confirmation will be forthcoming, and even if it were
we would go ahead anyway. For formalistic purposes I simply wish to
crystallise in written form the existence of the disputes as between DPC and
the GOM.

We next need a 60-day notice under Clause 17.4(d) of the PPA.
