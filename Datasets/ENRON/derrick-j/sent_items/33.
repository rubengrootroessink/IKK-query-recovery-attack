We are calling all table sponsors to see which tables are being used, and
how many seats are being filled.  This helps us with the meal order, the
registration and the room set-up.  I would appreciate your response
(today preferably) as to the number of family members and/or guests you
would like us to set a table(s) for.  We can handle the specific names
either tomorrow or Friday.

Thanks.

Jeff
