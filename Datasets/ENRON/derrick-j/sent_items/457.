Joe:  I don't believe this invoice came to me, but I will try to run it down and get it paid.  Jim:  Did you receive this?  If yes, just send it down to me and I will take care of it .  Thanks, Rex

Rex,
 
We  sent up thru Jim's office earlier in the week a bill from the local firm,  Medleh, that has been doing our copying and imaging.  They've told us they  will shut down operations for Enron if they don't get paid.  That will halt  some of our efforts to respond to the SEC subpoena.  Is there some way to  check on where that stands?
 
Joe
