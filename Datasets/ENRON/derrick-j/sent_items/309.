Dear Professor Hu, thank you for your message.  Your participation by telephone, for whatever portion of your afternoon might be free, would be very welcome.  I currently plan to be in Austin for the UT Law School Foundation Board meeting and related matters on November 9 and 10.  Perhaps our paths will cross there.  All the best.  Jim Derrick

Dear Mr. Derrick:

	Thank you for including me in this venture.  It promises to be fun and
useful.  Unfortunately, in terms of the November 2nd meeting, a faculty
candidate I'm primarily responsible for is coming through the law school
the same day.  He is giving a colloquium late morning/early afternoon and
my wife and I are hosting the dinner for him and his wife that evening.
So, especially given the post-9/11 logistics, it doesn't seem practical for
me to come to Dallas for this meeting.  One possibility might be for me to
participate by phone for a portion of the afternoon meeting and I would be
happy to do so.  But given the nature and length of the meeting, this
probably doesn't make sense - please let me know what you think.

	Best regards.
