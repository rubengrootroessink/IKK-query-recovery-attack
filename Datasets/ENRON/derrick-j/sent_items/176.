La Hora (Ecuador), 16 Mar 2001, ON-LINE:-
 In Ecuador, the anti-corruption and public ethics commission CCCC announced it has detected irregularities in the contract this country's state-owned oil company PetroEcuador signed with Arcadia, Texaco, Enron and Glencore, involving some 72,000 crude oil barrels per day production. The CCCC released a report it plans to pass to this country's General Attorney for its further anlysis.
