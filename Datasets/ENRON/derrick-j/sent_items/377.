Jim,

CC have asked for permission to act for a potential purchaser of our JV company in Korea. This falls within EGAS and Bruce Lundstrom has given the all clear. CC are of course aware of the consequences of acting adversely to Enron in litigation. 

Unless you object, I will confirm that CC can proceed. 

Thanks



								Mark

Mark -

SK Enron is part of EGAS.

It is my understanding that there were more than 15 expressions of interest in acquiring our interest in SK Enron.  Accordingly, there will be a number of firms that will be representing potential buyers.  I don't think that we have a problem with Clifford Chance representing a potential buyer.  We have not used CC in connection with this investment.

Bill, I've never heard CC's name come up in connection with SK Enron (e.g., representing a seller in SK Enron's purchase of a smaller LDC) but would appreciate your confirmation as well.

Thanks,
Bruce

Gents,

I am trying to discover who has legal or commercial responsibility for SK Enron Korea. I personally have no difficulty with Clifford Chance acting on this disposal on the other side of the table from Enron, but have no knowledge of which law firms other divisions use in this area. 

I'd be grateful for feedback as a matter of urgency. 

Thanks



								Mark

Dear Mark,

I refer to my below email and our telephone conversation of last week. You
wanted to find out the person responsible for this project within Enron and
you were absolutely correct with your comment that this is, as usual, a very
urgent matter. Please be informed that in the meantime my partners in Asia
contacted the CFO of Enron in Asia, Jeremy Thirsk, who does not envisage
that there will be a conflict. Jeremy promised to confirm the position once
he has spoken to you or to Bruce Lunstrom. I hope that this has happened in
the meantime. Could you, please, give us your final ok as soon as possible?

Thank you very much.
Kind regards,
Johannes Perlitt
