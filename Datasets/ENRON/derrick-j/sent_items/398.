Folks -

We had a lawyer conference call today to discuss the prospect of filing a
suit in London Commercial Court to enjoin the GOM from trying to file a
suit in India to void the GOM Guarantee and State Support Agreements.

Chris Walker, local counsel, GE and Bechtel support filing the suit.  Other
than Jim McCartney, the Enron representatives support filing the suit.  In
the end, Jim McCartney defers to Chris Walker's judgment.

Filing suit in London has some risks.  We are uncertain of the response of
the India Supreme Court, the GOM and the current GOM/DPC arbitration panel.
The Supreme Court may take offense to the filing (although Chris thinks
that this risk is small).  In a perverse way, our filing in London could
further induce GOM to file in India (although we believe that they will in
any event).  The current arbitration panel may use this as an opportunity
to wait until the underlying DPC/MSEB dispute is decided (although Chris
doubts it).

My understanding is that Enron commercial supports the filing of the suit.
It is scheduled to be filed on Friday. If any of you would like to revisit
the issue before Friday, please let me know.

Bruce
