Jim,

I am looking forward to working with Michelle to Co-Chair the 2002 event.  We appreciate your confidence in us and are honored to be the Co-Chairs.   Michelle Cash and her team did set a high standard and also put in place the ground work to help ensure successful events for the future.  I know Michelle Cash has a notebook of information that she would like to pass on to the next Chairs.  We will schedule a meeting with Michelle Cash shortly.  

Regards,
David

Michelle and David, I would very much appreciate your serving as Co-Chairs of the 2002 Enron Legal Department Conference, which will be held at a Westin resort in the Dallas area. Michelle Cash and her team, of which the two of you were important members, have set an extremely high standard, but I know that you will do a superb job! Please let me know when you would like me to ask the various groups to select the members of your team.  Thank you! Jim
