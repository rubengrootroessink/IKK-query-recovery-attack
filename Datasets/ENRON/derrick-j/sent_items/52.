Mark: My apologies, as I thought I had previously responded.  There is no additional update need from Global Finance. Let me know if you have questions.

	In your last memo to the general counsel, you requested that they respond to me by last Friday with respect to updating the Enron marks.  To date,  I have only received responses from Mark Haedicke, Randy Young, and John Ale.  Would you be so kind as to remind everyone again?  Thanks for your assistance.
