jim,  thankyou most graciously for the help.  i share your philosophy that you "try to support the lawyers in our community."  i feel i too give that support through my active presence as a member of the boards/executive committees of the federal bar association, south texas chapter (vice president), american inns of court, garland walker inn (secretary), american bar association, section of litigation (co-chair of cle)  and of course the ut law school executive committee.

we would like to contact chuck cheek as well (we do have an oil and gas practice) and i would appreciate your giving him a "heads up" that jerry swonke or i will contact him.   thanks.    best regards,  roger
