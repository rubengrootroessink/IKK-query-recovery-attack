Do you want to do this again?  If so, who do I invite.  I have forgotten who all were attending the last time.  S

Hello Stephanie,  how are you doing?  Can you check with Jim to see if we can come up with a date some time in May for a visit from Ed Feo, Eric Silverman and Mel?  I remembered that Jim had asked to wait until April to resume our efforts in tryng to schedule this.  Thanks.  Best regards.
