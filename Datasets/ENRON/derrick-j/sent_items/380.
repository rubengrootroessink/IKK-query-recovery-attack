Michael, I am currently scheduled to be in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday and Thursday, returning to Houston Thursday night.  If my schedule changes so that I can be at your event, I certainly shall.  I admire the way in which you are running your campaign.  All the best.  Jim

         Jim,
 
         As  a reminder, our big luncheon fundraiser will be next Thursday.  Thanks for  agreeing to  
         be  on the host team.  I can tell you it opened  doors for me!
 
         I have attached an invitation.  I hope you can  make it.  We're having a host table, and I  
         hope  you can be there.  Please let me know.   I know Enron legal is having a meeting (in  
        the  Woodlands?) that day, but if you could stop by it would be  great. 
Thanks for your  support.
 
Michael
