John, we used Shearman & Sterling in connection with our dispute with Peru in respect of the nationalization of our offshore oil and gas properties.  We haven't done too much with them since then.  Jim

Wessex's regulatory lawyer, Chris Bright, has just joined Shearman and Sterling from Clifford Chance.  Until late 1998, he was with Linklaters, Wessex's corporate counsel when it was publicly traded.

Jim, does Enron have a good relationship with Shearman and Sterling?  Though I haven't talked with the Wessex folks, I'm sure Wessex would want to continue using Chris--he is really good.
