Hi Jim. We are starting to work on a second receivables transaction [involving financial receivables in a terms structure as opposed to physical gas receivables in a conduit deal]. I recommend that V&E represent us, and that Sidley& Austin represent Deutsche Bank on this deal -- there are some economies from using the same firms that just closed the receivables deal last quarter.
