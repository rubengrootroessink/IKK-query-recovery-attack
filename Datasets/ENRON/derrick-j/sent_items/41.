Jim,

Well, you finally gave a speech that topped the one you gave at Linda's and my rehearsal dinner.  You did an outstanding job (as did Carrin), and it was obvious you were speaking from the heart.  I know you would prefer not to have all of this attention, but it comes with the territory.  It sure made me proud to see you up there, and congratulations on the accomplishment.

Scotty
