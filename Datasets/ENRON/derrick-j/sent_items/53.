To the first descriptive paragraph we should add "manufacture and sale of wind turbine electric generation equipment; ownership and operation (for ourselves and others) of wind turbine electric generation facilities".   Also in the third and last descriptive paragraphs we should consider substituting "wind energy" where it states "solar energy", unless another group is engaged in any solar energy related activities.  If so, we should add wind energy to the construction and development  and information dissemination sections of the recitation.  I believe with these changes our activities would be fairly disclosed.  Please call me if you have any questions.
