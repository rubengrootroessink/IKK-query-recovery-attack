I believe the committee has earned the right by its work to select the name. Jim

We really need to get an official name for the Portal. The finalists are:  

Enron Legal Edge 
Enron Legal Net
Enron Legal Source
EnLaw
Enron Legal Ease (copyright issues?) 

Who is going to pick this...Mr. Derrick, the GC's or the committee? 

I understand that you will only have a few introductory comments on the Portal rather than a 15 minute presentation. I will be meeting with you Thursday, and we can talk about what type of slides I can prepare for you to go along with your comments. We will have a Portal Demo outside the ballroom where the participants can see the demo and be provided with information on the categories. We have a new graphic design for the Portal Header which you can see below. Let me know your thoughts?
