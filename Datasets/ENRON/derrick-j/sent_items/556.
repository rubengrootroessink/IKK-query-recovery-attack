I propose that we send the following to Kristina from Jim:

  "Re:  LJM1 Issues

Kristina,

Thank you for providing information about LJM1 to Wilmer Cutler.  

Until we have more clarity about the issues with respect to LJM1, we believe it is advisable that you do not work on any transaction involving a sale of assets to LGM1, LGM2, or any related entities.

Please call me if you have any questions about the foregoing."

Please let me know if you agree and I will prepare this for Jim's signature.

Thank you.

Bob
