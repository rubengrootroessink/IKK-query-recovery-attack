Jim -

I'm attaching an e-mail from Chris Walker and a letter from Arthur
Marriott.

Arthur has been invited by the 2 existing arbitrators to act as the third
arbitrator in the existing GOI Guarantee arbitration.  Christopher supports
Arthur's participation.

However, Arthur and his firm have some Enron involvement.  First, he
represents Shell on the Cuiba project.  Second, some of Arthur's partners
(and not Arthur) have been advising some of the Indian lenders on aspects
of NY law.  Neither of these representations particularly bother
Christopher but he wants to make sure that it does not bother Enron.

Can you let me know today if you believe that these issues present a
problem for Arthur acting as the 3rd arbitrator?

Thanks,
Bruce

Bruce,

In order to stand this one up for 9th November 2001, I am going to need to
go back to Arthur Marriott QC tommorrow. Can you let me know whether you
foresee any difficulty with the potential conflicts to which he refers.
