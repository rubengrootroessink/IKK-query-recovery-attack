Jim, as we discussed late last night I checked with all folks in the DC office who would have any conceivable reason to talk to Treasury.  No one had a conversation yesterday where the SEC issue was discussed.  Today, I have checked with the remainder of the DC office, and no one has had such a conversation.   I hope this is helpful.
