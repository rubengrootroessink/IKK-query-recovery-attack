FYI, the Economic Times in India has published the following article, which=
 suggests details of a DPC buy-out.  While this article does not accurately=
 reflect the reception Wade Cline has been receiving in Delhi, it may be a =
trial balloon by the Prime Minister's office to gauge public reaction.  Dow=
 Jones has already carried a shortened version of the story, a copy of whic=
h appears at the bottom of this e-mail.  We are using the following stateme=
nt to respond to media inquiries:

Media Statement=20

DPC continues to hold discussions with GoI /IFI's regarding the sale of for=
eign sponsor equity in the Dabhol project. It would not be appropriate to e=
laborate further on the recurring media speculation with respect to the sta=
tus of these buyout discussions.=20

While we remain hopeful for an amicable resolution of this issue, DPC conti=
nues to pursue the available legal remedies under the contract documents in=
 order to protect the interests of DPC's stakeholders. =20

Enron nears deal to sell DPC to IFI's at 30% discount=20
IFIs may take over Enron for $700-800m, Shubhrangshu Roy=20


US power giant Enron is in advanced stages of negotiations to dispose of it=
s controversial Indian venture Dabhol Power Company at a 30 per cent discou=
nt to the financial institutions at a price of $700-800 million.=20

Enron and the FIs, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India, are sai=
d to be close to finalising a broad agreement to this effect in the next fe=
w days. The final settlement should be worked out before Prime Minister Ata=
l Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the US in the second week of November. Should =
the deal go through, Enron is likely to settle for a five-year payment plan=
 in equal instalments to minimise a heavy one-time foreign exchange outgo. =
Enron claims its financial exposure in DPC is over $1 billion. It had earli=
er insisted that it be paid this sum for any out-of-court settlement and to=
 enable its exit from India. Now it is likely to settle for a lesser amount=
, that is in the excess of $700 million, but definitely lower than $800 mil=
lion, which is its actual equity exposure in DPC. Sources close to the ongo=
ing negotiations say that the government is eager that the FIs take over DP=
C quickly so that the Prime Minister can tell US President George W Bush du=
ring his forthcoming visit to Washington that justice has been done to the =
power major.=20

Enron chairman Kenneth Lay, known to be close to the US President, was the =
biggest donor to Bush's campaign kitty. A settlement of the Enron imbroglio=
, being played out since early this year, is seen to be important to enhanc=
ing India's political relationship with the US. The government is keen that=
 the FIs take over DPC to avoid prolonged negotiations on a settlement that=
 would be necessary if a private Indian promoter were to step in. So far, B=
SES and Tata Power have evinced interest in taking over DPC, but their offe=
r prices are said to be too low. The FIs, on the other hand, are keen on an=
 early settlement as they have a huge loan exposure of over Rs 6,200 crore.=
 Should the FIs take over the company, they are expected to warehouse the p=
roject before selling it to a private buyer. This is expected to take at le=
ast 90 days.=20

Any prospective private sector buyer would need at least a month to underta=
ke a proper due diligence of DPC's accounts. Thereafter, the FIs could take=
 at least another 30 days to make an open offer and another month to close =
the sale with a private bidder or the State-owned National Thermal Power Co=
rporation.=20

Sources say of the $1-billion-plus exposure claimed by Enron in DPC, Enron'=
s equity exposure -- along with its US partners GE and Bechtel -- is $800 m=
illion. The company also claims to have spent around $200 million as "devel=
opment expenditure" and around $140 million by way of retained earnings.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) is in an adva=
nced stage of negotiations to sell its Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., at a =
30% discount to financial institutions at a price likely between $700 milli=
on-$800 million, reports the Economic Times, quoting unnamed sources.=20

The business daily says Enron and the financial institutions, led by the In=
dustrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), are close to finalizing a broad=
 agreement within the next few days. The final settlement should be worked =
out before Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the U.S. i=
n the second week of November, according to the report.

Should the deal go through, Enron is likely to settle for a five-year payme=
nt plan in equal instalments to minimize a heavy one-time foreign exchange =
transfer, says the report.=20

Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian stat=
e of Maharashtra. Enron holds a 65% stake in DPC. Costing $2.9 billion, the=
 project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.=20
