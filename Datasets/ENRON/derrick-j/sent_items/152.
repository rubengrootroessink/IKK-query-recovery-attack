Subject: The Reverend Hugh McIntosh



Our friend and former partner, Hugh McIntosh, completed his degree at the
Harvard Divinity School and was ordained to the ministry on June 3, 2001 at
the North-Prospect United Church of Christ in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In
the program for the service, he expressed great appreciation to his partners
and friends at Vinson & Elkins for "their wisdom, professionalism and
support which built the foundation for the future."

Hugh and Sara will soon move to Hawaii, where Hugh will be a chaplain at the
Punahou School.

I am attaching a picture of Hugh following the service, and hope that you
enjoy it.
