Paula tells me that we have accepted AF's resignation letter.  It was dated November 6, 2001.  Is that the effective date we want to use or some other date?

Per our conversation yesterday, will we get a resig. letter so we can get a date for the database?  I'm resigning him from all companies.  Thanks KC
