Saudi, I thought you would be interested in this. It appears that this scam, which, as you know, we have seen in many letters through the years, has made its way onto the net.  I have advised Joannie that she should not respond to this request. All the best.  Jim

Dear Friend,

I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed, the newly appointed head of
the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank
of Nigeria (CBN). I got your contact from a business
directory of your country and based on your business
activities and the type of investment I have in mind,
I found you to be the most suitable person for the
transaction stated below.

 Before I proceed, I want to strongly advice that you
devoid yourself from the general conception you have
about Nigerians. I would like you to carefully study
this proposal without bias, since it would be relevant
in our lives.

It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and
high-ranking government officials to divert
government's money into their private accounts; this
is usually done through CBN with the connivance of
senior officials. The ministers and military generals
especially during the era of late general sani Abacha,
achieve this by diverting most of the funds, meant for
the development of their respective agencies and
ministries into the CBN escrow accounts. Usually it is
this same escrow account that holds funds for the
payment of foreign contracts.  With the help of the
inside officials, the minister or senior government
officials and military generals would now create
themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign
partner to create them as artificial contractors,
using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money
to the nominated bank account of their foreign
partners. In this case the money is treated as payment
for foreign contract, and there is no trace. This is
how federal government's money is siphoned on a
regular basis, to the extent that most people now
result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge
they have about it.

Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the
central bank, he did not have enough time to perfect
and tidy up the transactions they have in place. So
the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow
account with no records. I just discovered this in a
bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of
our escrow account to the federal government and the
governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment.
I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow
account to declare to the government the total amount
that have been spent in the last three years and what
it was spent for. So,  in the course of carrying out
the above exercise, I discovered a total sum of
$150MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to
anyone and with no records. My intention is to reveal
about USD $100M to the federal government so that I
can be in his good books and make arrangement to
transfer the outstanding USD $50M into a safe account
abroad. It is based on this that I am making this
urgent contact with you.


However, I am doing this because of the nature of my
job. I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more
so, there is no way I can remain in this office
forever. I have children to cater for even when I
retire as the director, which is just next year. So, I
need something tangible to fall back on when I retire.
Besides, if I declare the total funds to the
government, it would probably go into the pockets of a
few people that control the government. This is to
enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria.
So, do not blame me for my action because you would do
the same if you were in my shoes, knowing fully well
that there will be no compensation even if you
disclose everything to the government.

Well, I have discovered that I can transfer this money
if we could quickly create you as an artificial
contractor, by using your company document and Bank
account to receive the money, in the same way my
successor transferred theirs. The only difference is
that the final payment is going to be made to your
named company through any of our correspondent payment
center in Europe or America, due to the policies
adopted by the new democratic government.

The entire process is not easy, but it is achievable
due to my position in the foreign remittance
department of the CBN, and the relationship I have
with the present director of external payment and
finance of the federal ministry of finance.

The entire operation will be between the three of us:
(I) I shall take care of all documentation, (ii) My
friend in the federal ministry of finance will take
care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all
documentation, (iii) You shall take care of the
banking arrangements, provide the needed invoices to
enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as
the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment
center you shall be paid from.

After we have succeeded in transferring this funds,
20% shall be retained by you for your assistance, 5%
for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the
course of this transaction and the remaining 75% shall
be for me and my colleague, which we would possibly
invest in into your company or any viable business
venture you suggest.

If you are comfortable with this programme please
revert to me at once via telephone number
234-1-7593507 or fax number 234-1-7590440. Should your
response be positive, I would then instruct on the
next step to take.

Due to security reasons, when you call, do not ask for
any name, simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone
number. Once I reconfirm my number to be
234-1-7593507, you can then mention my name before you
go into any discussion. If I fail to reply correctly,
do not wait for a second trial, just drop the phone
and call back later.

We demand a quick response from you. Any delay might
result in contacting someone else. Irrespective of
what happens, we count on your maturity to keep the
transaction to yourself. So, you are advised to treat
this transaction with utmost confidentiality.

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Yours faithfully,

Dr Rasheed Mohammed
