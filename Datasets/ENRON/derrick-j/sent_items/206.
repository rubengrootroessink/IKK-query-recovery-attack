Bruce and Gail,

I attach a rough first draft of the necessary Notice of Conciliation.

In its final form this needs to go in late tommorrow afternoon in New Delhi
if DPC is to be in a position to commence arbitration against the GOI as
quickly as is possible. There is any event 60 days of deadtime. There is no
sensible way of getting around that. Accordingly,the sooner DPC starts the
process,the sooner it gets to serve the necessary Notice of Arbitration.

It follows that if DPC wishes to get on with matters with the GOI as quickly
as is possible,this Notice of Conciliation requires to go in quickly.

Who does DPC wish to appoint as a conciliator (bearing in mind that DPC does
not genuinely wish to go through a full-blown conciliation,but simply wishes
to tee-up an arbitration on day 61)?

Laurence Street,whose name I have inserted,was the Chief Justice of NSW,and
is now in his mid-70s (but fairly fit and active; I saw him last at an ICCA
conference in New Delhi about 10 months ago). After ceasing to be a Judge he
did quite a lot arbitration. He was also the chairman (and an active
chairman) of Fairfax,a major Australian newspaper and media company and an
ASX component stock. Fairfax was the subject of a hostile bid,and had a
tough time with the Australian government.  As the chairman of Fairfax
Street has had some real business experience,but is also a pretty serious
lawyer. His main activity these days is mediation. He has done a lot of
it,mostly in high-profile Australian corporate disputes. If the conciliation
goes anywhere (which I tend to doubt) Street is about the most suitable
person I can think of at short notice.

If anyone has any better idea as to the identity of the conciliator,please
feel free to say so. If not,given that we have to cut quite quickly,my
suggestion and recommendation is that we go with Street.
