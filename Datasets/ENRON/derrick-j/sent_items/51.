The proposed location of the 2002 Institute is fine by me.  The suggested date of the mid-year meeting is shown as Friday, August 28.  I believe that August 28 falls on Tuesday.  Jim

TO:                Executive Committee of the Advisory Board
                     of the International Oil and Gas educational  Center
 
FROM:          Pat Martin, Chair
 
RE:             Mid-Year  Meeting and 2002 Oil & Gas Law Institute   
 
I would appreciate your prompt response  to the two questions presented below, regarding (1) the date of our mid-year  meeting and (2) the location of our 2002 Institute. 
At our annual meeting in San Antonio,  and pursuant to our long range plan for the center, we determined to institute  an annual mid-year meeting of the Executive Committee. An agenda will be  provided to you beforehand, but among the items for review will be our long  range plan to expand the scope of the center and recommendations from our  several new subcommittees: Programs (Chair John Lowe), Membership (Chair Jim  Armour), New Center Name (Chair Pat Martin) and Website and  Technology.
Absent a groundswell of opposition from  you, I intend to schedule this meeting for Friday, August 28, 2001 in Dallas.  Please let me know right away if this date is impossible for you.
I am happy to report that our 2002  Institute Co-Chairs, Brad Keithley of Jones Day in Dallas and Jack Lynch of BP  in Houston, will be joining us at the meeting as ex officio members of the  Executive Committee. 
Finally, attached are the results  of our poll of the 2001 Institute attendees and of our Advisory Board concerning  the preferred location for our 2002 Institute next February. It appears that all  roads lead to Houston this year. With the results of the San  Antonio program and a Houston program in hand, we will be in a better  position to determine the best home(s) for the Institute in the  future. Please let us know if Houston meets  your approval.
I appreciate your leadership at  this important time in the evolution of the center.
