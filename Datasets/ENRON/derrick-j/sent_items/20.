Hi Jim. Susan Bulgawicz asked for my assistance in the sale of one of the corporate aircraft -- N5737. Since the plane is financed and I have worked on the last 2-3 aircraft deals, there is a logical connection to my involvement. Susan and I both think that the best choice on legal representation is to continue working with the firm that represented Enron in the acquisition and original financing of the aircraft-- Akin Gump, rather than changing horses mid-stream. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.
