Emily, it appears that a matter in Europe will prevent me from attending.  I will contact you if the plans change.  Thank you.  Jim Derrick--Enron.

RE:  2001 Spring Meeting in Philadelphia


Attached is the agenda for the upcoming Spring meeting in Philadelphia.  The
Executive Committee has worked hard to develop a program that we anticipate
will
be lively and informative.  One of the highlights is the Thursday afternoon
panel of Washington experts discussing the new political environment, as
well as
legislation and policy initiatives that we should be aware of.

If you have not done so already, please let us know if you plan on attending
the
Spring meeting by responding to this e-mail.

If you have any questions about the program or the meeting in general please
call either Ann Linnehan at (203) 351-6113 or Emily Ward at (404) 249-2717.

I look forward to seeing all of you in Philadelphia.
