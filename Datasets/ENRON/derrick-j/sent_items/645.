Jim/Sheila:

At Paula Rieker's request, I have prepared the attached document, which discusses the need to retain three supervisors in the Corporate Services group of the Corporate Secretary's department.  I believe it to be self explanatory, but should you have additional questions, please let me know.                         HARDIE
