We do not provide copies of the policies.  

The Corporate indemnity is the first line of defense for the D's &O's.  If the indemnity responds, the company seeks reimbursement from the policy up to its limit.   There is no other D&O insurance above the $350,000,000, amount of insurance.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Kate and Larry,

	Limor Nissan in the New York office needs a copy of the Director and Officer Liability policy (or a similarily named document) for review.  Jean Michaud, a Canadian director, wants confirmation of coverage before signing documents.  Limor needs this information as quickly as possible.

Many thanks,
Laurie
