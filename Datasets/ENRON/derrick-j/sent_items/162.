Mark, thank you for the message.  Carrin and I returned safely; we very much enjoyed our dinner with the two of you and look forward to reciprocating in Houston.  In response to your questions:  (1) the GCs will meet in San Antonio beginning on the Wednesay morning of the conference.  There will be no scheduled GC dinner the night before, but those GCs who are in San Antonio that night may get together for an informal one; (2) I enjoyed meeting Marcus; my only question relates to the amount of legal experience he has; as you know, we normally take individuals who have been practicing longer than he has practiced; if you are satisfied that he can do the job well, I will support your recommendation; and (3) I do not have any issues with either of the law firms you mentioned. All the best. Jim

Jim,

I hope you and Carrin enjoyed your weekend in London and had a good trip back to Houston.

A couple of things:

- I wondered if it was clear yet when General Counsel meetings would be held prior to the conference, and whether those would be in Houston or San Antonio?

- how did Marcus Zwinger impress you? I would like to make him an offer, if you are agreeable.

- we are seeing a sudden increase in metals related arbitration claims. We intend to use two firms to assist with these - both are established shipping / commodities law firms: Holman Fenwick is one, Richards Butler is the other. Please let me know if we have any issues with either of those firms.

Many thanks.



							Mark
