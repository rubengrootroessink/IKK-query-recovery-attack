				Emilio,

				I think you should proceed.  Could you send me a resume?

				Jim, our two lawyers at Azurix Buenos Aires have needed some assistance in handling routine matters, given that most of Emilio's time is taken up with the termination issues.  The though has been to hire a local lawyer, known to the local team, on a contract basis to help with these items.  There's significant work to help in dealing with pending construction and supply contracts as the concession winds down.  I assume this is OK with you.

				John,
				I met this lawyer that I mentioned to you again, and she seems to be
				ready to manage working for us full-time during a three months period in
				order to help us, mainly with the fixing of contractual issues with our
				suppliers vis a vis termination / tranfer of the contracts to the
				Province / determination of liabilities. The costs would not be high,
				and she seems to be (I hope so) a very discreet person (particularly
				considering the job she currently has). If you do not have a problem
				with this (my only concern is her work at the Municipality), I would ask
				her to start working for us on Monday, not on a labour relationship
				basis, but rather on a independent professional one (she would bill us
				for her services).
