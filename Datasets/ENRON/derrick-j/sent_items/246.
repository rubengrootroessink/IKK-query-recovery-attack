Dad,
After reading and rereading the revised version I have decided to go with
the revised version without making any changes. I belive that it accuratly
sums up the reasons for my academic shorcommings that have plagued my
college years at Ole Miss. I hope that things will work out so that I can
set the record straight and make my family proud. I want to think you again
for being such an anchor in my life. I wish you could come back to Madrid
for a couple of days and hang out. The weather is truly inspiring. Primavera
is here. The sun is shining and the flowers are blooming. When mom was here
we went to the Thyssien and it mad me reminisce about what a wonderful time
I had with you here. I look forward to the next time. I am also very happy
to hear of the positive results stemming from Carrin?s trip to another one
of my favorite recent memories of us together in Scottsdale. Well lets keep
are fingers crossed and if things don?t go our way then I will find a
different avenue inwhich I can succeed. love, Son
