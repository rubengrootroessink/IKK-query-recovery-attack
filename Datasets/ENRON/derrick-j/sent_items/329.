Mark, S&S is a quality firm, but in my experience it tends to be very expensive (as are most of the New York firms).  I do not know whether it has offices in Washington State or Kentucky.  We have not in recent years used S&S to a significant degree.  What other firms have you considered? Jim

Jim,

we are evaluating 3 metals assets acquisition opportunities: 

1. the Longview alumina smelter in Washington State

2. the Vanalco alumina smelter in Washington State

3. an Arco/BP aluminum rolling facility in Kentucky.

I would like to run with one external US firm on these deals (the 3 deals are at exactly the same preliminary stage and there will be some economies of scale to be had. Also consistency of approach is important). The firm also needs to have strong offices with metals expertise both in London and New York and preferably close to the facilities in question. 

The firm I believe can deliver these advantages is Shearman and Sterling. I have spoken to a couple of people in the Houston office about this to get their views.

I would be grateful for your confirmation that you have no objection to this.

Thanks very much Jim.
