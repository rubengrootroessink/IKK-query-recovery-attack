Bill, thank you.  I should have mentioned in my earlier message that my travel agent did tell me about that flight, but I determined that it was not practicable to rely on it for two reasons: (1) if it were to be cancelled, I would have no way of getting back in time for the Monday meeting, and (2) if it were not cancelled, the most-of-the-night journey back would not leave me in the condition I need to be in to participate effectively in the meeting. I do very much appreciate your efforts.  My best to you and Mary.  Jim

Jim--

I just called my travel agent.  She says that Continental has a non-stop flight that leaves at 1:30 am and gets into Houston at 6:26 am.

Bill and Mary, unfortunately, it appears that Carrin and I will not be able
to attend after all.  An Enron Policy Committee (essentially, our executive
committee, of which I am a member) meeting has been called for Monday, and
I must attend it in person.  The flights from LA to Houston on Sunday night
depart too early to enable us to attend the LA event, and the earliest
flight on Monday morning arrives in Houston too late for me to attend the
Policy Committee meeting timely.  We are extremely disappointed, as you may
imagine.  We are very appreciative of your kind invitation and look forward
to seeing both of you soon. We will watch the event on television in the
hope that we see you being interviewed. I know you will represent us well!
Let us know if your plans include a Houston trip--we would welcome the
opportunity to entertain you.   All the best.  Jim

   Hi Jim--

   I just got back from San Francisco.  We are delighted you will be
   joining us.  It will be a fun night.

   We are hiring limos to take us to and from the Shrine Auditorium.
   Because both John Quinn and I live in Pasadena, the limos will be
   picking us up and dropping us off there.  Also, we are likely to have a
   dinner following the awards ceremony in Pasadena.  So--my recommendation
   would be for you to stay at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena.

   Your voice message said that you have not finalized travel plans yet.
   If you get out in time for dinner on Saturday, we should get together.
   As soon as you have your reservations, give me a call or e-mail me.  My
   direct dial at work is 213-533-8667.  My cell phone is 818-519-8751.
   Mary's cell is 818-519-8750.

   I think it would be productive for you to spend some time with us on
   Monday morning.  know the people working on your matters would like to
   meet you.  Perhaps I could pick you up on the way to work on Monday.

   Bill, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London and seen your
   message.  Thank you for the feedback and for everything that you and
   your
   firm have done for us. I believe our respective organizations make a
   great
   team!  Please give my and Carrin's best to your wife:  we have many fond
   memories of our time with the two of you and your other guests at the
   GRAMMY Awards.  Also, I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption, Q.C. that we had
   the honor of being represented by you; he is another of your fans.  All
   the
   best.  Jim

      Hi Jim--

      The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to
      breath.  We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours
   (since
      we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the
      experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.

      Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual
   pressure--with
      so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you
      work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of
   esprit
      d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things
      easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.

      There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to
      solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking
      questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody
   minds
      repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside
      lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you
   well
      know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.

      There are so many benefits to this team approach.

      1.  You get things right the first time.  As you know, in any
   litigation
      is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth.
      Because you get things right the first time,  the company is not
   exposed
      to being discredited when the other side responds.

      2.  I would bet that Enron's outside legal bills are half what they
      would be otherwise.  With most companies the outside (and inside)
      lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people.  The
   business
      people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance.  (I
      should say that I could never understand that given the direct
   Perhaps
      it is the trader mentality at the company.  Perhaps it is an
   unwavering
      focus on the bottom line.  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels
   they
      are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the
   team
      can achieve things that no one person can do working alone.  Whatever
      the reason, the outside lawyer's job is made so much easier.  That
      results in much, much lower legal bills.

      3. You increase your chances of winning.  The brainstorming is so
      valuable.

      4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.
      Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask
   the
      dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to
   the
      next opportunity to work with the Enron team.

      5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are
   choices
      to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron
      assignment goes to the top more often than not.

      You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be
      proud of what they have built.


      Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.

      Regards,

      Bill
