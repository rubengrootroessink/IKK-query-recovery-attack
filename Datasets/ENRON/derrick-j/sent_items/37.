I am attaching a draft of the program timeline.  Please look it over and
give me any feedback you have.

If you have written your remarks, and could forward them to me I would
appreciate it.  If the time listed for each of you, is insufficient, or
longer than you would like, please let me know.

I think the most important thing regarding the program is to start as
close to 12:00 noon as possible, and to end as close to 1:15 p.m. as
possible, while giving everyone ample opportunity to enjoy their meal,
socialize, and to recognize both of you.

Have a great weekend.

Jeff
