Subject:	RE: Supervisory Board Meeting on 2001-11-20

I believe that the Resolutions No. 4, 6 and 9 are not correct in terms of the text:

1. resolution no. 4 is not correct since the S.Board did not review the new (attached) changes to the budget and did not approve it. There was also an amandement to the text of the Resolution re. the line items and the total amounts exeeding the approved budget.	

I believe that the draft Budget with the new amendemends must be reviewed once again as a whole at the next Sup.Board meeting before it can be enacted.

2. Resoltuions No. 6 and 9 - the vote descritpion is not correct

Regards - Jarek
