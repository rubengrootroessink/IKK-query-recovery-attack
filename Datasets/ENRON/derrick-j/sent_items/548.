Mr. Derrick,

I met with Robert Taylor this week at your residence and had a very productive meeting.  One question that came up was the use of security cameras.  Areas that we discussed using cameras were:

Gate at Larchmont
Driveway gate

Please let me know if that is something that you are interested in or would like to discuss.

thanks Alan
