~James,
 Hi, this is Steve Callaway over at Tom James Clothing Company.  I just
wanted to take a moment and let you know about some of the holiday
promotions we are running right now.  We have the Custom shirt promo, buy
six custom shirts and get one free.  We also have our custom wraps, these
are great deals on custom clothing just for the holidays.  These all make
great gift ideas for family friends and coworkers.
  We have also added a lot to our women's line and have some exciting new
things that would make great gifts for the special ladies in your life.
Don't forget now is the time to start thinking about your formal wardrobe
with the holidays just around the corner, how is your tux looking these
days??
 I would like to meet with you in the next few weeks and show you some of
the new things we are doing this season.  You can just e-mail me to set an
appointment or give me a call at (713) 622-5678 EXT 136.  I hope things are
well with you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Steve Callaway
