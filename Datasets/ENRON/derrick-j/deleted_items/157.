I am attaching herewith a short note on J Kurdukar alongwith his
photograph.
The note contains my personal analysis of Kurdukar. We may further do some
research on his judgements & Narmada report to understand him better.
Thanks & regards.........suhas

Wade-

Suhas called to let me know that former justice of the supreme court J
Kurdukar has been appointed as the presiding judge of the GOM commission of
inquiry.  We anticipate a formal notification by the GOM of the probe and
its terms of reference some time later today.  From what I understand he is
considered more objective than some of the other proposed candidates and,
to that extent, he may be less likely to mount a crusade against the
company and its officers and directors.  At the same time, he is renowned
for the glacial pace of the proceedings over which he presides.  Evidently,
he tends to allow every interested party opportunities to intervene and be
heard and the Narmada Dam resettlement which he evidently has also
overseen, has dragged on for most of the last ten years. We'll try to find
out a little more about what he's done recently and let you know what the
bio looks like.

Obviously another logistical question of interest is how long it will
actually take the commission to get up and running.  Suhas seemed to think
it would take a couple of weeks for Kurdukar to organize financing from the
GOM (good luck) and get a small staff together.  Needless to say, if there
are other actions which we contemplate taking prior to the commission being
convened, we probably should not wait.
