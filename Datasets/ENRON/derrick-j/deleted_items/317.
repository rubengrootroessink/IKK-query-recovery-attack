STATES GAIN FLEXIBILITY IN ADOPTING NUTRIENT CRITERIA FOR
WATER STANDARDS

States may be allowed some flexibility to meet a 2004
deadline for adopting nutrient criteria into water quality
standards if they can demonstrate a plan for meeting
specific milestones, EPA writes in final guidance on the
criteria. In addition, the guidance allows states to
prioritize the waters for which they need to develop
nutrient criteria and to use their own approach in the
process. Excessive nutrients lead to eutrophication, which
manifests itself as algal blooms. EPA says these blooms
result in low dissolved oxygen levels, fish kills, murky
water, and depletion of aquatic flora and fauna. . . . Page

CARBON MONOXIDE LIMITS RELAXED FOR LARGE MUNICIPAL WASTE
COMBUSTORS

EPA announces that it is extending from three hours to 15
hours the period, during two types of malfunctions, when
large municipal waste combustors are excused from compliance
with carbon monoxide emissions limits. The rule amends the
new source performance standards for large municipal waste
combustors issued in 1995, which required compliance with
emissions limits except during three-hour periods of
startup, shutdown, or malfunction. . . . Page A-1

HOUSE PANEL PROPOSES FUNDS TO ASSESS VULNERABILITY OF WATER
SUPPLY

A $20 billion anti-terrorism package proposed by the House
Appropriations Committee includes nearly $110 million, an
amount not requested by the White House, for immediate
drinking water vulnerability assessments by EPA.  The funds
would pay for both cyber and physical security assessments
that could begin as early as this year if the overall
spending bill is approved by Congress. . . . Page A-1

REPROCESSED URANIUM TO BE USED AS FUEL AT TVA POWER PLANT IN
ALABAMA

The Tennessee Valley Authority will enter an agreement with
the Energy Department to reprocess about 33 metric tons of
highly enriched uranium for use as fuel in an
electricity-generating power plant. Bruce L. Yeager, an
environmental policy specialist with TVA, says the
weapons-grade uranium will be converted to low-enriched
uranium for use at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in Athens,
Ala. . . . Page A-3

TWO SUPERFUND SITES IN PENNSYLVANIA DELETED FROM NATIONAL
PRIORITIES LIST

Two Pennsylvania superfund sites--the Aladdin Plating site
near Scranton and a portion of the Tobyhanna Army Depot Site
in Monroe County--are deleted from the National Priorities
List by EPA. . . . Page A-2

 GUIDANCE ON RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PESTICIDES EXPECTED IN
DECEMBER

Revised guidance explaining how the EPA is assessing
cumulative risks of the organophosphate pesticides will soon
be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and
Budget and is expected to be approved for release by early
December. This cumulative methodology guidance will coincide
with the expected Dec. 3 release of a preliminary cumulative
risk assessment of the organophosphates, says an advisor in
the Office of Pesticide Programs. . . . Page A-9

EPA CHARACTERIZES RECYCLING INDUSTRY AS MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO
ECONOMY

The U.S. recycling industry is a viable, well-established
business sector that is diverse and contributes
significantly to the economy, according to an EPA study.
EPA finds more than 56,000 recycling and reuse
establishments operating nationwide with annual gross
revenue of over $236 billion. . . . Page A-2

MINNESOTA TO RELAX PERMIT PROCESS FOR SOLID WASTE TRANSFER
FACILITIES

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency announces plans to
streamline the permitting process for solid waste transfer
facilities. The agency also plans to establish a new
classification system for demolition debris and industrial
solid waste land disposal facilities to better define where
certain waste should be taken. . . . Page A-7

COLORADO CLARIFIES REQUIREMENTS FOR INTEGRATED PUBLIC WATER
SYSTEMS

The Colorado Board of Health clarifies requirements for
integrated public water systems. An integrated system
involves two or more public water systems--one of which is
the supply system--which have physically connected
distribution systems and which agree to operate using a
common set of standards. . . . Page A-7

FRANCE ANNOUNCES IMMEDIATE BAN ON USE OF ARSENIC SALT IN
AGRICULTURE

The French Ministry of Agriculture announces an immediate
ban on the use of arsenic salts (sodium arsenates) in
agriculture. French winemakers use about 1.5 million liters
of arsenic salts annually to prevent the spread of fungus in
vineyards. The ministry points to a report on the
carcinogenic properties of arsenic salts. . . . Page A-6

WORLD BANK URGES CHINA TO INCREASE SPENDING ON ENVIRONMENT

China needs to increase its investment in environmental
protection by one-third, says a World Bank report. World
Bank Vice President Jemal-ud-din Kassum says when releasing
the report that environmental protection is "growing in
importance" within the bank's operations in China. . . .

EUROPEAN UNION
______________

CHEMICAL LABELING : The European Parliament endorses a more
stringent approach to regulating industrial chemicals that
would require chemical manufacturers to provide toxicity
data on their products before selling them, would mandate
labeling of products that contain hazardous substances, and
establish the public's right-to-know the results of toxicity
tests and whether those tests were conducted on animals.  .

CLIMATE CHANGE: A European Union emissions trading scheme
should be voluntary in its initial phase and should include
all six of the greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto
Protocol instead of just carbon dioxide, says the Union of
the Electricity Industry, a trade association representing
producers of electricity in the EU. . . . Page A-4

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y5b2r1_

CARBON SINKS: Despite arguing for years against the use of
"carbon sinks" to offset greenhouse gas emissions, the
European Commission announces a method to verify the amount
of greenhouse gases taken up by forests that will play a
"fundamental role" in implementing the Kyoto Protocol. . . .
