Dear Mr. Derrick:
I am Director of Marketing and Sales of Mobious Solutions, a company that specializes in the discovery and production of electronic evidence.
Kindly permit Mobious to perform a demonstration for you of a fully automated process by which to separate and produce responsive, non-responsive and privileged electronic documents (with special emphasis on e-mail)in the event of a "2nd Request" production of documents mandated by the federal government in Enron's merger with Dynegy.
Mobious' method is enormously expeditious and has saved corporate entities thousands, hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars.
Sincerely,
Bob Eisenberg
