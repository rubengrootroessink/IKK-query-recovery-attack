	Bob,

	I hope you and your family had a good Thanksgiving.

	Per our telephone conference of just a moment ago, at Jim's request, I have personally hand-delivered to your office (and to Steve Susman's office) a copy of Uriel Dutton's proposed waiver letter agreement.  Steve was out of the office, so I left a voice-mail for him.  I will be in around 7:45 a.m. tomorrow morning and look forward to speaking with you and Steve about the background and issues raised, so that we can make a decision, hopefully tomorrow, on going-forward strategy, in light of Mariner's urgent need for representation in a large corporate matter.

	Many thanks.

	Britt
