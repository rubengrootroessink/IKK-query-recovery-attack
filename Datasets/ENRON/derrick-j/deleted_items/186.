The B&B Working Group:

Thank you for your help in closing the NewPower collateral substitution
and for your advice along the way.  I know it was trying on all of us,
and I appreciate your professionalism, hard work, sacrifice and
patience.  You all did a great job and please thank the other B&B team
members who supported us!

Hopefully we will have a reprieve before any more crises.

Thanks again and have a great weekend!
Robert
