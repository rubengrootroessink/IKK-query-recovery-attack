Thanks for the input, Rob.  Julia has already gone through the Enron Europe and Enron Wind interview processes.  She speaks excellent English, as well as German.  In addition to myself and Chris Wood, she was interviewed by an Enron Wind German lawyer (who has left and she is replacing), an Enron Corp. German lawyer, and by a German lawyer from Punder.  The feedback is unanimously positive.  I think I have run all of the interview traps in Europe, and am confident that she will be a real asset to our department and to the Enron Wind Europe team.
