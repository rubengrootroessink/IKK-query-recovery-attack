Andy has hired David Gerger, a lawyer well-known to me (and a former VE
associate) to be his lawyer advising him on criminal matters.  David called
today to say that Andy was cooperating with Enron.  We talked briefly about
who Andy should hire in the Houston civil cases.  Andy's first choice is
Kirkland & Ellis.  I told David the name of several litigators there that I
like and respect.  PS to Jim, Ted Mirvis called back to say that he would be
happy to take a reporter's call about what an informal inquiry is.
