Jim:

I can imagine the firestorm and I trust you would let me know if we could
somehow be of assistance. I can't think of a better group to weather the
circumstances than you and your extremely talented team.

I will keep this brief. Carrin requested an asset allocation model based on
your combined assets.  Pls let me know if you are comfortable with our
including the detail of your assets in a presentation to Carrin.

We hoped to respond to Carrin today but I will not do so until I hear from
you.

Regards.
