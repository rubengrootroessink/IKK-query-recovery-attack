The Dabhol mtg. today at 4:30 has been cancelled.  Kean called and said Lay is having a meeting w/Kean and others at 5:00 re: investors.  My question is:  The Dabhol mtg. is rescheduled to 12:00 tomorrow.  You have Amy Dunn Taylor luncheon at Brennan's tomorrow.  Rob will have to cancel the Amy Dunn Taylor thing and do the Dabhol.  Are you going to do the Dabhol and should I cancel you out of the Amy Dunn Taylor thing also.
