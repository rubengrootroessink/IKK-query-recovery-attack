John,
Here?s the CV of the lawyer that we referred to previously (it is
unfortunately in Spanish). Her field of specialization is Administrative
law. She currently works for the Municipality of La Plata, though she
may get a leave to do this job for us. I am concerned about this point.
If this is an obstacle that we could not overcome (I
 know you have asked the opinion of Jim Derrick about her), we may have
to look for another alternative as soon as possible.
