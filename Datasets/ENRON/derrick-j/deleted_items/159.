Dear Texas Ex,

Remember looking for career direction as a student?  Or searching
for that job after graduation?  Wouldn't it have been great to talk
to someone who actually worked in a field you were interested in, a
friendly face who had "been there, done that" and could offer you a
tip or two?

We're inviting you to become one of those helpful people by joining
the Texas Exes Career Network. By signing up on-line as a volunteer,
you may be contacted by fellow Texas Exes or current UT students
(though no more than 3 per month) and asked for informational
interviews to discuss your career and how you got to where you are.
(You are NOT expected to find jobs, only to discuss your field.)

To find out more about how you can show your UT pride by lending a
Longhorn hand, visit us at:

http://www.TexasExes.org/CareerNetwork

If you have any questions,
please contact us at career@alumni.utexas.edu or by calling
512-232-9178.

Hook 'em Horns,

Jennifer Duncan
Career Services Director
TEXAS EXES - Serving the University Since 1885
