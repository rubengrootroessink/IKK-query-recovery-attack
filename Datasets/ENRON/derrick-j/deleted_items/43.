Dear General Counsels:

As part of my work with the Enron Compliance Report, I am working with the Enron Assurance Services Network formed by Rick Causey to ensure audit activities are aligned with management objectives.

There are several EAS leaders reporting to Tod Lindholm and Shawn Kilchrist.  Tod and Shawn report to Rick Causey  with a dotted line to the Audit Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  The EAS leaders are dedicated to improving controls and are responsible to each business unit for its internal controls.

The EAS leaders are:
	Michelle Atwood - ENA, GM, IM, RAC
	Paul Bromley - Enron Europe
	Misty Barrett - EES
	Vicki Gregorcyk - EBS
	Terri Wheeler - Enron Corp.
	Sutton - ETS 
	John Berggren - International

 I am working with each of the EAS leaders in connection with our Reporting of Incidents under the Enron Compliance Report for calendar year 2001.  They will help us ensure that we are capturing and reporting all incidents.  Of course, the attorney client privilege and confidentiality will be maintained.

The EAS leader for your respective business unit will be in touch with you regarding the internal control environment and improvements thereto.  

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sharon
