Jim,

Bear Paw Energy, an entity acquired by Northern Border Partners, LP in March has been sued in District Court in Denver by a former employee over alleged promises concerning ownership in Bear Paw. Through Britt Davis and Bonnie White, we received several recommendations for counsel. We spoke with Larry Treece, the partner at Sherman & Howard who previously handled an arbitration involving Western Gas Resources and EPP. If there are no conflicts, we will likely engage the firm of  Sherman & Howard. Please let me know if you have any concerns with this engagement. Thank you .

Janet
