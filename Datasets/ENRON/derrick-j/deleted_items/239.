CONGRESS APPROVES SUPERFUND BILL TO PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT OF
BROWNFIELDS

The Senate approves a superfund reform bill that would
provide liability relief to small businesses and innocent
landowners, after a Wyoming senator withdraws his opposition
to the bill (H.R. 2869). The House had passed the measure
earlier in the day, which means the first major piece of
environmental legislation to clear Congress in 2001, a
measure designed to promote redevelopment of polluted
properties known as brownfields, is now ready for President
Bush's signature. The legislation also seeks to promote
redevelopment of brownfields sites by authorizing $250
million annually to fund assessment and cleanup activities.

REPORT FROM WHITE HOUSE EXPECTED ON FUEL ECONOMY CREDIT
TRADING

A Bush administration task force is looking to expand on a
recent National Academy of Sciences proposal to establish a
system of tradeable credits under the Corporate Average Fuel
Economy program, John Graham, chief regulatory official at
the White House, tells BNA. "Such a program would be less
costly than the current program and create a continuous
incentive for automakers to improve fuel economy," says
Graham. Under such a scenario, automakers could get credits
for achieving greater fuel economy standards than required
under the CAFE program and sell those credits to other
companies struggling to meet the standards. . . . Page A-1

WHITMAN SIGNS RULE TO MAKE HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUPS EASIER,
CHEAPER

EPA Administrator Whitman signs a final rule that will allow
companies to consolidate hazardous waste at remediation
sites without triggering the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act's strict waste management regulations. The
final Corrective Action Management Unit rule is expected to
make contaminated site cleanups easier and cheaper for
companies by allowing consolidation of waste for temporary
or permanent disposal. . . . Page A-6

EPA PETITIONED TO HALT USE OF TWO PESTICIDES USED TO TREAT
WOOD

Several environmental and public health groups petition EPA
to halt immediately the use of two pesticides used to treat
wood and are threatening to sue the agency if it fails to
suspend their use. The federal government has failed to act
to protect children from exposure to the wood preservatives
chromated copper arsenate and pentachlorophenol, according
to a statement from Beyond Pesticides/National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides, a Washington-based
organization, and the lead petitioner. . . . Page A-1

SENATE'S ANTI-TERRORISM BILL AUTHORIZES FUNDS FOR DRINKING
WATER SECURITY

The Senate passes an anti-terrorism bill that would
authorize a $50 million EPA program for drinking water and
wastewater security grants over six years. A similar bill
passed by the House authorizes $60 million for those
activities over the next five years. . . . Page A-2

COURT SAYS MASSACHUSETTS SUPERFUND LAW DOES NOT PRECLUDE
JURY TRIAL

A Massachusetts trial court finds the state's hazardous
waste law, which is modeled on the federal superfund
statute, does not preclude jury trials. In doing so, the
court declines to follow federal case law barring jury
trials in superfund cost recovery suits. . . . Page A-3

REGIONAL WATER BOARD DELAYS TOUGHER STANDARDS FOR ORANGE
COUNTY, CALIF.

The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board decides
to postpone for one month action on a municipal stormwater
permit that proposes tougher standards for cities in Orange
County, Calif. Officials from many of the 24 cities in the
county asked for the delay to enable them to review
revisions in the five-year national pollutant discharge and
elimination system permit. . . . Page A-4

EPA FINDS 'DEFICIENCY' IN AIR PERMITTING PROGRAM OF
WASHINGTON, D.C.

The air permitting program in the District of Columbia does
not provide adequate public notice of permitting decisions
and does not comply with federal regulations under Title V
of the Clean Air Act, according to EPA. A "notice of
deficiency," published by EPA in the "Federal Register", is
a prerequisite for withdrawal of EPA approval for the
District's operating permit programs, but the director of
the air protection division in EPA Region III says D.C. is
not in danger of losing control of its air operating permit
program. . . . Page A-2

NUCLEAR POWER: Germany's Bundestag votes to end the use of
nuclear power, thus finalizing the shutdown of the country's
19 nuclear plants over the next two decades. "This is a
happy day," the environment minister says during the
parliamentary debate. The revised Atomic Energy Act
implements a shutdown agreement reached by the federal
government with major utilities in June 2000. . . . Page A-5

Belgium's Finance Minister says prospects for gaining

setback for the EU and its efforts to implement and meet the
Kyoto Protocol targets on greenhouse gas reductions," says
an EU official. . . . Page A-6
