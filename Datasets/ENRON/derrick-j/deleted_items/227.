Thanks, Jim.  I hope your schedule clears up and you can be there, but I
understand if you can't.

On the Tech Law front, so far we have acceptances for the November 2
meeting from Tom Klitgaard, Joe Sims, Larry Lyles (meeting only), Joe
Hubach (reception/dinner only), (you, me and David Ellwanger).

Tom Green is unable to attend, as is Anne McNamara (who wrote:  "David,
with a group this small, perhaps you could check dates before setting
the meeting.  Just a thought.").

I've not yet heard from Coggins, Hu, Kryder or Whitaker.

I'll update this RSVP report next week.

David

       This is your reminder of our special meeting next Friday to
continue
   our long-range planning and restructuring of the IOGEC as we expand
our
   scope and membership to include new fields of energy law.  A number
of
   the issues left on the table at our mid-year meeting in August should
be
   resolved now as we get ready for the annual Institute in February and
   begin a concurrent membership drive.  Lunch will be served.  As we
have
   much to discuss, the meeting may run to 4:00 or so.

       If you have not yet advised David Winn whether you will attend,
   please do so now ( dwinn@swlegal.org <mailto:dwinn@swlegal.org> ;
   972-664-3488).

           An agenda will be sent to you next week in advance of the
   meeting. Thanks again for your wisdom and your leadership.
