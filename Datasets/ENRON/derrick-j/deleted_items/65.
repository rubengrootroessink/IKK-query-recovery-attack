RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
<mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of your
availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002

After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
notify you of the new date.

Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.
