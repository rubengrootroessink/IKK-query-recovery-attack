I talked to Rosalee and she said if this guy is to come to Houston to meet with Mr. Lay, or this is for Mr. Lay tomorrow as well as you, that we could "dead head" the plane and just go pick him up.  I called aviation and there is a plane going out to San Diego today and coming back to Houston from San Diego tomorrow at 2:30.
