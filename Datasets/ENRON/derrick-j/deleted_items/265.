Jim:  Im finalizing the SPA that will be going out to our shortlist of
final-round bidders in connection with the auction of our interest in
SK-Enron.  Currently, the definition of "Knowledge" as it relates to our
knowledge-qualified reps only includes the actual knowkedge of Jim Hughes
and Darrell Kinder.  For optical reasons, our bankers and corp. development
have suggested we broaden that group to include at least the actual
knowledge of the Enron-appointed directors of SK-Enron, which, of course,
would include you.  Although I realize you have not been intimately
involved with the goings-on at SK-Enron, Im checking if it would be ok with
you to be added to the list for the desired optics. Im happy to provide you
with the draft agreement (and the schedules once they are prepared) should
you desire.  Pls let me know.  Thanks.
