Jim:  Thanks for forwarding this to me---this helps me with our ongoing (seemingly daily!) disclosure issues.  Considering the confidential nature of these litigation memos, and the fact that Andy probably doesn't know who the heck I am(and probably doesn't care!), would you ask him to include me on his distribution list?  I think he will be more comfortable getting the request from you.  Thanks, Rex.

Jim -

I have attached a June 8, 2001 memorandum detailing the status of EWS litigation.  Per your request, this memorandum will be provided to you on a weekly basis.  Changes from the previous week will be in bold.

Thanks.

Andy
