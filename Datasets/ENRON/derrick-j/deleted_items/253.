To members of the Board: the request for additional  funding to complete the post-flood renovation of Jones Hall did not make it onto  today's City Council agenda. Instead, it will be considered next Wednesday  morning. I plan to attend the meeting as a very inobtrusive observer, and will  let you know what happens.
 
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving with your families.  I'll be in touch next week!

Subject: Jones Hall renovation  update
To my board members:
 
A great deal has transpired over the past several  weeks, as Ann and Toby can attest, and I thought that a brief update to you  was in order. 
 
HOK, CHP and Gilbane have been working hard on  the areas of the Hall yet to be renovated/restored, to wit:
 
1. Music library (to be relocated above ground  into the jump area, encompassing the old usher's room, etc.)
2. Dressing rooms
3. Storage for instruments and other  items
4. Symphony offices
5. SPA offices
6. Rehearsal hall
 
I wrote to you two weeks ago asking your thoughts  about using Jones Hall funds to assist with the renovation of the rehearsal  hall, primarily to protect Mario et al from going back to City Council for  more money. However, the accumulated projects listed above have turned out to  be so costly that there was no way to eke out the dollars here and there. As a  result, Mario and Jordy Tollett are now leading a new request to fund the  projects listed above. This request COULD (but will not necessarily) be  presented to Council next Tuesday, November 23 by Jordy. 
 
The total cost of these projects is $2.9 million,  of which approximately $1 million is attributable to the relocation of the  music library and the "dominoes" that follow that relocation - i.e., the  relocation of the storage rooms and the dressing rooms.
 
I will let you know what happens at City Council.  Mario has been good about keeping me informed but has not asked for any help  from the Foundation.
 
In other areas, Chip has settled back into the  Hall and we are acquiring office furniture for his humble space. I will be  contacting each of you to schedule a meeting in early December, and at that  time will issue a 2002 quarterly board meeting calendar that we will try to  cast in stone for next year.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions. I  am relieved that it appears that the Foundation will not need to part with  more money to help with this renovation at the present time, although we might  still be called upon to do so. I will keep you informed.
 
Have a wonderful weekend and, if I don't speak  with you next week, a lovely Thanksgiving.
 
Best,
 
Kim Sterling
