Dear Mr. Emilio Battioli,

I am an LL.M. candidate (August 2001) at the University of Michigan Law
School. I am very happy to have found the attorney in Enron Corporation who
has studied at the University of Warwick, the institution from which I have
graduated, too.

I have always been eager to practise law in a corporation and at the moment
I am looking for a job in the South of the US. Therefore, I have decided to
write to you contemplating that Enron Corporation may be interested in
utilizing my credentials.

As a native of Lithuania with a law and business degree from the University
of Warwick, I have had extensive international business and personal
experience in UK, Eastern Europe and Russia. I did an internship in Oil
Trading International and Legal Departments of BP Amoco PLC, London. I also
gained some corporate work experience when doing an internship in Harden &
Wells in Beijing. To gain further insight into corporate and securities
matters, I have focused on business related classes at the University of
Michigan Law School.

I would really appreciate if you had a look at my resume, which is attached
to this e-mail. Thank you ever so much.

Sincerely,
Lina Nagyte
