WHITMAN SAYS ENVIRONMENT STILL PROTECTED DESPITE
ANTI-TERRORISM FOCUS

Despite taking on new responsibilities in response to the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, EPA will continue to ensure the
quality of the nation's air, water, and land is protected,
Administrator Whitman says in an interview with BNA. "We've
obviously had to reallocate, shift some resources and people
around in order to meet the responsibilities post-September
11th," Whitman says. But the various offices of EPA are
"continuing to do what they need to do. We're continuing to
work on the issues that are priorities." Whitman says the
agency is not diverting resources from high-priority
matters, like superfund cleanups, "but we've asked everyone
to go back and reprioritize and see if there are other
cleanups that are not very environmentally sensitive." . . .

U.S. COURT AFFIRMS CLASSIFICATION OF DIOXIN AS 'KNOWN' HUMAN
CARCINOGEN

The Department of Health and Human Services acted reasonably
in upgrading dioxin from a "reasonably anticipated" to a
"known" human carcinogen in the National Toxicology Program
list, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The court's decision is
expected to have major implications for EPA's ongoing
reassessment of the risks of dioxin. The agency hopes to
complete its final reassessment of dioxin early next year. .

EMPLOYEES OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAB ACQUITTED OF CHARGES OF
FALSIFYING DATA

Eight former employees of Intertek Testing Services
Environmental Labs Inc., an environmental testing firm, are
found not guilty by a federal court jury in Dallas, Texas,
of charges that they falsified test data in order to meet
quality standards required by EPA. The lab analyzed samples
of air, liquids, soils, pesticides, explosives, and
nerve/chemical agents for consulting firms, engineering
companies, and federal, state, and local governments,
according to the Department of Justice. . . . Page A-2

EPA ENDS REVIEW OF FUMIGANT TELONE, SAYS BENEFITS OUTWEIGH
RISKS

EPA says it has ended a special review of cancer risks posed
by the fumigant telone, finding the pesticide's benefits
outweigh its risks. The fumigant is an alternative to methyl
bromide, which is being phased out under the 1987 Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. . . .

COMMENT PERIOD EXTENDED ON WHOLE EFFLUENT TOXICITY TEST
METHODS

The comment period on a proposed rule updating methods for
measuring whole effluent toxicity in effluents and the
waters into which they are discharged is extended by EPA
until Jan. 11, 2002. The proposed rule would modify whole
effluent toxicity test procedures, which seek to
characterize effluent as a whole in terms of its toxic
effects on certain test species. . . . Page A-3

BESTFOODS FOUND NOT LIABLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS AT MICHIGAN
SUPERFUND SITE

A federal court finds Bestfoods Inc. is not liable for
superfund cleanup costs at the site of a chemical
manufacturing plant in Muskegon County, Mich. The U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Michigan decides
the Englewood, N.J.-based food-processing company is not
responsible for cleanup costs because Michigan and EPA
failed to prove the company, and not its subsidiary, Ott
Chemical Co., actually operated the plant. . . . Page A-8

WORK BLOCKED IN EFFORT TO TREAT SEWAGE GENERATED BY TIJUANA,
MEXICO

Millions of gallons of Tijuana wastewater continue to flow
daily from Mexico into the United States as bureaucratic
infighting, legal challenges, and international
complications stall efforts to achieve secondary treatment
levels. Litigation and infighting block what began as a U.S.
effort to help Mexico's state of Baja California clean the
wastewater its Tijuana River brings north and into U.S.
coastal waters. . . . Page A-6

AIR POLLUTION

CALIFORNIA: The Bay Area Air Quality Management District
approves a measure to reduce the allowable level of volatile
organic compound emissions from architectural paints and
coatings. The amendments are in line with architectural
coating standards recommended by the California Air
Resources Board. . . . Page A-4

OREGON: The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality
schedules hearings in December on major proposed fee
increases for air quality permits. The fee hikes will be
substantial for larger businesses and less for small
companies.  . . . Page A-7

EUROPEAN UNION: A proposal for the mandatory introduction of
sulfur-free gasoline in the European Union by Jan. 1, 2008,
is scheduled to come up for a vote later this week. . . .

NORWAY: Strengthened regulations, increased environmental
taxes, and shifts in fuel and energy sources are credited by
the government with helping Norway cut sulfur emissions in
half between 1990 and 1999, with a further one-year
reduction of nearly 10 percent between 1999 and 2000. . . .
