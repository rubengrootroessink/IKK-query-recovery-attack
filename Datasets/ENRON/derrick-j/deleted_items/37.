Rob and Bruce,

Prof. Thomas W?lde is (as you will note below) a distinguished professor of economic and energy law at some special energy center at the University of Dundee, Scotland.

Any interest in this, which showed up this morning out of the blue?

Stephen.

Dear Stephen, 
I naturally follow with interest the Enron discussions in India. We do have  
reasonably good relations in the energy policy field in India, and I in  
particular with the Indian energy regulator. 
We do offer a deal mediation/conciliation service. My sentiment is that your  
negotiations in India have reached locked position, out of which it is  
normally almost impossible to extricate. 
You might consider or put me in touch with the senior Enron staff to see if  
they would be interested in a conciliation/deal mediation project. 
regards, tw
