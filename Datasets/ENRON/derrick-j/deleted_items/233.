Jim:

I wanted to take a moment and wish you and Carrin the best for the holiday
season.  Goodness knows we have all had an extraordinary '01-- I am guessing
this has been a year unlike any other for you and your family.  Here's to a
very healthy and happy '02.

Let's get together in the new year when you have a moment to focus on your
personal matters. Until then, should you need anything please let me know.

Regards.
