Dear James Derrick,

We hope you are now in receipt of preliminary results from Ipsos-Reid's Public Perceptions on Continental Energy as reported in the prestigious National Journal sent on Friday.  As well, we have included a hyperlink to our  November 17th 2001 presentation to the Senate Leadership entitled Public Opinion on Energy Issues and National Energy Policy and the press release resulting from that day's press conference.  Your organization might really benefit from seeing the whole survey, which will be completed shortly after Thanksgiving. This survey is the largest poll ever conducted on public opinion about energy issues in North America. To discuss this further, please contact me, Thomas Riehle, President of Ipsos-Reid U.S. Public Affairs at (202) 463-7300.

I look forward to reviewing this opportunity with you and your organization.

Thom Riehle
