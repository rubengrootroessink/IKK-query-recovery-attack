The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

Jarek

I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.
