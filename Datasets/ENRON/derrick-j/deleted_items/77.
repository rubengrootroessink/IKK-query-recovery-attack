APPEALS COURT ASKED TO STAY RULING VACATING HAZARDOUS AIR
POLLUTANT RULES

EPA joins with the Sierra Club and industry petitioners in
asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit to stay a decision vacating hazardous air
pollutant standards for hazardous waste combustors. The
joint motion seeks to allow EPA to implement interim
standards while it formulates a new rule setting forth
permanent standards, according to an attorney representing
industry plaintiffs. . . . Page A-1

W.R. GRACE TO PAY $2.75 MILLION TO SETTLE SUIT OVER ACCESS
TO MINE

W.R. Grace & Co. will spend $2.75 million on additional
health care benefits for residents in Libby, Mont., to
settle a dispute with federal agencies over access to the
company's vermiculite mining operations. EPA says the
agreement also calls for Grace to pay $71,000 in fines for
denying the agency full access to property that housed the
former mine. EPA gained full access rights to the property
in March when the U.S. District Court for the District of
Montana ordered the company to allow access to the
properties for investigation and cleanup work by the
government. . . . Page A-1

SHIPPERS WANT FEDERAL INVOLVEMENT IN ANY FUTURE RAILROAD
MORATORIUM

Railroad customers who ship hazardous materials are calling
for federal coordination if terrorist activities prompt
another moratorium on the transportation of certain
dangerous chemical shipments by rail. After the Association
of American Railroads restricted the movement of sensitive
types of cargo earlier in October, critics charge the abrupt
moratorium left shippers in the lurch and placed the
responsibility on shippers to determine the exact
restrictions on certain poison-by-inhalation chemicals,
which varied from railroad to railroad. Should a similar
moratorium be needed in the future, the National Industrial
Transportation League recommends it be handled and
coordinated by the federal government. . . . Page A-4

CHANGES URGED FOR GUIDANCE TO IMPROVE ECOLOGICAL RISK
ASSESSMENTS

Draft recommendations to help risk analysts improve
ecological risk assessments should be revised to make them
more useful, says a federal advisory board in a draft
report. EPA's Risk Assessment Forum develops the guidance,
"Planning for Ecological Risk Assessment: Developing
Management Objectives," to complement the "Guidelines for
Ecological Risk Assessment" issued by the agency in 1998.
Such guidance documents are used by companies, state
agencies, and other organizations when conducting risk
assessments. . . . Page A-3

ONTARIO ISSUES NEW RULES TO LIMIT AIR POLLUTION FROM POWER
PLANTS

New emission limits for electric utilities that burn fossil
fuels are an aggressive step in the Ontario government's
efforts to fight air pollution, says its provincial
Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer. The phased-in limits
for Ontario's electricity generating sector will take effect
Jan. 1, and, when fully implemented in 2007, will help
Canada to meet its commitments under the Ozone Annex to the
Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement, says Witmer. She says
Ontario's new regulations include an emissions trading
system for the electricity generating sector that will
create an incentive for Ontario businesses and
municipalities to further reduce pollution. . . . Page A-5

EPA FINDS USE OF BIOREMEDIATION INCREASING AT SUPERFUND
SITES

The use of bioremediation projects to clean up superfund
sites is increasing because the technologies are less
expensive than conventional remedies. In "Use of
Bioremediation at Superfund Sites", EPA says, of the 1,106
superfund sites at which the agency has made a decision on
the cleanup remedy, bioremediation activities are taking
place at 78, or 7 percent of the sites. . . . Page A-2

SCIENTISTS SUGGEST EPA USE MORE COMPLEX ASSESSMENT FOR
TREATED WOOD

A scientific advisory panel recommends EPA conduct a more
complex probabilistic risk assessment for its review of wood
treated with the pesticide chromated copper arsenate, rather
than the simplified approach it chose. A panel member says
EPA could adopt a modeling approach like the one it
developed for assessing risks posed by pesticides found in
food under the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. The
recommendation by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel comes as the panel
reviews components of the agency's preliminary assessment of
hazard and exposures for children from playground equipment
treated with chromated copper arsenate. . . . Page A-8

LAKESHORE PROPERTY OWNERS FILE SUIT OVER RUNOFF FROM CHICKEN
FARMS

A group of lakeshore property owners file a lawsuit against
Tyson Foods Inc. in Oklahoma state court alleging poultry
waste from the company's operations pollute the lake to
which they have access. The plaintiffs are owners of
shorefront property at Grand Lake O' the Cherokees in
northeastern Oklahoma near the Missouri border. According to
their suit, the lake is polluted by poultry waste from a
Tyson Foods chicken-processing plant in Noel, Mo., and by
runoff from Tyson Foods chicken farms located in the
watershed of Grand Lake. . . . Page A-9

WORLD BANK REPORT TOUTS IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT

A healthy environment is critical to reducing worldwide
poverty, which will help to ensure development activities
are sustainable and do not deplete natural resources, says
the World Bank in its annual environmental review. The
report estimates some developing countries lose 4 percent to
6 percent of their gross domestic product because of losses
in productivity and natural capital resulting from
environmental degradation. . . . Page A-6

CALIFORNIA: The Air Resources Board approves tougher exhaust
standards for heavy-duty diesel engines that are nearly
identical to those issued early this year by EPA. The new
rules will reduce emissions of both particulate matter and
ozone-forming nitrogen oxides by 90 percent by 2010, and
emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons by 72 percent by the
same date, according to the board.  . . . Page A-5

pesticide sales will be required beginning Nov. 1 under
emergency rules adopted by the North Carolina Pesticide
Board. According to the pesticide administrator for the
state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the
board adopts the emergency rule over concerns about the use
of biological or chemical agents as weapons. . . . Page A-9
