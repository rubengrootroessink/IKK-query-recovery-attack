Paul -

All of the news today should be considered victories for the Dabhol Legal Team:  

 -- DPC's amendment to writ petition to address the biasness of MERC's commissioners was allowed.  

 -- Commissioner Deo recused himself from any further MERC hearings.  

 -- The final merits hearing on MERC jurisdiction was set for Dec. 11-14.  

Please pass along my appreciation to everyone at DPC involved in the effort.

Bruce
