We will miss you guys on Thanksgiving but hope you all have a safe and happy
holiday. Carrin please give our best to your parents.  Little Jim Tanner,
Corby and I are heading to the deer lease Friday after the A & M "tu" game.
We will be coming through SA late Friday afternoon or early evening. Why
don't you join us for a little male bonding. I'll swing by and pick you up
and bring you home Sunday. If you can pull yourself away from the books we
would love to have you. I won't be back in the office this afternoon so if
you think you might be able to make it give me a call at the house or email
me at Jan' email address. It would be great to spend a little time with you.
Let me know.
Love to all, even you Karen,
                                         Bob-O
