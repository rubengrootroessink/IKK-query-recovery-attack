Attached is our agenda, together with a matrix which summarizes
issue-by-issue the proposals circulated to date on the many, important
issues we will address concerning the upcoming Institute, the upcoming
new member recruitment drive and the reorganization of the IOGEC.  This
matrix is "Tab 1" on the agenda.

These documents, as well as the others identified on the agenda, will be
provided to you again at the meeting, but since we have so much to cover
I wanted to give you an opportunity to "read up" in advance.

I look forward to seeing you in Houston on Friday.
