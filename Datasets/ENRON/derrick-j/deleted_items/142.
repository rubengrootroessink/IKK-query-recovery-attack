JVD, I had sent notice to everyone including Tracy and Mark Evans that we were not having the call.  This is another fine example of people not paying attention.  Frustrating.

Please accept Mark Evans' apologies, he will be on vacation tomorrow and therefore unable to join the scheduled weekly conference call.

Mark requested that I ask you if you would like one of the senior lawyers from our department, eg., Justin Boyd, Paul Simons or Marcus Von Bock to join the call in his absence?

Many thanks
Tracy
