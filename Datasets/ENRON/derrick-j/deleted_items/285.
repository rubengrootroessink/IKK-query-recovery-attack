HOG FARMS TO INSTALL NEW TECHNOLOGY, PAY FINE FOR CLEAN
WATER VIOLATIONS

Premium Standard Farms and Continental Grain Co. reach an
agreement with EPA and a citizens group requiring the hog
producers to install as much as $50 million in new
technologies to address violations of the Clean Water Act
from their concentrated animal feeding operations. The
consent decree, which also requires the companies to pay a
$350,000 civil penalty, stems from a 1997 lawsuit brought by
the Citizens Legal Environmental Action Network against the
two companies, which together comprise the second largest
hog producer in the United States. . . . Page A-1

BALLAST WATER MANAGEMENT REPORT REQUIRED OF SHIPS ENTERING
U.S. WATERS

Ships entering U.S. waters will have to submit a ballast
water management report under a final U.S. Coast Guard rule
designed to control the introduction of invasive species.
The rule also provides voluntary ballast water management
guidelines for operators of vessels entering U.S. waters
from beyond the United States exclusive economic zone and
promotes ballast water management for all vessels operated
in U.S. waters. . . . Page A-1

UNIFORM LAW SOUGHT FOR STATES TO ENFORCE RESTRICTIONS ON
BROWNFIELDS

A proposal for a uniform law for all states to follow that
would allow land-use restrictions on contaminated property
to be enforced when ownership is transferred is being
drafted by an organization of attorneys appointed by state
governments. The goal for most polluted industrial sites,
such as brownfields, is to redevelop and to reuse the land,
according to Bill Breetz, an attorney with the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.
Currently, Breetz says, no state has a law making
environmental covenants on land enforceable when the
property changes hands. . . . Page A-2

COUNTER-TERRORISM BECOMES FOCUS OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
MEETING

In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, EPA
decides to place special emphasis on the subject of
counter-terrorism measures during a December meeting on
chemical emergency preparedness and prevention. EPA was
planning next month's conference before the terrorist
attacks in Washington and New York, but changes the agenda
for emergency responders, state and local emergency
planners, industry representatives, and regulators to focus
heavily on "the best ways to combat terrorism." . . . Page

FEDERAL COURT RULES SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA MUST BOOST MASS
TRANSIT USE

The agency responsible for transportation planning in the
San Francisco Bay Area must boost the use of public transit
to a level it set in a 1982 clean air plan. The U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California
issues the decision in a case involving a ridership goal the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission set in the Bay Area
portion of California's state implementation plan. The
opinion is a victory for environmental groups that have
spent years trying to persuade the commission to devote more
resources to programs designed to improve transit ridership.

HABITAT DESIGNATION SOUGHT FOR ENDANGERED PLANT SPECIES IN
CALIFORNIA

Two environmental groups file suit to compel the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service to designate critical habitat
protection for eight plants classified as either endangered
or threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. The
California Native Plant Society and the Center for
Biological Diversity file the complaint in U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of California seeking
special designation for specified southern California
habitats. . . . Page A-4

TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS CONSIDERED FOR STREAMLINED
ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS

Federal highway and transit officials consider establishing
a short list of transportation projects that would be
monitored to ensure they do not get hung up in lengthy
environmental permitting and review processes. The Federal
Highway Administrator and the Federal Transit Administrator
are considering establishing a list of projects that would
receive special oversight to ensure all efforts are made to
streamline environmental reviews and permitting decisions,
an FHWA official tells a federal interagency group. . . .

NORDIC NATIONS PREPARE TO LAUNCH KYOTO RATIFICATION EFFORTS
BY YEAR END

The five Nordic governments, generally satisfied with
negotiations that completed an international climate change
agreement, will begin asking their national parliaments to
ratify the accord before the end of this year, government
officials from the five nations tell BNA. They say
ratification by all the Nordic countries should occur before
the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg
in September 2002. . . . Page A-6

STATE NEWS

TEXAS: The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
approves a new program that will allow information collected
by citizens about possible environmental violations to be
used as evidence in enforcement cases. The program, which
takes effect Jan. 1, allows citizen-collected information to
be used as evidence if certain requirements are met. . . .

AIR POLLUTION:  New York state's highest court declines to
hear an appeal of a lower court decision that required the
state power authority to conduct an environmental impact
statement for 11 small natural gas-powered electric
generating units. The case stems from the installation of
the units by the state's power authority earlier this year
to meet the summer electricity needs of New York City. . . .
