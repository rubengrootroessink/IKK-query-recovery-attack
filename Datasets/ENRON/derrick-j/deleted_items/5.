EPA ISSUES RULE TO PROTECT DRINKING WATER FROM MICROBIAL
CONTAMINATION

EPA Administrator Whitman signs a final rule requiring
drinking water systems to install controls preventing the
backwash of recycled water from filter rinsing. The rule is
designed to prevent microbial contamination of drinking
water. Issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments
of 1996, the Filter Backwash Recycling Rule will apply to
more than 4,600 large and small water systems that serve
about 35 million Americans, according to EPA.  "Today, I am
taking steps to better protect America's drinking water from
microbial contaminants, such as Cryptosporidium," Whitman
says. . . . Page AA-1

BUSH PLEDGES TO UPHOLD MORATORIUM ON OIL DRILLING OFF
CALIFORNIA COAST

President Bush says he will continue a moratorium on new
leases for oil and gas drilling off the California coast.
"Mr. Governor, I will honor my commitment to you to uphold
the moratorium on new drilling leases off the coast of
California," Bush says in Los Angeles. Former President Bush
imposed a moratorium on drilling in offshore areas of
California in 1990, and President Clinton extended the
moratorium until June 2012. . . . Page A-2

WHITMAN REVIEWING PROPOSAL TO CUT PAPERWORK BURDEN OF WASTE
RULES

EPA Administrator Whitman is said to be reviewing a proposed
rule to reduce the paperwork burden imposed by hazardous
waste regulations. Examples of the changes in the proposal
are the reduction of hazardous waste tank inspections and
the elimination of certain notices under the Land Disposal
Restriction rules. A final rule is not expected until late
next year. . . . Page A-1

FATHER, SON SENTENCED TO PRISON IN CFC DISTRIBUTION CASE IN
FLORIDA

A federal judge in West Palm Beach, Fla., sentences to
prison a father and son who pleaded guilty to conspiracy
charges to distribute dichlorodifluoromethane gas (CFC-12)
and to evade some $7 million in federal excise tax on the
ozone-depleting refrigerant. Aurelio Vigna is sentenced to
24 months in prison and his son, Joseph Vigna, to 18 months
in prison. The judge also orders them to pay a combined
$750,000 to the IRS and to resolve all civil tax liability.

PAINT COMPANIES TO PAY $800,000 FOR CLEANUP OF BALTIMORE
SUPERFUND SITE

Four paint companies agree in a proposed settlement to pay
$800,000 to EPA for the costs of cleaning up a former
industrial superfund site in Baltimore. Under the proposed
settlement in federal court, Jotun A/S and Jotun Marine
Coatings Inc. will pay EPA nearly $200,000, and Ameron
International Corp. and the Valspar Corp. will pay a total
of $600,000 to reimburse the agency for removal activities
performed on the Ainsworth Paint & Chemical Co. superfund
site in Baltimore. . . . Page A-3

U.S. INDUSTRY DERAILS APPROVAL OF INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL FOR
CHEMICAL RISK

The International Labor Organization's Working Group on the
Harmonization of Chemical Hazard Communication fails to
agree on a proposed international sign for identifying
chemical hazards after objections are raised by the U.S. air
transport industry. The industry objects to the use of the
sign to indicate immediate as well as long-term hazards. The
harmonized system is meant to improve worker safety
standards and consumer protection around the world in the
labeling and transport of chemical goods. . . . Page A-5

GAO SEEKS CRITERIA FOR MEASURING SUCCESS OF EFFORTS TO
PROTECT WETLANDS

Criteria should be established for measuring the ecological
success of wetlands mitigation efforts to ensure in-lieu fee
arrangements and other means of mitigating wetland losses
accomplish their goals, the General Accounting Office says.
In-lieu fee mitigation occurs when a permittee pays a fee
instead of performing mitigation associated with a project
or buying credits from a mitigation bank--parcels of land
set aside and restored, usually as high-quality wetlands.
"The extent to which the in-lieu-fee option has achieved its
purpose of mitigating adverse impacts to wetlands is
uncertain," GAO said. . . . Page A-2

HOUSE BILL WOULD REQUIRE STUDY ON REDUCING NUMBER OF
GASOLINE BLENDS

Two Wisconsin congressmen offer legislation (H.R. 2017) to
require an EPA study on the feasibility of reducing the
number of gasoline blends sold in the Midwest and other
parts of the country. The representatives say they want the
EPA to determine whether more uniformity among gasoline
blends would ease supply problems and bring down prices. . .

NORTH CAROLINA EXPECTED TO FALL SHORT OF SOLID WASTE
REDUCTION GOAL

The amount of solid waste disposed of in North Carolina has
dramatically increased over the past 10 years, making the
state's waste disposal reduction goals impossible to meet,
according to the state Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. The department's latest solid waste management
annual report says the amount of solid waste disposed of by
North Carolina residents has increased by 45 percent since
1991. . . . Page A-6

ICELAND EXPECTS TO RECEIVE EXEMPTION UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE
TREATY

An exemption to allow Iceland to build a new industrial
facility without violating the Kyoto Protocol's limits on
greenhouse gases probably will be approved by the climate
change pact's signatories, perhaps as early as July.
Iceland's environment minister, Siv Fridleifsdo`ttir, says
the exemption would acknowledge that one additional factory
in Iceland could lead to a large percentage increase in the
nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The clause is scheduled
to be discussed at the climate change talks in Bonn in July.

U.S.-CANADA: A science advisory panel is expected to meet in
June to review nontarget plant toxicity tests being
harmonized under NAFTA by EPA and Canada's Pest Management
Regulatory Agency. The review by the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel is
a step toward harmonizing U.S. and Canadian data
requirements on the toxicity of pesticides to plants not
targeted by the chemicals.

An EPA official says the review could assist the two
agencies in conducting plant risk assessments and in
reducing uncertainty in risk management decisions.

Under NAFTA, Canada and the United States agree to develop
compatible pesticide review programs to facilitate routine
sharing of work. . . . Page A-6

REGISTRATION: A recent arbitration decision on how one
pesticide maker should compensate another for data generated
to support regulatory decisions may lead to the use of a
hybrid method of data citation, an attorney involved in the
dispute tells BNA. Pesticide makers may try to combine the
methods of data citation known as selective citation and
cite-all citation, according to the attorney who represented
Gharda U.S.A. in the arbitration involving the pesticide
chlorpyrifos. . . . Page A-5
