Dear Mr. Derrick:

	Thank you for your e-mails.  It would be wonderful if we did get a chance
to meet in person while you're in Austin - whether you're here in
connection with this upcoming Law School Foundation meeting or here later
on for some other reason.

	Of course, at a minimum, I hope to be able to come to the
to-be-newly-scheduled meeting of the Institute for Law & Technology and
meet you there.  Yesterday, I received the 10/29/01 memo from David
Ellwanger and the accompanying binder.  There is a reference on page 27 of
the binder to a preliminary plan for the Institute that has been developed
by David Winn.  Would it make sense for this preliminary plan to be
circulated to committee members ahead of time?

	Incidentally, I read this morning of Bill's election to Enron's board - as
you know, he is outstanding.

	Best regards.

							- Henry Hu
