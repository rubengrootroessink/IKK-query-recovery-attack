 Dear Bob

It was good to speak to you briefly when I was in Houston the week before
last and I am sorry we did not get the chance to meet up. As I mentioned I
have very much enjoyed working with all of the team at Enron on the ICI job
and hope that at some stage in the future we get a chance to work together
again.

There was one matter that I forgot to mention when we spoke, although
Michael Brown may already have mentioned it to you. A few weeks ago we were
asked to act for the Maharashta State Electricity Board in relation to
arbitration proceedings against Dabhol. We of course turned the job down as
we obviously did not want to act against Enron(or of course Gail) given our
existing relationship. You would of course expect nothing less but I hope
you might bear this in mind next time you have a major dispute for which you
need UK counsel. After we turned down the job I think the MSEB's next port
of call was going to be Herbert Smith, our opponents on the ICI job!

I am due to see Gail in London next week but if you are ever passing through
London I do hope you will also look me up.

With best regards

Richard
