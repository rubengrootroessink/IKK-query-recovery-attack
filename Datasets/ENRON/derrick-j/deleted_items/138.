Sorry, I gave a bum lead....... as the facts unfold, it looks like this deal relates to a Volumetric Production Payment transaction  and equity investment done out of Scott Josey's group...the properties involved are located in Utah and Colorado..............the "Crescendo entity" is managed by non-Enron personnel.  From my discussions with Scott Josey this a. m., it appears that Crescendo management has been using outside local counsel to determine the relative rights as between Crescendo who owns the oil and gas rights and Sullivan who holds the helium rights via a lease arrangement with the BLM............Andy Edison, as of this morning, is on-point according to Scott Josey....Scott Josey's group is an ENA group.
best regards   bng

Janet just left me a voice mail and believes this is an ENA deal after all.  Barbara--you may want to get ahold of Janet to verify ownership on this one.  Please let this group know what the final answer is.  DF

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF
