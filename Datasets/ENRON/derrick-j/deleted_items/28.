Jim -- I don't see any problem with this and will confirm with Mark and then get back to John.  

Just FYI, this is the same transaction in which we did not waive the conflict for Skadden to represent British Gas (BP/Chaco's partner in these negotiations), but that was only because Skadden is providing litigation support to us on the Cuiab? project and they have direct inside knowledge of our negotiation strategy on the gas side.  K&S won't have this issue.

Regards,
	John

Please see the message below.  I would appreciate your responding directly to John Keffer. Subject to the usual caveat regarding arbitration and litigation, I have no objection to John's undertaking the representation, but the two of you are better positioned than I to know whether this would be a problem.   Thank you.  Jim

Jim-I'm sorry to be bothering you about this again, but I need to get your
clearance for me to represent BP in a transaction in Bolivia where BP,
through its partially owned subsidiary Empresa Petrolera Chaco, will be
selling gas to Southern Cone Gas Ltd.  As I understand it, the gas is
intended for Enron's Cuiab? power plant in Brazil.

Thanks again.

Regards

John
