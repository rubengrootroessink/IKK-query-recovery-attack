Dear Friends,

It has been more than a month since our lives were changed. September 11 has taken a terrible toll.  The size of that toll remains to be seen. The College has responded in a way to make all of us proud.  Students, faculty and staff have banded together and given of themselves in an effort to cope with this tragedy.  Nearly 12,000 of us gathered on the South Mall to participate in a moving ceremony of sympathy and resolve. We are changed but not detained from our purpose-to educate one another and thereby to try to make sense of the world in which we find ourselves. Teaching young people is a wonderful balm.

We have all been touched by the catastrophic actions in New York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania--some more directly than others. Here on campus, we have been struggling to return to our normal lives while we serve as a source of strength and reason for our students, as well as for each other. I hope this finds you and your family safe and well.

TARL LAUNCHES NEW WEBSITE
For those of you with an interest in Texas history, you'll be pleased to see a new public education website, Texas Beyond History, that has been launched by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). The new website can be found at http://www.utexas.edu/research/tarl/tbh/index.html, and showcases information and images about Texas cultural heritage-more than 13,000 years of human history-from Clovis to cotton farmers. For the first time, the public, especially school children and teachers, will have access to the most important of TARL's scientific holdings through online virtual museum "exhibits" and a variety of creative resources including map tools, children's activities, an illustrated glossary and lesson plans. This is the first website of its kind anywhere in the country.

THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST
Our students are making the news as well. The October issue of "Glamour" magazine features RICHA GULATI as one of the Top 10 College Women of 2001. Richa is a Plan II major and a winner of the Truman Scholarship. In addition, Richa and fellow Liberal Arts student ANDREW FRIEDBERG, a Government/Economics/Finance major, were honored as the University's Outstanding Students for this academic year.

We are also very pleased to announce this year's winners of the Larry Temple Scholarship. RICHARD COFER II, History and Government major, and MARGARET PORTER, Liberal Arts Honors, are the recipients of this award. Another recent scholarship winner is FRANCISCO JOSE BENAVIDES. Francisco, majoring in Italian and English, is one of only two winners of a scholarship from the Italian American Foundation.

On Oct. 20, the Texas Exes awarded their Distinguished  Alumnus Awards for 2001 (http://www.texasexes.org/news.php3?id=56), and no less than five of the six honorees hold Liberal Arts degrees:

R. Gordon Appleman (BA '59)
Betty Sue Flowers (BA '69, MA '70)
Ricardo Hinojosa (BA '72)
Joe R.  Long  (BA '51)
and
Jon P. Newton (BA '63)

On the same evening, Prof. William S. Livingston,  Senior  Vice President of The University, Professor  of  Government, former Acting President of The University, was awarded the Distinguished Service Award by the Exes (http://www.texasexes.org/press.php3?pr=4).  This is only the second time that this award has  been made.

Congratulations to each of these distinguished alums, friends, and colleagues.


UT MYTHOLOGY
One of the recurring myths about UT is that the classes are all huge.  Here is the breakdown on class size in the College of Liberal Arts for this semester:

Enrollment	Number	Percent
1-30		936	74%
31-75		170	13%
76-100		51	4%
100-200		55	4%
Over 200	56	4%
Total		1268	100%

We are working hard to reduce the number of classes with more than 75 students, but we are proud of the fact that nearly three-fourths of our classes have 30 students or less.

Let us hear from you.
