Bruce,

given that Enron Europe has no relationship to speak of with Ashursts, I would not find it surprising. We have used them historically. One partner was very strong in UK gas. He left more than a year ago and since then we have not used them. We do not therefore have a relationship which would allow us to exert any influence over them.

Rob/Mark -

Would we find this surprising given any relationship that Enron has (or doesn't have) with Ashursts?
