Jim:  I understand Sheila Walton (our regular HR rep.) has cancer and will be out for awhile (that certainly puts things in perspective, doesn't it?).  Her HR replacement is Terry Bosien---should I contact her re the promotions of Dave and Kriste (again, subject to your approval, of course---whatever info you need from me supporting these recommendations, just let me know).  Thanks again, Rex
