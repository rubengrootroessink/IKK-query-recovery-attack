Dear National Member:

The National Program conference call series on America's Response to
Terrorism continues next week, Wednesday, October 31, from 12:00 to 12:45
p.m. ET.  Sumit Ganguly, Professor of Government and Asian Studies at the
University of Texas at Austin, will lead a discussion on India and Pakistan
in the War on Terrorism and Michael P. Peters, Senior Vice President of the
Council on Foreign Relations, will chair.

Dr. Ganguly is author of the forthcoming book Fearful Symmetry: Explaining
the Indo-Pakistani Conflict.  He will focus on the risks and opportunities
that the United States now faces in South Asia, and how relations between
India and Pakistan will affect the United States in the war on terrorism.

Please respond to this e-mail if you would like to join us for the
conference call with Sumit Ganguly and Michael Peters, and we will send you
call-in instructions.  Please don't hesitate to call me at 212/434-9465 or
e-mail me directly at ifaskianos@cfr.org if you have suggestions or
questions.

Regards,
Irina Faskianos
National Director
Council on Foreign Relations
