MONITORING RECOMMENDED IN EPA GUIDANCE ON WATER POLLUTION
REPORTS

Recommendations to states for doing biological monitoring to
determine whether a water body is impaired and requires a
total maximum daily load of pollutants is contained in final
guidance released by EPA. The "2002 Integrated Water Quality
Monitoring and Assessment Report Guidance" calls on states
to develop a comprehensive monitoring and assessment
strategy describing their approach to obtaining data used to
characterize the attainment status of their waters. The
final guidance, developed by EPA's Office of Wetlands,
Oceans and Watersheds in the agency's Office of Water does
not differ substantially from draft guidance circulated last
month. . . . Page A-1,  Text E-1

STAFF SAYS TECHNOLOGY TO MEET NONROAD DIESEL RULES
AVAILABLE, FEASIBLE

Current technology makes it feasible for heavy-duty diesel
engine manufacturers to meet the most stringent emission
standards in place for engines that are more or less than 50
horsepower, according to EPA staff. This finding, announced
in a technical staff paper open for public comment, sets the
agency up to enter the next phase of nonroad diesel engine
regulation--more stringent standards for these engines and
their diesel fuel, says an EPA official in the Office of
Transportation and Air Quality. . . . Page A-8

NATURAL GAS, PIPELINE INDUSTRIES SEEK LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE
SAFETY

Leading natural gas and liquid pipeline industry groups urge
the Bush administration to press Congress to pass
legislation to improve pipeline safety. In a letter to
Transportation Secretary Mineta, industry officials say a
working group of leaders from liquid pipeline, natural gas
transmission, and natural gas distribution companies "has
reached consensus on numerous issues that promote the
continued safety and reliability of the nation's pipelines."

U.N. REPORT TARGETS SEWAGE TREATMENT AS TOP PRIORITY TO
PROTECT OCEANS

A United Nations Environment Program report cites poorly
planned coastal development, sewage flows, and excessive
nutrients from industrial and agricultural runoff as the
most serious problems associated with ocean pollution. The
report was prepared for a meeting next week in Montreal of
the organization's Global Program of Action for the
Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based
Activities. . . . Page A-3

PESTICIDE MAKERS GET MORE TIME FOR AIR POLLUTION
PRECOMPLIANCE PLANS

Pesticide active ingredient makers will get three more
months to submit precompliance plans for hazardous air
pollutant emissions limits under a final rule being
published today by EPA. A separate final rule also being
published today changes the definition of "process tank" for
pesticide makers as part of the settlement of a lawsuit
filed by an industry group. . . . Page A-2

EPA PROPOSES TO ALLOW CERTAIN HAZARDOUS WASTES TO BE SENT TO
LANDFILLS

EPA proposes a rule that would allow, under limited
conditions, hazardous waste eligible for placement in
Corrective Action Management Unit sites to be disposed of in
federally regulated hazardous waste landfills. Several
industry groups had pushed to have the proposed change
included in an EPA rule proposed last year that addressed
Corrective Action Management Unit sites and had sought to
make it easier for industries to clean up hazardous waste
sites. EPA issues this separate, new proposed rule
addressing off-site shipment of some wastes as a result of
those comments on last year's proposal. . . . Page A-4

REVISIONS TO VERMONT WETLANDS RULES RELAX REQUIREMENTS FOR
DEVELOPERS

Revised wetland rules that would loosen some regulatory
requirements on developers are expected to be adopted in
Vermont next month. The rules would streamline the wetlands
review process in Vermont and ease regulatory burdens for
routine development activities. But the rules also would
provide added protection for Class I wetlands, already the
most protected category of wetlands. . . . Page A-5

EPA DRAFT POLICY EVALUATES PESTICIDE EXPOSURE THROUGH
DRINKING WATER

EPA plans to release today for public comment a draft policy
to explain how it will implement the Food Quality Protection
Act of 1996 requirement to evaluate exposures to pesticides
through drinking water. Under the policy, absent evidence to
the contrary, the agency says it will not generally conclude
that drinking water treatment would reduce exposures to a
pesticide. . . . Page A-6

WATER BOARD REJECTS INDUSTRY APPEALS ON SAN DIEGO STORMWATER
RULE

The California Regional Water Quality Control Board rejects
the appeals of the San Diego Building Industry Association
and the Western State Petroleum Association to block a plan
for the regulation of stormwater runoff in the San Diego
region. . . . Page A-8

NUCLEAR COMMISSION FINAL RULE ALLOWS CHANGES IN STORAGE CASK
DESIGN

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirms a final rule
allowing changes to an NRC-approved cask design to hold
spent nuclear fuel in dry storage at power plants. . . .

COLORADO MAN RECEIVES JAIL SENTENCE, $100,000 FINE FOR
ILLEGAL DUMPING

A Mesa County, Colo., judge sentences the owner of a
now-defunct cooling systems company to 60 days in jail and a
$100,000 fine for the illegal disposal of hazardous waste. .

CAROLINA

Legislation that would require laboratories in North
Carolina to keep an inventory and to report regularly on
potentially dangerous biological agents is approved by the
state's General Assembly. . . . Page A-9

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
___________________

WTO: The European Union assures the United States it will
not promote the use of the "precautionary principle" to
justify the imposition of illegitimate trade barriers in
negotiations expected next year to clarify the relationship
between World Trade Organization rules and multilateral
environmental agreements, such as the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species and the Cartagena
Protocol of Biosafety. U.S. officials say the commitment was
made in a letter from the EU Trade Commissioner during the
recent meeting of trade ministers in Doha, Qatar. The
ministers agreed in Doha to launch a new round of
multilateral trade talks that will include discussions on
the relationship between WTO rules and "specific trade
obligations" set out in multilateral environmental
agreements. . . . Page A-3
