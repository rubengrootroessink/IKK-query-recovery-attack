Hi there, following up from my call earlier...

I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:

Enron Trading Services Inc
Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
Enron Metals Far East Ltd

Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?

Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards
Lauren Christie
