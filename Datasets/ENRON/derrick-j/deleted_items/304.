Jim -- Per our discussion, I gave Mary Flood the attorney numbers at Enron, mainly because she had credible research anyway and our number was actually a little lower. She also has a prominent lawyer in town quoted as saying that he has always viewed us as one of the major law firms in town, which is really all she needs.  My guess is we won't like this story, but it is very difficult to reel someone in on speculating about layoffs in one function when we all know what's coming companywide.

Thanks Jim.

Vance

Mary:

There are about 245 attorneys employed in our legal department
worldwide.  About 145 of those are in Houston.

I am not able to find anyone available for an interview today.  If you
have other questions, give me a call.

Thanks.
