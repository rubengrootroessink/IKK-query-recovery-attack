Today, the Corporate Secretary Department began receiving large amounts of registered mail which already has been signed for in the mailroom and delivered to us.  Chuck Cheek tells us that his Litigation Group should not receive these letters and will not be directly involved. 

We are just trying to ascertain to whom (individual/department/outside counsel) should this mail be directed.  

When we get an answer, we will pass the word and give the mailroom proper instructions.  It is my understanding that many of the officers on 50 also are receiving these letters.  We will need to notify all of the proper procedure.  

Let me know, and we'll take it from there.
