Jim:

Rob Stern of the law firm of O'Melvey & Meyers is here representing Jeff Skilling and requesting access to ENE Board/Committee minutes and Agenda files.   My feeling is that we will provide him access as we have provided to other outside law firms representing Directors and Officers.    Just wanted to confirm that with you.
