EPA NOMINEE URGES CAREFUL BALANCING OF ACCESS TO
INFORMATION, SECURITY

President Bush's choice to become EPA's chief information
officer tells a Senate committee that public access to EPA
data will have to be more carefully balanced with growing
concerns that such data could be of use to terrorists. "I've
always been a very staunch advocate for public access to
information," Kimberly Terese Nelson tells the Senate
Environmental and Public Works Committee. "However, Sept. 11
did change some things." EPA's Office of Environmental
Information has removed general risk management information
from the agency's Web site and is reviewing manuals and
information products for data that could compromise national
security. . . . Page A-1

1,100 ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CALL FOR DEEP CUTS IN POWER PLANT
EMISSIONS

A coalition of 1,100 national and local environmental groups
plans to release principles today emphasizing large cuts in
power plant pollution--a sign the groups are not willing to
compromise on legislation introduced by Sen. Jeffords that
is opposed by the Bush administration and industry groups.
The release of the principles comes as Jeffords, chairman of
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is
planning a hearing next week on his legislation (S. 556),
which calls for major reductions in power plant emissions of
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide
by 2007. . . . Page A-1

RESEARCHER SUGGESTS USING EMISSIONS TRADING TO CUT POWER
PLANT POLLUTION

If emission allowances for power plant pollution are
distributed through a government-led auction among electric
utilities, the cost of carbon reductions would be
dramatically reduced, suggests a researcher. . . . Page A-11

EPA CLOSE TO COMPLETING PROPOSAL ON RECYCLING OF CATHODE RAY
TUBES

EPA is close to completing long awaited rules on recycling
cathode ray tubes and disposing of solvent-contaminated shop
towels and wipes, according to the director of EPA's Office
of Solid Waste, Elizabeth Cotsworth. She says the rules on
cathode ray tubes, aimed at removing some of the regulatory
barriers industry faces in recycling the tubes, are headed
to the White House Office of Management and Budget for
review. Cathode ray tubes are major sources of lead and
mercury in the country's waste stream. . . . Page A-2

SNOWE INTRODUCES BILL TO REQUIRE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS
OF TRUCKERS

Companies that transport hazardous materials would have to
conduct background investigations of drivers and document
the drivers' identities under legislation introduced by Sen.
Snowe.  Employers would have to obtain fingerprints and
photographs of job applicants and conduct criminal
background checks on applicants for jobs with access to very
sensitive hazardous materials. Immigration and
naturalization service records also would have to be
reviewed under provisions in Snowe's bill (S. 1557).
"Federal authorities already recommend that companies hiring
drivers conduct these tests, and my legislation will simply
make this a mandatory requirement," Snowe says. . . . Page

DOE SELECTS PROCESS FOR SEPARATING MATERIAL IN RADIOACTIVE
SALT WASTE

The Energy Department chooses a process to separate
high-activity and low-activity portions of high-level
radioactive salt waste stored at the Savannah River Site in
South Carolina. The department says it will use "caustic
side solvent extraction" to separate highly radioactive
components of the radioactive salt waste from the
low-activity constituents. . . . Page A-6

OZONE HOLE OVER ANTARCTIC SAID NOT TO HAVE GROWN OVER PAST
THREE YEARS

The hole in the stratospheric ozone layer has not grown in
the past three years because the level of ozone-destroying
chlorine compounds has peaked and is beginning to decline,
according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Satellite data show the area of the ozone
hole above Antarctic peaked at about 26 million square
kilometers, making it about the same size as North America
and similar to its size over the past three years. . . .

PANEL HAS LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT EXPOSURE TO METHANOL IN DIET,
AT WORK

A federal advisory panel concludes that it has "minimal
concern" that normal exposures to methanol through diet or
in the workplace will harm human development or
reproduction. However, the panel is more concerned over the
effects of high accidental exposures on human development.
EPA is assessing the risks of methanol to develop an
inhalation standard. . . . Page A-5

MEETING ADVANCES CAUSE FOR HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS, PESTICIDES
TREATY

The three-year-old Rotterdam Convention on the prior
informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals
and pesticides moves closer to coming into force after the
conclusion of talks at the headquarters of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization. The talks feature delegates from
102 countries meeting in dozens of small groups to "close
the open paragraphs" in the Rotterdam Convention, says one
observer. . . . Page A-8

U.N. PANEL REPORTS ON MAXIMUM RESIDUE LIMITS FOR 26
PESTICIDES IN FOOD

An international scientific panel recommends maximum residue
limits for 26 pesticides in food that ultimately may be used
by some countries to determine what food products are
acceptable in trade. The Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues
for 2001 recommends the residue limits to the Codex
Alimentarius Committee on Pesticide Residues. . . . Page

OVERFISHING, HABITAT DAMAGE SEEN AS WORSE THAN POLLUTION FOR
OCEANS

Destruction of aquatic habitats and overfishing are having a
greater adverse impact on international waterways than is
pollution, says Dag Daler, project manager for the global
water assessment effort and a participant in a United
Nations-sponsored conference in Sweden. About 120 conferees
representing 40 countries attend the first general assembly
of the Global International Waters Assessment, a United
Nations Environment Program project. . . . Page A-9

BUDGET: Congress approves the conference report (H. Rpt.

fiscal year 2002, clearing the measure to go to President
Bush for his signature. The conference agreement provides

WETLANDS
________

NATIONWIDE PERMITS: A proposal by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to reissue nationwide permits authorizing activity
in wetlands should not include changes that weaken
environmental protections until a comprehensive assessment
of the program is complete, says EPA comments to the corps.
Developers, who are subject to the nationwide permit
requirements under the Clean Water Act, deride the proposal
as doing little to correct flaws they say are inherent in
the program. Environmental advocates criticize the proposal,
saying the permit program has resulted in thousands of acres
of lost wetlands. . . . Page A-3
