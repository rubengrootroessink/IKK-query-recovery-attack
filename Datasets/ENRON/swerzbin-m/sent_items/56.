Glenn-

I really have no interest in Lewis River or Klamath since there is zero correlation to the Columbia flows....  However, I'll offer the whole deal at $3 million per year with the hair if they're insistent.  Or we'll do any power options the weather desk wants.

Where do we stand on this? I sent Sanjeev some Asian Option Pricing last week; I get the sense he wants to pursue the original stream flow structure (one which were not comfortable with). Let me know what our commercial position is. Thanks

Glenn:

How is the pricing for the stream flow going?

Please let me know,
