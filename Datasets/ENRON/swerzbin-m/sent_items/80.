E] [IMAGE]      [IMAGE]       [IMAGE]       GEORGE, Wash. - Doing something=
 nice for California has  never been a priority here in the Columbia River =
Basin, where  high-voltage power lines lope across irrigated fields of alfa=
lfa,  potatoes and wheat.  Politicians from California, as farmers in this =
area will explain  at great length, have been scheming for decades to sipho=
n off the  basin's cheap electricity and water.   Californians, however, ha=
ve been noticeably less irritating as of  late. Having fouled up electricit=
y deregulation six ways from  Sunday, they are skidding into the summer air=
-conditioning season  desperately short of power. In the last year, much of=
 their  salvation has come from the Columbia River, whose monstrous dams ar=
e  the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America.  All along the r=
iver, from Portland, Ore., to British Columbia,  utility companies, aluminu=
m makers and farmers have joined to help  save California - but at a stagge=
ring price. Charging whatever  California's dysfunctional power market will=
 bear, people in this  narrow stretch of the Northwest have created a kind =
of Kuwait along  the Columbia.  With their record profits, some public util=
ities are wiring the  emptiness of Eastern Washington with fiber optics, bu=
ying diesel  generators to make still more power and paying Wall Street-sty=
le  wages to electricity traders - while making sure that their  electricit=
y rates remain among the cheapest in North America. Just  north of the bord=
er in British Columbia, a state-owned utility  luxuriated in its California=
 windfall by mailing out rebate checks  to 1.6 million customers.  Their go=
od fortune, though, has come with a measure of  ambivalence and may well be=
 short-lived. A severe drought is already  hurting farmers across the regio=
n. If it continues, utilities along  the river will have to buy power and m=
ay be punished by the same  market forces that gave them a windfall.  "This=
 is not nice money," said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who  heads a group=
 that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. "It is  something that is =
offered to us not to use water so Californians can  run their air-condition=
ers."  Nice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia  Basin. =
 North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly  owned utili=
ty that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as  much money last y=
ear than it ever had before. With just 35,000 local  customers, the utility=
 last year had a $58.2 million profit. It paid  its two top power traders $=
285,000 each, an astonishing income in a  county where per capita income is=
 less than $25,000 a year. The  utility refuses to reveal the traders' name=
s for fear their children  might be kidnapped.   The chief operating office=
r of Chelan County Public Utility  District acknowledged that increases in =
the cost of power were  "huge" and "obscene." But the executive, Charles J.=
 Hosken, added,  "We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market =
for our  customer owners."  Next door in equally sparse Grant County, a pub=
lic utility that  also owns two dams on the Columbia has made even more mon=
ey  maximizing the market. It had a record $88.8 million in profits last  y=
ear - more than double its best previous year.  Grant County Public Utility=
 District, which has just 40,000  retail customers, is using its windfall t=
o help build a $70 million  fiber optic network for local residents. It has=
 also bought 20  diesel generators to guard against power shortages and, if=
 possible,  exploit the power gold-rush. The utility estimates that those  =
generators could add $50 million to profits in the coming year.  Like Chela=
n, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought  insurance to insulate i=
ts customers from high market prices for  electricity, when, as now, local =
needs exceed generating capacity in  the river. Power rates in Grant and Ch=
elan Counties are about  one-fifth as much as in New York City.  Grant Coun=
ty's utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea  of giving a share =
of its profits to its customers.   "How would it look if Grant County gives=
 away rebates while so  many people are paying more for electricity?" asked=
 Lon Topaz,  director of resource management for the utility. "It would be =
lousy  politics."  An Upside-Down Economy    The second-worst drought on re=
cord in the Columbia River Basin  has combined with California's deregulati=
on mess to further distort  the energy market. Drought has not only helped =
increase the price at  which electricity can be sold on the spot market - 1=
0 to 20 times as  much as last year's price - it has strengthened a compell=
ing  bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every megawatt not purchased  =
and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in, long- term prices  that are =
a fraction of the current market rate) can be sent south to  California. Fo=
r many utilities, conservation spells local savings  and a long-distance bo=
nanza.  As a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap  h=
ydropower has been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are  being pa=
id up to $440 an acre not to farm.   Similarly, aluminum companies are coll=
ecting about $1.7 billion  this year by not making aluminum. Companies like=
 Alcoahave earned profits that delight Wall  Street, while keeping about 10=
,000 workers on their payroll, by  reselling hydropower that they bought in=
 the mid-1990's under a  cheap long-term contract.  Even residential custom=
ers are being offered a chance to make a  few dollars from the power crunch=
. AvistaUtilities has announced that it will pay its  customers in Washingt=
on and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do  not use, if their consumpt=
ion falls more than 5 percent below last  year's level.   For utilities in =
the Northwest, by far the largest profits from  California's electricity cr=
isis have been secured in British  Columbia. A number of private American u=
tilities have also benefited  from California's troubles.   BC Hydro, a uti=
lity owned by British Columbia with dams on the  Columbia and Peace Rivers,=
 is the first corporation in the history  of the province to exceed $1 bill=
