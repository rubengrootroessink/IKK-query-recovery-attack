Mike:

Just wanna follow up with you on the $22.8 schedule C (see below email sent to you and Tim on 9/27).  Did you get a chance to fill in the reason for using the schedule C?  When you are done please send it back to me and I'll print it out for you and Tim to sign off.  We will need to send document to Risk Control in Houston.

Thanks,

Fran

We reserved $22.8 MM in your 9/26 P&L for the restructured/changed BPA deal #51353.  Please take a look at the attached schedule C form and fill in the reaon for usig the schedule and any planned removal date.  Right now the reason is filled temperarily with below comments:

Reserve for deal 51353 with BPA due to the uncertainty of open access

When you are done please send the revised form back to me and I'll print out one copy for you and Tim to sign off.

Thank you,
Fran
