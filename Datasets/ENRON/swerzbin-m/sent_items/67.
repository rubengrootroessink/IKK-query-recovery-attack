This is the info.-  Kim Hillis is making the reservations (I hope there are rooms available this late)    A couple guys here have stayed there and said it's awesome.  With a great beach, close to town and golf. There's jet skis and boats right there.  I'm up for chartering a a catamaran for snorkeling and cruisin' all day.
