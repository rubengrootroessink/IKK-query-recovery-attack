We will be selling the old desk chairs to employees for $25.00.  If you are interested in purchasing a non-Aeron chair currently on the floor, please let me know by close of business, Monday, June 4.  On Tuesday morning, we will hold a drawing to allocate the available chairs.  

Just a reminder - we will be replacing desk chairs after 2:00 pm on Monday, June 4 and Tuesday, June 5.  If you are happy with your current chair and do not wish to have it replaced or have special requests, please let me know as soon as possible.  Please disregard if you have already responded.

Thanks!
Amy
