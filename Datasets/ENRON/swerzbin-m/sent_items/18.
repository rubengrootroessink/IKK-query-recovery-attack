Mike:

Please see the term sheet that Vivek has put together. I am not sure if Mo or Jeffery is going to work on this.

Please let them coordinate with Vivek and come with a structure that is acceptable to you.

The strikes columns are left blank and as discussed can be close to ATM

Please call me if you need furhter information.

Thanks,

Sanjeev
