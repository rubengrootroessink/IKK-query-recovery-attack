Mikey all our fundies stuff is still locked down ...  try these web-sites:  Powerlytix.com and Friedwired.com (pw: enron, enron).  Next week we'll open the stuff back up ... I'm guessing exports to be close 3,000 MWs into Cal  through the Spring run-off  then up to 5,000 MW thru July  (on average about 4,250 MW) then dropping in Aug and Sept back to 2,500.

Do you have an outage calendar for 2002?
