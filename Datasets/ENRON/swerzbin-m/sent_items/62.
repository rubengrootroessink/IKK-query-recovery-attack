Dick:

You may recall in the early part of May that we agreed as to the form of two (2) certificates which must accompany every financial transaction executed between Enron North America Corp. and EWEB.  The reasons are to (i) verify that either of Bert Dunn or Scott Spettel are still authorized (on the Trade Date) to execute trades under our ISDA Master Agreement and to (ii) insure that EWEB followed its policy of having the transaction reviewed by its Power Risk Management Committee (a copy of the trade confirmation must be reviewed by your committee as per your policy).

Kimberly Hundl will be forwarding certificates for the Transaction (Trade Date: 6/12/01) which we request be executed by Randy L. Berggren, General Manager/Secretary.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your assistance.
