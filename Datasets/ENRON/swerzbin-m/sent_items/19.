Mike:

This structure is from Caslebridge, who are independent consultants and work with various clients to hedge their exposure. They have not told me who the client is (it is not PacifiCorp)..I think we can make a good guess.

At this time, all we would like to know is that we would consider and price such a structure. If yes, then we would like to give them an indicative no. by Wed morning.

At this time the factors 1,000 and 10 are arbitrary.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Sanjeev
