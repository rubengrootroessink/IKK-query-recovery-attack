Greetings from Amsterdam,

I know its been two months since the last update.  So this is long overdue.
But then again I haven't heard one peep out of 75% of you on this email
list, so sorry to say, this will be your last Update.  All of the dead beats
are getting dropped.  YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT!  Oh, and don't bother
emailing me with a bunch of excuses, you're getting dropped and that's that.
(Maybe I kidding....maybe I'm not....)

Well let's get everyone caught up........

This is going to be a long one, so get comfortable....the last two months
has involved a lot of travelling.  I've been to Switzerland, sailing in the
North Sea, London (twice, as per usual), Monaco, New York (twice, for two
weddings, also no surprise), and Spain.  I'll recap a few of my journeys for
everyone.....

I'd like to start with my trip to London.  I went to my first real Cricket
match, England vs. Pakistan.  Unfortunately I went with clients that knew
much more than I did about the sport.  The traders of Axia Energy easily
took me for ?300.  A word of advice for my American friends, do not bet on
English sports that you don't know anything about.  You would have figured
that I had known that.  Sometimes my stupidity even surprises me.....Okay
Axia, you got me this time, we'll see what happens this weekend at the
American Football match in Amsterdam...!

The following weekend I was off to the French Riviera and the Monaco Grand
Prix.....intense sporting event.  Mind numbingly loud, beautiful weather,
and a great night in the casino.  Although, it's official, my French sucks.
Six years of French in school and I barely know how to ask for a glass of
water.  I'm not happy about that.  Oh! Speaking of languages, I have
enrolled in formal Dutch lessons with a few guys from the desk.  Classes
begin in September, twice a week, two hours a night for two months.  I can't
wait for the Update after the final.  Yes, there is a final.  Any way, let's
continue.....

My next weekend brought back home to New York City and Bob and Stephanie's
wedding.  Congratulations you two, I think you should be back from your
honeymoon by now?  Anyway beautiful event, very happy I was asked to be a
part of it.  Great to see a lot of old friends.  And....as promised, I did
not have to find a hidden place to take a nap.  Dave and Felice, I still
feel bad about that.  While on the wedding thing.....last weekend I returned
home for 38 hours to attend Deirdra and Penn's wedding.  Surprisingly enough
I stayed awake for this one too!  In all fairness, it was easy, it was a day
wedding.  Which was very helpful.  Anyway those two are in the Caribbean
having a blast I'm sure.  Not me, it's 7:15pm and I'm in my office writing
this stupid e-mail.   I think I'm going to set up a cot behind my desk...?

I have to mention a little trip I took in between weddings.....a bunch of
the Prebon's European managers had an off-site meeting in the South of Spain
(Malaga to be exact).  It was suppose to be in Barcelona, but that's a whole
different story.  I think I'll leave that part of the story out.
Anyway.....I have learned a few things about travelling lately, especially
about air travel.  We all know I fly a lot, I mean a lot.  I have a new
rule, avoid crappy airlines like the plague.  It's just not worth it.
Airlines to avoid while in Europe....Basic Air (with that name alone, I
should have known better), Luxair, actually I can take that one step
further, avoid Luxembourg airport and any flight that flies there.  I'll
elaborate....why wouldn't I?....First of all I take KLM to Luxembourg, no
problems there and I have to transfer to a Luxair flight that will be taking
me to Malaga.  Well after waiting on line with a bunch of old rude people we
pile into a bus.  We wait in the hot sweaty bus for 15 minutes, finally the
bus leaves.  I kid you not, we the bus ride was 30 feet long.  I was in
shock.  Don't worry it gets worse.....I squeeze into my seat, I think there
was nine inches (22.5 centimeters) of leg room.  Every single seat is
occupied.  Miraculously I fall asleep....but not for long.  The flight
attendant wakes me up from a dead sleep in order to serve me my "meal", I'm
using that term loosely.  So now I'm awake (which I'm not happy about) and I
have the scariest pate in front of me I've ever seen.  It looked so bad I
had to try it.  For the first time in my life I almost had to employ the air
sickness bag.  It was horrible.  I do have to mention, there was one good
thing....after the "meal", they did serve complimentary cognac, which was
nice.  Quick frankly, I felt they owed to me, but I was thankful none the
less.   There is something else that bothered me, but it nothing to do with
Luxair....

Now that I have almost been poisoned, I knew that there was no chance for me
to fall back asleep.  So I start reading the book I brought with me, "The
Bonfire of the Vanities" by Tom Wolfe.  Well in the end I found the book
entertaining, but I have one major problem with it.  I'm reading about this
guy Lawrence Kramer who is on his way to the court house in the Bronx (he's
an Assistant District Attorney) and Tom Wolfe has this guy getting on the D
train at 81st street and Central Park West.  Duh!  Everybody knows that on
the upper west side the D train and the A train are both express from 59th
Street to 125th Street.  The only west side local train that stops at 81st
Street and the Bronx Courthouse (161st Street) is the B train and sometimes
the C train.  I know I'm being a little petty, but give me a break, the
author "claims" to reside in New York City (I read the back cover), get your
facts straight pal.

Tomorrow I'm off the European World Bowl (American Football) with 25
clients.  I have a feeling my high school team could beat either team, but
it should be fun none the less....we'll see.

I would like to welcome the following people into the world....Vanessa
Malhame, Joel Kabel and Melissa Moore (my new niece) who was just born on
Wednesday night!

That's it, until next time......Enjoy your summer,

-Douglas Pursel Moore
