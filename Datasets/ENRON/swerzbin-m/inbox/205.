Until further notice please make every effort to have your curves downloaded by 2:15-2:30 Central Time.  As you both know, there are many individuals waiting for the new marks and many decisions to be made on the numbers, so your cooperation in getting us the curves helps us to finalize the numbers in a timely manner.  If you could also stress to your traders the importance of double checking their curves so no mistakes are made and also being extra careful in deal entry that would be greatly appreciated as well.

Thanks,
Stacey
