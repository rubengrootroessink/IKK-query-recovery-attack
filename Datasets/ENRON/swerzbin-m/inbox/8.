This has happened before.  I think they received the report electronically before they received the hard copies.  Have you been paid for all of your expense reports so far?  This msg. usually means nothing, but check your bank account first.  I'll look at your file though and see what I can find.

I don't think there are any receipts outstanding .. Could you please tell me which ones you're missing???  This last report had a receipt for everything.

You are only allowed 2 reports with receipts outstanding.  Your expense reports will not be paid until you meet this requirement.
