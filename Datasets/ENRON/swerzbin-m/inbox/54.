Hey,

I'd like to know if I could buy you a beer sometime and pick your brain on how things work in the NW term trading world.  I'm one of the NW mid-marketers now (4 of us total) and I'd like to know in advance how to best work with you, add value, and not be a pain in your ass.  Let me know if this is OK.  You pick the time & place.

Thanks!  
Andrea Woodland
