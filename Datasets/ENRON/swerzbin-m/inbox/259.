Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;
 
We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.
 
John B&Q (it's a long story...but I changed my name AGAIN to match the sponsors name, so that when the commentary team on the TV talk about me....they advertise the sponsors brand!)
