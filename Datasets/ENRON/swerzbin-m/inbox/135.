I called 1-800-297-3276 and navigated thru the automated menu.

Someone came on line and helped me, the confirmed my point balance and and asked me what I wanted to get.  I told them and they did it on the spot.

They also referred me to this website

www.americanexpress.com/rewards

I am not suggesting a course of action, but rather relaying my experience
