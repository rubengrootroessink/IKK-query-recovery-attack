Mike,

I placed the adjusted L/R Balance on the Enronwest site.  It is under the "Staff/Kourtney Nelson".  There are two links:  

1)  "Adj L_R" is the same data/format from the weekly strategy meeting. 
2)  "New Gen 2001_2002" link has all of the supply side info that is used to calculate the L/R balance
	-Please note the Data Flag column, a value of "3" indicates the project was cancelled, on hold, etc and is not included in the calc.  

Both of these sheets are interactive Excel spreadsheets and thus you can play around with the data as you please.  Also, James Bruce is working to get his gen report on the web.  That will help with your access to information on new gen.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback,

Kourtney
