Mike,

Hope everything is going as well as could be expected.  First, I wanted to
ask you for a favor in that we are basically short to you 175 mw of cal 02
cob light and and 100 mw of 03 cob light.  Cob is such a thin market and I
was hoping you might be able to help us out on counterparties who might have
offsetting positions I could bookout with.  Second, we are going to be
looking to expand at the beginnning of 02, our credit is good with just
about everyone now, and we will be looking to hire one or two experienced
people to trade the west, especially one long term guy.  We're obviously not
as big as some shops but we have a very aggressive bonus payout.  Anyway,
something to keep in mind once things get more settled up there for you
guys.  Thanks to you and Bob for the help yesterday booking some of this
stuff out.
