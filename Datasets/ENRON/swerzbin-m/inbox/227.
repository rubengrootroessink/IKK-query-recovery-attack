The stars have aligned to designate Wednesday, October 24, as the day to have our lunch.

Let's meet at Rock Bottom at 11:45 (or we could get all radical and actually leave together from the floor at 11:40) for the celebration.

We could probably figure out how many Kcalories we all burned by riding during September and dedicate ourselves to replacing them at a single sitting!

See you there.





Great work, team--we took the "total number of trips" category for the Bike Commute Challenge.

As a reward, we will be treated to lunch at Rock Bottom, courtesy of Enron, sometime during the month of October.

We need to pick a day when we can all get together for that lunch.

I propose one of the following dates, beginning at 11:45 a.m.:  

		T	W	Th	F

		16	17	18
			24	25	26


Please let me know which of these dates you CANNOT make.  If you have a strong preference about another date, let me know that, too.  The date(s) with the the highest possible attendance wins.

Let me know what your preference is.
