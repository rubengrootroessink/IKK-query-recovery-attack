Dear Parents of Mrs. Blair's Second Graders, 

It is hard to believe that the school year is almost over. ?I hope it has  
been a good year for your child. ?I am emailing everyone about two matters. ? 

The first is the End of Year Party. ?It is on May 25th from 10:00 until  
11:30. ?The format is a baseball game among the classes - the second graders  
will be divided into four teams. ?After the game, we will serve hot dogs and  
drinks. We have five volunteers to "help" but no one has volunteered to 
chair  
it. ?The volunteers are Norm Nabhan, Allison Grove, Karen George, Margaret 
or  
Mike Pierce, Lila Mazzone and Nancy Rybarezyk as sub. ?Does anyone out there  
want to chair this party?  

The second matter is our class gift to Mrs. Blair. ?We will get the three  
second grade teachers gift certificates using the money we collected from 
the  
parents at our class meetings. ?I also think that it would be nice for each  
child in Mrs. Blair's class to write her a letter thanking her for her  
efforts as teacher, telling her what they liked about the class, special  
memories, or anything they want to say. ?I propose that these letters be  
written on 8 X 11 paper and that each one have the child's school picture  
affixed to it. ?If everyone would bring these on the last day of school, we  
can put them in a notebook and present them to Mrs. Blair. ?My idea for the  
notebook is a thin three ring binder with a clear pocket on the front into  
which we can insert a cover page. 

Would anybody volunteer to purchase this book and create the cover page? 
?(If  
not, I will do it, but I am not particularly creative with this kind of  
thing.) ?Please let me know and please have your child write the letter to  
Mrs. Blair. 

Please call me or email me if you have any questions or can volunteer your  
assistance with anything. 

Margaret Pierce
