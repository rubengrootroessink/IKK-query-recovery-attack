   Word of the Day for Friday October 19, 2001:

   extemporaneous \ek-stem-puh-RAY-nee-us\, adjective:
   1.  Composed, performed, or uttered on the spur of the moment,
   or without previous study; unpremeditated; impromptu.
   2. Prepared beforehand but delivered without notes or text.
   3. Skilled at or given to extemporaneous speech.
   4. Provided, made, or put to use as an expedient; makeshift.

    . . .  the  intimate goofiness of an extemporaneous story
     told to a child.
     --Barbara  Tritel,  "What  the Wicked Magician Did," [1]New
     York Times, February 22, 1987

     She  summed  up  the long and complex sessions in an hour's
     extemporaneous   speech   that   was   remarkable  for  its
     organization, pithiness and coherence.
     --"Anna Freud, Psychoanalyst, Dies in London at 86," [2]New
     York Times, October 10, 1982

     In  fact,  his  particular  strength  may  well  have  been
     improvisation,  and  he  may  not  have  been interested in
     committing  the  results of his extemporaneous performances
     to paper.
     --Christoph  Wolff,  [3]Johann  Sebastian Bach: The Learned
     Musician
     _________________________________________________________

   Extemporaneous comes from Late Latin extemporaneus, from Latin
   ex tempore, "out of time," therefore "immediately, at the very
   time  the  occasion  arises."  It  is  related  to  temporary,
   "lasting  for a limited time"; contemporary, "belonging to the
   same  time"  (con-, "with, together"); and tempo, "the rate or
   degree of movement in time."
