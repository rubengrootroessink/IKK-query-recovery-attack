   Word of the Day for Thursday November 22, 2001:

   repletion \rih-PLEE-shun\, noun:
   1. The condition of being completely filled or supplied.
   2. Excessive fullness, as from overeating.

     We  have  to earn silence, then, to work for it: to make it
     not an absence but a presence; not emptiness but repletion.
     --Pico  Iyer,  "The  Eloquent  Sounds of Silence," [1]Time,
     January 1993

     With  distended  belly  and  bursting  waistcoat,  his eyes
     glazed  with  repletion,  he  picks listlessly at his teeth
     with a fork.
     --Kenneth  Rose,  "Madness  of King George's son," [2]Daily
     Telegraph, November 14, 1998

     He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.
     --Jeff  Guinn,  "The  Ghoul, the Bad, the Ugly," [3]Arizona
     Republic, June 7, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Repletion  is  derived  from Latin replere, "to fill again, to
   fill  up,"  from  re- + plere, " to fill." Plenty is a related
   word.
