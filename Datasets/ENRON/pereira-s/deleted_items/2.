   Word of the Day for Monday December 10, 2001:

   autochthonous \aw-TOCK-thuh-nuhs\, adjective:
   1. Aboriginal; indigenous; native.
   2. Formed or originating in the place where found.

     For  cultures  are  not  monoliths.  They  are fragmentary,
     patchworks of autochthonous and foreign elements.
     --Anthony  Pagden,  "Culture  Wars,"  [1]The  New Republic,
     November 16, 1998

     I  thought  of  the  present-day  Arcadians, autochthonous,
     sprung  from  the  very  earth on which they live, who with
     every  draught  from a stream drink up millennia of history
     and legend.
     --Zachary  Taylor, "Hot Land, Cold Water," [2]The Atlantic,
     June 17, 1998
     _________________________________________________________

   Autochthonous  derives  from Greek autochthon, "of or from the
   earth  or  land itself," from auto-, "self" + chthon, "earth."
   One   that  is  autochthonous  is  an  autochthon  (pronounced
   \aw-TOCK-thuhn\).
