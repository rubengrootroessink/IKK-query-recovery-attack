   Word of the Day for Saturday October 20, 2001:

   copse \KOPS\, noun:
   A thicket or grove of small trees.

     A  lit window shone from between the trees below them, then
     vanished  again  as  the car dipped over a ditch and passed
     through a copse.
     --Kate Bingham, [1]Mummy's Legs

     Among the mountains, hills, streams, waterfalls, and little
     copses,  the  child  rejoiced in "savouring the delights of
     freedom" that stimulated his boyish dreams and reveries.
     --Suheil Bushrui and Joe Jenkins, [2]Kahlil Gibran: Man and
     Poet

     They  sang  freely in the copses and thickets round Bohain,
     and in the ruins of the mediaeval castle where he played as
     a boy.
     --Hilary Spurling, [3]The Unknown Matisse
     _________________________________________________________

   Copse derives from Old French copeiz, "a thicket for cutting,"
   from  coper,  couper,  "to  cut."  It  is  related  to coupon,
   literally "the part that is cut off."
