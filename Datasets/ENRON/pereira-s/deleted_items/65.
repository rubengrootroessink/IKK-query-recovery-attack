   Word of the Day for Sunday October 21, 2001:

   ludic \LOO-dik\, adjective:
   Of or relating to play; characterized by play; playful.

     Um,  there's  only  one  problem:  her mother. Who, being a
     substantial executive, has a somewhat different attitude to
     the  worth  of  the  professions  than  her  wastrel, ludic
     husband.
     --Pat Kane, "Pleasing papa," [1]The Guardian, July 11, 2001

     He  is  indeed the outstanding imaginative prose stylist of
     his  generation,  with  an  entirely  recognizable literary
     manner,  fizzy  and playful (I am trying to avoid the words
     "pyrotechnic" and "ludic").
     --Geoffrey  Wheatcroft,  "What  Kingsley Can Teach Martin,"
     [2]The Atlantic, September 2000

     But  within  this  ludic tale there lurks a tragedy of love
     and  loss  that  does  not  lose  its  tenderness even when
     embedded  in  [the  author's] perpetually farcical frame of
     mind.
     --Richard   Bernstein,   "Lalita,   Post-Modern  Object  of
     Desire," [3]New York Times, September 8, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Ludic derives from Latin ludus, "play." Ludicrous, "amusing or
   laughable," shares the same root.
