Susan,

Thanks again for all your help.  This is the first team that I have ever been involved with that had the asst. coaches get to 100% of the practices. Also, thanks for standing in for me when I had to miss the last couple of games. You did a great job. Maybe if we get a Spring team we could exchange places, and you could   take over as the coach.  I would help you out when I could, and maybe Jon could, too.

I hope you,Kali, Renato and Michael have a happy Thanksgiving.

Terry Lester
