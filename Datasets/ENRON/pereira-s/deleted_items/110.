   Word of the Day for Sunday October 14, 2001:

   disquisition \dis-kwuh-ZISH-uhn\, noun:
   A formal discourse on a subject.

     Hence,  although  the  publisher  calls Mr. Roth's work "An
     Essay  on  Evil  in  the Modern World," it will be found to
     differ  materially in approach and manner of treatment from
     the usual disquisition on an ancient topic.
     --Percy   Hutchison,  "That  Old  Arch-Enemy  of  Man,  the
     Antichrist," [1]New York Times, May 12, 1935

     Gore was partial to eye-glazing disquisitions on reciprocal
     trade.
     --Bill Turque, Inventing Al Gore: A Biography

     The  treatises and pamphlets of the late eighteenth century
     about the reform of commerce were considered, very soon, to
     be disquisitions of only limited and technical interest.
     --Emma Rothschild, Economic Sentiments

    . . .  a  rambling  disquisition, with copious historical
     discussion and many anecdotes.
     --James McCourt, Delancey's Way
     _________________________________________________________

   Disquisition  comes  from  Latin disquisitio, from disquirere,
   "to  inquire  into,  to investigate," from dis- + quaerere "to
   seek."   It  is  related  to  inquire  ("to  seek  into")  and
   exquisite,  which  describes  something  that  is "sought out"
   (ex-, "out") because of beauty, delicacy, or perfection.
