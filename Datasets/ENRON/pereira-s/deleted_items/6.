   Word of the Day for Tuesday December 11, 2001:

   gambol \GAM-buhl\, intransitive verb:
   To dance and skip about in play; to frolic.

   noun:
   A skipping or leaping about in frolic.

     I've  been  told  dolphins  like  to gambol in the waves in
     these waters, and that sighting them brings good luck.
     --Barbara  Kingsolver, "Where the Map Stopped," [1]New York
     Times, May 17, 1992

     The  bad  news  is that while most of us gambol in the sun,
     there will be much wringing of hands in environment-hugging
     circles about global warming and climate change.
     --Derek Brown, "Heatwaves," [2]The Guardian, June 16, 2000

     Then they joined hands (it was the stranger who began it by
     catching  Martha  and  Matilda) and danced the table round,
     shaking  their  feet  and tossing their arms, the glee ever
     more  uproarious,  --  danced  until  they were breathless,
     every  one of them, save little Sammy, who was not asked to
     join  the gambol, but sat still in his chair, and seemed to
     expect no invitation.
     --Norman  Duncan,  "Santa  Claus  At  Lonely  Cove," [3]The
     Atlantic, December 1903
     _________________________________________________________

   Gambol,  earlier  gambolde  or  gambalde,  comes from Medieval
   French  gambade,  "a  leaping  or  skipping,"  from Late Latin
   gamba, "hock (of a horse), leg," from Greek kampe, "a joint or
   bend."
