   Word of the Day for Tuesday October 23, 2001:

   embonpoint \ahn-bohn-PWAN\, noun:
   Plumpness of person; stoutness.

     [W]ith  his  embonpoint,  Mr Soames appears to be wearing a
     quadruple-breasted suit.
     --Simon  Hoggart,  "Roll up, roll up, to explore the Soames
     Zone," [1]The Guardian, February 1, 2000

     His  embonpoint  expands by the day and his eyes are buried
     in the fat of his cheeks.
     --Quoted in [2]Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Revolution and
     Renunciation, by Nicholas Boyle
     _________________________________________________________

   Embonpoint  is from French, literally "in good condition" (en,
   "in" + bon, "good" + point, "situation, condition").
