     enemies are likely to redound to our shame.

     September 15, 2001

     Progressive, October 1, 1996

     [T]he  Kemp  Commission  tracked  three  periods of reduced
     taxation  in this century. Each was followed by an economic

     --Mona  Charen,  "You Can't Punish the Rich Without Hurting
     the  Rest  of  Us," [3]St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 25,
     1996

     O'Sullivan  busied  himself  writing would-be contributors,
     outlining  his  plan  for  the enterprise and how its glory

     --Edward  L.  Widmer,  [4]Young  America:  The Flowering of
     Democracy in New York City
     _________________________________________________________

   Redound,  originally "to be in excess or to overflow," derives
   from  Latin  redundare,  "to  overflow,  to be in abundance or
   excess," from re- + unda, "wave."
