   Word of the Day for Wednesday November 21, 2001:

   predilection \preh-d'l-EK-shun; pree-\, noun:
   A predisposition to choose or like; an established preference.

     Wilson  doesn't see any inconsistency between his socialism
     and his predilection for the high life.
     --Marina  Cantacuzino, "On deadly ground," [1]The Guardian,
     March 13, 2001

    ... youth's predilection for revolt.
     --Terry  McCarthy, "Lost Generation," [2]Time Asia, October
     23, 2000

     But  for  him  the  first  rule of judging was to set aside
     personal predilection and vote the law and the facts.
     --Edwin  M.  Yoder  Jr.,  "Lewis  Powell  a  Fine  Sense of
     Balance," [3]Washington Post, June 29, 1987
     _________________________________________________________

   Predilection is literally "a liking before," from Latin prae-,
   "before" + diligere, "to choose; hence to prefer, to like very
   well."
