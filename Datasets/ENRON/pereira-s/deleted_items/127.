I would like to get you all set up with the RAC website (icon above).  This will enable you to see your daily VaR, drill down to VaR by risk type, by month and run VaR scenarios.

This is where we pull in our information for the VaR report we publish each morning, and with this you won't have to wait for us to publish before you can see the numbers.

Everyone has been granted access to the east desk VaR and some of you are already set up with your defaults on the website.

For those who aren't................

Copy this icon to your desktop
Once you enter the site (rac.enron.com) click on "Market Details" on the bottom of the list on the left
The top left box (VaR) will be where you will see the numbers each day
"Edit" to pick your names

below are the names listed for the east desk (this will show you the total east var and break it down by trader)...identical to what we have been publishing 

S_NEAL
C_AMES
BRAWNER
C_GERMANY
J_HODGE
J_HODGE-VNG
P_KEAVEY
B_MCKAY
J_MCKAY2
S_PEREIRA
V_PIMENOV
A_RING
J_TOWNSEND
V_VERSEN
LAVORATO-EAST

Once everyone is set up we will stop publishing the VAR in the morning.

Please ask me or your book admin. if you have any questions.

Thanks

Kam
