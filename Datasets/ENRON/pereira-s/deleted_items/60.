Dear Kidventure Family,

We hope everyone is doing great!  Believe it or not, the holidays are just around the corner and this means Holiday Camp is too!  Winter in Texas is the theme this year and we want to see everyone for this "cool" event.

Attatched to this email is the brochure for Holiday Camp.  Registration will begin at 12 noon on Monday October 29th and will remain open until all spaces have been reserved. Simply log on to kidventurecamp.com or call the office at 713.960.8989. You will have the option of selecting all days or individual ones!

The camp will be highlighted by Kidventure's 2nd Annual Mt. Venture snow day with sledding, snowman contest and much more.  Earlier in the week campers will be part of teams that will design and build bobsleds to be raced on Mt. Venture.  So break out the mittens and ear-muffs and join us for this most memorable holiday event.


Kidventure Team
