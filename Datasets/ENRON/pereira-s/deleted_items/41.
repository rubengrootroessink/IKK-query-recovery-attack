   Word of the Day for Wednesday October 24, 2001:

   idyll \EYE-dl\, noun:
   1.  A  simple  descriptive  work,  either  in poetry or prose,
   dealing  with  simple,  rustic  life; pastoral scenes; and the
   like.
   2.  A  narrative  poem  treating  an epic, romantic, or tragic
   theme.
   3. A lighthearted carefree episode or experience.
   4. A romantic interlude.

     Sheep  are  not  the  docile,  pleasant  creatures  of  the
     pastoral idyll. Any countryman will tell you that. They are
     sly, occasionally vicious, pathologically stupid.
     --Joanne Harris, [1]Chocolat

     From  too much looking back, he was destroyed,... trying
     to  re-create  an  idyll that never truly existed except in
     his own imagination.
     --Gore Vidal, [2]The Essential Gore Vidal

     [S]he  kept  a  diary that poignantly captured the sense of
     youthful  gaiety  shattered by events suddenly intruding on
     their teenage idyll.
     --James  T.  Fisher,  Dr.  America:  The Lives of Thomas A.
     Dooley, 1927-1961

     The Guevaras' honeymoon idyll, such as it was, did not last
     long.
     --Jon Lee Anderson, [3]Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life
     _________________________________________________________

   Idyll  ultimately  derives  from  Greek  eidullion,  "a  short
   descriptive  poem  (usually  on pastoral subjects); an idyll,"
   from  eidos,  "that  which  is seen; form; shape; figure." The
   adjective form is idyllic.
