   Word of the Day for Tuesday October 16, 2001:

   panjandrum \pan-JAN-druhm\, noun:
   An important personage or pretentious official.

     Needless  to  say,  when  governors  and  ministers and the
     panjandrums  of  British  public life asked these appointed
     advisers and those from whose ranks they were largely drawn
     for  their  views  on democratic development, they gave the
     answers that might have been expected.
     --Christopher Patten, East and West

     And   so   I  have  appointed  myself  the  chairman,  High
     Panjandrum,   Grand   Inquisitor--and   sole  member--of  a
     grievance committee of my own making.
     --Alan K. Simpson, [1]Right in the Old Gazoo

   Panjandrum was coined by Samuel Foote (17201777) in a piece of
   nonsense writing:

     So  she  went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make
     an apple-pie; and at the same time a great she-bear, coming
     up  the  street,  pops  its  head  into the shop. "What! No
     soap?"  So  he  died,  and she very imprudently married the
     barber:  and  there  were  present  the Picninnies, and the
     Joblillies,  and  the  Garyulies,  and the grand Panjandrum
     himself,  with the little round button at top, and they all
     fell  to  playing  the  game of catch-as-catch-can till the
     gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots.

   It  was  composed  on  the  spot  to  challenge  actor Charles
   Macklin's  claim  that  he could memorize anything. Macklin is
   said to have refused to repeat a word of it.
