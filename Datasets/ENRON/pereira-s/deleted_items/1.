   Word of the Day for Sunday December 9, 2001:

   foofaraw \FOO-fuh-raw\, noun:
   1. Excessive or flashy ornamentation or decoration.
   2. A fuss over a matter of little importance.

     A somber, muted descending motif opens and closes the work,
     which  is  brief  but  effective.  It  provided much needed
     relief  from the fanfares and foofaraw in which brass-going
     composers so often indulge.
     --Philip  Kennicott,  "Brass  Spectacular is a Spectacle of
     Special  Sound,"  [1]St.  Louis  Post-Dispatch, January 17,
     1997

     After  working  in the news business for a number of years,
     I've  become  a  bit  cynical  about mass-media coverage of
     events like the Y2K foofaraw.
     --Roy  Clancy, "Ready for Y2K...," [2]Calgary Sun, December
     15, 1999

     Making  the Times best-seller list, or a movie, or all that
     other  foofaraw  is  not  necessarily  proof of [a novel's]
     lasting significance.
     --Roger  K. Miller, "'Peyton Place' was remarkably good bad
     novel," [3]Minneapolis Star Tribune, December 29, 1996
     _________________________________________________________

   Foofaraw is perhaps from Spanish fanfarr?n, "a braggart."
