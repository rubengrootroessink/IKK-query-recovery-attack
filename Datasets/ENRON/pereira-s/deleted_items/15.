   Word of the Day for Saturday October 27, 2001:

   tenet \TEN-it\, noun:
   Any  opinion,  principle,  dogma, belief, or doctrine, which a
   person holds or maintains as true.

    . .. the tenet that all men are created equal and seen as
     such by the eyes of God.
     --Kaye Gibbons, [1]On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon

     This kind of tolerance and receptivity is itself a cardinal
     tenet of Enlightenment thought.
     --Gary B. Nash, [2]History on Trial

     Since the 1950s, the central tenet of US foreign policy and
     security  strategy  had  been to "contain" the Soviet Union
     and communist domination and influence.
     --George Bush and Brent Scowcroft, [3]A World Transformed

     The  central  tenet of whig theory was the inevitability of
     progress.
     --William L. Bird, Jr., [4]Better Living
     _________________________________________________________

   Tenet  comes  from Latin tenet "he holds" (something as true),
   from tenere, "to hold."
