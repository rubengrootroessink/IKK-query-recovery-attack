   Word of the Day for Saturday November 17, 2001:

   bibulous \BIB-yuh-luhs\, adjective:
   1.  Of,  pertaining to, marked by, or given to the consumption
   of alcoholic drink.
   2. Readily absorbing fluids or moisture.

     Vineyards  are everywhere, especially when Felix approaches
     Paris,  the  most  populous  city in Christendom -- and the
     most  bibulous  too, since lousy local wine had to be drunk
     before it turned sour in a few months.
     --Eugen  Weber, "Renaissance Men," [1]New York Times, April
     13, 1997

     Ever since the joys of the fermented grape were discovered,
     the  bibulous  have  been  waking  up feeling the worse for
     wear.
     --Sally  Chatterton, "The Daily Website: www.hungover.net,"
     [2]Independent, September 3, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Bibulous comes from Latin bibulus, from bibere, "to drink."
