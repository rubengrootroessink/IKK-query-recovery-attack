   Word of the Day for Wednesday October 17, 2001:

   dulcet \DUHL-sit\, adjective:
   1. Pleasing to the ear; melodious; harmonious.
   2. Generally pleasing, soothing, or agreeable.
   3. (Archaic) Sweet to the taste.

     If  you want to catch up with our most famous songster, the
     nightingale,  just  visit  Minsmere at the end of April, or
     early  May,  and  stand on the edge of the car park. You'll
     soon hear the dulcet tones of the poets' favourite bird.
     --Stephen  Moss,  "Birdwatch," [1]The Guardian, October 23,
     2000

     Amanda . . . rages at her young 'uns in a voice that may
     have been full of dulcet notes when she turned the heads of
     her  gentleman  callers  in  her  youth,  but has now grown
     hard-edged and ringing, like a cracked bell.
     --Hal Hinson, [2]Washington Post, November 11, 1987

     Just  as my eyelids started to get heavy and my brain began
     to  relax  its hold on wakefulness -- bam! -- the less than
     dulcet  tones  of  Britain's  top  breakfast  DJ started to
     emanate from my radio alarm.
     --"Secs in the City," [3]The Guardian, July 30, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Dulcet  comes  from  Old  French  doucet,  diminutive of dous,
   "sweet," from Latin dulcis, "sweet."
