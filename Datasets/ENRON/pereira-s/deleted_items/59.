OK .  The girls got their mission accomplished and they will be treated to ice cream during the 2nd half of practice Wed.
I will bring my Suburban and take them to the Baskin and Robbins in the Randall's Shopping Center at Weslayan and Bissonnet. at about 8pm and you can pick them up there at the regular time of 8:30.

If you will notice they are progressing as a team right in line with what we have been teaching them.. They learned a little individual and team defensive tactics for the lst couple of weeks, so they started holding the oppositions scoring down to reasonable levels.  The last couple of weeks we have  been working strengthening their kicks, on finishing and on working crossing passes.  They have improved in all those areas. They gave us as many thrills as the Yankees on Sunday, so they now will get their just desserts.

I am trying to arrange a makeup for next Sun. and will let you know at practice.
