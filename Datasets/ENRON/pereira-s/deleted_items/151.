   Word of the Day for Tuesday November 20, 2001:

   languid \LANG-gwid\, adjective:
   1.  Drooping  or flagging from or as if from exhaustion; weak;
   weary; heavy.
   2. Promoting or indicating weakness or heaviness.
   3. Slow; lacking vigor or force.

     Deliberately  languid,  slow to rise to a dignified height,
     his  handsomely  graying  wavy hair perfectly combed, Floyd
     sits  most of the day with his long legs sprawled under his
     table.
     --William S. McFeely, [1]Proximity to Death

    . . .  in  the  languid  heat  of Rome, late summer, late
     afternoon.
     --Matthew Stadler, Allan Stein

     With  their  strength,  grace,  and  endurance, [they] move
     about  naturally,  freely, at a tempo determined by climate
     and tradition, somewhat languid, unhurried, knowing one can
     never  achieve  everything  in life anyway, and besides, if
     one did, what would be left over for others?
     --Ryszard Kapuscinski, [2]The Shadow of the Sun (translated
     by Klara Glowczewska)
     _________________________________________________________

   Languid  comes  from Latin languere, "to become faint or weak;
   to droop; to be inactive."
