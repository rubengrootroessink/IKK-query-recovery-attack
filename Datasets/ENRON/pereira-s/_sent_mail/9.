Julie-

Unfortunately, I will not be able to help you  sort recognitions during the
day on Tuesday -- I can't get off work on that  day.? If you are able to
sort our troop's recognitions (troop 12357)  by Tuesday evening, I would
love to come by and pick them up.? Our  last Brownie meeting is on Wednesday
afternoon, and I wanted to get  everything to our troop leader Wednesday
morning before work.? Let me  know what time would be convenient for me to
come by.? I have a  Southside Place city council meeting to attend at 7 pm
but could come by  before.....

Thanks,

Susan  Pereira
