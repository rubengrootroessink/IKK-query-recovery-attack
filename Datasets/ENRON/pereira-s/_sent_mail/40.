Kathy-

I got your message.  Kali has been going to the Thursday practices, with the 
exception of the last three weeks due to rainout, spring break and a going 
away party for a friend.  She'll be there on this Thursday.  Do you have a 
uniform for her?  Maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt 
and has that for the next game.  I'll try to work on her.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
