Thanks.  I had a feeling Laura's gift was the bath bag.  As for the $20 
donation, I'm glad we got it, because we ended up short on the cash collected 
for the cookies.

Laura wrote her name on the tissue paper because she forgot a card. Her gift
was the bath bag with the lip gloss.
Sorry for the confusion. That's great about the cookie sales. Did Karen
George tell you that someone gave us a $20.00 donation as well!
Great job!

Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents
last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in
transit!!).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the
thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set
in a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.

Susan

P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.
