Hi Susan,
    I would think that 2 nights , 3 days is plenty for Rio.  We could arrive
Sunday  see Corcovado, P?o de A?ucar, Tijuca rainforrest, and a few outlying
beaches.  Then late Tuesday afternoon the 10th you and Renato could fly out
for Foz.  Depending on the flight schedules you may have to wait until early
Wednesday morning the 11th. I think that Tuesday would be better so you're
not feeling rushed, but we'll see what flight times are offered.  Spend two
nights at Foz and fly into SP late Thursday evening the 12th.  Hang around
the house on Friday, put your suitcases together and head back for Houston
that evening.
    Too bad you're not able to spend more time here, but given what time you
have I think you'll be seeing the two most interesting places in Brazil. All
of the others, Amazon, Pantanal, Bahia all take so much travel time to get
there that it's not even really worth the attempt to see them.   If you do
decide on Foz, don't mess with packing your coats, it'll be easier to borrow
some of ours.
    The travel agent is looking at fares, etc. so I'll let you know what she
finds.
I'll be in touch.............Jan
