Just want you to know I received and checked your  paperwork.? It's nice to 
get a head start on things, thanks!? I did  not find a T5 - which is OK as 
long as you hadn't turned one in with cash and I  missed it.
?
I did make a minor adjustment which you'll need to  know about when 
distributing the recognitions.? The donated box of cookies  had to be to be 
assigned to a girl, so I gave it to Kendra Muecke.? She  originally sold 49, 
and with the extra box, she is at the level to receive the  patch and face 
stickers. You'll get the extra patch and stickers kit with your  stuff in May.

Julie-

I left my paperwork in the green box at your  doorstep yesterday.? I wanted
to make sure you received it.? I'll  be out of town until March 25, so if
you have any questions, I won't be  able to respond until then.

Thanks,

Susan  Pereira
