Stevens-

Destin does not feel comfortable with volumes yet at your meter.  They are 
waiting for final meter numbers before allocating to our transport contract.  
That should happen some time next week.  We will send you those numbers and 
the prices once we receive the final allocation.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan,

There was a small amount of gas sold from the Kahuna Gas plant in October.
I have spoken with Joe Casa with Enron and he is going to provide volumes.
Can you please provide me the October pricing or give me the name of
someone who can?

Thanks,

Stevens
