We were allocated a total of 7591 mmbtu at the receipt point for November.  I 
think our contract for November is at the average of the Inside FERC  
postings for the three pipes plus a penny.  Those prices are as follows:

Transco Zone 3  $4.51
Florida Zone 3    $4.45
Sonat                      $4.47
Avg                        $4.4767  +  0.01 = $4.4867 

The same transport fee and fuel percentage as last month should be deducted 
from this price.  I think the allocated fuel was 23 mmbtu.
 
Also, keep in mind that we scheduled 31,112 mmbtu per Rebel's directions.  
ENA will have to cash out the difference with Destin (at higher prices!).

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan,

Do you have any idea when we will receive volumes and pricing for the Bazor
Ridge Gas Plant for November?  If I need to contact someone else concerning
these issues please let me know.

Thanks,

Stevens
