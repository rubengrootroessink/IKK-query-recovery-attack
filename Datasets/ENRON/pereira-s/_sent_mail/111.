If the receivable is for ENA, it will have to be settled separately.  Andy 
Ring talks to Koch for day trading.  Maybe she could pursue this.

Is this a receivable for LRC or Enron?

While doing my Accounts Receivable research, I came across two outstanding 
invoice for Koch Enregy totally $2,934.60 from 1997.  Is it too late to 
recoup the money via the settlement agreement?
