Good questions!  The volumes are at the wellhead, so the fuel volumes would 
need to be deducted.  Destin has changed their fuel to 0.003%.  As for the 
prices, the Sonat gas daily prices should be reduced by $0.24 /mmbtu 
transportation.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Susan

Susan,

Please bare with me on these questions.  1)  Do the volumes have the 1%
fuel taken out?
                           2)  Do the prices have the transportation taken
out?

I assume somethings, but a thought best to ask.

Thank you,

Stevens

Susan,

There was a small amount of gas sold from the Kahuna Gas plant in October.
I have spoken with Joe Casa with Enron and he is going to provide volumes.
Can you please provide me the October pricing or give me the name of
someone who can?

Thanks,

Stevens
