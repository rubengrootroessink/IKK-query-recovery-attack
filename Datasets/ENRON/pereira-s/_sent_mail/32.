Dear Mr. Junek-

Per Scott Goodell's advice, I am officially informing you that the CES 
offshore firm contract is now on your book.  Scott thinks that it is 
volumetric, so there should be no impact on you.  The wellhead desk will take 
this over as soon as their pools are set up on Col. Gulf.

Sincerely yours,

Susan (aka "the bitch")
