Thanks for your help.  It sounds like your girl scout outings are a little 
more exotic than ours.  Our last event was an overnight campout in one of the 
girls' backyards.  The girls had a lot of fun.  I was lucky and didn't have 
to volunteer.  Michael got to be an only child for the night and got all the 
attention.  He loves it when Kali spends the night away!!

Talk to you soon.

Susan

Hi Susan,
??? Glad you guys are going to  Foz, I think you'll really enjoy it.? Don't 
worry about giving me your  credit card number, etc.? It will be easier for 
me to pay for it from here  and then you can just reimburse us.? In fact, you 
can give a check to Papi  and he can deposit it for us there.
??? I'm taking the Girl Scouts on  an all day outing today to an indian 
village so I won't talk with the travel  agent today.? However,? I'll call 
her and then tomorrow go by and  finalize everything.? Afterwards I'll send 
you all of the  details.
??? Hope your week goes  well.......give the kids a big hug.
??? Jan
?
PS? Just a reminder to get your visas, I  don't know if you have done that 
already.
???  tchau..........
