Stevens-

I wanted to clarify with you the transportation costs on Destin.  The 
transportation rate is $.24/MMBtu and the ACA charge is $.0022/MMBtu.  This 
should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation 
contract.   The net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for 
redelivery after 0.3% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes 
at the receipt point into Destin.  If you bill us on gross volumes, then you 
must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.2422/mmbtu in 
transportation costs from the pipeline.  From my calculations, deducts from 
gross volumes would be $.258 in Oct., $.2556 in Nov. and $.2602 in Dec.   
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Susan Pereira

Susan,

Do you have any idea when we will receive volumes and pricing for the Bazor
Ridge Gas Plant for November?  If I need to contact someone else concerning
these issues please let me know.

Thanks,

Stevens
