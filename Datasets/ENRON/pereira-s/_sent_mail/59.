Stevens,

Joe put a call into Destin today, but our contact was out.  Once we talk to 
the right person and find out exactly what needs to be done, I think we would 
be very interested in having Rebel draft the letter.  I'll let you know as 
soon as I know...

Susan

Susan,

I have told Rebel that you and I have discussed the BTU issue and the
complaint.  Harvey Petter with Rebel has offered to draft a letter.  Would
this be acceptable for you?  If it meets with Enron's approval it could be
sent by your office.  It might save you and your attorneys a lot of time,
but that is not how you might want to handle it.

Let me know.

Stevens
