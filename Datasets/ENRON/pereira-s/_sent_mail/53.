Margaret-

Renato and I are already signed up to work Kali's class booth and our son's 
class booth--all at different times.  I don't think we'll  be able to help 
all afternoon at one booth, but if something changes I would be more than 
happy to help Mary out.

Dear Second Grade parents, 

Our class booth is the pinata booth and the booth chair is Mary Rothwell. 
?As  
you may know, she is expecting a baby in early April. ?She is still willing  
to run the booth and prepare the pinatas before the fair but will need  
someone to help her that day since she will have her newborn with her. ? 
Duties would begin mid morning with setup and continue until 2:30 or 3:00  
with cleanup. ?During F& F hours from 11:00 - 3:00 her helper would need to  
help run the booth, hanging the pinatas from the tree, collecting tickets,  
etc. ?There are also several parent volunteer hourly slots that have not 
been  
filled - one slot from 1:00 - 2:00 and two slots from 2:00- 3:00. 

Could any of you help with any of this? ?If so, please email me and I will  
let her know. 

Thanks! 
Margaret Pierce 
Room Parent
