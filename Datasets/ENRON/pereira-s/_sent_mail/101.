We will not be settling the El Paso/Stingray imbalance.  El Paso insists on 
being paid back in kind, as opposed to cashing out at prices when the 
imbalance occurred.  We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.  Maybe 
we'll pay it back next year.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

P.S.-  Was new paperwork sent out to Cinergy??
