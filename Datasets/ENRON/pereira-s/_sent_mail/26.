Subject: FW: Project GEM/Windows2000 Deployment Migration


I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system.
 
Along with upgrading the O/S, Enron has also took the initiative to move over 
to Microsoft Outlook2000, for our messaging client.  This will provide more 
flexibility and ease-of-use for e-mail, calendars, contacts -- not to mention 
an easier medium to synchronize data to your handheld devices.
 
I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of 
you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more than 10-15min.  
Profiling can begin as early as tomorrow (4/17/01) - so here is what I ask of 
you:
 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with a date/time that I can stop by.  Being 
that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this 
profiling process should take no more than a few days. ***
 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.



Thank you,

Kacee Downey
