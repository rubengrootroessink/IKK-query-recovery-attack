I generally deal with Kari Dillard at BP.  This particular transaction was an 
intraday deal done on the 6th for flow on the 6th.  I assume it was Kari.

Thanks,

Susan

Susan,

Sitara shows you as the trader for deal # 720519. This is a 04/01 sale on 
TENN leg 800 to BP Energy for 5,000 MMBtu @ $5.32 on day 4/6. BP is not 
showing this deal. Can you tell me who you may have made the deal with at BP, 
so that I may pass the info. to my contact?

Thanks,
Genaro
