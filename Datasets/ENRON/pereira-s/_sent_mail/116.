Leslie-

I was wanting to know what the imbalances are booked at.  Are they all 
mark-to-marketed or valued at some historical pricing?  Also, can you work 
with LIG on the paperwork for settling the imbalance?

Thanks,

Susan

You left me two messages yesterday.  One regarding Louisiana Intrastate 
paying us $3.00/MMBTU for their imbalance on LRP, but I don't remember what 
the other message was regarding.
