Stevens-

We've moved up the food chain at Destin, but have not received a response 
yet.  I'll be out next week.  Check with Joe Casas to see if he hears anything

Susan,

I know you are quite busy with other items, but have you had time to
discuss the BTU protest with the Enron attorneys?  As I told you before,
Rebel would be more than happy to write "the letter", but I believe it will
have to be submitted by Enron as the shipper.

Thanks,

Stevens
