Dave-

There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like 
to see on the website and stack manager.  I realize that there may be bigger 
issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey 
Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??  
For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack 
manager.  Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the 
website, so people could shade products different colors.  This might cut 
down on trades made in error.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
