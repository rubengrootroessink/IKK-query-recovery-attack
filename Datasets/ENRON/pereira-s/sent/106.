Susan,

I have Kali on our list for Sat the 25th. If you can, send a check for $27
and that will move you to the head of the list. Prepaid riders go to an
instructor ahead of "stand-by" riders. If you are unsure about whether or not
Kali wants to ride, wait to pay. There are no refunds or make-ups for prepaid
lessons.
