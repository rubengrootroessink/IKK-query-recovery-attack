Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement 
payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the 
Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement 
from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume 
statement.  

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
