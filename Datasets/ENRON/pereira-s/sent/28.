March avg. + .01 = $5.00
April avg. + .01 = $5.35

Same transport & fuel deductions.

As for the BTU issue, Joe has talked with the Destin people several times 
about it.  They said they were going to get with Kahuna and straighten things 
out.  Joe will call again today.  Sorry about the delay, but we really have 
no control over it.

Susan,

Hello, I hope you are doing well.  Do you have the March pricing for the
Bazor Ridge Gas Plant yet?

Thanks,

Stevens

P S  Do you know anything about the BTU protest yet?
