Hi, Jan!  I don't know if you'll get this, but Maman said your email was back 
in business (my words, not hers!).  I asked the kids about going ahead to 
Brazil with y'all.  Michael will do whatever; Kali was a little hesitant.  
When do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave.  
We'll need to coordinate the travel schedules.  We're going to use OnePass 
miles for at least two tickets, so we'll need to finalize things in early 
April to get seats.

Talk to you soon.

Susan

P.S.-  Happy Birthday early!!
