Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car 
trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and 
including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 
additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few 
weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school 
during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
