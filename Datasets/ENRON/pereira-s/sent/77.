Kathy-

Thursdays at 6:30 will generally work for us; however, on Thursday the 15th 
we unfortunately have a conflict.  Can you send me the list of girls who are 
on the team?  I know Kali is curious whether she knows anyone or not. 

Thanks,

Susan

We finally have our practice time for Spring Soccer! It is Thursday form 
6:30  
until 7:40pm at Pershing on the large field. I understand that there will be  
one other U-8 girls team there with us and that there will be a trainer. I  
think the games may start on Sunday, Feb 18th but that is not confirmed yet.  
But our first practices with be on Thursday, Feb15th! We can't wait to meet  
all of the girls! Kathy Harrison and Roy Pruden

Sorry for delay, it's been real busy.? On the practice schedules, the only 
switch I have made is to put the 2? 7:40 sessions back to 5:30 to 6:30.? 
Assuming they will have smaller attendance, I am asking Nebo to only schedule 
1 trainer for each session.? We will plan on using half of the Pershing 
middle field unless the Pershing Large field is empty. 

See how this works, I am putting this into effect with Nebo's trainers unless 
I hear any objections by tomorrow evening.? Let's plan on charging $40 per 
player for the Spring, no matter how many sessions they attend.? And remind 
them that they can attend any day or session if they miss theirs.? If any get 
too crowded, we'll adjust the trainer situation. 

M? -?? U-6?? 5 teams 30 kids Pershing Large 6:30-7:40?? 2 trainers 
T?? -?? U-7B? 3 teams 18 kids possibly 1 U-8? 7-8 kids? Pershing L 6:30-7:40 
2 trainers 
T? -?? U-8G? 2 teams 20 girls? Pershing Middle 5:30-6:30? 1 Trainers 
W -?? U-6? 2 teams 12 kids U-7 G 4 teams 24 girls Pershing L 6:30-7:40? 2 
Trainers 
Th? -??? U-8G? 2 teams 20 girls? Pershing L 6:30 - 7:40? 2 Trainers 
Th -? U-8 B 3 teams 18-22 boys Pershing Middle 5:30-6:30 1 Trainers 

Thanks, Joe
