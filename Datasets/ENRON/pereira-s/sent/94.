Leslie-

Have you sent any confirmation to El Paso stating our agreement with the 
imbalance and that it has been transferred to ENA?

Susan

Koch has sent payments. LIG said they sent it but that was a month ago, so 
I've followed up and am waiting to hear from Bud Elkins.  That imbalance of 
11,973 due Stingray is correct but is no longer on LRP's books, it's been 
assigned to ENA.  Thanks.

Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement 
payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the 
Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement 
from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume 
statement.  

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
