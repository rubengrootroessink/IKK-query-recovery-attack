David-

If I want to communicate with the other commission members, am I supposed to 
funnel it through you?  If so, I want to find out if anyone is interested in 
setting up a table at the carnival (April 21) to solicit public opinion on 
P&Z issues.  We could set up next to the tree committtee or share a table.  
I'll be at the carnival until about 3 pm; however, I'll be working from 
12-2.  Also, we could solicit public opinion outside the clubhouse on 
election day, May 5.  I could do that anytime before 4 pm.  Anyone else 
interested???

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
