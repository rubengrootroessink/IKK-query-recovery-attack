My understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three IF 
indices + .01 (less transport and fuel) effective November thru February.  

The November price would then be $4.4767 + .01 = $4.4867 less $.2422 less 
0.3% fuel.
The December price would be $5.9967 + .01 = $6.0067 less $.2422 less 0.3% 
fuel.

Please let me know if this is not your understanding.  Also, please keep in 
mind ENA has taken losses on cashing out negative imbalances on this 
production.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
