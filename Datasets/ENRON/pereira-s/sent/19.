Jan-

Looks good.  I'll finalize with Renato when he gets back in town tomorrow.  
We'll email you then.

Thanks for all your help.

Susan

Hi Susan,
??? Went by the travel agent's  today to see what she found for your trip to 
Foz.? I'm still waiting on  some confirmed prices but a strong estimate would 
be between R$1,000 to R$1,300  and depending on the exchange it would be 
between US$500 and US$650 per  person.? The price includes airfare, hotel 2 
nights, complimentary  breakfast all mornings, transport from and to airport, 
english speaking guide  and driver (he also takes you to the Argentina side), 
tours on the Brazil and  Argentina sides, boat tour at the bottom of the 
falls, and a tour of the aviary  of tropical birds of Brazil.? There's also a 
helicopter tour you can take  but it's not included in the price.? This is 
with TAM airline.?  
??? We would stay in Rio Sunday,  Monday and then on Tuesday you and Renato 
would leave Rio around 11am and arrive  in Foz around 2:30 and get to the 
hotel around 3:30.? You would spend all  day Wednesday there and leave 
Thursday at 3:30 to arrive in SP at  5:00PM.
??? When she confirms the prices  I'll send you all the details.? Until then, 
let me know what you think of  this so far.
?
???  Jan
