Julie-

Unfortunately, I will not be able to help you sort recognitions during the 
day on Tuesday -- I can't get off work on that day.  If you are able to sort 
our troop's recognitions (troop 12357) by Tuesday evening, I would love to 
come by and pick them up.  Our last Brownie meeting is on Wednesday 
afternoon, and I wanted to get everything to our troop leader Wednesday 
morning before work.  Let me know what time would be convenient for me to 
come by.  I have a Southside Place city council meeting to attend at 7 pm but 
could come by before.....

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
