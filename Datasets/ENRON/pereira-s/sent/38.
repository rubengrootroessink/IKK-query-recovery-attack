Jan-

I checked the website for the hotels at Foz.  The tourism website is down.  
It looks like  a great place.  I'll have to convince Renato to go (you know, 
he might miss out on working out for one day).  I think the kids might like 
it too.  Did Alexia and Sebastien like it or was it too much walking?  I 
asked my boss about it.  He went with his family when he was living in 
Argentina.  They really enjoyed it.  Can you go ahead and check on flights 
and which hotel to stay at?  The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the 
nicer one on the internet.  I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking 
them there.  Is that right?  Let me know the airline and I'll check here.  I 
guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.  Also, would y'all want to 
go as well?

Thanks for your help.

Susan
