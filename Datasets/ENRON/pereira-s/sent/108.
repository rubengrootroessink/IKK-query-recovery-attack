I reconciled the imbalance between Stingray and LRP, but as to who approached 
who first, I don't remember.  It was my job to resolve all imbalance 
discrepancies on LRP, and then give my findings to commercial.  As I was 
working with Sherryl Cranford at Stingray, she made it clear that they were 
anxious to get the imbalances resolved and settled as well, and that was the 
only imbalance we discussed.  I think Sherryl and I agreed to that imbalance 
sometime in september.  Whether or not they've been asking for the gas back 
since February, I don't know because I didn't deal with LRP companies until 
several months later.

Leslie-

When did we agree with El Paso/Stingray on the 11,973 dth owed to Stingray?  
Have they been asking for this gas back since February?  Did you approach 
them first on settling this?  The reason I'm asking these questions is that 
HPL had a big imbalance due them from an El Paso operated line in Texas.  HPL 
had been asking for the gas back from the beginning and El Paso finally paid 
them back in kind this month.  I do not want to pay Stingray back in kind.  I 
want to pay them Feb. 2000 IF NGPL-LA.

Thanks,

Susan
