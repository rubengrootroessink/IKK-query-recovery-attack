So far you're only the second person who's asked  that, so I expect that I 
can get your troop's things sorted out on the 8th and  you could either come 
during the day to help sort or pick them up that  evening.?? I'm hoping there 
aren't any shortages on T-shirts,  etc.

Julie-

Is there any chance that the recognitions will be  available prior to May 9?
Our troop is having its last meeting before the  summer on the afternoon of
May 9.? Let me know if I can  help.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
