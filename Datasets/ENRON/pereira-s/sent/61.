Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents 
last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in 
transit!!).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the 
thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set in 
a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.

Susan

P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.
