Please take me off your email list for University of Chicago candidates.  I 
have not been involved in any recruiting efforts.

Thanks,

Subject: Chicago Summer Intern Interviews

Hello U of Chicago Recruiting Team,

I am about to bombard you with all of the resumes that have been submitted 
for summer internship with Enron..  We are needing to choose 12 candidates to 
invite, with about six alternates.  We are having two schedules which means 
that will be interviewing 24 people total.  The Career Placement office 
requires that 50% of you list be open for bid, therefore 12 candidates will 
be open.

I am going to forward the e-mails that have the resumes attached. Please 
review and choose 12 invites and 6 alternates.

I am also going to forward the teams commitment to participation as it stands 
so far.

We will be needing 4 interviewers day one and 2 on day two.

Let us try and meet on Tuesday to discuss the resumes.  We need to have our 
choices to the Career Placement Office.  Please let me know what time is good 
for Tuesday.

Thanks -=- Paul L.
