Jan-

I was looking at the wrong week.  Sorry, stress and sleep deprivation are my 
only excuses.  How much time should we spend in Rio?  Should we leave for Foz 
on the 11th?  I just heard about the Cataratas this morning from Scott Neal.  
That was the place he suggested and that sounds great.  I'll work on Renato 
when he gets back in town.  

Thanks,

Susan

Hi susan,
??? Glad to hear that you're  interested in the Foz.? I think it would be a 
great trip for you to take,  although I'm confused about the dates of the 4th 
and 5th.? Don't forget,  the six of us will be in Ilha de Comandatuba for the 
week of June 30 til July  7th.? If we stick to the original schedule we would 
all be getting into  S?o Paulo Saturday the 7th.? The driver would pick up 
you and Renato  and you guys would arrive at the house a few hours before 
us.?  
???? What could easily work  is for all of us to go to Rio on Sunday the 8th, 
spend a few days there and  then, you and Renato could fly directly to Foz 
from Rio and the kids and I would  drive back to s?o Paulo.? You guys could 
then fly into S?o  Paulo from Foz.
??? The hotel I would suggest at  the Foz is the Cataratas.? It's located 
within walking distance of the  falls on the Brazil side and set inside the 
national reserve forrest with all  kinds of walking trails.? They might offer 
a service to get to the  Argentina side of the falls, I'll check into that.? 
If not you just take a  taxi or car service.? 
??? When we went we stayed at  Mabu which had all of these thermal swimming 
pools, large grounds, pond  etc.? It was more for the kids to enjoy.? Our 
kids liked the falls but  after walking on one side of it had no interest for 
the other.........too much  walking.? It would be a nice get-away for the two 
of you I  think.
??? I'll check into flights and  hotels today and let you know what I find 
out.? I haven't heard much about  Hotel Conial Igua?a, I'll see what I can 
find on it here.
??? I'll be in touch  soon..Jan
PS? Let Renato know that just finished  having a workout room built at the 
house.? Also, he can enjoy some great  running in front of the beach while 
you're in Rio --?? so hopefully he  won't suffer too much withdrawal 
!.................have a good  one
