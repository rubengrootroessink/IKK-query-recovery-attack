Subject: Change of P & Z Meeting Date



Susan and John:

Staff would like to reschedule the tentative Tuesday P & Z meeting.

City council members are also set to meet on this date for a elevated
tower/cell tower workshop.

I had envisioned a 30 minute meeting with P & Z members to finalize the last
remaining item (driveway distance from right-of-way) at the Tuesday meeting
before council's workshop.

However, I have since received a letter and sketch from CenterAmerica
concerning the demolition of Weiner's.  CenterAmerica is proposing a 3 to 4
story development consisting of retail on the first floor and a self-storage
facility on the remaining floors.

Staff would like to begin discussion with P & Z on this CenterAmerica
proposed project.

Would you be available on either Wednesday (February 7) or Thursday
(February 8) at
7:00 P.M. for a longer meeting?
