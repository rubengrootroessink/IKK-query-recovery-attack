The only info I had from you is that we owed ProEnergy 11,035 mmbtu.  I asked 
you if we had any other outstanding imbalances with Cinergy or its 
precursors.  You gave me the Onyx volume, but I had already negotiated the 
deal.  Whose imbalance is the 10,644 mmbtu??

Daniel Kieran with Cinergy/Producer's Energy called me because he wanted 
clarification on something in the contract.  He thinks were forgetting about 
the imbalance due LRP of 10,644.  I thought you said the reason the price was 
so low was because that imbalance had been taken into consideration, so in a 
sense we are netting the two.  Is this correct?  Also, was the Oryx imbalance 
of (770) taken into consideration in the agreement below?

Cinergy has agreed to settle the imbalance of 11,035 mmbtu owed them at 
$1.77/mmbtu.  Please prepare the paperwork showing us paying them $19,531.95 
to clear this imbalance.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

p.s.- you can just address the letter to Daniel Kieran
