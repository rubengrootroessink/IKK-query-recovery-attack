Hi, Jan!  I hope you are all doing well.  I'm sorry to hear that your mother 
is ill.  I'm sure it's frustrating to be so far away.  

I know you have other things on your mind right now, but I wanted to check 
with you about our visiting this summer.  We were thinking about the second 
week in July.  We have not made any definitive plans.  Let me know if that 
will work.  If this summer doesn't work, we can always try next summer...

Take care.

Susan
