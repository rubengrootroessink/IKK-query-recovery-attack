In the past, Jesse would let me know about our imbalance and cashout price.  
He would do the paperwork and trade out of the imbalance with another party.

Susan, Are you interested in imbalance trading for VGS?

Brenda,
Victor and I totally agree with you.  With the increase of wellhead 
production and swings that we are seeing, we are totally revisiting the way 
we handle wellhead.  Beginning with March we will be taking a closer look at 
what our production is doing and will enter appropriate cash out tickets on 
Venice.  

Just to let you know, we are going through the process of looking at wellhead 
production on all our pipes and at what is the best method to handle.

Venice invoices for cashout on a one month lag.  The February invoice cashed 
out the January  volume of <19,385> at $6.8121 for a total credit of 
$132,052.55.  The imbalance for February production is  <4455> and to trade 
the imbalances, VGS must be notified in writing on or before the 25th of 
March.

There are no cashout tickets for VGS on the CPR cashout reports that I ran 
for January and February production.  From looking back at several months of 
invoices, we appear to get cashed out every month.  Would it be possible to 
have cashout tickets entered for VGS?

If you have see any problems with the imbalance volumes reflected on the 
invoice, please let me know. 

Thanks,
Brenda
