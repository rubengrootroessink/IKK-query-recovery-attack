Leslie-

We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way:

We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50.
Koch owes us 13,639 mmbtu at $2.21/mmbtu and 11,720 mmbtu at $2.38/mmbtu, 
which equals $58,035.79.
The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I negotiated this with Scott Garrison 
at Koch.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
