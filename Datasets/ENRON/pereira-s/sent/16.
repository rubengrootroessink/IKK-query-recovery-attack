That sounds great!!  We're looking forward to the trip as well.  The kids are 
anxious to have Alexia and Sebastien here to play with.  I don't know if 
there are any activities in particular that Alexia and Sebastien want to do, 
but I know Kali and Michael would be happy just to play at home and swim.  
Mayba a movie or two.  By the way, we just saw Spy Kids for the second time.  
If it's playing down there, you ought to take the kids.  Alexia will 
especially enjoy it.

See you soon.

Love,

Susan

Hi Susan,
??? How's it going?? I  firmed up everything with the travel agent 
yesterday.? I still don't have a  price to give you because the hotel hasn't 
set one yet for the ground portion  (that's life in Brazil!), but it will be 
somewhere in the range that I had said  earlier.? 
??? Everything is all set and  reserved, and as soon as we have a price I'll 
purchase them.? So for the  time being don't worry about writing a check and 
I'll get back with you when  it's all finalized.? I'm really looking forward 
to having the kids return  with us and having you guys come down...it's going 
to be a lot of  fun!
??? Talk with you  soon..............Jan
