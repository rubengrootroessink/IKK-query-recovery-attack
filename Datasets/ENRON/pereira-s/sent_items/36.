Could not agree more and carried that argument during the meeting in
which the proposed plans were presented at Council.  Other than Marilyn
Griffin, I received no vocal support or indications of such from the
other members including the mayor.  I hope your comments are sent to
them as well.

I would also encourage you to closely examine the proposed changes to
Colonial Park (a nuance transformation from a Community Park to a
Neighborhood Park) and cost.

With the YMCA coming into city ownership next year, there should be no
problem with INDEFINITELY postponing construction at Colonial Park until
youth activities currently ongoing at Colonial can be transferred to the
YMCA.

thanks,

mike
