Laurie-

No. I have not put a new ticket in the system.  I wrote up a paper ticket and Alejandra Chavez adjusted the term  of the existing sitara ticket.  I'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled.  You might check with Alejandra and Kam Keiser.  Apparently, we've had some similar deals with other counterparties.  The NYMEX desk people told me that Credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds.  Do you have any instructions concerning this, given our current financial situation??

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan, I just got an invoice from Superior for the unwinding of the Sonat trigger deal.  The invoice covers production months 12/01 through 08/02 and is for $3,761,900.00.  Have you put something in the system for this?

Thanks
