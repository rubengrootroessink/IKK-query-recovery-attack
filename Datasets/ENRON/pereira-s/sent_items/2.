Subject:	TGT - Cashout Pricing Rejected by FERC

I wanted to let you know that the filing by Texas Gas Transmission to use GAS DAILY pricing for cashout  was REJECTED by FERC.    So please disregard the cashout information that was included on the PIPELINE SUMMARY you received at our meeting last Monday.
TGT submitted another new filing which proposes using weekly averages in Natural Gas Week and also proposes changing the tiers.  TGT wants to implement this retroactive to October1st.   Numerous entities have filed oppositions to this proposed TGT tariff change.     So at this time,  the method to be used by TGT for cashouts is uncertain.   
I will let you know when a cashout methodology gets final approval by FERC.
