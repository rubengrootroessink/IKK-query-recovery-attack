I expect us to file bankruptcy today or tomorrow.  We will likely be defaulting on a lot of our December business.  There are some last ditch efforts going on, but I'm not very hopeful.  If we file bankruptcy, I think we'll all get at least 60 days pay.  There were supposed to be layoffs this week anyway.  I guess those will happen.  I don't know.  They may wait until we file bankruptcy and see what the bankruptcy court judge wants the company to do first.  Stay tuned....

Thinking about you!
