Let me know if your payment doesn't look right.

I think we've got the prices right in our system now.

   Susan,

   I don't know if you have talked to Tricia Troung since you left me a
   message Friday.  I agree with what you said, the average of the three
   prices, plus $.01.  However the invoice, which Tricia says is what's in
   the
   "system"  pays us on each of the prices(three different prices), for
   different volumes.  Not equal volumes,  but  a graduated scale.

   Thank you,

   Stevens
