Hi, Connie!  

The trading groups (the ones that used to make all the money) are still working full days.  We're trying to trade, but our number of counterparties decreases daily.  I don't know if we'll make it through the next week.  They are laying off people this week, so I hear, in other groups.  I don't know who has been notified.  We may all be walking out the door soon.

As for the kids, Yes, Kali still believes in Santa Claus.  I don't know if she knows and is not fessing up!  We'll be here in Houston for Christmas.  Give us a call when you get here; we'd love to see you.  

Thank goodness I already bought the kids' Christmas gifts.  They haven't written their lists yet, though.  

We went to a dude ranch in Bandera, TX for Thanksgiving weekend.  The kids had a blast and want to go back next year.  

I guess I'll be updating my resume this weekend.  It looks pretty bleak.

Talk to you soon.

Susan

hey Susan,

How is it going this week?  I heard that people are mostly sitting around
during the morning then going to bars in the afternoon...or is that just in
the London office?  Are people even coming into the office?  Heather Kendall
said she will be let go just before Christmas.  I can't believe how they are
laying people off just before Christmas, the whole scenerio is like a bad
movie.  She's coming to visit this week, so maybe we can cheer her up with
some Christmas shopping in Rothenburg, it's an adorable little mid-evil town
that has the greatest Christmas decoration stores ever...and they are open
year round.  We took Julie there when she was here a couple of weeks ago.

How are the kids doing?  Does Kali still believe in Santa Claus?  We are
going to spend Christmas with Melissa and family.  Christmas is just not
much fun without children to watch.  Armin needs a vacation, well we both
do.  We leave on Dec 21 and CAN'T WAIT TO GO!  Are ya'll staying home for
Christmas?

Well, just wanted to check on you!  Take care...connie
