Dear Mr. May-

I am writing to request that West U postpone the planned work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls (ages 6-8) involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in the park from February through May every year.  WUSA would have a very hard time finding a replacement field at this late notice, especially anything close to West U.  What harm would it do to delay the City's plans until the summer?  West U prides itself on being a city focused on community and families.  What's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to practice on public park space??

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira
