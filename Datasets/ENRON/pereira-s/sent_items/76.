Hi, Connie!!  Sorry I didn't get back to you on Friday.  Things got busy. =
=20

The stock is still going down, but not as much.  It's at $13.92 right now, =
yippee!!!  I'm hoping all the skeletons are out of the closet now.  I guess=
 I'll be working another 5 years or so -- I don't think the stock will get =
back to $45 or $50 until then.  There aren't any new businesses for Enron t=
o get into to make the stock analysts excited.  All the money we're making =
in trading is apparently not doing it for them. =20

Who knows what will happen to the executives who are still here?  It might =
be hard to get a concrete case against them.  I'm sure some of them are in =
the same boat as the rest of us.  Oh, news flash....ENE $13.80.....I think =
Wall Street wants Ken Lay's head on a platter.  I'm sure the stock analysts=
 are really frustrated that Jeff Skilling isn't here anymore --- they would=
 have gutted him.  Old Skilling is just grinning in his new River Oaks mans=
ion.  I think I would gut him if I crossed paths with him.  I think I shoul=
d sign up for anger management classes. =20

As for my car purchase.... yes, I traded in my Land Cruiser for a Toyota Se=
quoia.  I got a really good deal on my trade-in and paid cash for the balan=
ce.  Two days later, Renato found out from his new boss that Renato's posit=
ion was superfluous.  This boss is the only Entergy guy to survive the Ente=
rgy-Koch trading merger.  They put him in between Renato and his former bos=
s, and this guy decided that they didn't need both of them.  Entergy-Koch i=
s so small that there aren't any other comparable positions open.  The guys=
 working for Renato are sick about it.  The upper management at Entergy-Koc=
h has done a review of this Entergy guy since he told Renato to take a hike=
 ---everyone, peers and employees, told management in the review process th=
at the guy was a two-faced loser with zero personality. Of course, now, Ren=
ato has already signed off on his settlement agreement; plus, he'd never co=
nsider going back.  They are paying him through the end of the year and ves=
ting him in all the savings plans.  They are also paying him a year's salar=
y, and he's currently doing a consulting job for the pipeline.  He's been a=
ctively looking for a new job.  Hopefully, he'll find one, or I'll be worki=
ng until I'm 70!!

Oh, well.  Maybe I'll have some good news next time.....

Susan

Dear Susan,

That's just INCREDIBLE!  Is the SEC investigating all of the execs that
left?  Scott had said that they were all just crooks, but I didn't know if
maybe his opinion was a little tainted, guess it wasn't.  Julie hasn't said
much at all about anything either, just that it's not the same place
anymore.  I am so sorry for all of you with those worthless options!  What
is Lay saying he's going to do to fix this and moral???  I'm sure everyone
is ready to leave.  How did it get so bad so fast?!  Just incredible. I sur=
e
hope things are going better where Renato is working!

So, did you buy you a new SUV, you wrote that you were thinking about it.
We need something like that so bad.  We have a car that's more for sporting
around in than using in everyday use.  The problem for me here though is
parking, I HATE PARKING IN EUROPE!  So I couldn't handle anything very big
either.  I actually love those little "Smarts" have you seen them, I doubt
that they have any in the states, they are a little 2 seater but it has mor=
e
space in the back for shopping than our BMW does in it's trunk. AND IT'S
GREAT FOR PARKING! But all that has to wait until we get this house finishe=
d
and figure out if we are making any money in this business, being it's our
first year and Armin's parents made us take the business without EVER seein=
g
a balance sheet.  All I can say  so far, is that we are paying our bills an=
d
eating good!

Hope you have a good weekend, you need it I'm sure after this week.  Tell
Renato hello for me.

Take care,
Connie
