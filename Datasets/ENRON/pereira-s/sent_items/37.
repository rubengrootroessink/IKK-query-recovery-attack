Dear Ms. Griffin-

I would like to request that West U postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 neighborhood girls involved in West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park February through May every year.  It will be difficult for WUSA  to find an alternative site on such short notice, especially near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months?  West U prides itself on being family- and community-minded; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira
