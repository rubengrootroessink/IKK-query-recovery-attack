Laurie-

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan, this the order that Superior says the August deals should be filled in.  Can you please review the email below with the spreadsheet I sent earlier and let me know.

Thanks

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354
Baseload:  	2,000/day    @ $3.10     ENA Deal # 939542
Swing:   		      @ GDA      ENA Deal # 939300

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

Jenna

Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not
right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to
get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.
I'll let you know what I find.
