Dear Susan,

That's just INCREDIBLE!  Is the SEC investigating all of the execs that
left?  Scott had said that they were all just crooks, but I didn't know if
maybe his opinion was a little tainted, guess it wasn't.  Julie hasn't said
much at all about anything either, just that it's not the same place
anymore.  I am so sorry for all of you with those worthless options!  What
is Lay saying he's going to do to fix this and moral???  I'm sure everyone
is ready to leave.  How did it get so bad so fast?!  Just incredible. I sure
hope things are going better where Renato is working!

So, did you buy you a new SUV, you wrote that you were thinking about it.
We need something like that so bad.  We have a car that's more for sporting
around in than using in everyday use.  The problem for me here though is
parking, I HATE PARKING IN EUROPE!  So I couldn't handle anything very big
either.  I actually love those little "Smarts" have you seen them, I doubt
that they have any in the states, they are a little 2 seater but it has more
space in the back for shopping than our BMW does in it's trunk. AND IT'S
GREAT FOR PARKING! But all that has to wait until we get this house finished
and figure out if we are making any money in this business, being it's our
first year and Armin's parents made us take the business without EVER seeing
a balance sheet.  All I can say  so far, is that we are paying our bills and
eating good!

Hope you have a good weekend, you need it I'm sure after this week.  Tell
Renato hello for me.

Take care,
Connie
