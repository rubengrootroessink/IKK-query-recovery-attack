Hey Missy,

Sorry we missed your call last night.  I was not home and Todd was up to his eyeballs in cleaning up a plumbing problem that we had and still have at our house.  Boy, was I glad I was gone last night.

Alice had invited me to go to a gala that her book club put on last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice, but long.  They featured the poetry and readings of Thomas Melancon.  Have you hear of him, he was there, very good, although I am not a "poetry kinda sistah", but it doesn't cost much to be considerate and supportive of other folks' passion.  Anyway, it was sooooo much fun getting all dressed up, the attire was semi-formal.  When I got dressed and came out of the bedroom, Jordan goes "Oooohhhhh Mommy, Todd says nothing......needless to say Jordan made my evening.  He is really going to be the kind of guy that looks out for his Mom.

As far as Todd goes, I'm trying so hard, I remember you saying "be still" and I have been, but boy it gets hard sometimes.  Alot of times, I feel so confident about breaking out of my own, after all, it could not be much different.  Sometimes my mind says do it now, since the stock markets are down and I am broke at this time (laugh).  Anyway, I'm semi-cool.

What's up with you?  Any more phone calls from Mr. Yoga?  I heard it's supposed to be cool, weatherwise, for you guys over the next couple of days.  When I went over to your Dad's house, Nell said that you had your hard "pressed" for the wedding.  Are you still wearing it "pressed"?  You go girl!

See ya!

Hi:

Sorry.  I got the message, but I've been running for the last week.  The divorce is almost final....I am DIVORCED !!!! YEAAAAAHHH.

I WON SOLE CUSTODY OF THE GIRLS ....YEAAAHHH.

But since Reggie is representing himself, after three hours, we ran out of time.  So we will resume the trial on 10/25, and we will argue over the value of the house, the stuff in the house, and decide how much I have to pay him.  You know I have every little receipt I could find so that it reduces this amount.  But, the final decision on division of the home is up to the judge.  The child support amount will be determined too.

It really doesn't matter, the judge wants the kids to be in the house, and the most important thing, is that I will make all parenting decisions with regard to the children.

Since then, it's been crazy at work, then I was on the program committee for the annual conference of a professional organization that I belong to.  The meeting was here in Chicago, so I spent the weekend and Mon and Tues. socializing with that group.

My "church" girlfriend stook me out for drinks last Friday, and I've been partying ever since.  Patrice, I didn't know how much of a burden that man was to me until that judge said "your divorced effective immediately".
I haven't been this happy since I was in college.

And guess what.....don't tell anyone, I haven't even told my sister or mother this....my yoga instructor asked me for my phone number on Saturday, and actually called me Sunday.  He's 41, divorced , has an undergraduate degree in biology and has the tightest ass you've ever seen.  But, he's short and has a gold tooth.....(and he probably really likes white girls).

that's enough for now.  I got to get some work done.  Talk with you soon.  Robyn

Hey girl,

How are you?  I hope everything is well with you and the girls.  I was
hoping to hear from you this past weekend.  We called and left a message
this past Sunday.  You've kinda got me worried.

I enjoyed visiting with Uncle Charlie and Nelle last week.  It was nice to
see Rayvn as well, she's so cute!  Thanks for the suggestion.  That worked
out well for me.

As for me, everything is going okay for me, I'm just in a mellow mood, just
hangin tough.

Write back!

   Subject:  RE: Hey

   You sound good.  I'm glad you made it home safely.


   Here are the numbers:
   708-216-8395 (w)
   708-386-3558 (h)
   630-293-0293 (dad's)

   yes the wedding was beautiful.  I didn't think it was going to happen.
   Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not
   going to make it. He wanted to postpone, Nell was concerned about losing
   money (girl...I was on Steve's side, and could not belief they were
   worried about the cost of flowers and the cake).......however, Steve has
   two blessings in his best men. He spoke with them  (one from Spokane,WA
   and the other from Montana.  They drove in to Chicago to be with him. 30
   hours straight through. He was so happy on Saturday, because they got
   there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday.

   Everything else went off without a hitch, but Karen didn't stop shaking
   until they cut the cake. (I think she needed a cigarette).

   Of course Jordan is doing well.....he's a Thurston, with all there good
   and bad traits.......intellect runs large, conduct however is
   questionable.

   I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff.

   I'm attaching a special message, that I'll send to Todd separately.

   One suggestion (if you don't mind),  come to an agreement on how to
   disciple the children. Kids will play you, even at Jordan's age.  This
   will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd.

   Love, Robyn

   So good to hear from you!

   Yes, I did drive back to Houston.  I was there on Monday, went to the
   conference in Lincolnshire, went to dinner Monday night, got up Tuesday,
   drove to the conference, and all hell broke loose at that point.  Total,
   total chaos, I was so frightened.  The group said we're driving back to
   Houston, once they announced that all airports were closed!  21 Hours to
   get back, but I Thank God we made it back, and none of us were in harm's
   way.

   One of my close co-worker's father just happened to be in New York at
   the
   World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday, and has been presumed to
   be
   dead.  It is just a crying shame!  Also, the impending war.....did you
   ever
   think you would see this in your lifetime?

   Incidents of this kind really show you that"tomorrow's never promised".
   I
   will be back in the Chicago area real soon, more than likely the first
   or
   second week in October.  I'm really skeptical about flying, but what do
   you
   do?

   How was the wedding?  I know it was beautiful!

   I'm taking care of myself and living my life.  I do what I can, if Todd
   wants to participate, I'm glad to have him, but if not, me and the boys
   roll....we can't wait around.

   Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school, he's received
   very
   good conduct grades recently, and the teacher says he at the top of his
   class, as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff.

   Talk to you later!

   Love Patrice

   P.S.  Please e-mail me your work, and home number, as well as Uncle
   Charlie's...I need to program these into my cell phone, so that I have
   them
   at all times, when I'm in the city.

      Hey:

      How are you?  I saw Lonnie at Karen's wedding.  He said you drove
   back
      to Houston.  I hope you are taking care of yourself. How are the
   boys?
      Love,
