Hi Pat,


As we discussed the pricing for December, 2001 will be as follows (all prices are estimates at this time and will follow the direction of the NYMEX):

For Enron to perform full balancing, this means if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 2,000 MMBtu/d or if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 500 MMBtu/d..... the price will be  an estimate of $3.10 per MMBtu for December, 2001




For Enron to perform the service, just as we are currently doing for November, 2001, whereby you buy or sell the difference at a Chicago Gas Daily price.....the sales price for a baseload quantity (you select your quantity up to 1,500 MMBtu/D) will be an estimate $2.85 per MMBtu/d.


As I stated above, all the prices listed above are estimates.  As of this date, Enron will need to receive a pre-pay on the above listed deals.

Please call so that we may discuss.

Thanks




P.S.  The burns are as follows:

Date		MMBtu/d

11-12		  581
11-13		1876
11-14		1287
11-15		1180
11-16		1038
11-17		  690
