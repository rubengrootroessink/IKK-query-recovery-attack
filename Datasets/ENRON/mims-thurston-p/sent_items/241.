Patrice,
	Kaztex is saying that deal #1074625 should be at the flat gas daily price of $1.87, and that deal #1074647 should be at gas daily + 0.01 or $1.88.  Can you please either confirm that our prices are correct, or change them to match Kaztex's prices?  Please let me know as soon as possible - I need to get this finalized today.  Thank you!!!
