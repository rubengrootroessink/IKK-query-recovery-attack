Hi Bob,  

Per our conversation this a.m., here are the notional sales prices for Nicor City Gate deliveries for the following:

Five Year Price out of January, 2004	=	$3.67 estimate

Ten Year Price out  of January, 2004	=	$.3.92 estimate

(Please keep in mind that these are ESTIMATES!!)

If you need these prices further broken out by year, please call me.  I will also forward the ISDA and Long Term Gas Purchase Agreement to you early next week.

Thanks

Patrice



P.S. You forgot to answer my question regarding what financial entity you would be trading under,  is it Corn Products International?  Write back, because I need this information for the contracts, etc.
