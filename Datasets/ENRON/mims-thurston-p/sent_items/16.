Hi Jimbo,  how are you?

You can tell that we're real busy at the present as evidenced by my timely response.  In answer to your question, we are still in a holding pattern.  We don't have much information, other that the same information that you see.  I would like to say yes, I have a new employer, but it seems a little too early as of yet.  Keep pulling for me, I need all the help I can get.

See ya!

So are you working for Netco now, part of UBS?
