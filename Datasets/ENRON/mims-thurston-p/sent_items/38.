Jesus,

Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.  It is 25 MMBtu/d day, May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.

Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.  The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.



Thanks
