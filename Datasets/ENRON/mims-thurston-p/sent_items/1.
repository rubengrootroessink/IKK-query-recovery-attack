Hi Griff,

Here is the contact information for Edison Mission Marketing and Trading and Nicor Gas Company.  I still need to provide info on IdaCorp, but IdaCorp has requested that all credit arrangements be put in place prior to receiving any documentation from UBS.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. Can you let me know when these customers have received the packets?
