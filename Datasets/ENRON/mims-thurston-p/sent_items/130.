Hey girl,

What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could=
 have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I h=
ad a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they ha=
d their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice=
, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00.  =
The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45. =
 I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms Thang =
felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal a=
ttire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, =
and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by desi=
gn, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that I bought set it of=
f so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore my rhinestone cho=
ker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, =
but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show al=
l my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When I came out of the b=
edroom after getting dressed, Jordan said "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Ma=
de my evening.  Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word.  But I fe=
lt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those=
 come out (smile). =20

We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd sai=
d the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, b=
ut it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was w=
ondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's b=
ack in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get=
 a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home u=
ntil around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mar=
t.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.  Ri=
ght now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All w=
e do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, ind=
ependent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new=
 environment.

Oh well, talk with you later!

Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her report
card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into sickness.
I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but she
still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The 4th
grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up in
prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that she's dumb
and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a letter last
night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's not.
She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt me so
bad.

Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The best
thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

How's the school search going for Jordan?
