Good morning Elizabeth,

Would you please check with the trader on the above deal. I don't know why, but my contact at Detroit Edison swears this invoice is not there's. Please verify with the trader WHO this deal was done with. Then, the trader may have to call this woman over there or his/her contact at Detroit Edison to get this thing handled and paid. 

Thanks!
