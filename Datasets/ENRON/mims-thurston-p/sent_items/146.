Hi Melba,


We need to have a couple of new physical products set up as soon as you can.  They are:

2) PGLC/NGPL (Non-Pool) = The interconnection between The Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Pin No. 909285)

3) NBPL/Peoples/MANHTN = The interconnection between The Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company and Northern Border Pipeline Company located in Cook County, Illinois (Meter No. 81)



Please let me know when these products can be activated.  Thanks
