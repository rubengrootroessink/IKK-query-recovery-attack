Just a FYI---Recent developments---there is a slim chance that you may here from Tony Conway or Donnell in the near future trying to be nosey about me and Lonnie...please keep everything on the downlow.  As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)

I hope we can roll tonight so I can fill you in, I have a 5:30 hair appointment, so I'll be leaving at 4:50 so let me know.
