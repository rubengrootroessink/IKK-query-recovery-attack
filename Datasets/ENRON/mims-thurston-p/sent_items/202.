Hi Robyn,

How are you?  I hope everything is working out well for you.  I know you had to go back to court last week and I was wondering how that went for you.  Everything here is the same.  The boys are still being "the boys".  They're alot of fun.  Todd is still being Todd.  Although I must say, I think he's getting a little concerned regarding my somewhat "cavalier" attitude.  Nothing seems to really bother me that much any more, because I've made some resolutions in my own mind that work for me.  I guess I better start fussing at him more to get him back on track (not).

I thought for a moment that I might be visiting Chicago again real soon and even contemplated spending the weekend to do some shopping on Michigan Avenue, but I don't know now.  Our company, in case you haven't heard, is really going through.  Out senior management allegedly was involved in some "suspect" deals and joint ventures that have cost this company dearly.  We are suddenly finding ourselves going from hero to zero in a "heartbeat".  Last year around this time, Enron's stock was trading at $85 plus and right now our stock is trading at $11.29.  Just since news of this scandal came out a week and a half ago  (we took a $1 billion third quarter write-down), we've come down  from $30 to $11 (roughly speaking).  It hurts, and it appears that it's all because of 5 or 6 senior level executives.  If this company survives this, it will truly be a miracle.  Pray for me and pray for Enron.

How are the girls doing?  I know they're doing fine.  How's Cecelia?  Tell her we said hello.  How's Uncle Charlie?  Any word when Grandpa Thurston is moving down or is that still on hold?   I know Todd talks to Sherry alot, so I know she's doing fine.  How's the yoga instructor?

I attended the Harlem Dance Theater Production lasts Friday night with a girlfriend.  Interesting, although, I found out I really don't have an appreciation for that ballet "thang".  I was hoping for more "sho nuff" modern dance.  It was interesting, but now worth the $50 I spent.  My girlfriend and I went to a club afterwards....what an experience!  I'm glad I'm not into that scene anymore..rough life!  We stayed a couple of hours and came on home.

The same girlfriend kept the boys overnight on Saturday night and I actually had a free day to myself from about 3:30 that afternoon until I got out of church the next day.  Boy, what a good friend.  Todd was in Austin this weekend, so I was totally free.  I ended up shopping for an hour or so, and came home all excited about watching a good movie on Lifetime, and fell right to sleep.  Didn't wake up until 11:00 p.m.  Oh well, I enjoyed myself regardless.

Talk to you soon!

Love ya!

You sound good.  I'm glad you made it home safely.


Here are the numbers:
708-216-8395 (w)
708-386-3558 (h)
630-293-0293 (dad's)

yes the wedding was beautiful.  I didn't think it was going to happen.  Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not going to make it. He wanted to postpone, Nell was concerned about losing money (girl...I was on Steve's side, and could not belief they were worried about the cost of flowers and the cake).......however, Steve has two blessings in his best men. He spoke with them  (one from Spokane,WA and the other from Montana.  They drove in to Chicago to be with him. 30 hours straight through. He was so happy on Saturday, because they got there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday.

Everything else went off without a hitch, but Karen didn't stop shaking until they cut the cake. (I think she needed a cigarette).

Of course Jordan is doing well.....he's a Thurston, with all there good and bad traits.......intellect runs large, conduct however is questionable.

I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff.

I'm attaching a special message, that I'll send to Todd separately.

One suggestion (if you don't mind),  come to an agreement on how to disciple the children. Kids will play you, even at Jordan's age.  This will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd.

Love, Robyn

So good to hear from you!

Yes, I did drive back to Houston.  I was there on Monday, went to the
conference in Lincolnshire, went to dinner Monday night, got up Tuesday,
drove to the conference, and all hell broke loose at that point.  Total,
total chaos, I was so frightened.  The group said we're driving back to
Houston, once they announced that all airports were closed!  21 Hours to
get back, but I Thank God we made it back, and none of us were in harm's
way.

One of my close co-worker's father just happened to be in New York at the
World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday, and has been presumed to be
dead.  It is just a crying shame!  Also, the impending war.....did you ever
think you would see this in your lifetime?

Incidents of this kind really show you that"tomorrow's never promised".  I
will be back in the Chicago area real soon, more than likely the first or
second week in October.  I'm really skeptical about flying, but what do you
do?

How was the wedding?  I know it was beautiful!

I'm taking care of myself and living my life.  I do what I can, if Todd
wants to participate, I'm glad to have him, but if not, me and the boys
roll....we can't wait around.

Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school, he's received very
good conduct grades recently, and the teacher says he at the top of his
class, as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff.

Talk to you later!

Love Patrice

P.S.  Please e-mail me your work, and home number, as well as Uncle
Charlie's...I need to program these into my cell phone, so that I have them
at all times, when I'm in the city.

   Hey:

   How are you?  I saw Lonnie at Karen's wedding.  He said you drove back
   to Houston.  I hope you are taking care of yourself. How are the boys?
   Love,
