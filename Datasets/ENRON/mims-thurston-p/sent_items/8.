Hey "G",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.  It's on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me, I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.  Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

Love ya

When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How was your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.  I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.

VAL
