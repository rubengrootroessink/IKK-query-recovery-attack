Not as many as we originally thought, Sandie is calling folks the next
couple of days.  We invited about 5-6 families/friends, Marsha maybe
invited about the same. I know Todd had a couple of DYN folks.   When its
all said and done we may have about 40 people including kids.  I'll know
for sure Friday.  Mom and Jackie will be down that weekend so they will be
there.
