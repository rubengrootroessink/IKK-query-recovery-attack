Kimberly, please have the staff e-mail you the comments that they made yesterday about the states/areas/accounts they are covering.  I want you to put together a summary for everyone on this matter.  In addition, I want to get a list from everyone of any markets that are no longer willing to transact with ENA due to credit issues.  Need the list today.

Frank
