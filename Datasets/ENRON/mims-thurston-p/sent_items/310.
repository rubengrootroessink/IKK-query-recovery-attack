Hi Jordan,

Pam called this morning to inquire about the status of the above referenced amendment.  I apologize for the delay on Enron's part in sending this document.  It is my understanding that this is the same document that would be used for the Dynegy guarantee as well.


Please send me a red-lined version of any changes you have and I will personally make sure that legal responds immediately.

I can be reached at 713-853-5772 should you have further questions.

Thanks for your help!
