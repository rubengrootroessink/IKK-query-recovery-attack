Hey Pooky,

The rest of the weekend was fine.  I forgot to tell you on Saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had.  In fact, I was on my way home when you and I were talking.  Sometimes our choir members are so sad, they don't always show up at functions and events like they should, unless its an opportunity to showboat.  So.....I had to sing on the front row on Saturday evening.  We sounded like crap....I was so embarassed, I actually got so hot and started sweating, because of my embarassment.  It was awful.  I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived.  Kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday, I actually thought he might be getting sick, because that was so out of character for him, but he's back to his old self now, just talking alot and being hard-headed.

I just called the lawyer again and got the secretary....she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery, so she could not talk....so I'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt.  The secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know.

So "F" is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt.  I hate that it hurts, but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior.  I know what you mean about your Dad.  In my case, my dad would be saying, hold on....

Anyway, I love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here.....

When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How was your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.  I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.

VAL
