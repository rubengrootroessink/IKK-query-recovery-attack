Hi Darla, I've put in a call to Nicor.  The objective was to pay them $0.01 for the swap between Peoples and Nicor.  Thw other ticket involved is 664363.  If I'm not mistaken, I think we have accomplished that.  I'll let you know.

My contact at Nicor, Mary Hill, says their trader confirmed with you that the price on deal #664380 should be GDD.  Sitara has GDP.  The price that was agreed to between you and the Nicor trader, according to Nicor, was $5.33 on the 10-12, according to our records, we are billing $5.34.  I need your help in correcting this matter.

Thanks
Darla Saucier
