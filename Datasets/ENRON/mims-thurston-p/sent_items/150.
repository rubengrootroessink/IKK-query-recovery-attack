Hey Jason,

I understand that you were out of the office on Friday, and I'll be out of the office on Monday, but I will call you on Monday mid-morning.  The customer has called again on Friday, and I would like to get this thing resolved.  Please work with me on this issue.  I'm not sure what Enerson's role is anymore, but we need "all hands on deck" to get this issue ironed out immediately.

My cell # is 713-851-6240 and you may call me anytime.  I'll be visiting customers, but please call and leave a message if I'm not available.

Thanks
