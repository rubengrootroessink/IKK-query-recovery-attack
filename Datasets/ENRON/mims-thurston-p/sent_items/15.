First Union has changed the on-line enrollment process. All you need to do is to go to www.firstunionsec.com, click on the "Enroll for access online", You will then be required to call 1-877-879-2495. They will set you up with pin numbers, etc.
You only need to call if you are not on-line or you need to add an account for you to view.. If you prefer, we can do a conference call with First Union to set up the account.

Please give us a call with any questions. The process should take approx. 5 minutes.

Take Care and Have a good week,
