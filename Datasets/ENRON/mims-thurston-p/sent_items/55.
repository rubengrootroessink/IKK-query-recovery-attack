Hey what's Happening?

Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!

We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena Theater,  should be very good!

Also, did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter, Dana, is in the hospital, I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's doing.  I'm assuming her last name is Brown.

Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced brother from S. Carolina).  Girlm she called me this morning, and she was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the phone, they talked two hours.  They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.  I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.  I know she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice conversation.  I just hope he thinks she's cute.

Oh well, talk to you later.

Hey girl!  Welcome back!  I had a great Easter with the exception of the
bad news I received late Sunday night.  My cousin (Renee') passed on Sunday
around noon.  She lived here in Houston.  Her husband gave her and her baby
AIDS.  Her husband died some years ago.  Her mom now has her little boy,
who is close to Siera in age.  My 2nd cousin (Kenny), who lives here in
Houston also, lost his wife on Sunday around 2:30 pm.  She was only 22
years old and they have a two year old daughter.  This situation is really
sad, because it stemed from a disagreement that was very petty.  The
Saturday before last, Kenny and his wife were on their way to Blockbuster.
They were arguing over Kenny buying a DVD player.  He stated that she was
selfish when it came down to him spending $, etc...  He told me that the
next thing he knew, she jumped out of the moving car.  He was going about
35 mph.  She had bad head injuries and underwent two surgeries.  She lived
a week and one day.  Her family is now blaming my cousin and they called
the police on him at the hospital.  The police had to escort my cousin and
his family to their cars because her family was trying to fight him.
Kenny's wife was responding when they brought her in to the hospital, and
the police asked her if Kenny pushed her out of the car and she said no.
It's a good thing they have this on record.

I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers.  I can't believe
he's lost that much weight.  He is blessed, and we're praying for God to
heal him.  We're praying for eternal remission right now in the name of
Jesus!  I know he was so happy to see you and his grandchildren.  You all
alone give him the strength to keep fighting.

Church service was good on Sunday.  Greg sho nuff preached!  However, the
choir didn't sound too good.  Doren was out sick, so Gerald had to play and
direct.  It was aweful.  We were all rocking different ways.  No, we did
not sing any of my songs.  I only made the 11:00 service.  Are you going to
rehearsal tonight?

Well, I did buy that cute dress from Lane Bryant with the shirt to match.
I also bought the green print skirt with the green solid shirt and the pink
solid shirt.  Honey, I was a fox in that dress at the wedding on Saturday.
I missed the wedding, but made the reception.  When I walked in the room,
all eyes were on me.  For once, I didn't feel self conscious about my arms.
My husband was all over me and giving me compliments.  Several of his
cousins told me how good I looked also.  Steve wasn't too pleased about
that.

Have you worn those capri pants and spaghetti top that you bought?

Hello,

How was your weekend?  My weekend was great visiting with my family.
Everyone is doing fine.   Daddy is doing okay.  The radiation treatments
put the prostate cancer in remission, although the Dr. said the cancer
would just move to another part of his body.  He thinks it may have moved
to his leg,  He had a MRI done last week, and today he will get the
results, and he's so afraid he's going to need surgery again.  He's has to
use a walker to get around and he's lost so much weight, he probably went
from 170 to l00.  It's really sad, he is so small and frail.  He's starting
to get his appetite back somewhat.  He sure had a good time eating this
weekend.  My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner.  Please keep him in
your prayers.  It's so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing help in
everything he does, but he's definitely a BLESSED MAN!

How was church services on Sunday?  Did you make it to all the services, (I
don't even know why I'm asking, I know you didn't go to all of them, that's
a bit much).  Did Greg show out on Easter?  Anything new going on with the
choir, did you sing any of your songs.  This month is going to be extremely
busy with the revivial and the other church outing.

You know I never did get a  chance to ask you what all you ended up
purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day.

Anyway, talk with you later!
