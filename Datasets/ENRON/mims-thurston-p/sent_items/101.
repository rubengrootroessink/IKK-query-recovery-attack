You are soooooooooooooo late.....(Smile)  Yes, I've seen Jewel, i tried to show her to you once before we were headed to the garage.  Yes, the looks great.  I asked her what was her secret and she said medical, plus a lot of prayer.  I just wanted to know what she took to lose it.  (Smile)

I heard that Cynthia lost a lot too.

And Fannette has been gone almost a year now.  (Smile)

She's also into Real Estate.
