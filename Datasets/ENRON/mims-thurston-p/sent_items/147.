Yes this is an Enron company.  You're right, just like old shoes and I hope everyone is well taken care of.

Get out of here!!!!  Is this an Enron company?  If so, I am so happy for you Lizzie, I will certainly miss you.  You and I have been working together for years and it's just been so comfortable! (just like "old shoes") .  I wish you well and I know you'll do a great job!

The confirmation for deal 1060746 was faxed this morning to Emma.  I called her and left her a message that if the confirmation was not received to please get back with me.

I also wanted to let you know that October 22nd is my last day.  I have accepted a position  with Freight Markets.  I am in the process of training Sean Riordan who will be taking my place.
