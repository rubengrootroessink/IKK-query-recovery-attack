No, I didn't make the party.  I just kind of fizzled out!  Anyway, hope you're feeling better and hope we can roll today so we can catch up chile!

I'll call before I leave.

Good Afternoon Ms. Thurston!!	

   Did you make Tony's party????  I hope you did..........I've gotten several calls from Donnell, however, I was a little under the weather over the holiday and still not doing so great.  I had to cancel my dental appointment today, because I'm sure they won't give me the premeds.  They confirmed when I called.  Anywho, I left your home number with Donnell to call you and give you Tony's home number.

Anywho, I hope you and the kids had a great time over the holiday.  I finally left the house on yesterday to go with Stan to visit his parents.  He had to go to work, therefore I was stuck a little longer than I would have wanted to, we played cards so that helped me a lot.

Anywho, I'm working on performance reviews, not sure what time I'm leaving today, but do call.

See Ya!!
