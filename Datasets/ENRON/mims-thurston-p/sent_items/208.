Hey Lady,

I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs

Hey Tricey!

I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been going
on? How are the boys?

Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday but
she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to you.
Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer at
4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
address I have one for her too?
