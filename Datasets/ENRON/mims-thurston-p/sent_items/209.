Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5 hours
because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject is
he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating just
about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam, especially
to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell her
or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address because she
had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a chance
to.

Smooches

Hey Lady,

I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been
shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing
great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm
very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll
call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs

   Hey Tricey!

   I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been
   going
   on? How are the boys?

   Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
   yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

   Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday
   but
   she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
   Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to
   you.
   Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer
   at
   4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
   address I have one for her too?
