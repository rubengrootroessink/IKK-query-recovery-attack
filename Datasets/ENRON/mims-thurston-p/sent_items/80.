Yes, your correct, I'm sure that we are going to have the same issue.  I'm still waiting for the lawyer to respond back to me.  I know he had to contact the Calgary trader to get a resolution.  I'll contact him again today and will let you know what he says.  Thanks for reminding me again!

Just wanted to keep on top of this...

We are getting ready to settle Apr-01 production and I believe that we might have the same issue.

Hi Scott,

I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.

Thanks
