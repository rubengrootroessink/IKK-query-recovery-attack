Bernie, call me as soon as you can. I am trying to make flight arrangements

Hi,

I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on
Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or
so and come on through to Omaha.

I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had
to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some
nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you
stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like
Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom
yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how
everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad
shape.

I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not
ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and
not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of
pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so
hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is
any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's
certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if
there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying
for Daddy as well as Mom.

If there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.

Talk with you later!

   Hey girl, what's going on?  When are you going to be here so I can clear
   my
   schedule.  I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late.
   The
   visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how
   to
   use the feeding tube. I went over there around 9:00p.m. from church.
   After she fed daddy thru the tube, he upchuck again.  So this tells all
   of
   us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job.   The main concern
   that
   is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the
   vomiting.  The Hospice nurse will be out today at 4:00 and I go back
   over
   there to hear what they have to say.  Daddy goes to the new doctors on
   May
   31.  The main concern is the vomiting.  We just have to hang in there
   and
   keep praying.  After my doctor's visit with Daddy on Thursday, I had a
   hard
   time dealing with it on Friday.  Everytime someone would ask me about
   it, I
   would start crying.  I am doing better today and daddy's spirit seemed
   fine
   last night.  I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up
   to
   him to talk with Corey.  The next thing I need to do is call Daddy's
   boss
   and ask him about his retirement.  Even though he is eligible, he is not
   ready to take that final step.  when junior and I were talking, we
   wondered
   about what would happen to the retirement (as far as Mom is concerned)
   if he
   does not officially retire?   Daddy is still very optimistic as we all
   are.
   It is very important that his attitude stays positive.  Enough for now.
   Talk with you later.

   Hey girl,

   Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So
   little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to
   say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena
   yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.

   I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop
   trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he
   will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to
   concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going
   to
   seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and
   fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was
   hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little
   bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

   The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However,
   the
   concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had
   several
   acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until
   1:15
   p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton
   Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that
   dates
   again.

   Talk with you later.

      How come I have not had a response from you?  You better get on your
      job.  I
      was beginning to wonder if you were on vacation or something.

      I saw "little" Corey last night for the first time.  You can see some
   of
      his
      Indian heritage.  His hair is hair is very straight and he is darker
      than
      teena.  It was so weird calling him Corey.  That is going to take
   some
      getting use to for me.  Teena told me that you called her yesterday.
      I finally got the name of the hotel that the choir will be staying in
      when
      we arrive in houston on 6/27 & 6/28.  It is not embassy suite.  It is
      the
      Hilton Houston Southwest.  Where is that in relations to you?

      Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I
   know
      you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll
   hail a
      cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina
      has
      had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want
      her
      to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is
   concerned,
      we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams,
      etc.
      Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have
      dressing.  Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so
      I'll
      try to call you on the way home.

      See ya!
