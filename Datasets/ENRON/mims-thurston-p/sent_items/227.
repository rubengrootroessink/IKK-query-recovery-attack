Girl, you're a mess!  Although, you are causing me to smile "in the midst of it all".  You really do need to find this guy.  What's his full name?  Have you tried the internet?  Have you tired any old friends?  Surely, someone knows him or know's where to contact him.  Come on girl, let's go, go. go!  You REALLY need to find him!  Please write back and tell me his full name,  Does he have gas service in his name at Nicor??  Does his momma have gas service with Nicor or do they live in the city?  Come on!!!

Last night i could not sleep.  I really need to find my friend, just to remove him from system.  Last night I had a dream I found him.  The guy here at work called him for me.  He was not married, but had a daughter.  His feelings were mutual.  He had come to Chicago and rented a limo so that we could have an evening alone.  We did not have any sexual activity.  We did a lot of catching up and sharing of feelings.  He would send me flowers and he wanted to buy me an expensive gift, but i told him that was not necessary, but he did it anyway.  His last statement to me was that i let you get away before, but i will not from this day forward.

I wanted to ask the person who had the prohetic reading to take a look at both pictures (Frank, Ron) to see which man was the one in the dream.
