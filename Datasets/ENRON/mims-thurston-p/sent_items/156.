Hey Debra,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1
V17515.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

Thanks
