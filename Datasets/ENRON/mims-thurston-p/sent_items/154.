Hey girl,


I'll be out of the office all next week, traveling and meeting with customers in Chicago.

Call me if you have any questions regarding Kaztex (or anything else) we have worked together on.  My cell phone is 713-851-6240.
If i'm not there, please leave me a message.  Thanks for all your hard work!
