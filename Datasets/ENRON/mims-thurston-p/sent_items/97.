I have the eye creme and the eye liner.  However, I will be out of the office until Monday.  So I will bring it then.  Also, I will see if I can get the stress free cologne.  I don't have that.

Hello,

Tasha told me that you just got back from your trip abroad.  Was is just Fantastic! (smile).  Any brotha's and sistah's over there?  Hope you had a great time.    I would love to see pictures sometime.  I would like to purchase some of that eyeshadow base.  I think it is the triple action cream or something like that.  It has the gold cap to it.  Also, I would like some black eyeliner.  Just call me whenever you have it.  Also, I'd like some of that "Stress Free" cologne from the Private Spa collection.

Just let me know when you have it.  

Thanks!
