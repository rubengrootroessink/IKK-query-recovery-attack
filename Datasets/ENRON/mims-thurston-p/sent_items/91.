Yes, I thought we had sent you the contract already.  The actual contract only refers to a delivery point at the Chicago city gates, and not specifically Peoples or Nicor, if I'm not mistaken.  Is this going to be a problem?  I'm sorry, I thought it had been forwarded to you already!!!!

Patrice, Have you had a chance to locate the Cargill contract?

We need to get together to discuss how our desk can help you on a day to day basis since we are now EWS.
