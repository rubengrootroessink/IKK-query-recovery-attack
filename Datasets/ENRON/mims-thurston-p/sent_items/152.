Hey Rob,

I haven't heard or seen anything yet on the executed contract?  Is everything okay?  I'll be out of the office traveling next week, and I wanted to get a status before I left.

Thanks

Patrice
I will be having this signed and sent to you tomorrow morning.  As we have
gone back and forth a few times, please let me know if you see anything
that does not reflect our final determinations.  I have included both the
redline and the final versions.
Thanks
