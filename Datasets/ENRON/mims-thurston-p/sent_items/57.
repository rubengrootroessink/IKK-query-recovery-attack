Good afternoon,


Robin called last night after I spoke with you and told me that her impress=
ion was that Rev. Jackson was resigning.  I called Horace this morning and =
asked him if he resigned and he said, Oh no, he had just made a mistake (I =
get the impression that Greg caught Horace dogging him out and called him o=
ut on him, and Horace being the good, honest person that he is, couldn't li=
e).  He said that it was his idea to get up and talk to the church.  Robin =
said he was just crying while he was talking.  He said he's in "time out" n=
ow.  I tried to ask him if Gregg put him in "time out" but he kind of kept =
talking.  He said he's really having family problems surrounding this churc=
h thing and he's just going to be sitting out for the next couple of weeks.=
  He won't be in the pulpit, he said Gregg would probably have him sitting =
with the deacons.  I asked him what is going on with the deacons,  and he s=
aid it would take all day to talk about that, and he had someone in his off=
ice.  I let him go after that.  Now isn't all of that interesting.  =20

I forgot to tell you that I spoke with Sharon Mayon on Friday.  She married=
 Tyrone this past Sunday. =20

That revival is this week isn't it?

Talk with you later!

Oh, Happy Birthday!  I'm so sorry I forgot to write it down.  I'll have to
take you to dinner.  I know you'll enjoy KiCi and Jo Jo.  I want to go!

I did not hear about Dana.  What's wrong?  What hospital?

Hmm, so you hooked Cynthia up with a customer.  Yeah, I hope he thinks
she's cute also.  She dresses nice and keeps herself well maintained, but
sometimes when I look her dead in the face, she's not the cutest person.
Keep me posted on that.

Well, have a great time tonight!  Happy Birthday again!!  By the way, how
old are you?

Hey what's Happening?

Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!

We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena
Theater,  should be very good!

Also, did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter, Dana, is in the
hospital, I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's
doing.  I'm assuming her last name is Brown.

Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced
brother from S. Carolina).  Girlm she called me this morning, and she
was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the
phone, they talked two hours.  They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.
I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.  I know
she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice
conversation.  I just hope he thinks she's cute.

Oh well, talk to you later.
