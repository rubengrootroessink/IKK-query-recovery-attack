Hi Jan,

So nice to hear from you.  I am glad you are finally "enjoying life".  I wish I could join you now.  With the Enron stock and "whatnot", I'll have to hang around alot longer than anticipated (smile).  Are the boys excited about going to "MDO".  I bet that is a change for them, and alot less expensive for you.

The job is going well, I really like it, it is a different kind of stress, but definitely more preferable for me.  I really like what I'm doing.  My  boys are getting the added benefit of Mom being in a really good mood most of the time.  Jordan is doing pretty good in school,  I'm not really sure that he's in love with school, but he's doing well.   Kendall, what can I say?  My Kendall is something else.  He is so funny, and guess what, he talks in a very loud voice, it kills me, i wonder where he got that from!

Suzy is moving to New York this Friday morning.  Her husband's mom lives somewhere in New York and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job.  I hate to see her go, but if it's best for there family, then go for it.

Anyway, take care

Love ya!

How the heck are ya?  I have been thinking of  you alot lately.  I tried to guess your e:mail address a couple of times  over the last couple of months but there is just no guessing it.  I finally  had to call Laura Vuittonet.
 
Well, I'm having a great time home with the  kids.  I really thought I would be bored by now but I feel just a busy just  not as tired.  In fact, for the first time since I had my kids I feel very  rested and at peace.  It's fun being a kid and  running around Houston  when there isn't much traffic and it nice having the time to slow down the  pace.
 
The boys are in Mothers Day Out 2 times a week from  9:00 - 2:00 which really isn't much time at all.  I could use another day  of alone time.  On those days I am usually meeting with Enron or once in a  while I meet a friend for lunch.  Time really flies.
 
Anyway, I hope all is well for you.  Miss  ya.
 
Janet
