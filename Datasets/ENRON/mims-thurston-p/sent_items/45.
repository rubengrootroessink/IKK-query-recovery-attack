Hey Girl,

Yes, we had our concert, it was real good, had a very poor turnout, but he choir really enjoyed themselves.  Rickey Dillard is a fool!  He's alot of fun, and I didn't realize he was gay, but he is.  Everyone says he used to be gay, and not he's changed, but......

I spoke with Daddy on Friday, and he asked me where was his e-mail.  I haven't heard anything from him as of yet, but I did send him a e-mail asking the question.  Did he do his radio program yesterday?

Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback riding,  Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon got used to the idea.  I myself was a little skeptical, because I had ol' Kendall on my horse, and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle, instead of me, all I had was the reins,  at first I said "the hell with this", but it was fun, we'll definitely do it again.

Talk with you later!
