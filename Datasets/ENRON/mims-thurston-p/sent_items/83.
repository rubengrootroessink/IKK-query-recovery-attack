Hi Lizzie,


Will you please call this lady at TransCanada, Tracy in Gas Accounting at 402-505-8800.  She says we have a couple of term deals that have the incorrect TransCanada counterparty.  They are not deals in my region, so I thought it best to have you handle, as opposed to passing her around..

Thanks
