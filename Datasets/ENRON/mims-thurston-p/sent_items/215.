Now what location of Vickie's secret are you talking about?  And give me an example of midday, evening or morning stuff?  You just lost me!

I love Clinique. I haven't tried their mascara but I've been using their
powder for about 3 years.

She is registered under Danielle Crusoe. Victoria doesn't have a registry
but when we went the manager let me write down all of the things that
Danielle wanted and she said that she would make sure that everyone in her
store knew about it for when people came in. I called it "Danielle Crusoe's
Wish List". I must give you the invitation. Her theme is "Around the
Clock". Have you been to this kind of shower before? It wear you bring a
gift that the bride-to-be will use during the morning, midday or evening
hours. I absolutely love during bridal showers they're so fun.

Clinique, it's there new one.  But is she registered under Danielle Crusoe?
They do have a registry, correct.  I'm kinda excited to know what Danielle
is registered for?

   Hey noonie!

   I am going to try to make it to revival as well so I'll bring your
   invitation. I have one for Robin too. Tasha told me that she told her
   about
   it but she didn't say whether she was coming or not. Those are the two
   places where she is registered. You are a mess talking about you might
   have
   to pick something up for yourself. It is hard not to come out of there
   with
   something for yourself and I'm sure Todd wouldn't be mad at cha' :o) I
   have
   all the games ready for the shower, I sure hope everyone enjoys them.

   What is your favorite mascara?

   Hope,

   I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the
   Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her
   then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle
   registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church
   tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she
   registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for
   myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my
   favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.

   Hugs

      Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5
      hours
      because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What
   subject
      is
      he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating
      just
      about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam,
      especially
      to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

      I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please
   tell
      her
      or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address
   because
      she
      had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a
      chance
      to.

      Smooches

      Hey Lady,

      I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have
   been
      shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
      Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are
   doing
      great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.
      I'm
      very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

      Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home,
      I'll
      call you if I do, or just call her for you.

      Talk with you later!!!

      Hugs

         Hey Tricey!

         I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has
   been
         going
         on? How are the boys?

         Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with
   Taylor
         yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

         Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on
      Tuesday
         but
         she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't
   either.
         Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give
   it
      to
         you.
         Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on
      Westheimer
         at
         4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or
   email
         address I have one for her too?
