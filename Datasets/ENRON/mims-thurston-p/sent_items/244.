You are so nasty!!!!!!! Who is Henry (that get's on your nerves)? I can take a breather anytime now.  I have an 11:45 meeting today and then after that, it's just wait and see.   I am thrilled for you, you deserve everything you're receiving now and so much more!!! 

I too am very glad to be your friend...I only wished that we lived in the same city and could visit more often.  When God put us together, he knew what he was doing, AS ALWAYS!  

I love you my sister.

Also, you need to be careful on the e-mail and use code words, if you know what I mean.  You know I know how to READ!!!

Love ya!

I want to say that I am very thankful that the Lord has blessed you to be apart of my life.

Let me know what happens to you, on today.  You have soooooo much experience that you can go anywhere.  If I can be of some help let me know.

Patrice I really Love Ron.  My sister-in-law say my eyes were beaming.  I was a good girl.  Henry gets on my nerve sometimes.  I was running late this morning, therefore I did not have enough time this morning.  It would have been oooonnnnnn.  There is so much I would like to disclose to you on today.  I know other things are on your mind.  Let me know when you can take a breathier.  Your brother man is trying to act right, but, I am playing hard ball.  I need to go to Tex, and Denver.
