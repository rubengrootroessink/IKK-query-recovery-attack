Hey Lady,

How was your holiday and time off?  Hope everything is well with you!

Thank you.

Hi Debra,

Nicor Gas Company wants to amend our base contract (their form of agreement) to add some "netting language".  Please review ASAP and let me know what you think.  I am most anxious to get this amendment reviewed, as this is our biggest LDC in the Midwest and they are continuing to do business with us, and have even sleeved some deals for us, when others would not sell to us.

I will be on vacation Tuesday and Wednesday,so I would appreicate your help.  As always, tomorrow I can be reached on my cell if you need me.  

Thanks

P.S. Did you get ahold of Mr. Hunt from Nicor yet.
