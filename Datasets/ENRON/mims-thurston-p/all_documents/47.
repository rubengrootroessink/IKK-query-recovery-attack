Sorry, it took so long to respond to the e-mail.  Hope, you guys are doing 
well!  
Yes, I'm interested in receiving the address list for the attendees!  We 
really need to get something out pretty soon to the people.  Grandpa says 
people are calling, (I wonder if its just one or two people), but 
nevertheless, we still need to get something out.

Talk with you soon!
