Hey,

How's it going today?  I've been thinking about you and Siera.  Did things go 
alright last night.  Have you heard any more back from the principals yet, or 
are you not going to know anything until tomorrow?  
I know tonight is study night for her spelling test, so I probably won't talk 
to you tonight.

Rev. Jackson called me yesterday.  I thought that was funny, he said they had 
told him that I was upset about my contribution statement, and he thought he 
would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything.  He then 
went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because 
I was a generous contributor.  I then proceeded to give him a piece of my 
mind, because they need to get serious about the business end of the church.  
By the way, I was talking to Kent the other day, and he mentioned that 
Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church.  That's interesting.  I can only 
imagine what happened there!

Anyway, do you have your African attire yet?  I have some, but it's old, and 
I had been thinking about buying something new.  I might go to Sharpstown and 
have a look, but that is not set in stone.  It depends on what type of time I 
have and what type of mood I'm in.  You know we're supposed to wear our 
African attire on Sunday.  You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan 
Church on Sunday at 3:00 p.m.  I'm pretty sure I won't be attending.  I'm 
tired of going to the same places.  We need some variety.  Gregg needs to get 
some new "hook-ups" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the 
outings.  And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs.  If we 
have to sing "In the Sanctuary"  one more time, I'm going to throw up.  

I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off.  
It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, 
and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon.

See you later!!!!!
