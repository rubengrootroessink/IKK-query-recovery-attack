I spoke with Carol on Friday and supposdly their wedding coordinator found a 
room at Embassy  Suites for $39 per night.  It's supposed to be at I-17 and 
Greenway, wherever that is.   I'll belive that when I see it.   I probably 
will not bring the kids, it just seems like such a hassle.  I can understand 
Mom not wanting to miss work, so it seems like it will be a girls weekend.  I 
have not checked on flight arrangements yet, but I'll let you know.   I still 
want to leave on Thursdat night, so we have time for site seeing.  How much 
was the ticket?
