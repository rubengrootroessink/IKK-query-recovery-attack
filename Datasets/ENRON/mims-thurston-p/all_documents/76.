Hey girl,

You didn't tell me that Jennifer changed her name.  I called her cell phone 
and left a message and it gave her real name, not her slave name.  I cracked 
up!  Seems like the older people get, the crazier they get.  That reminds me 
when my mother called herself changing her name from Louise to Louisa.  I 
answered the telephone at her house and they said "Is Louisa there, and She 
said, oh that's for me".  I cracked up!

Anyway, funny thing happened on the way to the forum, no seriously I was 
standing the lobby on Friday, and a young man asked me if my name was 
Patrice.  Turned out he was Birdell's son, Dupree, remember him?  He's back 
down here working for Prostaff delivering boxes.  He's turned into a nice 
looking young man.  I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes.  She 
seems to be doing fine, only spoke for a few minutes though.  I'll call her 
back one of these days when I have more time.

Missed you at Jordan's party.  Silly me, I didn't figure it out until 
Saturday that you had Shayla drop off the gift.  I initially thought it was 
from Shayla.

Well anyway, you rolling?
