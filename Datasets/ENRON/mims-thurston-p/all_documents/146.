Girl, did you see Jesse Jackson on TV.   You know how they have the news on 
around here, and Jesse came on and said, "In order to have a RECOUNT, you 
have to have the FIRST COUNT, and it's not a black and white issue, its a 
wrong or right issue".   Always trying to rhyme!   Can you believe that 
idiot.  I was too embarassed and kind of acted like I wasn't paying attention.

I understand that Jesse is "down for the cause", but his credibility is 
suffering, because he's involved in every DAMN thing.  If you're an authority 
on everything, you cannot be passionate about much at all.  He's something 
else.  He needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility!!!!
