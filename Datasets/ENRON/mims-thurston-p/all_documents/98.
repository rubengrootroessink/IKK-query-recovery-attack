For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported  a weighted average price of 
$10.77 for all activity at NGPL Nicor.

The following Chicago Midpoint Pricing was reported to Gas Daily:


December 21, 2000  $10.77

December 22, 2000  $15.76

The December 22, 2000 midpoint reflected a weighted average price for flow on 
gas days December 22-26, 2000.  The reason for the lengthy trading period was 
due to Nicor Gas Company being closed on Friday, December 22, 2000, as 
opposed to December 26, 2000 ( the majority of the companies recognized 
December 26, 2000 as the holiday).

Nicor Gas Company made the decision to buy additional gas on December 22nd 
for flow on December 23-26, 2000.  Since I did not trade incremental volumes 
for this time period, I reported the same prices and volumes that I had 
previously traded  for this time period.

I did receive several phone calls from other marketing companies expressing 
concern that Gas Daily was going to come out with a new posting for the 
December 22-26, 2000 time period, when in fact, the incremental volume that 
Nicor purchased made up a small percentage of  the total volume for that time 
period.   I phoned Dave Behrman at Gas Daily to determine if this were true, 
and he replied that they would make a decision once they gathered all third 
party information.
