Daddy,

I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, if I am, so sorry, but....I wanted 
to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and Mom.  


I need to know now, rather than later, if we need to set up a game plan for 
you guys.  Also, you don 't have to be emotional about borrowing money from 
me, nobody else is (smile).  After all, I owe you one!!

Love Bernie!
