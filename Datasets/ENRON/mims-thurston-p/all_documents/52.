As far as vacation, I think we are thinking of going to Virginia Beach, VA. 
and just renting a house on the beach.  I've never been there, but have heard 
a few good things about it.  I'm trying to get more information before I go 
ahead and book a house.  Also, with my dad being sick, I've been somewhat 
reluctant to do it, because we always take a family trip each year.  God is 
good, so he'll probably get a chance to go.  Have you made any plans yet?  If 
you do, make sure and plan something leisurely.

Also, yes, we need to institute the park days and let these kids go CRAZY.  
They all seem to get along real well.

So my girl, has good taste.  I knew she had it in her.  I really, really like 
my Tahoe.  I wish I had bought it sooner.  It took me about a month to get 
used to it, but now I'm rolling.  Tell your sister I said hi, and let me know 
when she's in town again and when ever you guys have some time.  I would love 
to get together again.
