Hi Melba,

While we're in the midst of creating new products, will you please set up a 
new product called:  NGPL North Shore Gas Company.

The description should be:

The interconnection between Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and North 
Shore Gas Company .  It should be mapped to Chicago.

I would like to use this product tomorrow as well.

Thanks for your help!

P.S.   Also, you may just use North Shore Gas for the decriptor.

Thanks
