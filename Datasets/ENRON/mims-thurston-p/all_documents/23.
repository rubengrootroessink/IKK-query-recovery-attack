Hey Nella,

When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last 
Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and 
they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me 
asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".

He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.

How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went 
to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In 
fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling 
because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha 
and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl 
one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  
Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like 
in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so 
nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.

This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind 
you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of 
one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one 
with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I 
didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she 
made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to 
leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 
other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I 
think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff 
together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.


Talk with you later
