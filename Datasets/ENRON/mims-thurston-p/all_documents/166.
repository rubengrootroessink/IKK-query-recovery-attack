Hi Nellie,

What's happening?  I sent you and Momma some new pictures of the boys, if you 
have not received yet, you should receive either today or Tuesday.  I made 
the hotel reservations for Phoenix at the Embassey Suites, the rate is 
$159.00 per night, pretty expensive, but the Nascar is in town, and we can 
split it three ways.  Hopefully, there is a sofa sleeper in the room, 
although I did not ask, I asked for two queen beds, in case there is not.  
Now I just need to get the car reserved and we're all set.  I spoke with 
Shawna on Friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see 
if she could improve that rate, so far I have not heard anything back from 
her yet, nor am I holding my breath.  She said her colors are burgundy and 
gold, if I remember correctly.  

Jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that 
Jordan was so good, that he would like Jordan to be in an accelerated class 
for his age group.  This class is called the "Hope Team"  and it gets the 
kids ready for competition.  I did not realize he was that good, although I 
could clearly see that he was the best in his class (proud Mom).  I called to 
inquire about the cost, and the receptionist quickly told me" Ma'm you have 
to be invited to be in that class, you just can't enroll, and I said, yes, 
ma'm we have been invited to enroll, thank you very much!" 

Well, anyway, we'll  see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. each day.  
We'll see, I know he would really enjoy it.
Kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning October 23rd.  I 
was thinking he would really enjoy it, but the more I think about it, he'll 
probably want to be in Jordan's class (oh boy!!).

I spoke with Daddy last week, and he's supposed to be checking into possibly 
getting tickets to come down for Thanksgiving.  Let me know what you're 
hearing?  Talk to you later.
