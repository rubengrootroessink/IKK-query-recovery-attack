Bobbi,


Attached are the final numbers for the interruptible balancing for November, 
2000.  I have also attached a tentative schedule for December, 2000 for both 
the firm and interruptible.  Those schedules will probably be revised once we 
get through December 1st nominations and "boo-boos".

Thanks
