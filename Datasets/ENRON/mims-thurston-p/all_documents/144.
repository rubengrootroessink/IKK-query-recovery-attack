Hey girl,

What's happening?  Girl, remind me, just in case I have a memory lapse, that 
I will never, ever go back over to that church again.  It's a nice, small 
church, but those folks crack me up.  Last time I went, Sharon Mahon, sat 
next to me and just really acted a fool and had me roaring.  This time, those 
fools sitting by me (audrey and Doren) had me laughing, especially Audrey.  
They're fools!  I was so embarassed that my chuckle came out!  So, just 
remind me, I will never go back over there.   I sure hate that you missed 
seeing the baptismal pool! 

Boy, what a difference a day makes in the weather.  Last night, Todd cleaned 
out the closet, because of the potential tornado threat.  I was a little 
unnerved, especially with the kids.  I had the kids put on their shoes and 
socks and whatnot, just in case something happened.  I was a praying sister.  
That really scared me.  Then, to top it off, the weather got really cold this 
morning!  Oh well, talk with you later!
