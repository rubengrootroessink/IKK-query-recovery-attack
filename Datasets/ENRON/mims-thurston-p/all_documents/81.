Hi Priscilla,

These deals are a mess,  I remember issues with the deals, but unfortunately, 
can't remember all the details.  I will speak with our Calgary office, as 
well as, our Operations Manager, George Smith, and provide details to you 
ASAP.  Unfortunately, I think the ASAP won't be until Monday, as George Smith 
is out of the office until Monday.

Thanks,
