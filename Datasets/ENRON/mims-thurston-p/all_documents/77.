I have two counterparties that we have invoiced for gas on December 13th - 
Coral and CMS.  In both cases I am being told that this gas is also  being 
invoiced by Petro-Canada and that it was baseload and at a cheaper price than 
what we are invoicing them for.

The deal numbers are  CMS Marketing  #529459 22000 @ 9.10 = $200200.00
    Coral   #529442 8000 @ 8.90 = $71200.00

Both counterparties have stated that they will not pay our invoiced amount.  
Is it possible that these deals should be invoiced to Petro-Canada instead of 
CMS and Coral?  Would you let me know what the resolution is?

Thanks  for your assistance
