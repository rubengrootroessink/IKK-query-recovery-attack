Stephen,
 
At this time,  ENA chooses not to bid on your RFP for the reasons listed below.
 
Mid 5: NNG/ GPM Linam Ranch 1709 is not a liquid point and it would not be prudent to sell where we do not have the reserves to back it.  The other issue is the NNG-TOK Index is not traded frequently and therefore the posting may easily be manipulated.  
 
The alternative plan is to allow ENA to sell Mids 1 though 6 up to the volume US Steel requires to meet system needs and to price it off of a Demarcation Index (a frequently traded Index).
 
If you have any other questions or comments, please call me.  
 
 
Best Regards,
 
Sylvia Pollan                             Patrice Thurston
