You are so nasty!!!!!!! Who is Henry (that get's on your nerves)? I can
take a breather anytime now.  I have an 11:45 meeting today and then after
that, it's just wait and see.   I am thrilled for you, you deserve
everything you're receiving now and so much more!!!

I too am very glad to be your friend...I only wished that we lived in the
same city and could visit more often.  When God put us together, he knew
what he was doing, AS ALWAYS!

I love you my sister.

Also, you need to be careful on the e-mail and use code words, if you know
what I mean.  You know I know how to READ!!!

Love ya!

   I want to say that I am very thankful that the Lord has blessed you to
   be apart of my life.

   Let me know what happens to you, on today.  You have soooooo much
   experience that you can go anywhere.  If I can be of some help let me
   know.

   Patrice I really Love Ron.  My sister-in-law say my eyes were beaming.
   I was a good girl.  Henry gets on my nerve sometimes.  I was running
   late this morning, therefore I did not have enough time this morning.
   It would have been oooonnnnnn.  There is so much I would like to
   disclose to you on today.  I know other things are on your mind.  Let me
   know when you can take a breathier.  Your brother man is trying to act
   right, but, I am playing hard ball.  I need to go to Tex, and Denver.
