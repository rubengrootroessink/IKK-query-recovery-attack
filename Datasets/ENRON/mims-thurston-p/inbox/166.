Mimmsie,
I miss hearing your voice and your laugh!

It sounds like you have a new job, is that right?  What is it?   I'm so out
of the loop.  Any job that can make you happier will definitely benefit the
entire family.  I'm go glad you move on to something new, it takes a lot of
guts but that is something you were never short on.   And I don't even want
to talk about the stock price.  I keep telling myself that I won't need it
for several years and who knows where it will be in 15-20 years.

The boys like their new MDO program.  Kids just need some time with peers or
they go crazy and wild.  It sounds like Kendall is a little carbon Copy
(with the load voice and all).  We can only hope we get one more Mimmsie in
the world.  It must be so weird to have one child in "Real School".  My how
times have flown by.  I remember when we were two Childless gals out to
conquer the world......Motherhood is better!

Wow, Suzy is moving to NY.  I meant to call her but just never did.  I
thought I would be bored once I was a stay home mom but I feel very busy
just not stressed out.  Tell her I said hello and Good luck on her move.

Well, have a great day and let me know what your new job is!

Love ya,
J
