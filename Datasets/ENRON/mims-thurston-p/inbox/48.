Girl the snow at my home was knee deep.  Debbie told me to work from home.  I
did not have all the necessary information to complete a lot of the reports.
I do have a cell phone.  I will not turn it on until I get back from Denver.
I found out everyone else was here so I came in.

I did not realize there was a problem.  Pretty bad out there huh?  You
really need to get a cell phone for bad weather, you could have been
stranded.!

Glad you're there!
