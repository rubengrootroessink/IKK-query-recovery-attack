I received a call from Tom Donohoe.  He would like to receive the preliminary information to insure that the apps don't get lost in his company.  Here's his information:

		Tom Donohoe
		Entex Gas Resources
		713-207-7993
		713-207-0054
		thomas.c.donohoe@centerpointenergy.com

Let me know if you have questions, Patrice.

Thanks,
Griff
