Money

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/100_bill_rotate_md_wht.gif>

 

It can buy a House

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/house.jpg>

But not a Home

 

It can buy a Bed

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/tired_lg_wht.gif>

But not Sleep



 

It can buy a Clock

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/italian_pendulum_clock_swaying_sm_wht.gif>

But not Time

 

It can buy you a Book

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/book_page_flip_md_wht.gif>

But not Knowledge

 



It can buy you a Position

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/whiteman_cellphone_talking_md_wht.gif>

But not Respect

 



It can buy you Medicine

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/bottle_spill_md_wht.gif>

But not Health

 

It can buy you Blood

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/bloodbag.jpg>

But not Life

 



So you see money isn't everything.
And it often causes pain and suffering.
I tell you this because I am your Friend,
and as your Friend I want to
take away your pain and suffering!

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/100_bill_rotate_md_wht.gif>

So send me all your money and I will suffer for you! Cash only please.
