I am feeling strong.  On this morning we had a not so pleasant conversation.  Believe it or not over lunch money for LaShelle.  LaShelle is in high school.  He wants her to take her lunch, while he goes to the bars and buy drinks and go out on Friday or Sat to the clubs and spend more money, not to mention what he wastes money on other things.  Maybe I am missing something.  He does not know I am taking a half day today.  I think I am going to drive down and park and find a quiet spot and just read the word and pray.  I will have to call you from a pay phone.  I not quite sure what his plans are for today, home or not.

You can rest assured that I will definitely have you in my prayers.  How is
everything going this morning?  What is your state of mind?  Are you
feeling strong this morning or a little apprehensive?  If you are feeling
apprehensive, please try and write down your questions and concerns that
you have, so that you don't waste your visit by being overcome by emotions.
Call me when you get back from your visit.  I will probably be leaving here
around 2:00 or so.  Call me on my cell.

Love ya!
