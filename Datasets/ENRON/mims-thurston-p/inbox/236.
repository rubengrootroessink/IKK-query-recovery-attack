You are a mess! That is a shawl sweetie not a bow :o) and it is priced at
$110. If purchased by October 31st, you will get 15% off.

I really hope that Jordan will want to do it :o)

Here is one picture of the bridesmaids dress. I am using two different
tops. Some of the girls will wear the one below and the other girls will
wear a strapless top. The color of them all are Rosebud. My sister will
wear a Rosebud lace outfit. They don't have a picture on the web of the
strapless top or my sister's dress but I can show it to you in a book. The
girls who are wearing the strapless top will also wear the same straight
skirt that is pictured. I am also attaching a picture of my mommy's dress.

Hope, Hope, Hope,

The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!  But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go
to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!  Is
that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?  How much is the
dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.  (p.s. I'm not worried about
the cost, I just want to look good!)

What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will
be thrilled.  That'll be so cute!  I'll ask him tonight and explain
everything to him.  I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as
well.  That boy is a mess!

Talk to you soon!


P.S. Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color!

   Hey Tricey!!!!!!!!!

   You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress
   but
   the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
   tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)

   Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a
   girl
   and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question
   :o)
   Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
   talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to
   walk
   with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with
   the
   biggest smile on her face.

   Love ya!
