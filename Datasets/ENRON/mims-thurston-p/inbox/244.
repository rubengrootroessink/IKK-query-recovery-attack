Rob,

I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference to
"must pay within 5 business days" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does make
a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party to
provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand under
a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments where
appropriate.

I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
authority.

Finally, I reinserted "excluding choice of law provisions . . . " language
to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

All told, most of the changes look fine.

Thanks.

Ernie
