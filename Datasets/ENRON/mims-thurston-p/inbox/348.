Sylvia, NGPL sent a letter to your attention dated 11/5/01 to notify you
that this contract is up for renewal (expires 6/2/2002) and Enron needs to
notify us by 12/5/01 if it wants to go thru the right-of-first-refusal
(ROFR) process.

This morning a revised letter was faxed in error which stated that the
notification date is now 12/31/01.

PLEASE DISREGARD THIS FAX!

I called and spoke with Lindsey Culotta since you are out today but I wanted
to make sure you got the word that you should disregard this fax and stick
with the original notification date as stated in the 11/5/01 letter.

Please call if you have any questions.
