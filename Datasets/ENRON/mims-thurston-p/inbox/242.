Hey girl!  Sorry I didn't get a chance to call you last night.  I was in
bed by 9:30.  Steve got home around 11:00 and didn't say a word to me.  He
turned on lights and made lots of noise, but said nothing.  He slept
upstairs in the game room last night, so evidentally, he goes in late
today.  He could've at least dressed and taken the kids to school, since I
do it every morning, but he didn't.  I can't worry about it.  I'm so use to
doing it all by myself anyway, so it really doesn't matter.  What time will
you be at rehearsal tonight?  Maybe we can talk before then.

Hope's number is (713) 207-7103.   Talk to you later!

Hey good morning,

How did things go last night?  I hope everything went well. I went to Lane
Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.  What is
Hope's phone number.  I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it
better not make me look fatter!).  Write back when you have a chance.

   Well, I wouldn't have anyone to take care of my kids.  Siera has
   cheerleading practice from 6:30 - 7:45pm.  Afterwards, it'll be
   homework.
   They got to bed late last night and were extremely tired this morning.
   I
   promised them they'd be in bed by 9 or 9:30 tonight.  I'll see what I
   can
   do.

   Tasha,

   I'm so sorry to hear that things are getting hectic again.  I definitely
   know what that feels like.  Do you think we could get away without the
   kids
   for an hour or so this evening?  Even if it's late..I need to see you
   and
   talk to you.  I still need to check with Todd to see if he's working
   tonight or what, but let's see what we can find out!

      Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I
   really
      don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He
   has
      threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
      scared.
      I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so
   bad,
      and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing
   to
      do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
      chooses
      not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial
   difficulties.
      This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I
   don't
      know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him
   has
      done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more
   he
      could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids
   and
      what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that
   I
      do
      to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.

      Nytasha
