I appreciate all that you have done.  There are 7 days remaining.  I wish I
was leaving tomorrow.  I miss him dearly.  Three to four years is going to be
a challenge.  In that time frame I must finish school and both of my daughters
would have graduated from high school and 8th grade.  The apartment was
bothering me on yesterday.  It was laid on my heart to call her and let her
know everything up front.  She had to run a credit report, you know that is
not good due to the circumstances.  I let her also know why I can not move
until March 1.  Emotionally I wish I could move Feb.1.  Financially I would be
set to move and start my new life of March 1.  I prayed about on last night
and turned it over to JESUS and I am not to worry about it.  I see the lady on
today.  My whole life will be on the move in the month of Feb.  If all goes
well I should receive the package no later than Tuesday.  Keep your head up
about the class.  If you need to pull Hunter to the side and work with him
personally do that.  May be L can help?  Beside missing RC I am okay.

Hey "G",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse
and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this
afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.  It's
on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me,
I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.
Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this
stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its
hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

Love ya

   When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How was
   your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with
   mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this
   week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of
   us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there
   before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went
   in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.
   I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem
   evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught
   him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive
   a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.

   VAL
