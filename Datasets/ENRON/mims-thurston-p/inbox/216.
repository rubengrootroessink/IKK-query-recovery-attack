We really have had nothing to do with this since it went into bankrupcty.  We were basically wiped out except for a very small portion of the senior debt.  We will get back about $500,000 of a $32.5 million.  We also lost money on the MTM of the gas contract and a little on the commodity piece.  

This thing was so bad that there was really nothing we could do to save it.

John,

Since Heartland Steel was sold in July, 2001, are you still involved in this deal?

Thanks
