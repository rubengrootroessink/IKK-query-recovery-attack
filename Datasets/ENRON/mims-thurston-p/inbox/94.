Hey girl!  Sorry it took so long for me to reply.  I'm extremely busy over
here.  I'm trying to juggle my current work load and provide the auditors
with information they're requesting.

Hmm!  A vacation sounds great!!!  We're talking about going to Michigan
during the kids spring break. (March 11 - 15)  My aunt lives there.

Well, we decided to keep the truck for about 5 more months.  The 2003
Expeditions should be coming out then.  We'll also be buying a new car in
June or July.  I would love to have a Lexus, but the price doesn't agree
with my budget.  I'm now considering the 2002 Nissan Altima.  It has the
body style similiar to a Lexus GS300.  I hate car shopping because of the
sly salesmen, but I'll do my homework beforehand.

What's new with you?  How's your mom, sister and brothers doing?

Fine, I was thinking of you earlier today.  Just had a bite to eat and just
sitting here surfing the net.  Looking for some good vacation spots.   just
happened to be looking at Arizona for the heck of it.

How is you day going so far?  Already had lunch?  How did the car shopping
trip go on Saturday?
