Well, Robin isn't pleased at all.  She thinks that he's extremely rude and
arrogant.  I have mixed emotions.  I enjoyed most of his songs, but I won't
like his style all the time.  There has to be a mix.

   I called you last night with Robin, to tell you the stunning news.
   Effective next week, V. Michael McKay will be over us.  He is going to
   take
   us to the next level!  Can you believe this?  What are your thoughts?
