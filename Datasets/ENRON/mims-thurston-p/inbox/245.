Well, I wouldn't have anyone to take care of my kids.  Siera has
cheerleading practice from 6:30 - 7:45pm.  Afterwards, it'll be homework.
They got to bed late last night and were extremely tired this morning.  I
promised them they'd be in bed by 9 or 9:30 tonight.  I'll see what I can
do.

Tasha,

I'm so sorry to hear that things are getting hectic again.  I definitely
know what that feels like.  Do you think we could get away without the kids
for an hour or so this evening?  Even if it's late..I need to see you and
talk to you.  I still need to check with Todd to see if he's working
tonight or what, but let's see what we can find out!

   Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I really
   don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He has
   threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
   scared.
   I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so bad,
   and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing to
   do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
   chooses
   not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial difficulties.
   This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I don't
   know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him has
   done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more he
   could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids and
   what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that I
   do
   to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.

   Nytasha
