Hi, Patrice.
We are in the process of putting a proposal together for a customer.
The months and volumes are outlined in the attached Excel spreadsheet.
It's probably exactly what Enron is not looking to do, but just in case,
I thought I would send it to you.  If you are interested in putting
together some numbers, please let me know.
Thanks.
Kaztex Energy Management
