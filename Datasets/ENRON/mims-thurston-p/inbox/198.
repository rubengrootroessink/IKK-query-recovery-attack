I know that it's in the IT department and that's it :o)

Everything is going okay, thanks so much for asking. It is definitely a lot
of work, one thing after another. I'm glad to know that Jordan is excited
:o).

We love going to good 'ole' Chuckie, you see I said we because I LOVE their
pizza. The children really have a good time there too plus it wears them
out!

I ain't mad at the little boys Kenneth Coles because I sure do love their
shoes..... ha! I know that moma Thurston don't play that nonsense when it
comes down to service. People are just getting besides themselves these
days. I almost went off in Olive Garden yesterday because of poor
management service but my girlfriend didn't want me too. I am so mad at for
wanting to SET IT OFF, you are too kicks (Louisiana talk o:))

My weekend was okay. I picked up some cake tasters that this one bakery we
have in mind baked for us. They gave us 4 samples, I chose Italian Creme,
Carrot Cake, Amoretto White and Mark chose a Chocolate Fudge and they were
good except for I don't eat chocolate cake. I pick up another sample cake
on tomorrow and then one more probably this weekend. Saturday I was with
Danny most of the day and that was it.

Girl, what is PMO?  I'm doing fine, I just sent Tarsha an e-mail, and I hit
the send button and there you are!  Is everything going as planned in all
of your wedding preparations?  I certainly hope so.  I know planning a
wedding is alot of work.  Jordan is still excited about walking with
Taylor.

I had a good time with my boys this weekend.  They are crazy.  We went to
the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to
get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was
there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute,
fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they
were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys.
$65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what
the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither
one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a
pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed
and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost "set if off" at the
Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was
unacceptable.  Anyway, don't mess with Moma Thurston.

How was your weekend?

See ya!

   Hi Patrice:

   How are you today? I am wondering if you know who is over the PMO
   department over there at Enron. My cousin in Austin received a phone
   from
   them regarding employment and is curious about it.

   Regards,
   Hope
