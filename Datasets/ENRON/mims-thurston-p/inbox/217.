I would have expected you to have received delivery by now.  I am faxing
you a copy and will check with FedEx on the delivery status.

Hey Rob,

I haven't heard or seen anything yet on the executed contract?  Is
everything okay?  I'll be out of the office traveling next week, and I
wanted to get a status before I left.

Thanks

   Patrice
   I will be having this signed and sent to you tomorrow morning.  As we
   have
   gone back and forth a few times, please let me know if you see anything
   that does not reflect our final determinations.  I have included both
   the
   redline and the final versions.
   Thanks
