Subject:	Contact List

Please find attached spreadsheets showing the Top 50 gas customers and the Top 50 power customers, showing the internal rep for gas contact, power contact and PA contact.

As discussed in our meeting today, every Master User for each company should be contacted, unless it becomes known that a particular Master User is not responsible for either gas or power.

The person identified under the "PA" column beside a company will be responsible for calling the Master Users for that company. If all the Master Users have not been contacted within 2 days of the "Green Light" for PA marketing, the NetcoOnline marketing team will place the calls.

You will shortly receive a PA marketing pack. This pack will contain:

	a) Copies of PA's and ETA's, which you can fax to customers
	b) Frequently Asked Questions
	c) Key Messages

If you have any questions about the NetcoOnline process or the PA process, please contact the NetcoOnline marketing rep identified in the "Netco" column on the spreadsheet.

Thanks,

Dave
