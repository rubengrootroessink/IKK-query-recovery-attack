Girl please.  I don't know all those hyms myself.  I left right after you.
I tried to flag you down in the parking lot, but no, Sis. Thurston was
burning rubber.

Siera's doing much better in math, but she's had a few, low language
grades.  She's only been tutored once.  Today will be the 2nd day and
she'll be there two hours instead of one , because Steve picked them up
early on Monday, forgetting that she had tutoring.  Please continue to pray
for her.
How's Jordan doing?  What did his teacher want this time?

We really do need to go to a spa.  I have a gift certificate to Institute
Clarins inside Saks Fifth in the Galleria.  I'll use that soon.

I really didn't enjoy rehearsal last night.  I don't know what the problem
was.

Hey Sister Sims,

You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir
rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a hard
time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need to
look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going well
for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan
and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very immature.
She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.

You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and
talk.

Write back

   Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to be
   EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
   Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't
   in
   Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make
   you
   feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
   feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

   I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
   plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

   I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?
   I
   was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang
   with
   the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
   Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what
   all
   the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

   After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving
   a
   small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but
   Steve
   asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much
   he
   loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He
   also
   apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
   for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
   treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
   speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
   like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know
   what.
   He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
   snuggle
   up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
   immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He
   then
   jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if
   he's
   6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so
   just
   go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't
   ask
   where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
   don't have time for his mess.

   So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

   Nytasha

   Hey girl,

   What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really
   could
   have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
   had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and
   they
   had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
   nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
   6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating
   at
   6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl,
   Ms
   Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
   semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
   stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
   length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top
   that
   I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I
   wore
   my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
   wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high
   heel
   sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
   When
   I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
   "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
   husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take
   some
   pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

   We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
   said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
   entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

   Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I
   was
   wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that
   she's
   back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

   How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll
   get
   a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
   until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
   Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change
   too.
   Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.
   All
   we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
   independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break
   and
   new environment.

   Oh well, talk with you later!

   Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

      Subject:  Hello

      Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
      extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her
   report
      card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
      sickness.
      I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but
   she
      still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
      4th
      grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up
   in
      prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
   she's
      dumb
      and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
   letter
      last
      night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
      not.
      She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt
   me
      so
      bad.

      Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
      best
      thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

      How's the school search going for Jordan?
