Dear Patrice,

Here is the link for the presentations from the recently completed LDC Forum - Gas Storage Strategies and Market Center Hubs, September 10-12, 2001 in Chicago.  We hope that, by making copies available to you in this format, you will  get additional value/information from the Forum.

Click here:    http://www.interchange-energy.com/presentations.htm
to see a listing of the speakers and then click on each presentation you would like to review.

Thank you for your support of this Forum and God Bless America!
