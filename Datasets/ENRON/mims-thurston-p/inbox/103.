Subject:	Enron/BP/Crestar Apr10 Conversation re AOS Gas


The following is a summary of our conversation on Tuesday, April 10  re
communication time lines:

8:55MCT
   By this deadline, Gerry Kurtz will phone Elizabeth Bartnes with the AOS
   volumes (if any) to be purchased and transported by BP to Enron.
   KeySpan will indicate the BP AOS decatherms to be sold to Enron, as well
   as the E3M3, GJ and delivery point for the Crestar gas to be sold to BP.

9:00MCT
   By this deadline, Gerry will phone Mark Schrab of Enron to advise him
   whether and how many decatherms of AOS will flow to Enron and how much
   will be provided by each of BP and Crestar.  The relative share of AOS
   gas to be provided by BP and Crestar will not necessarily be prorated
   according to their shares of the 51,100 Mcf Contract Capacity.
   At this time, Mark will likely have a good idea of the downstream
   volumes, contracts and pipelines applicable to at least the BP portion
   of the AOS supplied to Enron.  He will first respond to the offered BP
   AOS supply by providing the BP information (if available) verbally to
   Gerry, and will follow up by confirming to both Elisabeth and Gerry in
   an email/spreadsheet shortly after.
   It is understood that Enron is under no obligation to accept an AOS
   nomination if KeySpan misses the 9:00MCT deadline.

9:45MCT
   As described above, before this deadline Mark will have sent an email to
   both BP and Crestar detailing the destination(s) of the BP AOS sale to
   Enron.
   By this deadline, Mark will then send an email/spreadsheet to Gerry
   regarding the destination(s) of the Crestar Firm and AOS sales to Enron.
   It is understood that Enron will be responsible for any pipeline
   imbalance or other charges if Enron does not meet the 9:45MCT deadline.

10:30MCT
   By this deadline, both BP and Crestar will nominate their respective
   supply volumes to Alliance for delivery to Enron and its markets.
   BP or Crestar will be responsible for any charges which they may cause
   Enron to incur if they fail to nominate to Alliance by 10:30MCT.

If I have missed any details, please let me know.

Jim
