I do not remember his mother's name.  I know his sister name, Brenda Coates.  His name is Ronald Antonio Coates.  I have tried as close as I can get to his old friends.  My brother in law is his friend.  I am going to try to ask cust service to see.  My other direction is to call the University to find maybe an address.  I was told he might live in Kansas, but that is not for sure.

Girl, you're a mess!  Although, you are causing me to smile "in the midst
of it all".  You really do need to find this guy.  What's his full name?
Have you tried the internet?  Have you tired any old friends?  Surely,
someone knows him or know's where to contact him.  Come on girl, let's go,
go. go!  You REALLY need to find him!  Please write back and tell me his
full name,  Does he have gas service in his name at Nicor??  Does his momma
have gas service with Nicor or do they live in the city?  Come on!!!

   Last night i could not sleep.  I really need to find my friend, just to
   remove him from system.  Last night I had a dream I found him.  The guy
   here at work called him for me.  He was not married, but had a daughter.
   His feelings were mutual.  He had come to Chicago and rented a limo so
   that we could have an evening alone.  We did not have any sexual
   activity.  We did a lot of catching up and sharing of feelings.  He
   would send me flowers and he wanted to buy me an expensive gift, but i
   told him that was not necessary, but he did it anyway.  His last
   statement to me was that i let you get away before, but i will not from
   this day forward.

   I wanted to ask the person who had the prohetic reading to take a look
   at both pictures (Frank, Ron) to see which man was the one in the dream.
