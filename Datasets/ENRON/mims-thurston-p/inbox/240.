Hey Tricey!!!!!!!!!

You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress but
the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)

Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a girl
and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question :o)
Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to walk
with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with the
biggest smile on her face.

Love ya!
