Patrice,
Please see the below comments from my attorney.  Let me know if we can work
with this.
Thanks

I suggest revising that sentence as follows to avoid any potential conflict
within the terms of the Guaranty itself and to accommodate Enron's
reasonable request for a specific number of days:

     " . . . and shall be deemed sufficient notice that, subject to
Paragraph 9 of this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to pay the Obligations
within 7 business days after receiving the Payment Demand."

Hey Rob,

We have one more comment for you to consider:

We must have a definitive number of days in case, "Enron makes a demand on
this guaranty".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How
about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must
have a definitive number of days.

Your turn!

   Rob,

   I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference
   to
   "must pay within 5 business days" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does
   make
   a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
   those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party
   to
   provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand
   under
   a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments
   where
   appropriate.

   I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

   I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
   authority.

   Finally, I reinserted "excluding choice of law provisions . . . "
   language
   to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

   All told, most of the changes look fine.

   Thanks.

   Ernie
