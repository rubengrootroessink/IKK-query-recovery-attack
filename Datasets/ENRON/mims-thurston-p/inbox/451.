 "His & Her" Watch Set   - Without the High Price Tag!   They say if you truly want to know how much money someone makes ... just look at their wristwatch. If they're really well off, chances are they're wearing (or own) a watch like this. Individually, these magnificent quartz watches draw   immediate attention, but when worn next to someone you love - they tell the world you are inseparable.   Now, thanks to an exclusive arrangement with the distributor, we are able to offer BOTH of these fine watches for a mere fraction of their appraised value. Each set is shipped with a certificate of authenticity. Was $129.95 .. yours only $19.98 pair (Set of 2).   Click Here To Order
