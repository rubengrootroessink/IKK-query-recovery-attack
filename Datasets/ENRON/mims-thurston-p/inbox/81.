Wow, I am really sorry to hear about your Dad!  I know how close you two
were/are.  I am so glad you know he is in a better place....its just hard
when you miss someone so much.

I am so so glad to hear you are loving you job!  A great boss makes all the
difference ...you were a great boss so its only fair you get one too.  I
really loved Middle Marketing, it was the most creative and challenging job
around and it has a lot of fringe benefits (boone-doggles, etc).  I have
heard Laura Luce's name quite a bit but I never heard anything personal
about her so I am glad to hear she is nice and smart!

It surprises me a little bit to hear that Jordan broke his arm, I would
expect that it would have been Kendall since he sounds so gregarious and
outgoing.  I bet it broke your heart to see that!  Ouch!  I am sorry to hear
about Suzy financial situation, I can really relate since I recently took a
big hit to my retirement fund and (including Enron Options/stock).  Its
kinda strange how much security money can give you.  Luckily I have been
able to keep it in perspective but it has been alittle bit of a ride.

Your house will feel new with new paint.  New paint just makes everything
new.  We also just finished a kitchen remodel and I love it.  I brought out
the big guns and got granite countertops.  We also put in recessed lighting
(instead of florescent), new crown and base molding, new tile, paint and I
added bead-board to my island so that it looks more like a separate piece of
furniture.  It looks good.

Thanks for the heads up on Julie.  I had lunch last week with Greg McClendon
and told me too.

LUNCH, HOW ABOUT FEBRUARY 4TH?  I know that seems like a long time away but
since the MDO program follows the school year, they are always out!  Alex
and Conner go to school on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9 to 2.

Talk to ya soon,

J
