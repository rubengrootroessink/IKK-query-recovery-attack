Veronica,
Attached is the Guaranty Amendment for Nicor Energy, L.L.C., which adds financial transactions to the existing guaranty.  Please copy Jim Hunt at Nicor (jhunt@nicor.com) on you message.  Once received from Nicor, the Amendment needs to be countersigned by ENA.  We will also need a copy for our files when fully executed.

Please call me if you have any questions.

 

Stephanie
