Patrice--I'm working on the reconciliation and I've noticed that in Sitara for deal 1084719, the pricing is at Citygate GD for day 16. Did you go back in and change this? Let me know b/c the pricing is coming across in Unify as $2.29 rather than the $2.22833 you put in for the rest of the month.

I'll send you the spreadsheet as soon as it's done......

Thanks!
