Hey girl,

How's it going?  Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two 
days.  I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home 
until 11:00 p.m.  By the time I got the kids to bed, it was almost midnight 
and I was sick about keeping them up that late.  Last night, I went to the 
grocery store, came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham, macaroni and 
cheese and green beans.  After we relaxed for a while, we started getting 
ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m.  I was 
exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night.  I woke up around 
1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed.   I was 
tired.

This evening I made a nail appointment.  My nails look like "do-do".  I would 
like to get a new set tonight, but we'll see if we get off early enough for 
that.

Daddy sent me a e-mail today, he had two really bad days on Wednesday and 
Friday, but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today.

Talk with you later!
