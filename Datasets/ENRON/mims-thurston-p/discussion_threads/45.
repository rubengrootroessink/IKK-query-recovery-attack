Hi Monique,

We have a mutual friend, Natasha Sims.  Natasha and I attend the same church 
and sing in the choir together, and we were talking yesterday about Mary Kay 
products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same 
place.  What a coincidence!  To top it all off, I received an e-mail from 
Angie Collins and your name was also on the e-mail, so I said, "I have got to 
send her an e-mail".  Well, anyway, I would like to order some products.

I would like the cleanser for normal skin, a concealer in the ebony bronze, 
and a black liquid eyeliner.  Please let me know if you have these items in 
stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up!

  Thank you so much.

Patrice
