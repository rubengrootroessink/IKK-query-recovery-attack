Hi,

Welcome back, I trust you had a good vacation.Nothing much going on here, 
just huge price moves.

Anyway, everything we well, for the most part.  As far as Alliance gas is 
concerned, the only new information is that the Aux Sable commissioning 
process will not start until Wednesday (last estimate) per Anne Buschal.  So 
make sure to mention to Hunter on Monday, as everyone else should already 
know about it.  Anne's number is 403-517-6270.  She will be calling each 
Morning.

My logon and password is: pmims and louise8mom.  Please look at the Nigas 
Troy Grove Sheet that I have on my computer.

My position should be around 15 long, just enough to cover rolloff for 2 
days.  If its not, please buy/sell to get me close to that number (or 
whatever is best depending on which way the market is going).


P.S. I'm selling to Clark Refining at the Illini Point, 4,000/day @ Sitara # 
436296.  He wants us to keep them on until he calls to tell us otherwise.   
His number is 314-854-9644 Dteve Brown.

I'll be back on Wednesday.
