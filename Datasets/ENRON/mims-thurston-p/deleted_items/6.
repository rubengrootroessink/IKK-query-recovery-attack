"For the first time in years I am able to enjoy sex as much as my husband. 
He says the feelings during sex remind him of when we were first married."
Wendy - 51 years old
Several studies have shown that in excess of 40% of females suffer from
some type of sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction has been divided into 
four subclasses. Three of these four subclasses can be attributed to a 
decrease in blood flow to the female genitalia. In particular, the lack of 
blood flow to the clitoris makes reaching orgasm very difficult or impossible 
to obtain. Vitara? causes increased blood flow instantaneously to the 
genitalia, which, with manual stimulation has shown to allow women to 
experience an orgasm. Also, the natural-occurring estrogens and hormonal 
precursors found in the yams and DHEA increase vaginal moisture.Click Here for More!
