How can I afford to give away the camera people have paid as much as $65 for?"

Simply put, I can't. At least not to everyone, but you were smart enough to request free products from your-free-present, so you're entitled!

But here's the catch! There is very limited supply - we will not be getting this camera again and folks have been ordering this camera like crazy.

In fact, just before I sent this email my inventory quantities showed only 83 left. So, I need you to click the link below so I can ship yours before they're gone! Do it now, and I guarantee you'll be one of the very lucky folks to receive this terrific camera - FREE!

<>, I look forward to sending you more top quality products in the future. However, if you don't want to receive emails with free merchandise (although I can't imagine why!) simply click the link below and we'll pass your offer on to someone else.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks!
