Yes this is an Enron company.  You're right, just like old shoes and I hope everyone is well taken care of.

The confirmation for deal 1060746 was faxed this morning to Emma.  I called her and left her a message that if the confirmation was not received to please get back with me.

I also wanted to let you know that October 22nd is my last day.  I have accepted a position  with Freight Markets.  I am in the process of training Sean Riordan who will be taking my place.
