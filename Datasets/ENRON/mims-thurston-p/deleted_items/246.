 <p>PATRICE,</p>
 <p><font face="Arial">In the last few weeks alone, over
 1,000 people have taken advantage of an unprecedented
 opportunity exclusive to our<i><b> </b></i>Elite members.&nbsp;
 We wanted to give our Elite members one more chance
 to get involved before Mr. Hansson went public and
 made this offer available to anyone.&nbsp; It took
 some begging, but thankfully he agreed to put off
 the public release for one more week.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial">If you're unfamiliar with what
 this is about, read on, it's incredible.&nbsp;</font>
 </p>
 <p><font face="Arial">A very prominent and successful
 businessman out of Seattle, Washington by the name
 of Theodore Hansson has decided to split the profits
 with you 50-50 on very lucrative deals using a very
 simple technique that big business is trying to keep
 secret.&nbsp; Not only is it realistic to make up
 to $5,000 per deal, Mr. Hansson takes ALL the risk
 away from you by providing ALL the money needed for
 YOU to complete highly profitable deals.</font> </p>
 <p><font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.m-ul.com/e/c.cgi?j=20020114_25&e=1736394363&r=u1970&d=6&p=1">Find
 out how you can get involved with Mr. Hansson by<br>
