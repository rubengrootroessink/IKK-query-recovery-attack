Hi Val,
I know you don't know me that well, but I am a minister at my church and I =
am in charge of the prophetic ministry there. I train people to operate pro=
perly in prophetic ministry if they have a prophetic gift. I have a team of=
 people that I work with.

I just wanted to let you know, when I got on the elevator a little while ag=
o, my prophetic gift activated.  Sometimes it happens when I least expect i=
t, but that's God.   Anyway, when I looked at you, I clearly heard the Lord=
 say, "I am going to bless her immensely in the days to come.  Everything t=
hat has been taken from her, I will restore. I will restore to her, healing=
 and joy." God is even going to restore material things to you.  It will be=
 just like Job, the end of your story will be greater than the beginning.  =
 I seen you with this man and you were so happy.  You have went through a l=
ot of devastation emotionally and God said He is going to restore you.  The=
 husband I seen in the vision loved you so much, a portion of your healing =
will come through him by God, but ultimately all healing comes from the Mas=
ter.  God has already begun the healing process in you.  I have watched you=
 over the past few months and I could tell something was wrong with you, bu=
t recently, a change has taken place for you in the spirit realm and God is=
 doing a work in you, strengthening you and reshaping you.  You are going t=
o be ok and so blessed in the end and God will get the glory.  He loves you=
 and He cares so much about you.   He wants you to know that He is doing th=
e work that you cannot.

Stay encouraged because you have the victory!
Love,
June
