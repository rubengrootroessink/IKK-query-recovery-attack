Subject:	ALLIANCE WINDFALL OUTAGE

I was just talking to Alliance about how they are going to handle the Windfall outage for June 5th and 6th.  Alliance is 95% sure that they will be taking AOS to zero for the weekend prior to the outage, so this will mean AOS will be zero for June 2-6 inclusive and the plants will be affected for Gas Days 5 and 6 only.

Any questions give me a call 

Thanks

Liz
