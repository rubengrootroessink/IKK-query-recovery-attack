Due to a variety of circumstances we did not migrate employees to the UBSWE environment tonight (Monday, February 4, 2002). We will communicate further details of the migration plan on Tuesday, February 5, 2002.

Thank you for your cooperation in advance, please contact the Resolution Center at x 3-1411 should you have any questions.
