Patrice,
I know you guys are in a new building now.  Would it be possible if you could fax over your new address on letter head?  Our fax number is 630-983-4583.

Patrice my home life really has me sick to my stomach.  I am so angry at him, I would like to scratch his eyes out.  Pray for me.  It just isn't fair.
