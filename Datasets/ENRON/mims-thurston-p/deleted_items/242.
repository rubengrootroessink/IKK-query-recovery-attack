I will see the apartment on Sat.  I am also going to see the lawyer on Thur=
sday.  I joined church on Sunday.  I will be putting my house up for sale. =
 There is only 22 days left to Denver.  Marcus knows scriptures by reciting=
.  He can read Spanish.  He is now taking spelling tests.  He is pretty goo=
d in math.  I am going to the gym at 11:30 and shall return at 12:30.  I am=
 really trying hard not to fall in the mode why did he do this to me, I did=
 not deserve any of this.  When I see his demeanor toward me, like he has n=
ot done any damage makes me sick.  For the past two weeks I have been sleep=
ing in the other room.  R.C. only brought it my attention, have I ever thou=
ght about using protection with him, because of his (Frank) activity.  Ther=
e is a lot on my plate.  I do not see how I am making it.  Have a party at =
some park district and bring in a clown to make faces, sing songs, or play =
games.  You can also have a party at the YMCA, using the gym or swimming po=
ol.  Keep me in your prayers.

Yes, my sister, you have been heavy on my mind.....is everything okay with
you?  How are the proceedings coming along?

Everything on my end is okay...still a lot of unanswered questions and i'm
just waiting to get answers.  The positive is that we do have a buyer for
the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation,
whereby, nobody was interested.  Thank God that did not happen.

I've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week, and as usual, i'm
wracking my brain trying to decide what to do,  I detest parties on
Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds.  Got any ideas?

By the way, has Marcus learned how to read yet?  Jordan tells me he really
wants to learn how to read, and I want to make sure that my baby is not
behind the rest of the pack.  I went to the library yesterday and checked
out about 7 books for my baby.  We are some reading fools these days.

Write back!!!!

   When this email reaches you, I pray that you are fine and well.  Just
   because I have not spoken to you, does not mean I don't MISS YOU.
