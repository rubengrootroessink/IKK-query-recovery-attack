Dear PATRICE,

STOP PAYING YOUR LONG DISTANCE BILL!

For a limited time, we're giving away FREE LONG DISTANCE FOR LIFE!
That's right, you'll receive long distance minutes absolutely FREE when
you sign up for a FREE 30 day trial with Premia. You can kiss those long
distance bills goodbye! Click below to find out more!

NO! This is not an offer to get you to change your long distance company.
