Hey Patrice,
I realize that you are a busy girl, but I would appreciate it if you could find some time to fill out the performance evaluations for Margie Straight and Jessica White.  Your opinion does matter in that these girls are new to the gates and I need to make sure that you feel that your needs are addressed.
Thanks Lisa
