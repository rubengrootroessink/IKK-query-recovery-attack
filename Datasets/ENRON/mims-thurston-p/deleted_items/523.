Originally we sent you this but now this is what we need to have set up:

We asked for

PGLC/NBPL/NBPL should be NBPL/Peoples/82 - Northern Border Manhattan
PGLC/NGPL/NGPL should be NGPL/Peoples/909285 - NGPL Peoples
PGLC/TTP/TTP should be PGLC/TTP/TTP - This was formerly PGLC/NGPL/909285 which is and INCORRECT meter on PGLC's side.  PGLC/TTP/TTP is the POOL for PGLC.  This product should be called Peoples Pool on EOL rather than PGLC/NGPL/Non Pool

Let me know

Cora, and Jad,

Please take a look at these two test deals that Patrice has requested.  I am still waiting on global to get the tradezone TTP added. I will let you know as soon as I hear from Sylvia Campos.  In the mean time please take a look at the other two test deals in sitara Parallel.  The deal numbers are as follows:

Nicor/E.Dubuque = 4037411
NBPL/Manhattan = 4037412

Please get back to me ASAP if these two products look good, and we can release them for production.
Thanks
TARA

Everything right now is currently mapped to PGLC/NGPL/909285 when deals are done on EOL.  THere are deals out there right now with this meter for future months.    These deals will need to be changed to PGLC/TTP/TTP manually.  The meter PGLC/NGPL/909285 should not be used after these new trade zones are set up.

This is how it needs to be set up :

PIPE/TRADE ZONE/FACILITY:

PGLC/NGPL/NGPL
PGLC/NBPL/NBPL
PGLC/TTP/TTP - We need to set up this trade zone.  Spoke with Russ Severenson

Torrey,

I know you had asked me in the past to go ahead and pass on to you traders which are pressuring us to get stuff out.  Do you mind calling or e-mailing Patrice Thurston-Mims and explaining to her the enormous back log we have in the testing area and the under staffed that we are.  Let me know if you any questions.
