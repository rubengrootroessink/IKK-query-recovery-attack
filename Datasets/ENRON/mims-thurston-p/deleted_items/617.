You With your knowledge, experience, and all those who know you, you would never have to worry about finding another job.  You might have to leave TEX.  But, mirant and elpaso is growing, just as well as AEP and Aquila.  There are a lot of rainbows on you side.  :)  By no means should you ever be worried.
