In an effort to remain up to date with your goals and expectations for your investment portfolio, we recommend an annual meeting. This will give us the chance to catch up on changes in your life, review your asset allocation, the current market conditions and any possible changes in income and estate tax laws.

Since we are entering the last quarter of 2001, we feel it is time to conduct your review. Please review the attached document to begin the process for your review. Simply complete the form and return to us via fax, mail or email.

Many of our clients are located out of state, we will conduct your review over the phone.

If you do not feel it is necessary to review your financial plan at this time, please complete the top half of the attachment and return it to update our records.

As always, we appreciate the confidence you place in us and we hope to work with you toward your financial success for many years to come.

We look forward to meeting with you soon.

Sincerely,



Stephen M. Benotti
