ow
How are ya doing?  I hear you are doing  origination now with Laura Luce (sp?).  Are you liking it?  I have  been thinking of  you.
 
Me and the boys are just doing nothing but fun kids  stuff.   They go to Mothers Day out about twice and week from 9:00 to  2:00 and I really enjoy my alone time...  I have been trying to update my  house since we will be here for a while.  I updated my kitchen and am  redecorating the boys room.  I am also getting the entire upstairs painted  but the paint I picked might be a little dark.  I have a hard time picking  colors and paint but I am sticking with it for at least a year before I  repaint.    I think the color is starting to grow on me  already.
 
Hope the boys are doing great, I know they can be  handful!
