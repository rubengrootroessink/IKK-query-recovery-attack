Hi Patrice,

I'm going to get an earlier flight in on Monday. I'll leave Houston at 7:20 and arrive Indianapolis at 9:42. I'll just take a cab to the hotel that night. This is much better so we don't have to worry about being late. 

On a side note--Jason will be calling you regarding some HS numbers. Did you find anything out about the contract and what it says about the delivery point? Are we going to discuss that there? Also, I'm going to try to talk with Lisa Mellancamp and find out exactly which topics are off limits. I know you're leaving Monday, but we'll have time to talk about all this on the drive to Terra Haute.
