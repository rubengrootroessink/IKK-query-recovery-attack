There is only 1 week left before moving into the new building.  There are two shredco containers located at EB3206E and in the freight elevator for documents that need shredding.

Remember:

1.  You can only move 6 boxes per person plus equipment
2.  Take home all IPAQ'S, Blackberry's, Palm Pilots and Laptops Friday 11/9/01 so that nothing is misplaced

6.  Please give your User ID and Password to your assistant so she/he can make sure that everything is up and running for you on Monday 	morning.
7.  If you have a headset, please pack it.   They will not be installed until Monday morning.
8.  Since there are no amtels moving, please be sure you have MSN messenger installed in your computer because this is what your assistant 	will use to give you your
