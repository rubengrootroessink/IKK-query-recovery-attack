Yes, I have a reservation at the Westin. What time do you want to head out on Tuesday? Call my room in the morning when you get up and moving around. My cell phone, just in case, is 281-300-3225. 

Jason Williams in credit, Jeff Hodge, and I had a conference call late Friday. You already know everything we talked about I'm sure. Jeff advised that we should have a number in mind that they may be asking for. Hopefully Jason called you...............

See you in the morning!
Valerie

Did you get with Alex to find out what hotel?  It is the Westin.  Also, who is Jason and what are HS numbers?  As far as delivery point, yes, it is the interconnect between Midwestern and Vectren (the LDC).  Please make sure and bring your pipeline statements.  Also, I did meet with Jeff Hodge, our attorney, and I know the details regarding the contract.  I'll be in the office until around 10:30.

Thanks

Hi Patrice,

I'm going to get an earlier flight in on Monday. I'll leave Houston at 7:20 and arrive Indianapolis at 9:42. I'll just take a cab to the hotel that night. This is much better so we don't have to worry about being late. 

On a side note--Jason will be calling you regarding some HS numbers. Did you find anything out about the contract and what it says about the delivery point? Are we going to discuss that there? Also, I'm going to try to talk with Lisa Mellancamp and find out exactly which topics are off limits. I know you're leaving Monday, but we'll have time to talk about all this on the drive to Terra Haute.
