 <p align=center><b><font
 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=red
 size=5>Welcome and let us introduce you to the best kept secret in
 the financial markets today. A secret that your
 bank would like to keep to itself.</font></b></p>
 <p align=center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size=3><b>WHAT IS THIS BIG SECRET AND WHY DOESN'T YOUR BANK </b></font></p>
 <p align=center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size=3><b>WANT YOU TO KNOW IT??</b></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The
 secret is Tax Defaulted Paper and the reason
 they don't want you to know about it is simple
 .For decades they have been using your passbook
 savings and CD money at low, low, low rates
 of interest to purchase high yielding Tax lien
 and deed certificates. </font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>How
 does this sound? Your bank borrows your money
 at 3% and uses that money to purchase tax lien
 certificates at 24%. <b><u><font color=blue>That
 is a spread of 21% or $2100.00 per ten thousand
 dollars that is invested.</font></u></b> In
 short, you get $300.00 and they get $2100.00
 profit per ten thousand dollars. That is a profit
 to the bank of over 700% on your money. What
 a great way for the rich banks to get richer.
 Up until now, this was a secret known only to
 a select few.</font></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>So
 what is this product? And why is it such a lucrative
 investment vehicle? We call it TDP, Tax Defaulted
 Paper. It's simple and straightforward. Local
 governments are in the business of running their
 government. They have to pay their government
 employees, police, fire, school teachers, pave
 the roads, fix the sewers, run the hospitals
 and public transportation, collect the garbage,
 etc. The money they use does not grow on trees.
 The money they spend is raised from your local
 real estate taxes. As we all know not everyone
 pays their taxes. There are over 3000 counties
 across the United States in need of real estate
 tax revenue. When they can't collect they start
 getting serious about getting it collected.
 This creates a great opportunity for serious
 investors in the know.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=blue
 size=3><b>Hard to believe this is true? In just one day, we bought
 approximately $80,000 in tax lien certificates
 paying 18% and we are currently researching
 tens of thousands of dollars in additional TDP
 that we are planning to purchase.</b></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>What
 kind of owner doesn't pay their taxes and what
 kind of property is this? These properties include
 everything from single-family homes to large
 commercial properties.&nbsp; For example, we
 researched a tax lien on a commercial property
 with a $23,000.00 tax lien levied against it.&nbsp;
 The property was a Walgreen's drug store!!!&nbsp;
 </font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Not
 only does the investor earn 18% on that money
 till Walgreen's pays off, but, he or she gets
 a crack at the underlying real estate worth
 over $1,200,000. That's the possibility of owning
 real estate for just pennies on the dollar.&nbsp;
 <b><u><font color=blue>That investor could be
 you.</font></u></b></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=blue
 size=3><b>Why don't we own it?&nbsp; Someone beat us to it. Timing
 is everything and in this business, time is
 money.&nbsp; Getting started tomorrow instead
 of today, costs you money.&nbsp; Spending months
 or even years trying to learn it yourself, instead
 of letting an expert teach you, costs you money.</b></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>This
 is why our customers buy our programs. We provide
 turnkey programs for the serious entrepreneur
 and investor, with advice and guidance on how
 to take full advantage of this high yielding
 and very profitable industry. Without a doubt,
 this is a multi-billion dollar industry of which
 the true potential has not been tapped. Yes,
 there are other people who know how it works
 but they can't help you get the job done effectively.

 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>I
 know that so far it sounds too good to be true.
 But, it gets even better because investing your
 money our way is risk free. <b><u><font
 color=blue>There is virtually no risk of losing your money.</font></u></b>
 Your money is secured by the underlying real
 estate.How does that work? It's simple, you
 give the local government your money for someone's
 past due property taxes. Then, when the property
 owner pays the back taxes, the county pays you
 back your money plus interest so high you will
 be upset that you didn't know how to do this
 before you lost all that money in the stock
 market. What if the tax lien is not paid off?
 Simple, you get the property. Once again owning
 the underlying real estate for just pennies
 on the dollar.</font></p>

 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Try
 this out for size. If you lost a chunk of your
 IRA?s value and are concerned that it will take
 too long for the market to come back, here is
 your solution. Our programs will teach you how
 to use your self-directed IRA to repair the
 damage done by the market. You can purchase
 TDP?s in your IRA with rates high enough that
 in no time you can replace what you have lost.
 Think of it this way, how long will it take
 for you to double your money at 24% or better?
 Answer! <b><u><font
 color=blue>Less than three years.</font></u></b> Not too bad verses
 a market that will take decades to repair itself
 and doing it in TDP?s is risk free to boot.
 Its kind of like you have your cake and can
 eat it too. Here is a quiz for you. What will
 $5,000 be worth in twenty years growing tax
 deferred at 24%? Approximately $3,174,000.00.
 Not too bad for totally risk free investing.
 Do I need to say more? </font></p>
