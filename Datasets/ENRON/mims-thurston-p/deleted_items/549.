Gas Structuring is starting its "Clean Sweep" process today at 3:00 PM on t=
he 32nd floor.  Clean Sweep is the process that the move coordinators have =
instituted to eliminate unnecessary storage of outdated material in the new=
 building.  So, Gas Structuring will close for business effective 3:00 PM t=
oday and reopen tomorrow morning.  If you or anyone on your team have an ur=
gent matter that has to be addressed today, please make every effort to get=
 to us in time for us to respond before 3:00 PM.  Also, please forward this=
 notice to the persons on your respective teams.  If you have any questions=
, please ask. =20
Thanks,
Ed

PS  The move "regulators" are reported to be providing refreshments and sna=
cks for this event.  As such, we are seeking proposals to "pass through" th=
ese "incentives" to any person or persons who would like to "outsource" our=
 sweep process.  Proposals will be accepted up until 12:00 PM today.  We re=
serve to right to accept all or any part of  any proposal and may or may no=
t negotiate with one or more parties to provide the sweep service.  All swe=
ep outsourcing proposals are subject to move regulator approval.  Any chang=
e in move regulation that results in a reduction in incentives being enjoye=
d by Gas Structuring will require that the outsourcing party keep Gas Struc=
turing whole.  Baseball arbitration for all disputes.  This agreement will =
be governed by Texas Law and we will give the successful outsourcing party(=
ies) our contract to sign immediately prior to work commencing.  No changes=
 to the contract will be allowed since the move regulators have already app=
roved the agreement.  We will answer no questions regarding the size or num=
ber of files to be swept.  You must obtain any information regarding the si=
ze or number of files, type or quantity or refreshments, type and quantity =
of snacks and other such data from public sources.  We will accept cash abo=
ve all other forms of consideration.     =20
