Dear Mrs. Thurston,

Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel:

POSITIVE BAG MATCH
Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft.

DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME
To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002. Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure. All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Customers who buy tickets on or after January 18, 2002 who are not at the boarding gate 15 minutes prior to departure are subject to having their reservations canceled, seats released and checked baggage removed from the flight.

SECURITY FEE
The Transportation Security Administration is requiring that airlines collect the September 11th Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement, not to exceed $5.00 each way or $10.00 per round-trip ticket. This security fee goes into effect for tickets purchased on or after February 1, 2002. It applies to qualifying enplanements from airports in the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. This fee applies to all tickets including frequent flyer reward tickets, two-for-one tickets, tour conductors and infants for whom a fare has been collected.

Continental Airlines continues to make safety our number one priority. Be sure to stay informed with continental.com at:
