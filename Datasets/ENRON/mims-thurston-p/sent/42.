Hi Jeannie,

Several months ago I met with Jennifer Milligan regarding part-time 
employment. I still have an interest in this area, and thought I would drop 
you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within 
the company.  I have no definite time frame, but I do know that I do have a 
strong interest in part-time employment.  Please let me know if anything 
comes up, and also if we need to meet.

I would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment ( 
please do not discuss with Hunter) as I do not want to jeopardize my position 
on the desk or have him thinking that I'm not giving 100% because I'm 
interested in part-time employment.  I've casually mentioned this to him in 
the past, so he's somewhat aware, but probably did not take me very seriously.

Thanks for your help!
