What's happening?  I know you've been busy, I remembered that Thursday night 
is Ciera's (spelling?) review night.  Everything is well here at work and at 
home.  I 'm leaving early today, probably, around 3:00 p.m.  We've had a 
pretty good week and we're ready to go home and start over next week..  Next 
week is really supposed to be cold here and in the Midwest, so it will really 
be a busy work week.

  I think I might try to stop at the mall sometime today, whether it be late 
tonight (you know they're open until 11:00 p.m. I think) or right after 
work.  I will pick up a gift certificate from Victoria's Secret for Samantha 
if I make it out.   Do you want to go in on it, I was going to spend  about 
$25 (believe me, she is looking for a gift!).

 Have you made a decision on the Christmas Party?  We're still going to mine, 
but girl, we have to take the kids over to Todd's mother and she lives in 
Bear Creek and then drive all the way back to Enron Field.  My regular 
babysitter could not do it.  Anyway, holler at me!
