I think we should all stay in the same room, especially if we get a suite at 
embassset suites, with a pull-out bed.  We checked it out and I can get there 
are 7:30 p.m. on America West on Thursday.  The rate is $305.00, a little 
pricey.    Did I tell you that Shawna wants us to come to the rehearsal 
dinner?  I'm trying to figure out when we're going to site see.
