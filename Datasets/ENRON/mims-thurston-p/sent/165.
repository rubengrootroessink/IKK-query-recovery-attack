 Hey Stranger,

  I hope your day is going well. It's been an extremely busy
week for me but I'm still blessed.I thought about you this morning and was
wondering how things were going? Thursday is my day that I'm out in the
field visiting members that are sick and in the hospital. Well, I guess I
won't see you until Sunday, Keep the faith and don't give up.

        Be
Encourage,
        Rev. Jackson
