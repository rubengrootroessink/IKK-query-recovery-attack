Hey Daddy,

What a very pleasant surprise to hear from you in the middle of the day!!!  
Things here are a little exciting, they are asking us to spend the night in 
one of the hotels downtown, as the streets are supposed to ice over tonight.  
So quite naturally, nobody's mind is on work, it's on the weather.  So 
needless to say, I have a little bit of time on my hands.  The boys are going 
over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Todd and I 
will just stay downtown.  I understand that you guys had some bad weather as 
well, I know Mom was out of school.

I will definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids, they will enjoy it 
so much.  Kendall celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun.  Todd 
bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now.  
It's really cute.  On the other hand, Jordan was feeling a little neglected 
because of Kendall's cake and presents, but he's okay.  It was just  a new 
experience, him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys.

Anyway, I'll send your tape.

See you later and I hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basis

Love 

Bernie
