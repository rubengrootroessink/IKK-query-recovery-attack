Hey, how did the appointment go yesterday?  Were you trying to e-mail me 
yesterday?  I received a message regarding returned mail, did you get one as 
well?

I spoke with Val the other day and also said hi to Aunt Ethel.  They seem to 
be fine.  Val and I had been playing telephone tag ( really did not want to 
talk with her because she ticked me off, but I'm over it now) for about the 
last two months, so she finally caught me on my cell phone.  You know I 
always keep my cell phone on when I'm away from the house and office.  The 
number is 713-851-6240.  When I'm at church, the phone is off as well, but 
anyother time, it's most always on.  And of course, my pager number is on my 
business card.

Anyway, please e-mail me back, if you're up an about.

Talk with you soon.
