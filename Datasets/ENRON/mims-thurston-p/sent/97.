Oh Hope,

So nice to hear from you!  I think about you all the time.  I miss not seeing 
you every Tuesday!  Are you considering coming back any time soon?  If not, I 
certainly understand, we are so "messy".  We just finished "Take it to the 
Bridge" and I can say that it was certainly more organized than last year.  
We performed at 4:00 for about 1 hour and we were free the rest of the day.  
A big improvement over last year, although they wanted us there at 11:00 that 
morning.  I just bought a new truck for me and the kids, a 2001 Chevy Tahoe.  
I really like it, but I'm still trying to get used to driving something that 
big, and it sits so high, whoa!!

I certainly am praying, just as you are, that the kids are doing great and 
everything is going great for you.   We'll have to get together and do a 
"afternoon at the park" with the kids.  Take care.

Love ya!

P.S. Now that I have your e-mail address, I'll e-mail more often!
