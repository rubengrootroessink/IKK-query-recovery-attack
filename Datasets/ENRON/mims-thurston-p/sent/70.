Hey Kenny.

Thanks for checking on me.  My trip to Omaha was okay.  On one hand, it
gave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in.  It's
not real good, but he feels optimistic.  You know he has prostate cancer
and I believe it has started spreading into the bones.  He's very, very
weak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn
out.  Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many
places).  He's definitely has his good days and his bad days.  He is taking
regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain,
which he's in half the time.  It's really sad.  He's lost alot of weight,
but he's in good spirits I guess.    To talk to him over the phone or hear
him over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.  It's was really
hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put
on his best act, so that I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to see
your parents going through this kind of suffering.

He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over
matter, along with lots of prayer.

Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't
want her to do it.  Daddy says he's going back to work.  Please pray for
Mom as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really
do.

Talk to you later!
