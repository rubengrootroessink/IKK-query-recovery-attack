Hi Melba,

Will you please create a new product that reads as follows:

The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline 
Company located in Will County, Illinois.

I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting 
for "Chicago LDC-Large end-users" midpoint.

I will need to have the Vector Alliance set up for tomorrow if possible.

Thanks Melba!
