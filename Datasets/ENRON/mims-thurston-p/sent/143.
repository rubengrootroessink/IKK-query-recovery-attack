Girl, isn't that sad about the election results and the recount.  It's really 
terrible.  Everybody over here is watching it very, very closely.  They 
really want Bush to win in a bad way.  I'm tired of hearing about it!   How 
are things over your way.

My day yesterday was okay, Todd cooked us dinner before he went to work, I 
was shocked, but appreciative.  I think I might go car shopping this weekend 
if the weather is nice.

Speaking of church, do you know that Robin told m that Greg lives in million 
dollar house?  Remember when Hope said that his light bill was super high, it 
probably was correct!  We'll need to do a "drive-by" one of these days.  I 
want to see this house!

Talk to you later.
