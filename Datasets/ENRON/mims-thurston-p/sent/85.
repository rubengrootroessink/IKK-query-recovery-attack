Oh I'm glad you sent me an e-mail because there is no rehearsal 
tonight!!!!!   
Tasha said she saw Taylor in the children's church, and I looked for you in 
the audience, but did not see you.  After church let out, I was gone, I was 
home by 1:15 p.m.  That never happens!  I looked for you guys and I said, oh 
well, I'll catch them later.  

By the way, I'm having Jordan's B-Day party on Monday evening, January 22, 
2000 at the Chuckie Cheese on the Southwest Freeway,  Yes I'm having it on a 
Monday night after work (6:30 p.m.) because I can't stand that place, and 
Jordan has his heart set on it.  It's always too crowded and it drives me 
crazy!  So I figure, we'll meet between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. and be out of 
there by 8:30 p.m.  It's not the best plan, but it beats a Friday, Saturday 
or a Sunday.  I'm just inviting about 6 people. so it'll definitely be small  
Let me know if you're interested.

See you soon!.
