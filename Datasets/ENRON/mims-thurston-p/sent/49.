So nice to hear from, it is indeed always a pleasure.  I can't wait until we 
can get together and have a chance to really chit chat.  We're always so 
busy, "A woman's work is never done".  

I did not go to rehearsal the other night myself, I had a customer in town 
and had to take him out to dinner, since he's one of my biggest customers.

I'm looking forward to my 3 day weekend, are you guys working on Monday, 
President's Day?  I'm off and can't wait.

I will certainly keep you in prayer, my child. 

Love you!!
