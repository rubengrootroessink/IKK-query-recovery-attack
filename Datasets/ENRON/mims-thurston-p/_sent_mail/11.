I just called my other friend, her name is Renee Lewis and her home number is 281-484-2380.  She has sang the I Believe in You and Me song mnay times before at weddings and she is familar with Kissing You, but said its a really sexy song,  Have Barbara call her because she has alot of ideas.  She's a professional now and she can suggest all kinds of songs.  Take care!
