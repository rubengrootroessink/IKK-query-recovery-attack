That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the 
fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey 
publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this 
issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a 
magazine for the coupon.  I'm not surprised about Hope, it was such a late 
night.  See you later
