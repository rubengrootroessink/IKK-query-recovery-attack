That's so sweet of you to let me know, but we will not be there this weekend, 
we just went about two weekends ago.   I'm thinking about taking the kids to 
this farm out in my part of town.  My understanding is that it is open to the 
public, but I'm trying to get the name of the place.  Diane Cook has taken 
her kids there, so I'll let you know more about it when I receive the info.   
Jordan has decided that he wants to help feed the farm animals!!!!  (He'll 
probably be scared to death once we get there!)

I noticed Kreme had their Halloween party at school yesterday.  What costumes 
did the kids where?
