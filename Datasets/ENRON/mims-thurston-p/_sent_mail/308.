Hello,

How was your weekend?  My weekend was great visiting with my family.  Everyone is doing fine.   Daddy is doing okay.  The radiation treatments put the prostate cancer in remission, although the Dr. said the cancer would just move to another part of his body.  He thinks it may have moved to his leg,  He had a MRI done last week, and today he will get the results, and he's so afraid he's going to need surgery again.  He's has to use a walker to get around and he's lost so much weight, he probably went from 170 to l00.  It's really sad, he is so small and frail.  He's starting to get his appetite back somewhat.  He sure had a good time eating this weekend.  My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner.  Please keep him in your prayers.  It's so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing help in everything he does, but he's definitely a BLESSED MAN!

How was church services on Sunday?  Did you make it to all the services, (I don't even know why I'm asking, I know you didn't go to all of them, that's a bit much).  Did Greg show out on Easter?  Anything new going on with the choir, did you sing any of your songs.  This month is going to be extremely busy with the revivial and the other church outing.

You know I never did get a  chance to ask you what all you ended up purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day.

Anyway, talk with you later!
