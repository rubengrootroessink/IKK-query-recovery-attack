Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know 
you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab 
over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has had the 
baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to 
spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the 
regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said 
something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing.  
Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call 
you on the way home.

See ya!
