Boy, it looks like this is really going to be a tight, tight, race.  As far 
as your other issue, I would just say very professionally, that "there are 3 
subjects that you are uncomfortable talking about, and they are voting, 
religion and salaries." and just keep it at that.  You also might want to 
add" I hope you can respect my stand on these subjects."

That way, you've communicated your desires in a concise, professional 
manner.  

Talk to you later!
