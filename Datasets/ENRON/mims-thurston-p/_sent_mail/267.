Just tried to call you.  Please call me before you leave, and yes, you 
probably need to leave, but where will you go?

If you go straight hme, emotions are running too high for it to be a safe 
environment right now.  I'm not trusting his reactions or your own right 
now.  You are hurting and sometimes that will cause us to do things that we 
normally would not do.  Please do not put yourself in that position!!!!


Please call me!
