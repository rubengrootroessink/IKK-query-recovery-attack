Hey Rev. Jackson,

Hello sir, how are you?  Well, I tell you Pastor really outdid himself 
yesterday.  I really enjoyed his sermon.  He really has a knack for weaving a 
story and making it applicable to today's events, etc.

Tasha and I got so tickled, watching you sing that song.  You did very well.  
We said, "Look at Rev. Jackson, he's jammin".

Well, anyway, talk to you later!
