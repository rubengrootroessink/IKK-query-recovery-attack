That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon.  I'm not surprised about Hope, it was such a late night.  See you later
