Give me another couple of days, we're still checking.  Did I tell you that 
Carol told me she was waiting on a $1.5 million loan to come through so she 
could pay for Shawna's wedding, as well as take care of her business.   So 
you know we may get down there and there may not be a big wedding, (girl, you 
know how that goes, now who in the hell is going to lend her that kind of 
money?)   You know Carol and Shawna are doing some type of financing of real 
estate, or something like that.  Ralph West came to our groundbreaking 
ceremony we had on Sunday and delivered a sermonette.  He is awesome.  I told 
him I enjoyed his sermon, and he mentioned that he was leaving for Omaha the 
next day.  Do you have acrobat on your computer?  I'll try to send you 
picture to see if it comes out.


Talk with you later.
