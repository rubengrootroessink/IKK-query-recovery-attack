Hi there!

Just checking on you.  Did you make it to practice last night and did 
Lucretia's husband keep the kids? (smile).  If so, what time did you get back 
home, I know it was late.  I went to Auchan's last night to try to see what 
they had in the way of western attire for the kids.  They did not have much, 
and the hats for $2.99 were on back order.    I was looking for western 
shirts for the kids, but they did not have a good selection, so I went to a 
Western store on Gessner.  Boy, what a mistake, they were so darn high.  
Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly.  I walked out saying 
that these people are serious about their western wear.

I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've been listening to them on 
my headphones.  It sure helps alot.  I can get away with it, because we have 
certain weather reports that are produced by Enron, that you have to wear  
headphones to hear, so it looks good.  Plus, the boss doesn't mind.  We 
listen to music just about all day anyway.  Have you heard the Chester D.T. 
Baldwin tape.  I think it's one of my favorites.  Speaking of gospel, is your 
family  still planning on  doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for 
the family reunion?  I was wondering about that!

Have you talked to Sharon and offered her your congrats yet, I want to call 
her, but I don't want to make it seem like Hope is telling all of her 
business.  

Talk with you later!
