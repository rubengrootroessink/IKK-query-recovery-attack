I spoke with Robin last night for a minute.  You didn't tell me how good 
church was on Sunday.   She said Kathy Florence really preached and 
encouraged me to buy the tape!  It must have been awesome!

Anyway, are you going to rehearsal tonight?  How are things going with 
Steve's party and have you set a time yet?  What does he want/need  for his 
birthday?  I know he loves Power Rangers, but is there anything else, maybe 
something you had been planning to buy, (pajamas, underwear, shirt, pants, 
socks, etc.)

Talk to ya!
