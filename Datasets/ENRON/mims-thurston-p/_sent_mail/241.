Hey Girl,

I'm back and I had a wonderful time.  Phoenix is a nice city and very easy to 
get around in.  The weather was a little chillier than Houston, and as a 
result I have a little cold and sore throat.  The wedding was very nice.  The 
wedding itself was in a small church, but somewhat elegant.  The reception 
was "the bomb".  It was in a real nice resort and it was money, money, 
money.  I was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money.  She had 
a reception for around 150 to 250 people.  I'm not good at looking at a crowd 
and judging, but I bet it was around that many folks there.  She had a buffet 
dinner (mainly sandwiches, but they were good), all kind of party favors, 
beautiful cake, 5 layers and each layer was something different, a band, a dj 
and a comedian that had been on BET that they flew in from Dallas.  It was 
really nice.  Again, I hope she did not go into too much debt, but it was 
nice.  She had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride.  We 
went shopping and sight-seeing.  We even went to go find the grade school 
that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix  
many, many years ago.  It was alot of fun actually remincescing (you know 
what word I'm trying to say).

Did you go to church Sunday?  If so, how was it?  I really did miss not going 
to church.   How was the rest of your weekend?  Kids and Steve doing okay?  I 
can't wait to see you tomorrow night, it seems likes it been a long time.

Talk to you later.  I will be home tonight, so I'll call you or you call me 
when we get the kids wound down!
