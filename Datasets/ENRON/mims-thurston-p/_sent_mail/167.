Hey Kenny.

Thanks for checking on me.  My trip to Omaha was okay.  On one hand, it gave 
me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in.  It's not real 
good, but he feels optimistic.  You know he has prostate cancer and I believe 
it has started spreading into the bones.  He's very, very weak, can't walk 
more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn out.  Mom has to 
drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many places).  He's 
definitely has his good days and his bad days.  He is taking regular pain 
pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain, which he's in 
half the time.  It's really sad.  He's lost alot of weight, but he's in good 
spirits I guess.    To talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio, 
you would swear he's in great health.  It's was really hard for me to get a 
true perspective because I know he was trying to put on his best act, so that 
I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to see your parents going through 
this kind of suffering.

He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over matter, 
along with lots of prayer.

Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't 
want her to do it.  Daddy says he's going back to work.  Please pray for Mom 
as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really do.

Talk to you later!
