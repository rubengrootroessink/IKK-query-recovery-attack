Nothing has happened, it seems like he's trying to stick close to home.  I 
came in on Monday night and went upstairs, because I frankly, did not want to 
talk and did not want to get mad in front of Jordan.   I was furious and I 
still am furious.  Last night we had choir rehearsal, so he was in bed when i 
came back.  I really don't want to talk to him right now.   I'll keep you 
posted, because I will be doing it hopefully, tonight!

See you later.
