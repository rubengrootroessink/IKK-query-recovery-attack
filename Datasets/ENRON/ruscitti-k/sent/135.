Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Kevin
