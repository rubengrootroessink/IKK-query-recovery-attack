I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.
