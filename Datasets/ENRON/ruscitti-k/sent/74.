That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the 
Astros are in town that weekend.
I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear 
everything's going well.

I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was 
pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's
smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. 
ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore
me as usual.

Talk to you soon.

P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some 
serious work.  Hopefully it'll be
habitable by the time you see it.
