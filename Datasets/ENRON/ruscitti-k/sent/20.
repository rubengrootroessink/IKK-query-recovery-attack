Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were 
out of town the
last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and 
reflecting.   I think it healthy
to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better 
understanding, I find,
typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more 
happiness in life.
However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We 
all have regrets, but
these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the 
long run.  

I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might 
imagine, I got a kick
out of that.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin
