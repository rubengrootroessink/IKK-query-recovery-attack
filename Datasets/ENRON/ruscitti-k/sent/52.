Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin
