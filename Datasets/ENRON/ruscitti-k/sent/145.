Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.  

Kevin
