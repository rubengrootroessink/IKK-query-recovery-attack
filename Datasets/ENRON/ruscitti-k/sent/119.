You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't 
know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
into some
good red meat.
