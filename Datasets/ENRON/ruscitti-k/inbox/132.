Yo Kev,

What's happening? Hope everything is going okay. How is Lisa and the rest of 
the neighborhood?

It's starting to get cold here. The temperatures are in the high-40's.
Went to Notre Dame last week with dad. It was cool. The campus was 
beautiful; the ride wasn't that bad; and the people were REAL nice (how 
weird?!).

Anyway, dad had a good time, except I think he got pneumonia on the trip. 
"Mr. Sunshine" was dressed up in shorts and a golf shirt for a mid-October 
trip to Indiana. It was 75 degrees when we left Jersey and 45 degrees by the 
time we hit the Ohio border. He can't figure out how he got pneumonia (true 
story). Anyway, I saw him yesterday and he looks and sounds better.

Anyway, Gloria is busy coaching soccer. Her team is 9-4-1 (best record in 
school history). Tommy is busy causing havoc wherever he goes (Takes after 
mommy). His grandparents are driving mommy and daddy nuts (same ol' story).

I hope everything is going all right. Heard the big lobsterfest was a 
success (Nothing like a FRESH Maine lobster). Belated congrats on your first 
anniversary.

Is life pretty tense at Enron (with all the craziness of the world markets, 
terrorism scares and this Anthrax hysteria)? Do you have to go through a 
metal detector or anything like that?

Anyway, I saw Moeller was on TV. Never thought I'd be happy to see his ugly 
mug on the toob!

Well, I've got to go (I'm at work). Talk to you soon.

Love your brother,

PS. Mom and Dad are looking forward to THANKSGIVING with you and Lisa! (Some 
fun, eh?!)

Take care
