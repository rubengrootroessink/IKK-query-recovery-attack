?I could see the Twin Towers burning from my office window in 
Brooklyn.

?When I saw the second tower fall, all I could think of was my son 
in daycare a few blocks from there.  Fortunately, I found he was 
safe.  Our home is two blocks from Ground Zero.  We couldn?t get 
back in for five weeks.  The Red Cross was a safe haven.  When I 
talked about my fears and concerns, they listened.  I felt truly 
cared for.?

Pamela Weadick, New York City

September 11, 2001 forever changed the landscape of our country and 
the life of every American. We have never faced a disaster of this 
size, scope or intensity but we?re meeting the challenge. 
Conversely, we have never before received such overwhelming support 
from the public. Americans like you have responded with an 
outpouring of love, labor, blood and generosity. The American Red 
Cross depends solely on voluntary donations of time, money and 
blood. Without donations from you and others, we would not be able 
to carry out our humanitarian mission.

America has spoken loudly and clearly.  The Red Cross is honoring 
the national call for relief efforts to be directed solely toward 
the people affected by the September 11 tragedies.  The immediate 
and long-term needs of the people affected by the terrorist attacks 
are our highest priority.  We?re moving more money to the families 
of the dead and seriously injured victims quickly by extending our 
Family Gift Program to cover a full year of living expenses, 
providing additional payments for the next 6 months based on need.

25,000 families already have been directly helped by the American 
Red Cross. Through your support of our disaster response efforts, 
millions of meals have been served, tens of thousands of people have 
received mental health and grief counseling, and millions of dollars 
have been dispensed to families in dire need to cover costs of 
transportation, childcare, mortgage or rent payments, funerals and 
related expenses. Thousands of people have been displaced from their 
homes, and the Red Cross is there offering funds for groceries, 
lodging, clean-up and recovery. More than 45,000 Red Cross 
volunteers and disaster workers have worked at Ground Zero where 
they have been caring for construction workers, police, fire 
personnel and emergency medical technicians.

The American Red Cross will spend $275 million in support of people 
affected by the disasters by year end, about half of the $542 
million that has been received to date.  We continue to assess the 
needs of those affected by these tragedies and will offer families 
even more assistance in the months ahead.

The Red Cross was the first organization to give such support and 
has provided more cash assistance to the families and dependents of 
loved ones lost in the September 11 attacks than all other major 
humanitarian service organizations combined. The Red Cross will help 
with recovery efforts throughout the weeks, months and years to come 
? for as long as needs exist.
