Kevin,

I need to follow up with Stacy Dickson on any possible revisions to the GTC.  Also, it has been mentioned to me that the long description that appears on the website should include specific details as to when and how the buyer needs to notify Enron of the delivery point, alternate delivery point, or where they plan to park/store the gas.  I'll get with you on Tuesday after I talk with Stacy about this.

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW
