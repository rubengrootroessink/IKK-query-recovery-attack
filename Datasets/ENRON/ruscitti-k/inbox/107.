Dude,
Good thing I took some of my Pru 401K $$ and bought Enron in February, when
I opened my roll-over IRA.

Besides the job how's everything else going with you and the lovely Lisa?

Things could not be more hectic over here. I'm switching jobs next month.
Gave the dot.com world a shot and timed it wrong. When the company you are
working for is borrowing $$ from the VC to meet payroll and has not locked
in the final round of funding, you know it is time to move along. Will be
joining a NY Real Estate Brokerage House, where I'm friend with the guys.
Will be helping them run their Corporate Service Group.

Lets see what else is going on.

Chrissy is trying to decide if she is going to volunteer for the Merrill
Lynch layoff package that is being offered. I want her to, because her boss
is making her life miserable.

My father had triple by-pass surgery last month. He is doing fine now and it
is probably for the better in the long run that he had the procedure done.

And on good note- My brother got engaged.

I lost Mr. Conway's tele # and email address, can you shoot it over to me.
Would like to drop him a message. Is he still State side? hopefully.

Remember to drop me a note when you finalize your visit back to NJ in
January, so we can hook up.

Tell Lisa and the family that we send our regards,

Jonathan R. Coun
