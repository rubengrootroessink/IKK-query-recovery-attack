This is from someone at the Pentagon.

I just witnessed something I don't think I'll ever forget.  I was down near
the cafeteria in the Pentagon meeting a friend for lunch and I see a very
large crowd of people inside.  I walk in and soon find myself standing less
than three feet away from our Commander-in-Chief and right beside the
Secretary of Defense (and a bunch of Secret Service folks).

President Bush was walking around shaking hands and thanking all of us for
what we do.  He kept saying to people "Don't Worry" -- as if to say, I've
got it under control.  He must have shaken 1000 hands or more.  What
particularly struck me was his presence - not a particularly large man in
stature, but he had an aura of a giant - a smile on his face, yet you can
sense he was a man on a mission - a man of purpose and conviction - there
was just this feeling that he is ! THE MAN, and he is in charge - he had a
quiet confidence that was deafening!

Then, a group of folks just behind me started singing God Bless America
and, in no time, the entire room - which was packed - was singing the song.
It was enough to give anyone goose bumps.  If there was a dry eye in the
place, I couldn't see it (probably because my eyes weren't too dry).  It
was just one of those once in a life time experiences that I shall never
forget.  After God Bless America, there were a few chants of "USA -
USA-USA," followed by a lot of applause.

When President Bush finally made his way toward the entrance, he turned
with his confident smile and waved at everyone, and the room just erupted
in cheers and whistles and applause.  I've been to professional football
games where the noise wasn't that loud.  It was just such a wonderful
experience - and it made me:

1) So very happy that George W. Bush is our president and
Commander-in-Chief.
2) So proud to be an American.

Just thought I'd share.
