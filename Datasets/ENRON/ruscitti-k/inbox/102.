Classmates,

The reunion is rapidly approaching!  I think we have been able to get ahold
of just about everyone now, and it looks like there will be a very big
turn-out ... thanks for taking the time to let us know your plans!!   Also,
special thanks to Constantine for doing a bang-up job on recruiting,
especially among the New York contingent!

Now that we have gotten the word out, its time to collect a few bucks to pay
for these great events!  If you haven't already submitted your Registration
you can do so in one of at least two ways:

1)  Return the flyer from the Alumni Office that you received in the mail.
This has pricing for all the events and should be received in plenty of time
if you send it this week or early next.   Note:  if you didn't get the
packet, then you probably need to update your info on the alumni database --
go to http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/.

2)  Register Online by going to the Reunion Homepage at
http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/reunions.html  (note:  this is a link to
the main Reunion site with info on all events).   There is a secure form
there with all the pricing, info and a credit card processing function.
Nice!

Either way should work, please note that you will only be able to do the
Online Registration through Oct 31st so please get on it!

Couple of points of clarification regarding the pricing and events!

1)  You will see reference to two separate events happening the same
weekend, the Alumni Conference and the various Class Reunions (1996, 1991,
1986, etc)!   Just think of all these events as one series of activities
designed for your reunioning pleasure and pick and choose what you would
like to attend w/ special attention to anything that says "Class of 1996".
For a list of all events, visit the Reunion web site (link shown above).

2)  You will notice that there are two BBQ lunches on Saturday.  There is a
Class of 1996 event at Will Rogers State Park, and there is a separate event
on the North Lawn at UCLA for everyone else.  You can attend either event
(or both for that matter), but I would encourage you to go to the Class of
1996 event because that is where all of your friends will be!

3)  Pricing for the events is listed on the Registration page, but a quick
summary is as follows (simplified version):

Conference Events
---------------------------
Beer Bust (Fri night) - $15/person    Note:  All classes will attend
Building Your Knowledge Portfolio I (Fri day) - $75/person
Building Your Knowledge Portfolio II (Sat day) - $50/person
Alumni BBQ Picnic (Sat day) - $10/person

Reunion Events
--------------------------
Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic (Sat day) - $15/person
Class of 1996 Reunion Dinner (Sat night) - $65/person
Class of 1996 Golf Tourney (Sun day) - $65/person

Package Pricing
--------------------------
Alumni Conference package - $135/person - includes Beer Bust, 2-Days of
Knowledge Portfolio and Alumni BBQ Picnic***
Alumni Conference + Reunion Events - $TBD/person    Note:  this isn't listed
yet, but should be on the site shortly ~$270/person

***Important:  If you buy the Alumni Conference package, which includes a
ticket to the Alumni BBQ Picnic, go ahead and use the ticket to attend the
Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic!   Keep the extra $5 and buy Constantine a beer for
us okay!

4)  The Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic starts at 11:30am and is located at Will
Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades.  Please note that this is different
from Will Rogers State Beach.  The park is located North of Sunset Blvd.
between Amalfi Drive & Chautauqua.  Should be very warm and a great location
for a BBQ!!

Hope this information is helpful, please let us know if you need more!   In
the mean time, the planning continues and we hope this is a great event!

Looking forward to seeing you in LA!!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many, many Reunion Organizers
