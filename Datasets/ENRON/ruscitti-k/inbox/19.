Employee Stock Purchase Plan enrollment runs from May 7 through May 16

Employees of Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI) should receive their enrollment
packets for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) at their work locations
today or early next week. The ESPP allows RRI employees to purchase RRI
stock at a 15% discount through payroll deductions. It is NOT the same
program as the Directed Share Program.

The ESPP enrollment packet contains five items:

   a letter with your ESPP personal identification number;
   a prospectus for RRI;
   a detailed enrollment brochure;
   maps of the automated phone system and Web enrollment tool for easy
   navigation; and
   a beneficiary designation form.

Enrollment for the ESPP will take place between Monday, May 7 through
Wednesday, May 16, 2001. Employees may enroll online, through an automated
telephone service or by speaking with a customer service representative.

If you have not received your packet by Wednesday, May 9 or if your packet
does not contain the correct materials, call Mellon Investor Services, the
record keeper for the ESPP, at 1-866-789-ESPP (3777).
