How did the move go?  Everything inside the four walls?

No, I haven't called Kampy yet.  It's been a mess at work and we've been in
Southern California seeing family the last two weekends.  I just had 3 hours
of training postponed, so maybe I'll get to it today.  The job search is
plodding along.  I've sent out my resume to a lot of places, both for inv.
mgmt. and for Treasury jobs, and I haven't gotten much response.  The
Treasury jobs all want 5 years or more of experience, which I think is a
joke, but maybe they're getting applicants who qualify.  It sounds like we
might have two potential buyers for this company - a change of
ownership/leadership might kill some of the uncertainty.  I don't think I'd
hang around here long-term, but anything that adds some stability is a good
thing.

I think the guy's name was Chris Sevrens.  I knew him vaguely; nice guy, but
one of the I-bankers who was in grad school because he had to be and never
seemed to take it very seriously.  Of course, I probably took it way too
seriously, so what the heck.

We've been out of town (first communion for our niece and a long-overdue
trip to see my mom) the last two weekends so we'll be laying low.  Some
yardwork, some chores, maybe a trip to the beach (11 miles to Half Moon Bay
- can't beat it).  I don't know if I mentioned it, but last summer I read
Kerouac's "Big Sur", which is the last book with the Dean Moriarty group.

I saw that, unbelievable huh?  The sad thing is that the folks I work with
never heard of Jack Kerouac nor "On the Road".
Probably not surprising considering most are from Texas.  How's everything
going?  Did you get an opportunity to call
Kampy.  How's the job search progressing?

Before I forget, was there a guy in our MBA class named Chris Sevrson or
something like that?  An email was forwarded
to me and that name was on the forward list and it sounded familiar.

Any big plans for the weekend?  We're just hanging around Houston.  It
seems every weekend for the past year+ we've
been doing some type of house work.  Hopefully one day it will slow.  Talk
to you soon.

Kevin

   By the way, did  you see the original manuscript for Jack Kerouac's
   classic novel of the beat  generation went for $2.2 million?  Maybe Lisa
   can propose an  appropriate toast at Vesuvio's.

   Boys:

   As I watched the Lakers pound that Texas  team?oh yeah, San Antonio, I
   was thinking about the guy Mr. Ruscitti refers to  as "my boy."  As I'm
   sure you were  both otherwise occupied, you probably missed my boy in
   action this  afternoon.  He was on what he  termed a "power walk
   (catchy, don't you think?)," going door to door with  power-saving light
   bulbs, which he was handing out free of charge to  "emphasize our need
   to conserve energy."   Boy, my boy is one powerhouse.   You think we
   could bottle what he's  got?
