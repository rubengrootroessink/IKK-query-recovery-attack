introduced to the public in June 1994.  In it's first two 
years, the DIRECTV System--an 18" satellite dish, set top 
digital receiver and remote control--became the fastest 
selling consumer electronics product introduction in U.S. 
history, surpassing the VCR and CD player.

DIRECTV has continued to grow at a record pace.  Including 
the acquisitions of U.S. Satellite Broadcasting (USSB) and 
PRIMESTAR in 1999, DIRECTV has already grown to over 10 
million subscribers and become the third largest 
programming provider in the U.S.

>From the start, DIRECTV has been an innovator and 
technological leader.  With the utilization of a growing 
fleet of high-powered satellites in stationary orbit above 
North America, DIRECTV is the first entertainment service

programming to an 18-inch satellite dish.  With over 225 
channels, 31 music channels, sports, movie and 
entertainment packages, special events and near video 
on-demand pay-per-view broadcasts, DIRECTV? programming is 
varied and wide.  In addition, the DIRECTV PARA TODOS? 
service was launched in October 1999, which provides 
Spanish and English programming developed for the US-based 
multi-generation Hispanic households.

DIRECTV continues to break new ground.  With strategic 
partnerships and equity investments in other entertainment,
Internet and multi-media leaders, DIRECTV is creating the 
future of home entertainment today.  By aligning with such 
companies as AOL, TiVo, XM Satellite Radio and Wink, new 
products and services will be launched in the coming months
and years that will lead the way into interactive 
television and home entertainment and services.
