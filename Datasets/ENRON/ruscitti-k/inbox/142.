Dear Kevin, 

 <http://expedia.cq0.net/r/default.asp?R=000088a43000091f3&rfrr=-1410> If you're like us, you've been looking forward to cooler weather, falling snow ... and opening day for skiing and snowboarding! This year, planning that ski trip with family or friends is easier than ever, with Expedia Ski Vacations. Not only will you get low prices, but you can get everything you need for the perfect trip online -- yes, even your rental skis or board and lift tickets! Plus, if you book by November 19, you can get a free ski lift ticket <http://expedia.cq0.net/r/default.asp?R=000088a43000091f3&rfrr=-1410> with your ski vacation. 

Thinking snow? Nothing gets you in the mood for the slopes like a Warren Miller movie <http://expedia.cq0.net/r/default.asp?R=000088a8a000091f3&rfrr=-1410>. Expedia.com is a proud sponsor of the latest thriller from this master of the mountains -- see it in a town near you!
