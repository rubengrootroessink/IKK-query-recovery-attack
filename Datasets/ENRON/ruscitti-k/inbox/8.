=============================

Investment Banking Associate
The Denver office of Tucker Anthony Sutro Capital Markets
("TASCM") is currently recruiting a first or second year
Investment Banking Associate for a full-time position based
in Denver, Colorado.


Job Description

Investment Banking Associates assume immediate
responsibility by working on a broad array of transactions
with a variety of TASCM professionals.  Associates are
exposed to various functional areas of corporate finance as
well as to all Managing Directors in their office or
region.  TASCM Associates are integrally involved in the
preparation of client presentations and transaction
execution.  Successful Associates create, manage and teach
complex, interrelated financial concepts, financial models
and business models.
As they mature, Associates will continue receiving exposure
oriented towards rounding out their transactional and
industry experiences.  Associates generally will be
assigned to one or more industry verticals or product teams
on a priority, but not exclusive basis.  They should be
conversant in all areas of corporate finance, require
minimal guidance in executing assignments to which they
have had previous exposure, and be capable of assembling
flawless client/prospect presentations.  TASCM Associates
are assessed in terms of ability to understand new
concepts, to work effectively on several assignments
simultaneously and to execute high quantities of quality
work.
Associates typically enter the organization with a MBA or
other advanced degree.  Prospective applicants for an
Associate position should possess a strong desire to become
an investment banker and understand the challenges of the
job and its commitments.  Our Associates typically have a
strong background, either through undergraduate study or
career experience, in finance and accounting.  We prefer
individuals with prior investment banking or deal
experience.  All candidates should possess highly developed
communication and client management skills.
The most critical qualifications for a successful career as
an Associate at TASCM are the desire and ability to thrive
in an entrepreneurial environment.  Our client roster
includes many early stage companies working at the cutting
edge of technology and business innovation.  We seek
individuals who think like business owners and embrace the
challenges and opportunities of working on the frontier of
the new economy.
Finally, we look to hire Associates who possess the
intangible leadership skills, character, integrity and
vision required to lead TASCM into the new century.  We
assess every potential candidate both on ability to handle
the responsibilities of the Associate position and
potential to become a Managing Director.
