By the way, did  you see the original manuscript for Jack Kerouac's classic novel of the beat  generation went for $2.2 million?  Maybe Lisa can propose an  appropriate toast at Vesuvio's.

Boys:
 
As I watched the Lakers pound that Texas  team?oh yeah, San Antonio, I was thinking about the guy Mr. Ruscitti refers to  as "my boy."  As I'm sure you were  both otherwise occupied, you probably missed my boy in action this  afternoon.  He was on what he  termed a "power walk (catchy, don't you think?)," going door to door with  power-saving light bulbs, which he was handing out free of charge to  "emphasize our need to conserve energy."   Boy, my boy is one powerhouse.   You think we could bottle what he's  got?
