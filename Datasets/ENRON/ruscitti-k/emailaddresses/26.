Heidi Minyung Suh was born on July 2, 2001 at 12:57PM.  She is a beautiful, healthy little girl weighing 7 lbs 14 oz and 19.5 inches tall.  Both Heidi and mom, Sunnie, are doing very well.  Heidi sleeps and cries when she's hungry and wants milk all the time.  My first daughter Heather thinks Heidi is a play doll, and is somewhat jealous of the attention she's getting.  Our house in Seoul is quite busy with activity with two babies, my parents and Sunnie and I.  Yes, fellas, you can deny it, but you too will become fathers one day.  (Scary thought, eh?)   Apart from the lack of sleep and personal time, it's pretty wonderful!  The JV is doing well, although there's quite a bit of pressure to meet numbers this year.  Hope things are well in Houston for all of you.
