Dr. Ruscitti:
 
You never responded to my last e-mail lo those many months ago.  How are you?  I hear you're a big fan of Gray Davis.  One thing you can say about Gray, he's colorless.  The poor dishrag is laying the blame at you Texans' feet.  But then, why not?  If I have to listen to G. Bush talking about "nucular" power much longer, I'm going to blame everything on Texas.
 
How's marriage?  How's Enron?  I hope all's well, and that you're about to expand your family.
 
If you have any news, or plan to be out this way, please look me up.
 
Best,
 
Tim
