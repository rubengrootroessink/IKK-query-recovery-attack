O.K.
The lobsters are ordered and on the way. Enough were interested in
mussels and clams for me to add to order. 
Are you all bringing:
Pete & Fernando	Potato salad
Lisa & Kevin		Appetizers
Lewis & Laura		Corn on the cob
Greg & Marion et al	appetizers?
Josette			desert
Patricia			chowder?
All			booze
Patricia is thinking 6:30ish
Oh yeah, total with lobster, clams & mussels is around $35 per person.

SEE YOU MA?ANA
