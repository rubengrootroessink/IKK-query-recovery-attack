No, I didn't go to any parties,either, I started to, but since I had dinner
engagements the two evenings prior, I really wanted to see my boys before
they went to bed! I almost walked into the Amoco party, but only to eat
their food and drink their beer! But then I knew that I would go to the
Torch party and wish I hadn't! Who is Torch, anyway? Where was the Enron
booth? That's like 3 years in a row that Enron hasn't participated! Why is
that? Is it the Enron culture, not to participate in gas functions? Are you
strictly going paperless and wireless? Broadband and such? What do the
troops around you say? Does anybody think it is rather odd that you don't
do that? Just curious, I personally don't give a flip. I went to lunch with
somebody that said Enron had a party Tuesday night. Where was my invite?
Y'know, it's kinda funny because I never really get invited to parties like
Williams or Reliant or Conoco, and the sad thing is, I don't care. Why is
that? So many people make such a big deal about getting hammered when they
go out, I guess I'm just getting old!

     Well, I've got to go out again and treat some mullet to dinner again!
I can't wait for all these people to leave, so I don't have to keep
smiling, keep eating and getting little sleep! OUT!

Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single
one.  I heard
there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to
you much
since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.
