Friends,

Siddhartha, Nidhesh, and I are moving back home to Calcutta, India in April, 
2000.

Attached are our contact details.  I would have loved to contact each one of 
you directly but this has happened in a hurry and we have to pack, wrap up 
and leave Houston by April 20.  So please call to catch up and maybe plan a 
visit to Calcutta!

My work email and voicemail will remain active as I will be on a leave of 
absence from Azurix.  I will check them periodically.  Today is my last day 
at work. 

I hope that you will make to the happy hour that Gaby is planning next week. 
I would love to see you.

Regards,

-sheetal
