Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.  



Should you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9138.
