Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

Kevin
