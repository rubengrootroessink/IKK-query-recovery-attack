The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any 
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast 
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim 
and Kendall I said hi.

Chump!
This energy crisis is making me question  my timing on buying a house.  I'm
thinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.  They
just crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.  Any opinions?

I start my Texas travel in February.  I'll be in Dallas for the first full
week and back in March in Dallas again.  Starting the end of March I'll be
there almost every week for about 6 months.  You'll be seeing more of me than
you want.  When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up some
dates.
Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.

Take care, B
