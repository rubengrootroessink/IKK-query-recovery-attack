Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW

A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day.
