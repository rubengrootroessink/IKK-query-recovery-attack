Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?
He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was
wondering how
the citizens of California viewed him.

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

Kevin
