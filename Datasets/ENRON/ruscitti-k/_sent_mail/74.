TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin
