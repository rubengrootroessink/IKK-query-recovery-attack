Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin
