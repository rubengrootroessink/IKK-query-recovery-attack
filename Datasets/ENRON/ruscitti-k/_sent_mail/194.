Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things 
could blow
up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I 
think
a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be 
interesting to
see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if 
California gets the
kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.
