Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin
