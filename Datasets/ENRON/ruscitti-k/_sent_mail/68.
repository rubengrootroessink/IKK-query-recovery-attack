Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin
