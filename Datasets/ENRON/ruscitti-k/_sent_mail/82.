Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

DK

This is the guy's name.
