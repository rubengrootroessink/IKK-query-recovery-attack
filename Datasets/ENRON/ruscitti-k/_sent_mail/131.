Congrats Murli,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job 
at Enron.
I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the 
Communications
group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would 
be better
at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 
(W) and
we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate 
brokers to refer you to.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin
