I need to hear the rest of the Red Neck weekend story.  Send me an email or give me a call.  Also do you have Lowery's and T.J.'s
email addresses.  They were deleted from my system when our email system was upgraded.

In that case:
1. Guided tour of Enron Stadium
2. Chauffered transportation to/from Corpus Christi
3. A pound of fifties to spend over the weekend
 
I just checked w/ mapquest and they are estimating a whopping 6 hours for the drive!!!  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to remember it taking about 3.5.
Lowery is doing some more training in San Marco, about 45 minutes north of San Antonio.  I imagine he was staying on the River Walk so he had something to do with Kim.  If he had any balls at all he'd stick around for the weekend.
