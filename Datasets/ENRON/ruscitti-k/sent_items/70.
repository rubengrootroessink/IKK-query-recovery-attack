AP Camden,NJ: A terrorist cell has been broken up in Camden just east of
Philadelphia. Four of the members have been apprehended by the Camden
Police, with the fifth still at large. Arrested in the Camden sweep were
Bin Eatin, Bin Smokin, Bin Sleepin and Bin Drinkin. All are being held on
illegal immigration
charges. Police stated that they can find no one fitting the description of
the fifth cell member, Bin Workin, in the area. But Camden Police are
confident that anyone who resembles Bin Workin would be easy to spot in
Camden.
