I'm not going to be able to make it.  I talked to Lisa and we're heading
back to NJ for her friends wedding.  I'm hoping to make a trip to CA
sometime next year.  I hope you have a great time and tell Lulenski I
said hi.

Kevin:

Do you know if you're coming out yet? Got e-mails from
Lulenski (he's coming) and Sarhatt (he's not). I'm
planning to go to the beer bust and picnic for sure
and probably the Saturday night event if enough of you
guys are interested. Let me know.

Regards,

Mike
