We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.
