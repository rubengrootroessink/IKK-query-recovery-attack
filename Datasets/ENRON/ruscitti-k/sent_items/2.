Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.
