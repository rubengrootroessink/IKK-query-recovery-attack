Subject: Anderson '96 Reunion - 4 weeks away!


Dear Class of 1996,

**Note:  Response to this email requested, thanks!

Well, our much anticipated 5-year Reunion is less than a month away!  The
planning committe is working hard on the events, and we are trying to firm
up the list of attendees.  We got a GREAT response to the last email, thanks
for taking the time to let us know your status.  If you haven't responded
yet, please do so just so we can adequately reserve space.

Just to remind some of you, the event will take place on: *** November 2-4th
*** in Los Angeles, CA!   The rough schedule of events is shown below.  In a
subsequent email today or tomorrow we will provide some details about hotel
accommodations.  You will also be receiving an information packet from the
Alumni Office in a mailing that should be out next week.

If you are planning to fly I've heard there are some great deals on
Southwest and United among others (<$100 from SF).  Anderson Alums also get
a 10% on Southwest (see below)

If you would like to respond to this email regarding your status, please use
this form:

1) Status of your email account
	A)  Got this info - email address is correct
	B)  Got this info - but would prefer to use another address next time
	C)  I did not get this info (not sure how you would answer this, but...)

Note:  You may have received this note twice - it was sent to all members of
the Class of 1996 currently registered in the Alumni Database, as well as to
the Class of 1996 Email List (which is opt-in).

2) Plans for attending the Reunion Weekend
	A)  Will definitely be Attending
	B)  Will make a brief appearance (1 or 2 events)
	C)  Still Deciding
	D)  Will not be Attending (but wish I could)

3) Comments/Suggestions - Any thoughts on how to make this a GREAT reunion?

As mentioned previously, its been a rough year for many of us and it would
be great to end the year with some fun and good times!  I can tell you from
what we've been hearing, and from the number of responses received, that we
are going to have an awesome turnout for the events, so you don't want to
miss out!!!   So get your tickets, review your facebook (so who was that
Doug Dahl character anyways), dust off the old Anderson attire and let's
party!!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many, many Reunion Organizers
