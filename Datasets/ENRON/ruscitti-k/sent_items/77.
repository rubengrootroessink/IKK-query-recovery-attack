Let me tell you who won't win - RU.  They are arguably the worst
division 1 football team I've ever seen.  I saw them for the 1st time
this weekend on TV.  They are horrible.  Hope everything's going well.
Life at Enron sucks.  I'm sure you've been following the situation.
I'm sure there'll be a #1 bestseller written about this circus.  Talk
to you soon.

Kevin,

This has to be one of the *ugly* games of the year.  The only saving
grace (and it isn't much of one either) is that the winner gets to say
they won their last game.  For Cal, that would be their only win.  I'm
going to be in OC at my in-laws, and I'm going to try to get an Internet
broadcast.

If Rutgers wins, I'll buy you a drink the next time I see you (actually
I'll buy you a drink regardless).  

Hi to Lisa - hope you guys have a Happy Thanksgiving.
