Where are you moving to?  How's the little one?  Hope everything is going great.  We just
bought a new house ourselves.  We are moving in the 12th.  This weekend we're hitting Jazz
Fest in New Orleans with Capt Frank P. Conway.  Talk to you soon.

Hi Everyone,

We just wanted to let you know that we are canceling service from our
internet provider starting 4/26/01. We will let you know our new internet
address, as well as the address of our new house, when we finally get
settled in November.

Love,
Karen and Tom
