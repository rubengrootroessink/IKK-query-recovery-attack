Kevin,

I am the executive recruiter you spoke to today about new job opportunities.
Thanks very much for your time.  As discussed, I've attached my contact
information for your records.  Please send your resume back to me in Word
format and let's make arrangements to discuss your background and interests
in new job opportunities.

You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
