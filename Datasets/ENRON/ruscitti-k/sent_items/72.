Robin,

How's everything in NY?  The flow of info around here has been horrible.  I
have no idea on what's happening - a bad situation to be in obviously.  We're
just reading all the news on the wires.

Just starting to look at some options in case the trading desk vanishes.  Do
you know if Sempra in CT is still looking for people.  I figure it's time to see
what else may be out there.

I'm sure we'll talk a little later.

Kevin
