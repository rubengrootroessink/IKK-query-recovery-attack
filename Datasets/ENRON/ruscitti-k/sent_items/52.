I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section 154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and 2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

Some idiot lost a pair of pliers so I have to wait around to go fly.  I
guess it's just as well, I'd hate to find them at 3,000'.

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to
actually show up in the first place.

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.  

KR
