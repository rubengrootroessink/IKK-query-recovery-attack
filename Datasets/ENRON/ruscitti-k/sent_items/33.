*** Springsteen visits Jersey Shore club

ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - A legendary Jersey Shore rock club had a
special guest at its birthday party over the weekend: Bruce
Springsteen. The Boss made a surprise appearance Sunday night before
about 2,500 fans at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park. The show, which
marked the one-year anniversary of the club's reopening, featured
another shore favorite, Southside Johnny and Asbury Jukes, and
rocker Graham Parker. Springsteen showed up on stage at about 8:40
p.m. and performed with the band and Parker for about an hour. The
set featured several Springsteen songs and some Southside staples,
along with a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Born on the
Bayou."
