IN SPORTS TODAY:

After failing to secure a win via a recount of points, the Tennessee Titans
(6-7) are now demanding to replay the final down of their recent 42-41 loss
to the Dallas Cowboys (7-6).  Titan team officials explained that Titan
fans
intended for the final down field goal attempt to be good, and that
replaying the down is therefore justified despite the ruling of officials
that the ball did not pass thru the uprights.  Titan team officials added
that the width of the uprights confused kicker Al DelGreco (17yrs - Auburn)
on the 19 yard attempt and that the uprights should be widened for a replay
of the down.  Cowboys team officials countered that DelGreco had seen the
uprights before the game and had not complained to the officials.  They
added that Cowboy kicker Tim Seder (R - Arkansas) successfully kicked thru
the same uprights during the game from distances of 47, 42 and 36 yards.
