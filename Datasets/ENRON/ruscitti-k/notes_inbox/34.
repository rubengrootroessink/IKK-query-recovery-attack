This is a message from Cindy Olson, Executive VP, Human Resource & Community 
Relations.

Please take a few minutes to complete the attached, very brief survey. Your 
input is important in helping determine future efforts in this vital area.

You have been randomly selected to participate in the second of an ongoing 
series of surveys that will be conducted to help us gauge how effectively we 
are leveraging diversity to enhance our organization.

As you know, Enron is engaged in a struggle to recruit and retain the quality 
of talent necessary to allow us to meet and beat our competition.  The 
business case for diversity is inarguable and we must step-up to the 
challenge of recruiting, developing and continually valuing an increasingly 
diverse workforce.  Such an effort requires that we look at diversity in a 
broader context that combines the different thoughts and ideas, life and work 
experiences, as well as skill sets of employees. It is this combination that 
will enable Enron to remain the leading innovator and one of the most admired 
companies in the world.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation and contribution.
