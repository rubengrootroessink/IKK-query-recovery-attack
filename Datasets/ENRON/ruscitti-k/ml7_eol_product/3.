Matt or Frank,

Please provide a sigma factor for the following product type requested by 
Kevin Ruscitti:

US Gas Phy Fwd Secondary Firm

A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis.  The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the 
Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 
31 May 2001.
The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  
The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery.  The 
volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational 
constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes 
are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an 
alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated.  
In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, 
the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or 
parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System 
constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.




Thanks,

CW
