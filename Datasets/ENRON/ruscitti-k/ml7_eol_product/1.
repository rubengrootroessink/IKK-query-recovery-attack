Matt or Frank,

Please provide a sigma factor for the following product type requested by Kevin Ruscitti:

US Gas Phy Fwd Secondary Firm

A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis.  The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 31 May 2001.
The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery.  The volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated.  In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day.

 


Thanks,

CW
