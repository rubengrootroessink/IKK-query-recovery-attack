What to Expect on Monday 

As we have communicated earlier, there may be some short- term price volatility when the market opens. Accordingly, you may want to consider whether to use a limit order or a market order when placing a trade. (Click here <http://email.schwab.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/mcp?p=0397I039MI4CFd$012000mdtpjdtmD> for more information on order types). In addition, with potential strains on systems due to heavy volumes, you may experience operational or execution delays. (Click here <http://email.schwab.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/mcp?p=0398F039MI4CFd$012000mdtpjdtmD> for more information on market volatility).
