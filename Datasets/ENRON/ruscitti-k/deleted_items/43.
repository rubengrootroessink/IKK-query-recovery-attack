Job Description
Ashoka is seeking an exceptional individual who will "seed"
and spread the most effective innovations in the areas of 
micro-enterprise, micro-credit, self-employment and income 
generation around the world. Working with a global network 
of on-the-ground practitioners in over 40 countries, the 
Director of the Small Producers Initiative will face the 
challenge of distilling the crosscutting principles that 
emerge from the work of Ashoka Fellows and other leaders in
the field. These will be disseminated across sectors to 
initiate, support, or influence programs and policies so as
to accelerate positive change in the area of economic 
development. Furthermore, much like a venture capitalist, 
the Director will selectively work with Ashoka Fellows to 
"take to scale" those Fellow's initial innovations with 
great promise which need additional support in order to 
realize their potential.

Qualifications
? Excellent oral and written communication skills
? Strong analytical and strategic planning abilities
? Demonstrated ability for sustained intellectual inquiry
? Proven leadership skills and creativity
? A team orientation and strong interpersonal skills
? Enthusiasm for building the profession of social
