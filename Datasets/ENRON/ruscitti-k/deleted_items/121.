Chump,

Here's the cars I'd look at if I were you.

Acura 3.2 CSL
330i Coupe
Passat V6
Volvo S-80 or S-60 w/ twin Turbo
Audi A4/A6
Maxima (whatever the top of the line is - always top rated by Car and
Driver)

If you want American Iron, I'd look at the Chrylser 300M.  My uncle is a
huge driver and loves it.
