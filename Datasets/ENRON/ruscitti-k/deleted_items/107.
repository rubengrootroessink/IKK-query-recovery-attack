For whatever reason (lower prices maybe?), we have experienced a huge increase in customer buying activity.  Other than the real small guys, we have been doing about 40 to 50 contracts a day of terms 1 to 5 years.  Today we have booked 112 and they continue to come in as I write.  If you are interested in our customer activity, let me know.
