 Assurance & Business Advisory Services
Staff		Senior		Manager

Assurance and Business Advisory Services is the cornerstone
of Andersen.  In this practice, you'll learn how businesses
really work and gain in-depth business experience and 
knowledge.  Traditional audit services might have worked in
a traditional world, but that would no longer exists.  At 
Andersen, our capabilities go well beyond the traditional 
by focusing on clients' broader business issues and

process analysis as well as in risk control and performance
measurement.

At Andersen, we have transformed our Assurance offerings to
help you meet important new challenges in these times of 
rapid changes.  Our Assurance methodology is squarely 
focused on risks and controls.  It is assurance for the new
economy.  Our Business Audit methodology begins by 
understanding a clients' business context and identifying 
business risks - the root causes of financial reporting 
surprises, misstatements and errors.  Once we have 
identified the risks, we focus on assuring the quality of 
key controls, so that our clients have confidence in the 
information they rely on to run their business, that that 
others rely on to invest in it.  We are enthusiastic about 
the role of assurance and its ability to deliver value to 
business leaders and the investing public.  Assurance is a 
growing business at the heart of Andersen.  For every 
client and company, it is a fundamental and increasing need.
