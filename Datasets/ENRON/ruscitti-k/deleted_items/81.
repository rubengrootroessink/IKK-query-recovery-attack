Personal letter from Charles Schwab, founder <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/PTRG/RUNN/BW72/RF/D43D6H>

	

We stand ready to serve you and conduct business as normal, providing the market wisdom and support you need most. We are working closely with the stock markets, federal government, regulators and other members of the financial services community to ensure America's financial markets return to normal. 	
	
I continue to believe a long-term approach is the wisest course of action, although I do recognize that some short-term volatility will likely occur when markets reopen. Please consider this in placing orders prior to market reopen.	 
My advice to you is the same investment advice I have offered clients for over 40 years: invest for the long term and maintain a diversified portfolio--and stay calm during the rough times. 	
We know that each individual's situation is unique. I encourage you to explore our web site, visit a Schwab office, or call us at 1-800-435-4000 with any questions. We stand ready to assist you with all of your financial services needs during these challenging times.

	
	
Thank You,
