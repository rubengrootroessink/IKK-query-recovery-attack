Oh by the way,

Refresh my memory on how you got the call name of "sissy".  I am sure that there
is a perfctly sound reason behind this one?!?!?!?  Don't worry your masculinity
will never be in question with your boys out here on the left coast!  Maybe we
can get a lobby going to change your call name to "bamboo".
