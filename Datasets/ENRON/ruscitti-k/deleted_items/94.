re feedback from this thing:
the guy who bob knows who was  looking wanted to get people from outside to really build up the business...the other co-head wanted to concentrate on internal moves to see if they could start with an option capacity and build it up later .....the second guy won....
so not a decision that reflected the resumes put forward, but a focus on internal politics.....

just wanted to let you know

are you going to france for honeymoon?

i found out george taking me to california for our anniversary......what are the names of your favorite wineries.....we really should do a joint trip next time....

spk soon
hope you are well - best regards to lisa
