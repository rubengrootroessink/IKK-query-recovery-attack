Alliance presented this to PGL when they were here on Tuesday (its the firm 
shippers primary deliver points).As an interesting note PGL interconnect will 
allow 600, but their system can't handle it.  We're working with our Canadian 
office to "buy" some of this alliance gas for PGL.  What we are looking at is 
reducing your baseload sale and part of their DIQ and replacing it with 
alliance gas.  We'll talk about it later.

Barbara,

I met with some people from Alliance Pipeline yesterday to discuss
nominations and confirmations.  Attached is a piece of information that
might be of interest to the daily group.  Could you route to the rest of the
group?

Thanks.
