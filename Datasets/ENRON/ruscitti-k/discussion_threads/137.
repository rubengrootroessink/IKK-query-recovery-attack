FROM: Enron Human Resources


We are pleased to pass along to you the fact that United HealthCare (UHC) and 
Memorial Herman Health Systems (MHHS) reached agreement on a long-term 
contract.   There will be no disruption in terms of accessing network 
services from the hospital system or those providers who were scheduled to be 
terminated.  Employees currently electing UHC will receive a confirming 
letter shortly from UHC.

As mentioned in our earlier memo, it is our understanding that Cigna has also 
been contacted by MHHS and are now in contract negotiations. 

Open Enrollment packages are in the mail and you should consider the above 
facts when making your decision on your medical election.
