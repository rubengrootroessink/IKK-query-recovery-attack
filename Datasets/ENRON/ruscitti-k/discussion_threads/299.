Kev-it certainly sounds like you have alot on your hands with the house, but
i'm sure it will all work out.  Maybe you can call rabbit to come and do some
renovation work.  after all, he did spend his entire sophomore year building
the brothers bar!!  Or maybe give marro a call-he was the house manager and
pretty good with his hands.  Or better yet, give morgante a ring.  he won't
show up, but he'll take your wife out for a date.  By the way,
congratulations on getting married!!  Next time you come to NJ I'll give you
your present (it's on ice, don't worry)
    Yes I am still dating beth.  It's a little tough with the distance (as
i'm sure you can understand), but we do the best we can and when we see each
other it's always great.  We actually spent new year's down in mexico.
Matter of fact i picked up the rest of my pictures the other day and quickly
proceeded to become depressed at the fact that i am here and not there.
Needless to say we had a great time.  You know, we are figuring on taking a
trip sometime in the spring, maybe vegas.  it would be unbelievable if you
and lisa could meet us.  Or maybe we can even visit you guys.  let me know.
    I saw sweets new office recently.  He and i had lunch.  I'll tell you
something, he is such a great guy.  everytime i call him for anything, no
matter how long it's been since i've talked to him, he always acts like i
just spoke with him.  I have to fax you the letter he sent to me last year.
It was fucking hilarious.  Anyway, the office is great and i met one of his
new partners.  i'm sure they will do excellent there.
    I hope work is going well.  I'm keeping my eye on enron.  they are always
in the NY Times with some sort of inventive stuff that they're doing.  It
looks like a pretty cool company.  I also have a mutual fund that invests
heavily in the company.
    My work has been extremely hectic, but things couldn't be better.  My
partner pete and i merged our office with another guy on January 1 and now we
are a 3 partner firm.  We bought a building in Hawthorne and we close on
April 1.  I'm looking forward to getting into the building soon.  We have to
wait though for some renovations to be done.  But it should be pretty
exciting.  It's  a victorian house and it's a real nice setup.
    The only other person i have seen recently is coun.  He and Chris met
Beth and i for lunch a couple of weeks ago at the short hills mall.
Oh-before i forget, my number at work is (973) 569-0888.  Give me a call
soon, and give me your work number as well.
    Oh one last thing, give me moller's e-mail address if you have it.  And
something else, let me know next time you guys are road tripping to louisiana
or wherever else.  i am definitely in.
    Well take care, definitely stay in touch and by all means give the former
Ms. taggart my best.  It was great hearing from you.
