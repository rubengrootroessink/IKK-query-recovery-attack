Dear priceline.com customer, 

Saving money is what priceline.com is all about. That's why we're 
sharing this great offer which Sprint ION direct has put together 
especially for you: 

Downloading files can sometimes take a while. A long while. How many 
times do you skim magazines or read mail when you download? 

Those days are history!

Sprint ION is here. Now you can download at speeds up to 142X faster 
than a 56K modem. Imagine your life with the power of up to 8Mbps 
downstream, up to 1Mbps upstream, and broadband Internet connectivity 
carried via ATM over ADSL. 
See if Sprint ION is in your area!
