Duude,
What's happening? Finally getting around to getting
you my new email and tele #. I left Pru back in
mid-December and have been running non-stop with the
new job. It is a world of difference going from Corp
America to a start-up, but its been fun.

Been doing some traveling and spending a lot of time
trying to get new customers and servicing the ones we
sign up.

So how was N.O.? I'm sure that the three of you didn't
do any drinking or got into any trouble.

Tell the lovely Mrs. Ruscitti that we say hello. Don't
forget, let me know the next time you are in Jersey
and if you have time we should hook up.

I had bookmarked Mr. Conway's email on my computer at
Pru and forgot to take it with me, can you send it to
me. Thanks and talk to you soon,

=====
