Kevin,

I recently saw that a Team Thadeus (fantasy baseball) original and one time
Philly - Kevin Stocker was cut by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  I'm sure you
were saddened to see one of the better players the Phillies put out at
shortstop get treated so rudely.  I hope all is well with Lisa and the
dogs.  What's the latest with the house hunting and the wedding plans?

Everyone here says hello.

Thanks.

Paul
