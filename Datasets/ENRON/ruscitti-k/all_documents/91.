Kevin,

 I received a statement from Wisconsin Gas that shows what we received at the 
different points from Wisc. Gas.  My understanding on the deal that we have 
with EES is that we only buy from Wisconsin Gas what EES requests from us.  
On the statement, I can match up what is in our system for all of the points 
except for Willow Run (Michcon).  The Wisc. Gas statement is showing that we 
purchased 13,291 dth on August 16.  I did not see anything come through for 
EES at this location so I asked Julie Boehl in volume management to look into 
it.  She did not see a brokered deal entered for EES at Willow Run.  EES is 
showing purchasing 11,408 from us (they may be incorrect on their volumes) 
and we are not showing any sales that match to this volume.  Could you please 
check into this for me and let me know if this is missing in the system?
