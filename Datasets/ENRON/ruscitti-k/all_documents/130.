Hey Kevin,
We understand you will be coming home in a few weeks.
Do you know the exact date, or did my husband just not tell me?
I'm testing out my email ability since Lisa was able to give me your address
last night.
We're glad to hear all is going well and the the house will be completed
sooner than expected!

Enjoy the heat!!!! Gloria
