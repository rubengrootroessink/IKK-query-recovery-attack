Kev,

Don't know if this found you or not but I got your new EMail address sent back
to me.  We also just received the gift from you and Lisa.  Thanks a bunch.
Luke will definitely cuddle up in the warmth after his baths.  Say hello to
Lisa.  You know Rena will have the formal Thank You off in the mail soon.  
Hope
to see you guys soon.  By the way, do you have Bill Ricigliano's phone # by
chance.  Send it to me if you do.

TJ

Hey Guys,

Thought I would update you on the 2 1/2 month 14 lb 11 oz machine I have for a
son.  Don't know where the size is coming from ....... lets hope it isn't the
milkman?!  Hope everyone is doing well.  Las Vegas is calling.  20 BUCKS - YOU
IN?!

Take it easy,
TJ
