Hi Kevin,

I tried to call you at work today, but you had already left.  I then tried
to call you at home but I have an old or wrong ph#.
I just wanted to say that I am so sorry I can't come to the wedding.  I was
actually coming by myself, because EVERYONE we asked to baby sit, couldn't
for that Saturday.  I was really looking forward to it.

The problem is that I am having problems with my episiotomy from the
delivery.  It has not healed properly and I am still having pain.
I won't know until my appointment next week, but the doctor said that I have
to go back in the hospital and get re-cut and re-stitched, and then I have
to wait to heal all over again.   I don't know all the details, but I am
assuming it will feel the same as it did just after the baby.  I was told I
couldn't do much of anything for about 2 weeks.  I asked to have the
procedure early, but they said I have to wait to heal completely or it may
not be strong enough to hold the stitches.

John's Baptism is on Oct 1, and my parents are coming up, so I need to have
it done 2 weeks prior to that, which puts your wedding right in the middle.
The  doctor said there was a slight chance it could heal on it's own, but it
is doubtful.

I just wanted to let you know that I am so bummed that I won't be there.  I
was so psyched to see Rich, Frank, Kampy and your family.   I'll let you
know if anything changes, but for now it looks like I'm going to miss the
most important day of your life!!!

Give me a call (856) 797-1398.

Thanks,
Karen
