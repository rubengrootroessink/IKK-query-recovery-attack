good points and yes the Dow just needs one more week like this to trade
under 9000 so 8000 is not a stretch.   Markets typically predict a recession
long before it arrives.  In the second q of this year you will see some sort
of headline that says Recession hits US.  I would buy that day.  As for
california, the worlds 6th largest economy,  energy is obviously your space
but I think that the calpines, capstones, and others are options such as the
contract they received last month.  Hope all is well.  Sweets party was fun.
It was only missing you and TJ. j
