Kevin,

Great to hear from you!  I was beginning to think you had dropped off the
face of the earth.

I am getting on the boat in about 4 hours - midnight.  Actually, it's not
too bad that way as I go right to sleep when I get on.  I fly at night on
Saturday so I can sleep in.  Fortunately, I will only be on the boat for 18
days as we are conducting the exercise in Okinawa vice another country.
Hopefully, the situation in Taiwan won't deteoriate between now and when I
get off.

Great news about the house!  Send us some digital photos if you have them.
I think it is better to buy a house that needs some work as you are able to
get more home for the cash.  Also, it is easier to turn a profit if you
sell.  Not to mention having some projects in work is always a good hobby.

Marie and I came really close to making an offer on a beach house in Navarre
beach.  Fortunately, reason got the best of us and we are waiting until we
get back before we make such a monumental decision.  There are just too many
factors involved to make the decision from some digital photos.  So, are you
planning on staying in Houston for a while?

A smaller wedding sounds like a good plan.  To me, having a few close
friends present is always better than a bunch of strap hangers.  However,
most chicks would probably disagree.  Marie seems to have had no regrets
with our ultra small wedding.  Just let me know what you need me to do to
help pull it off.

If all goes well, we will start heading home in mid-June and settle in
around early August.  I will also be home for Erin's wedding in May.  We
will also be doing some house hunting in Pensacola at that time.  We will be
in the states from the 20th of May through the 9th of June.  Let me know if
you are available on the first or last weekend and we will stop in Houston
on the way in or out for a day or two.  The tickets we buy allow us four
stops anywhere in the US.

The only wild card in all of this is Test Pilot School.  I applied to the
board that meets in May.  If I get selected, I would go to Maryland instead
of Florida and it wouldn't be until mid-November.  If that happens, and I
actually hope it doesn't, we would either stay here for a few more months or
go to Md. early.  Either way, I will be at your wedding.

Glad to hear from you,

Frank

My address on the boat will be
