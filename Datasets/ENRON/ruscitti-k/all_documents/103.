Ahn-yong-ha-sae-yo Anderson team,
Looks like I'll be missing the fall recruiting activities in L.A.  I trust 
all is going well, and that we should continue our success at Anderson.  I 
would hope the dot com fever has died down somewhat, plus I think Enron has 
quite of bit of upside to offer candidates in that so much of what we do now 
is new economy without as much risk as a pure dot com.

Life in Seoul is working out quite nicely.   My wife Sunnie and I are finally 
settled into our townhouse in Sungbuk-dong, next to Pukhansan National 
Park.   Almost all of Korea is mountainous and we can find trails everywhere 
in and around Seoul.  Work is going very well.   I'm in charge of new 
business development at the SK-Enron joint venture so I've got my team 
working on about half a dozen initiatives.  I am currently busy preparing for 
the launch of a B2C website catering to consumers and their household 
needs.   I'm also leading a pilot project to lay some fiber optic cable along 
our gas pipeline network.  Summer monsoons have finally stopped, and we're 
looking forward to a trip down to Pusan during Chuseok (Korean 
thanksgiving).  Sunnie, daughter Heather and I spent a week in the mountains 
near Seoul, quite beautiful.    Let me know how the recruiting progresses, 
and also what's been going on in Houston.  

Cheers,
Jung
