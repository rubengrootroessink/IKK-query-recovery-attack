UAT on phase 1 of this application development has identified previously 
unforeseen technical and functional requirements/issues. Consequently, a 
comprehensive re-specification and re-planning exercise for DTL has been 
completed such as to give a much later implementation timetable.

Given the immediate, and absolute, need to implement the more significant of 
the control and efficiency improvements identified in this project along with 
the competing demands for existing IT development resource we have decided to 
:-

pause development work on the DTL application ( specifically )
apply business analysis resources on the full redesign and documentation of 
ledger control and reporting processes
complete the process changes within the Trade Accounting area that have been 
on-going for the last 6 months
reassign IT resources to the Enlighten and Envoice projects
reassess the timetable for the delivery of the residual DTL control and 
efficiency improvements by re-preforming the business case for the DTL 
application following the completion of the above identified work

Please feel free to discuss any of the above issues with us

Regards

John & Mike
