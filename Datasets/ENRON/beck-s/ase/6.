Hello folks -

Brent and I have updated the agenda for the changes we made the other night.  
I am sending this to you for your own use.  Remember that we will walk 
through this again on Sunday night to make sure we're still on the right 
track.

Please don't distribute the agenda or share it with the session 
participants.  I'm sure they are starting to ask the question - "So, what are 
we going to do while we're there?" - in fact I've had folks ask me that 
already.  My typical response is to reiterate the goals of the session and 
explain that we will do a series of exercies in both large and small group 
formats.  And, when they continue to press for more (as I've found they 
typically do) - I politely let them know that more details will be shared 
when we kick off the session on Monday morning.  Now, if they are curious 
about what an ASE is and why they have to go to Dallas for it, you can cover 
that too or have them call me.

Team, I think we're really close to being ready.  I'm going to spend the rest 
of the day pulling together our input documents so if you have anything you 
want included send it on!

Let me know if you have any questions!
Lisa P
