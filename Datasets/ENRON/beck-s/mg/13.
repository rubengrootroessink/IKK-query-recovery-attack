Do you want me to ask Tim to put you into the reporting frame work as well - 
level with the European office of the chair?

Subject: MG : MO/BO Functional Groups and Reporting Lines

Please find attached a workbook comprising two worksheets. These worksheets 
illustrate how Support for the London based MG businesses - Financial Trading 
and Merchanting - plug in to the Enron Europe framework.



Org

This sheet illustrates the main reporting lines for the Front, Middle and 
Back Office(s) up to the "Office of the Chair" for Enron Europe. Though the 
Mechanting business is used for illustrative purposes, for Financial Trading 
simply substitute Mike Farmer and Howard Carter with Michael Hutchinson and 
Kevin Rhodes respectively.

Staff

This sheet simply attaches names to each of the Middle and Back Office 
functional groups indicated in the sheet entitled Org. Staff within the 
Middle Office functional groups have been introduced to the dual reporting 
concept whereby they report to both the Business Controller and Functional 
Lead. 

The intention is that quite soon after moving into Enron House the functional 
teams for both Financial Trading and Mechanting will start to more closely 
together. The influence of the Functional Leads should ensure that these 
teams are blended into a generic Enron Metals support group, where possible 
leveraging across the other trading support groups.

Any questions, please call x 34264.

Regards,
Tim
