Tim,
As discussed, please find attached an updated version of the Enron Metals 
North America Structure.  It includes the Brokerage business and updates the 
Merchanting operations.  Please review and provide your comments.  I would 
like to finalize this and begin the formal implementation of these changes as 
soon as possible.


Best regards,
Marcelo
