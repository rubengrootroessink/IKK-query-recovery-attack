Thanks very much for your comments.  I too applaud the groups' efforts on the 
new request system !  This is the kind of improvement in our processes that 
we should all be seeking on a regular basis.  It's nice to know this one hit 
the mark and adds value to our customers' processes as well.

Subject: New Global Counterparty Change Request System

Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know how pleased we are with the 
New Global Counterparty Change Request system.  I had the opportunity to use 
it yesterday.  It is very easy to use and very user friendly!  Also it is 
very efficient, since we no longer have to remember who handles what party of 
the alphabet.  We love the fact that we can work on a request and save it as 
a draft before finalizing it.  Also like the ability to view our own request 
so that we can view the status.

Overall, your group has done a great job on this project!

Kim Theriot
