Sally,

The May 18th date is locked in stone.  We have already reserved seats on a 
Continental flight @ Noon Thursday, May 18.  It's unfortunate that Mark was 
not kept up to date, but we have only moved back the date 1 time due to the 
May Day riots.  Tom and I have been in constant contact and we have confirmed 
the move-out date.  The book-split project will be implemented tomorrow and I 
will spend the next few days ensuring that the traders understand how to book 
their deals and that Risk is able to generate and explain the DPR on a timely 
basis.  Also, while I am here I plan to meet with the Weather Derivatives 
team to assess their needs and gain an understanding of their markets.

This project will not drag on day-by-day as mentioned below.  There is much 
more that can be done, but that is out of the scope of this project; besides 
I am ready to come home.

Have a good weekend,
Todd

FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.  We 
have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may 
want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then 
returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from 
that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be out 
of the flat by the 18th of May?  --Sally

Sally,

I need Tom over here ASAP. The flat was given to Todd on the understanding 
that Tom would have it at the start of May. Its now been extended to 18th 
May. I don't wan't to postpone Tom's transfer any longer. Please can you give 
me assurance that Todd will vacate by his newdate of the 18th May.

Thanks

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict "two full working days" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

Tom,

I just heard today that you're not arriving until the 18th as Todd Hall is in 
the apartment. Please let me know what is going on - this is the first I 
heard, and I think its a bit late considering I thought you'd be here today 
!!!!
