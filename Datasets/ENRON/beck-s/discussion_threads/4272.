8:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and the Associate PRC will be conducted from 1:30=
=20
p.m. to 6:30 p.m. =20

III. Process

Each PRC representative has been randomly assigned 15 to 17 Associates or=
=20
Analysts that they will represent in the PRC meeting.  Please note the PRC=
=20
rep is not representing only those individuals who may work in his or her=
=20
specific OpCo but individuals that work throughout the organization.  The P=
RC=20
rep will continue to represent the assigned Associates or Analysts during=
=20
their entire tenure with the Program.
The PRC reps are expected to contact the PRC supervisor and gather=20
performance information (including pre-ratings if available).
The Program will prepare a binder for each PRC rep that includes consolidat=
ed=20
feedback from the PEP system for their assigned Associates or Analysts and=
=20
will provide this to the PRC Representatives on July 7th.
Associates and Analysts will be pre-rated by their Business Unit supervisor=
=20
using the six performance ratings (Superior - Issues) and the Management=20
Professional feedback form as detailed in the PEP system.  The pre-ratings=
=20
must be loaded into PEP by July 6th. =20
The Associate and Analyst ratings will be cross-calibrated by tenure at the=
=20
meeting as follows:
Associates:
Level 1: 0 to 6 months
Level 2: 7 to 12 months
Levels 3 & 4 will be reviewed together: 13 months+.
Analysts:
Level 1: 0 to 6 months
Level 2: 7 to 12 months
Level 3: 13 to 24 months
Level 4 and 5 will be reviewed together: 25 months+
The rating determined in the global cross calibration meeting is final, and=
=20
cannot be changed once the meeting has ended.
Following the global Associate and Analyst PRC, the Associates=01, and the=
=20
Analysts=01, supervisors will obtain the final rating from the PRC=20
representative.  The supervisors must ensure that an evaluation session is=
=20
conducted and the final rating is communicated to each Associate and Analys=
t=20
by September 15th. The completed form must be signed by the Associate or=20
Analyst and returned to Terry Bosien in Human Resources by 9/18/00.

Associates are eligible for promotion to manager at their 18 and 24 month=
=20
anniversary.
Timing.  Anniversaries that occur from April 1st through September 30th=20
should be recommended in the July PRC and those that occur from October 1st=
=20

promotion is granted it would become effective on the 1st of the month=20
following the PRC, or on the Associate=01,s anniversary date, whichever is =
later.
