Hi Sally,

I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to get in touch with you as the 
PRC process begins to take off.  I was hoping we could meet briefly at 
sometime in the next couple of weeks.  I rotated into a new group (U.S. 
Network Development) in late August and am doing very different work within 
EBS.  I would welcome the chance to share some of this and other thoughts of 
mine with you.  My schedule is quite flexible, so if there is a time that is 
convenient with you, please let me know and I'll stop by.  Probably 15 
mintues would be adequate.

Thank you, and I hope to see you soon.
Nicole
