ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=
o the=20
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=
=20
OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe=
ct on=20
the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=
,=20
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=
=20
July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=
as=20
also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The=
=20
current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tig=
ht=20
timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility.

To meet Q1 end requirements (i.e. full production of the DPR and stock=20
