Just fyi - Andy Z. has asked that I be the administrator (i.e Master User) 
for IntercontinentalExchange for all of ENA, ECC, and EPMI trading.  The cost 
of this exchange is $500 per user so we are going to be closely monitoring 
who is getting access to the site.  We are working  to get something set up 
on eRequest to track and automate this process.  We have a meeting scheduled 
for Wed, so I will give you all the details then.

Thanks
Sheri

Sheri,

It was a pleasure speaking with you today.  Attached is the ICE New User
Enrollment Form.  This is the means by which you can identify the
individuals that are to be set up as ICE users and the level of access (User
Type) to be granted to each.  Of particular importance is the identification
of the individuals who will be acting as the primary Administrative, Credit,
IT, and Invoicing contacts for IntercontinentalExchange.

You will need to complete a separate form for each Enron entity that
executed a Participant Agreement.

If you have any questions, please call me at 770.738.2129.  Thanks for your
interest and we look forward to serving you.

Regards,
Chuck Vice
