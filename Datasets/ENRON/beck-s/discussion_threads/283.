As part of Enron Industrial Market's (EIM) move into the Pulp, Paper and 
Steel markets, our European effort is well underway. Our markets are global 
in nature and we believe we need a strong presence in Europe to penetrate 
that market effectively. Accordingly, we are pleased to announce that Bruce 
Garner has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Enron 
Industrial Markets - Europe. In this role, Bruce will be responsible for all 
activities for EIM in the European market.

Please join us in congratulating Bruce in his new position.
