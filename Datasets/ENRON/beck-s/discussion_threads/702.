Status of Bandwidth trading reporting:

We have met with each of you and sent you information for the specific needs 
of
each group.  As of today, I think we are all in agreement that the information
sent will work respectively for each of you and we are ready to 'go live' with
bandwidth reporting.  If this is not the case, please contact Jeremy Mills (x
35685) or myself (x39312) as soon as possible.

Thanks to each of you for working with us on this initiative,

Denae
