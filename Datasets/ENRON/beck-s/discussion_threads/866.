Subject: Supervisory Leadership Classes

By now, you should be aware of the Supervisory Leadership Curriculum rolled 
out by Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago (see the posters in our elevator 
banks).  This curriculum was designed at the request of senior management to 
provide new and future leaders the opportunity to prepare for such roles.  
Feedback from the program administrators is that there has been a low 
response rate.  This may be due to confusion about eligibility and cost.  
Just to clarify - All of you are eligible to participate.  In fact, you are 
strongly encouraged to participate.  Further, those individuals within your 
groups that are leading efforts or are expected to step into such a role are 
encouraged to participate.  Please keep in mind that individuals don't 
currently have to be supervisors to attend the training; the idea is to 
provide training for new situations encountered as leaders.  Generally 
speaking, those at the specialist level and above should be considered for 
these classes - just use your judgment.  

Although there is a cost associated with these classes, it is minimal in 
comparison to the returns that can be gained through participation.  
Guidelines are available to help you target specific needs for yourself and 
your staff.  Please contact the training department to obtain a curriculum 
guide.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Susan
