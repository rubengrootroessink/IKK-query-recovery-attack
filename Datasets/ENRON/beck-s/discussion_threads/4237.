I think I am seeing you tomorrow at 8 AM.  I understand you are out Wednesday 
through Friday.

Sounds like the operations role is fairly substantial all on its own with 
EES, EA, HPL, etc. as well as EGM and EIM with their ramp ups related to 
ships, rail cars and trucks.

See you in the morning.  I have an 8:30 AM so I only have that 30 minutes.

Thanks. 

GP

I will have that to you by the end of the afternoon.  I have set aside my 
afternoon to complete the timeline and resource needs, rewrite the 
presentation to originators, recap our Monday morning meeting on 
commercialization efforts for this week, work on my game plan for EES and get 
with Bob Hall to do an update for Brian Redmond on the HPL sale before his 
Tueday meeting with Louise.  I will share these items with you as I get them 
checked off my list this afternoon.  --Sally

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last 
week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  
Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we 
can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that 
participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra 
participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy 
immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant 
called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.
