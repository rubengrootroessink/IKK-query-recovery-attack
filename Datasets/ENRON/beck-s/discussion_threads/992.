This is a reminder of the GBN steering committee meeting this Sunday, 4:30 pm 
at Guadalajara.

Looking forward to seeing you,

Glenn.


GBN Steering Committee Meeting, 09 April 2000
May 17th Speaker - no sponsor.We decided against having a cover charge and to 
use GBN funds. We felt a cover might reduce attendance and wanted to keep the 
speaker series free for attendees. A $10 cover wouldn't cover all of the 
expenses anyway and we felt it would create a bad impression. Deed Vest of 
Rockwell International has confirmed availability for the date. Carolyn is 
handling the set up.
September 20th Houston's Economy PanelPaul Murphy, Southwest Bank of Texas: 
confirmed with sponsorshipShirley Delibero, Metro: unconfirmed, should hear 
something this weekRobert Duncan, Transwestern Real Estate: confirmedHarvey 
Bunce, UT Galveston Med Center: unconfirmedTechnology: need someone. Roger, 
any interest at Compaq?Energy: need someone. Sally, any interest at Enron?
Moderator: UT Professor Michael Brandl, Ph.D.
I will be contacting the TBN and see if they would also like to attend. This 
will be a GBN event, but we will invite the TBN.

June 25th Astros night v. San FranciscoAccording to Chrissy, the plans 
include a ticket to the? game, dinner at Zydeco's and a trolley ride from 
Zydeco's to the new Enron field. All this for only $25/person! Chrissy, if 
you have the info, let's try to get it on the May 17th event mailing.

Summer 2000 Family EventSeveral members have expressed interest in a family 
event. Chrissy and I are looking into Theater Under The Stars (Miller Outdoor 
Theater). GBN will buy soft drinks and attendees will bring their own picnic 
dinner.
Next Meeting - Sunday, May 7th @ 4:30 pm at Guadalajara.
As you find out information for the events on which you are working, please 
email Chris and I to keep us up to date. Thank you for your help. Your work 
is appreciated.
Glenn.--
