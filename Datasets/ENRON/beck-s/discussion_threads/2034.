Cassandra,
I think Michael's issue is just one for you and Shona to worry about and try 
to simultaneously come up with a way to diffuse without bastardizing the 
process. .  I continue to say the we need to maintain the theme that speed 
and "gut reaction" is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence,  I 
feel so strongly about this that I would consider removing my team from 
involvement if politically correct, grammatically sound and properly 
researched reports that do not say anything or are stale or are full of 
ambiguity are the end result (see the internal audit report on 
Helsinki!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!).   I think the solution is make it clear that these reports are not to 
be used for prosecution but frank discussion.
I am right about this.
Please forward this to Shona/Sally/Mike or anyone else at your discretion 
(this is a compromise between Evil Ted and Zen Ted)

Ted
