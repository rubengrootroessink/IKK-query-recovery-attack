Sally, Brent and Gary,

In a meeting with Bryan, Jeff, Gary and Markus on Monday, November 20th, I 
showed Bryan a copy of the monthly price verification procedures and the book 
administrator's Price Verification Comparison Spreadsheet .  I also showed 
Brent this information later in the day, as he had to leave before we all 
left.

Therefore, I find Bryan's Operations' bullet  wrong and misleading.  This is 
not the statement that was made and agreed to on Monday when we all met.  
This statement is also not consistent with what is actually in the 
attachment.  You will receive a copy of the price verifcation spreadsheet for 
the last six months on Monday.

Please call me or Theresa with questions.
Sheila

Bryan,
I think the second bullet is misleading.  The bullet is not reflective of 
what is actually stated in the attached document.
There is a month-end price verification process on the Credit book.  
Trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing.  Where the mark is 
greater that 2 points, the difference is discussed with the trader.  Trader 
must then amend the mark or provide third party substantiation for the 
illiquid position.
The Price Verifiaction Comparison Spreadsheet with broker quotes is filed and 
maintained by Risk Management.

The Operations break-down in the process relates to:
 Triplets excluded from the monthly price verification process and not 
escalated, prioritized to management
 Telewest  pricing relied on a price from the prime broker which was manually 
sourced and not current
 Price Verification Comparison results should be formalized and distributed 
to senior management.

Thanks. Sheila

We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.
