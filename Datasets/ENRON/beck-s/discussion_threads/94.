Sally and Bob, 
Please visit your GIS profile and update any necessary information for the 
January 8th, 2001 meeting.    I've outlined the two steps that you need to 
take to reach the GIS information  window.    Please call me @ 36703 if I can 
be of assistance. 
Thanks, hgm

Go to this screen first on our intranet and click on "HR Global 
Applications".   This will take you to the GIS environment. 


Click the GIS tab and update your data for the January 8th meeting if 
necessary.   If you need to update any information click the issues tab on 
the top right hand side and report any required changes.     Just to be safe, 
let me know what your requested changes are so that I can follow up on their 
update.
