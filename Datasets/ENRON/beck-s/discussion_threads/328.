Dear Mary:

ConfirmCorp is making positive inroads to the marketplace.  We are in=20
continuing talks with a few top ten energy companies.  If all goes well, we=
=20
will start beta testing on March 1.

Chorus Solutions, Inc. has taken a minority equity position in ConfirmCorp.=
 =20
Jeff O=01,Block, principal of Chorus Solutions and author of the Altra GMS=
=20
system, is acting as lead technical advisor.  Jeff's team brings technical=
=20
and management expertise to ConfirmCorp.

We are also establishing ties with the support community (e.g. on-line=20
exchanges, portals, consultants, publishers, and software vendors).  Their=
=20
peripheral influence will help broaden ConfirmCorp=01,s reach and facilitat=
e the=20
electronic confirmation process.

As before, we think Enron can really benefit from e-confirmations by taking=
=20
an active roll in the ConfirmCorp process.  Are you available for a follow-=
up=20
meeting to discuss the possibilities?

Regards,

Chris Papousek
President, Confirmation Clearing Corporation
