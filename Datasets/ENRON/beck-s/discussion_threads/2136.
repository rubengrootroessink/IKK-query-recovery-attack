CommodityLogic's financial management module is offering an "exposure 
tracker" in its version 2.0 release scheduled for Dec 15.  The credit 
deparment has raised issues on the accuracy of the data this feature will 
display and has suggested we meet with you and your group to discuss how we 
can ensure we have good data.   Apparently, they have to do a lot of manual 
calculations on the existing data, and we are asking for a daily feed with 
lots of counterparties.

I'd like to set up a meeting for Tues or Wednesday of this week to discuss 
how we can address this issue;  what time is best for you?  Call me if you 
need more info - 5-3992.   I'd like to have Tom Gros, Bill Bradford, me, and 
you and someone from your group there if possible. 

thanks!!
