Paul,
While I think it is reasonable for you to request an increase to your limits, 
as you may know, the Board doesn't meet until May 2.  It would be somewhat 
unprecedented to leave a "proprietary" position over the limit for that 
length of time, i.e., the Australian Electricity book would far exceed the 
number of position limit violations for any other commodities.  I have left a 
message for Greg and will speak to Rick Buy today.  In the meantime, I 
suggest that you put together a request for approval to increase your limits 
to be presented at the first opportunity.
Ted
