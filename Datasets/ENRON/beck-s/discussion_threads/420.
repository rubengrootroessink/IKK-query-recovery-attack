I have forwarded your message to James Scribner.  He now heads the Global 
teams and has responsibility for our relationship with D&B.

Hi, may I have access to D&B. Bruce Harris in our group mentioned that you 
might be able to gain access for me.

Thanks

Bruce:

1)  KMV.... access ID "mmenron"  PW "bryan1"   ...  please keep in mind this 
is a test ID only... only single log on (i.e., get off if you're not using).

2)  Egan-Jones... thought you already had access... we were approached "to 
fill out Houston contract"... I will ask.  Jean-Sebastien Fontaine or Tomas 
Valnek have it on their computers (via Bloomberg) if you need immediate 
assistance.

3)  D&B... I don't know.  Mary Solmonson (Houston) is who we go through for 
all the D&B stuff.  If you want Moody's, S&P, or other one-off company 
reports call Tomas Valnek (Manager of our credit analysis section).

Mike,

Would you have information on how we might get access to D&B company reports 
here in Houston?  Also KMV and Egan-Jones?

Regards,  Bruce
