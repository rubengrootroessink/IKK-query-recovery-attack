I tried to get into the reports viewer and noted that changes have been 
made.  As I am the director responsible for the DPR, I need access to all 
reports.

Please let me know when you have given me access again.

Regards,

Shona

Subject: Executive Reports Viewer

In an effort to maintain the integrity of the sensitive reports of ENA, and 
therefore, minimize access to this information, permissions to the Executive 
Reports Viewer were recently reviewed by John Lavorato, and his revisions 
were made accordingly. 

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at 3-9307 or Kristin 
Walsh at 3-9510.

Thank you,
Christa Winfrey
