Sally,
This is the communication summary we discussed.  I have detail behind the 
steps if you have any questions or would like to see more.  

Please note that the "Management Closing Meeting" is referring to the 
meetings w/you and Wes that Bauer/Sorrells have been conducting in the past.

Thank you.
Mechelle



P.S.  Enjoyed lunch today!
