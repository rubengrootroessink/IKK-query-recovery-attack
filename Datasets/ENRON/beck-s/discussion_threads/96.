We  have switched all the ENA financial gas deals that should be marked as 
physical.  Again,  we flipped these deals through a physical book so that the 
options trader could see his positions.  There appear to be deals still out 
there for Global Markets,  South America,  and ECC.  

Debbie - Some of these deals actually should still be financial.

Leslie - If you will get in touch with Canada,  I will talk to Global Markets 
and South America.

Thanks
