Frank and I are staying at the Sheraton Belgravia which is about a 5 minute 
walk to our office  -- it is small and quiet but nice rooms.  It is not on a 
major street like Picadilly or Park Lane, but we like it.  The rate is about 
o190 a night

We had to move out of our flat on Monday, so are staying there until we 
leave.  Right now we are scheduled to fly out on Sat the 20th.

Also --- just a few notes on next week

I am free Monday night if you would like to have dinner.  I know Frank and 
Maureen will be in Spain that night, they are back on Tuesday  

Also my going away party that Fernley is throwing is on Wed night -- so 
hopefully most people will drop by there.  It is just a pub thing near the 
office, but hopefully you can make it!  I am sure there will be dinner or 
something afterwards.  

Talk to you soon

Beth

Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the 
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time 
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally
