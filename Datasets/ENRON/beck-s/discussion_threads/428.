I have a few questions regarding the transition. 

Access Programmers - the contractors will be managed by the end-users they 
are supporting from now on.  The budget dollars for them are in CC 103849 - 
$50K per month.  Do you want each department to continue paying their 
invoices against these budget dollars in 103849 or through their own cost 
centers ?  Do we transfer budget dollars? Close the cost center?  

Equipment - We have 1 flat screen and several large monitors.  Should we just 
return all equipment to surplus or offer to others?

Space - Will CommodityLogic be moving and assuming the space that will be 
vacated on 3/12?

Fax machine will be disconnected/returned.  Digital Scanner will be surplused.

There are two printers that can be surplused unless someone else (CL?) 
wants/needs them.  TurkeyLegs and Tarzan.  

I currently charge 50% of my time to CL and 50% to my cost center - 103850.  
Should I continue this or charge all my time to CL and close my cost center 
?  Since Marvia is also be redeployed, there is no one else in my cost center.

Let me know if you want to sit down and discuss or you can just provide quick 
answers here or in voice mail.
