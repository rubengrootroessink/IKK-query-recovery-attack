To All EMSA students,

Attached are two versions (Word and Power Point) of a flier regarding the
Enron Informational Meeting next Tuesday (September 19th).

As the flier states, Mike McConnell, an OU graduate and a graduate of this
program (formerly known as PLM), will be the main speaker. Mike is a former
landman and is a very dynamic speaker. Mike recently assumed the position of
President and CEO of Enron Global Markets, L.L.C.. Though many of you have
heard him before. Mike has a completely new and exciting power point
presentation he will give. Not only will he talk about new things going on
at Enron and in the energy business, he will also discuss what is going on
in Exploration & Production too. It is my understanding he will also give a
fascinating demonstration about Enron On-Line ( Enron's revolutionary idea
that has completely changed the way gas and other commodities are now
traded).

I realize many of you have night classes (i.e.. Oil and Gas Law, etc) and
cannot miss it. However, you need to plan on attending the social, after
class, at Coach's. Jody Crook, Sally Beck (Vice President of Energy
Operations) and  Lexi Elliott (Enron's new college recruiter) will be here,
along with other Enron representatives, to meet and visit with you about
career opportunities with Enron and discuss questions you might have about
the energy industry in general.

Also, Enron will have a booth at the Career Fair the following day
(Wednesday, Sept. 20th). You should also plan on going to that and visiting
with them and the other companies that will also be on campus to look at EM
students too. This will give you a good comparison of what type of
opportunities that are out there and to compare the management styles of
each of these companies. I know that Enron invites comparison, as they have
obviously been very successful with their style.

Again, I expect all of you that do not have class conflicts, or try to make
arrangements to have someone cover for your class,  to attend all or at
least the social part of this presentation. Needless to say, Enron, and
especially Mike McConnell, are taking the time and expense to come up and
visit with you and to look at this program. It was this program and both Ms.
Beck's and Mr. McConnell's support, that first brought Enron to OU. We need
to make the same type of commitment to them and show them how much we
appreciate Enron's support of our program and the hiring of OU students. The
new "Participation Point  Policy" will be in effect for this and attendance
and non-excused absences will be noted.

For your information, this week is the week to sign up for Enron interviews,
through the Career Services website. Enron is scheduled to be here on
Monday, October 9th for first round interviews. If you make it to the second
round, those will take place on Tuesday, October 10th. So be aware of your
schedule to allow for interview times for both Monday and possible Tuesday
when interviewing with Enron.

Should you have any questions, or have problems opening these attachments,
please let me know.

See you at the EMSA meeting on Sunday night (e-mail coming) and next week at
"An Evening with Enron".
