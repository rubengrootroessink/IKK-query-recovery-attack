Sally
Here is the document we drafted today.  Please review in detail and revise as 
needed.

I beleive it will be in everyones best interest for you to solidify the 
organization structure with Causey,
Shankman, Lovarotta (sp) or whomever as needed.

Good Luck.

Let me know if there is anything more I can do to serve you in this process.

Respectfully,

Tom
