Shona,

Thanks for your task force summary.

Below is what I have already produced here from the London perspective.

Should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were 
especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems 
arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail 
? Also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where 
we are improving (or not as the case may be) on both a general and specific 
book basis.

James

Debbie,

Using the data you kindly sent me I had one of my guys extract the 
performance issues from a London stand point and specifically look into the 
incidence of human errors  as those we can 'influence' immediately.

I am glad to say that the human error rate is very low and over this 
(approximate) 30 business day period and in fact there were only 5 human 
errors on around 120 officialised DPRs.

London IT are also going to analyse the data to try to pinpoint trends in 
their area.

Please let me know if this is informative.

Regards James
