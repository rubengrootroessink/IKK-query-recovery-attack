Sally,

Are you aware of the problems with SAP?  This error caused an incremental 
$600,000 credit loss to Perry Gas Companies that could have been prevented.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Bill

Russell - as I remember, Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was 
interfaced to SAP.  This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P 
and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie 
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day, 
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If 
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on 
SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.

Thank you,

Russell
