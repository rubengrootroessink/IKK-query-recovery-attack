I'm meeting with Rick Causey tomorrow morning (Friday), and hopefully Sally

Subject: Controller/back office

How have you progressed with finding us candidates for controller and back 
office?  The sooner we can get these people on board the better.  I sense we 
are falling a bit behind here in relation to some of the other functions.

I can be reached in Tokyo at 81 3 5404 3818 or on my mobile at 81 90 4073 
6761.

Joe
