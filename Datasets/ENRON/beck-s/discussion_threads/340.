I'm not sure how or if you're planning on distributing to the business unit 
controllers or other ops people the updated Risk Management Policy, but I'm 
attaching a version without the limit amounts as this is what we use to 
distribute to people outside our group (of course we tell traders their own 
specific limits, and the top guys can see the consolidated DPR, but for 
everyone else we provide it without limits).  I did send it to Wanda Curry 
and Barry Pearce, but I'm not sending it to anyone in your org chart unless 
you'd like me to.  I'd like to get this out on the RAC website, but since 
it's a work in progress, I think it might be a while.


Regards,
Cassandra.
