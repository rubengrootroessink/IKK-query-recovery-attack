Sally,
I just wanted to follow up with you on John Postlewaite's options that we 
discussed when we enticed him to stay here at Enron.  I asked Kim Melodick 
and Norma Villareal if they knew anything about them and they did not.  I 
know you spoke to David Oxley about this.  Can I follow up with him?  Thanks.
Kristin
