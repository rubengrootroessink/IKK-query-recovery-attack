Sally,

Per Dorie, there will be an interactive invitation to Office of the Chair 
offsite (probably the beginning of next week).  With a click, you will RSVP & 
indicate whether or not you need airline reservations.  If so, you will be 
forwarded to a travel agent who has been selected to make these 
reservations.  Do you want me to make back-up reservations just in case 
preferable flights get booked early?

Dorie,
Are you making airline reservations?  I checked with you several weeks ago & 
you said everyone needed to make their own arrangements - Is this still the 
case or will you be handling?  If so, please call me so we can make 
arrangements for Sally Beck.

Thanks,
Patti x39106

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.

Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.



Regards
Dave and John
