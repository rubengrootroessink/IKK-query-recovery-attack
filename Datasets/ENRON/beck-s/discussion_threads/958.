Team,

Great meeting yesterday.  Thanks for your participation.  There's lots of 
great things going on throughout the organization!

Below summarizes the key points of our April 19 meeting:

Executive Committee Update
Our meeting with the Executive Committe to provide an update on Vision and 
Values is scheduled for Monday, May 15 at 11:45 for 30 minutes in the 
Boardroom.  Presenters include George Wasaff, Craig Sutter, Kirk McDaniel, 
Dave Schafer, Brian Redmond, Dick Amabile, Rachael Tobor, Gina Taylor/Beth 
Tilney and Cindy Olson.   Each presenter is responsible for presenting the 
key points/accomplishments of their sub-committee.
Presenters, please review your section of the presentation and "tighten" it 
up.  Each topic should have ONLY 1 slide.  Submit your changes to me by 
Tuesday, April 26.  
An updated presentation will be emailed to the team by Friday, April 28.
During the week of May 1 - May 5, each V&V rep should meet with their 
Executive Committee member to provide an overview of what will be presented 
on May 15. 
Please provide any feedback as a result of these meetings to me by Monday, 
May 8.
Ken, Jeff, and Joe will receive the final presentation by Wednesday, May 10. 

Excellence Through Communication
Each Business Unit/Global Function provided an update on Action Plans and 
feedback to the ETC survey.  At a glance, all of the Business Units/Global 
Functions find value in the custom questions.  Also, mail lists for the 
October 2000 survey need to be updated and the ease of accessing the survey 
needs to be consistent across business units/global functions.
Dick Amabile will summarize the update and forward it to all of the members 
of the Task Force.
In the June V&V meeting, we will link up with the ETC survey team to begin 
discussions for the October 2000 survey.

Sub-Committe Updates
P&D
Please work with your business unit/global function to identify pilots.  
Please contact Kirk McDaniel (x368251) or Dick Amabile (x33972) with ideas 
for pilots.
The team is currently working the Ad Agency on how to communicate the 
benefits and use of this tool with employees.  
The team is also considering changing the name from Participation & Dissent.

Communication Training
Work continues to enroll vp's and above in the Executive Impact & Influence 
course.  As of 4/19, 179 people (54%) have enrolled in the course with 150 
(46%) people not currently enrolled.
The On-line Basic Communication course is on schedule with plans to offer the 
course to employees during the 2nd quarter of 2001.

Communication Tools
Results of the email survey and best practice interviews were communicated to 
the group.  Action items are currently being developed and implemented based 
on the survey feedback.

Internal Communication Campaign
The campaign will formally launch on May 8 with a voicemail from Ken Lay to 
employees.  We're also working on a short video of Ken to post on IPTV on the 
Intranet.
Elevator monitors will be installed in the elevators over the next 6-8 weeks 
with a target launch date of 6-18.  The monitors will display live video, 
corporate announcements, and Vision and Values messaging along with other 
employee communication.  

Best Companies Initiative
An analysis of Enron's 2000 survey results was presented.
An employee letter from the Office of the Chairman was recommended to be 
forwarded to those employees reaching career milestones (5, 10, 15, 20, 25  
years of service).  Please forward any changes to that letter to Gina Taylor 
by Friday, April 28.  

Thanks again for a great meeting.  

Gina
