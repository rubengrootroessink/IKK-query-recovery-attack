Subject: ERMS DISCOUNTING Solution

Since December 1996, we have reserved for the over statement of our books 
because ERMS discounts from the first day of production rather than payment 
date (e.g. for gas the 25th of the following month).  The Calculaton for the 
ERMS Discounting Reserve is currently performed  monthly by Risk Controls and 
Reporting.  The December Reserve was ($7.8 million).  

At an ERMS/TAGG meeting this morning,  Zhiyong Wei and Jeremy Wong said that 
ERMS discounting could be corrected in two months.  Debbie Brackett, Chris 
Abel and I suggested that April 1st may be the best time to implement.  

Please advise Debbie, Chris or I of any concerns you may have with us 
implementing this ERMS calculation correction for a April 1st date.
Thanks, Sheila
