Attached below is a follow-up from my recent trip to London.  After reading 
through the document, I would like James to  schedule a teleconference 
meeting for Friday to discuss this further before forwarding it to the 
Commercial team.  I can meet anytime after 7:30 am Houston time.

Thanks,
Todd
