Sally - I am forwarding you the information I received from the Analyst 
Program which details the Analysts currently tagged as MSAP.  As you can see 
from Shelly's message below, she is working to clean up the data.  I hope 
this helps.  Since I will be at LSU tomorrow (Monday), I thought I would send 
this to you so you could print it out.

Subject: Commercial Support Analysts

Lisa, the attached report reflects 80 something analysts that have been 
identified as commercial support.  We are currently undergoing database clean 
up and have approx 70 analysts that have not been identified (commercial vs 
commercial support).  Once those analysts have been identified, which should 
happen early next week, I will forward yet another report your way.

I'll keep you posted.
Shelly
