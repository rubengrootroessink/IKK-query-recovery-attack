I think the daily IT issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing 
problems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues. 
I would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operational 
issues as well. 

I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday. Can the 
RAC people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues.

Thanks, Rick
