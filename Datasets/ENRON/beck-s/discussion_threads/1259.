Sally, I met with Jeff Shankman, Hunter Shively, Fletch Sturm and Laura Luce 
yesterday re: Chicago resources. Everyone is in agreement that we need to 
assign the overall Chicago office support activities to one individual within 
your group who will be completely responsible for activities relative to deal 
booking, DPR accuracy, P/L accuracy, transfer pricing accuracy, accounting, 
scheduling, (EOL activity support?), etc. This will be a full-time job I 
think. Could we make this happen asap. Let's get together and discuss if need 
be. Thanks Sally!
