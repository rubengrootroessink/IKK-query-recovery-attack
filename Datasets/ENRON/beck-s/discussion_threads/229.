Sally,

Thought this was good....

Hey, here is another wonderful group of facts about women.  I don't
normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance.  Even if
your a skeptic read to the bottom.



Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means
you.


There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only
eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman,
she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman
weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged
women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed --
not perfect!

A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a
fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and
shameful.  Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
Today they  weigh 23% less.

Beauty of a Woman -

The beauty of a woman
Is not in the clothes she wears,
The figure she carries
Or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman
Must be seen from her eyes,
Because that is the doorway to her heart,
The place where love resides.

The beauty of a woman
Is not in a facial mole,
But true beauty in a woman
Is reflected in her soul.

It is the caring that she lovingly gives
The passion that she shows,
The beauty of a woman
With passing years - only grows.

An English professor wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on
the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.  The men
wrote: "Woman, without her man, is nothing."   The women wrote: "Woman!
Without her, man is nothing."

The Images of Mother -
4 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mommy can do anything!
8 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mom knows a lot!  A whole lot!
12 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything.
14 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either.
16 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned.
18 YEARS OF AGE  ~ That old woman? She's way out of date!
25 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.
35 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.
45 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it?
65 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

Please send this to five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women's
History Month.  If you do, something good will happen...  You will Boost
another woman's self-esteem.
