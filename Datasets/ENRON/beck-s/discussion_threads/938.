Sally - I received a 2nd message from Shelly which provided the detail of all 
analysts in the Program.  The previous E-mail contained only those analysts 
labeled as MSAP.  If you need anything tomorrow (Monday), please leave me a 
voice mail message as I will check them form LSU.  I hope this helps.

Subject: Report Request

Lisa - see the attached report that reflects both commercial and commercial 
support analysts.   I will forward a report exclusive to the commercial 
support as soon as I get it (should be this afternoon).  Call me if you need 
anything else.

Have a great day!
Shelly : )
