This system was just implemented for ENA etal as a Global system.  We are 
working on convincing Europe to incorporate into their EnVision plan.  There 
could be potential to include this in the Commodity Logic family as a way to 
aggregate and serve time series price information to users.  A direct 
competitor of this product would be FAME Energy which I looked at earlier 
this week.  On the surface, it would appear our system is more robust than 
the one offered by FAME.

Dear All,

Please be aware that earlier today the MKM system was pushed to production. 

http://mkm.corp.enron.com

We are currently in the process of moving the system from the UK to our 
clustered servers in Houston. This early release will give us some useful 
feedback on the visual interface and help promote the MKM approach to other 
business and application development groups. I will keep you informed of our 
progess.

Any questions please call x37747.

Thanks,

Stuart
