James

As promised - an initial stab at your iternary in London with some 
suggestions for some additional people to visit. I am confident that Sally 
can add to this list for you to visit ( less specifically aligned to the four 
key topics we agreed for your visit )

Have a quick look and feel free to call me today or tomorrow to add to the 
timetable !!

I am looking forward to your arrival

Mike
