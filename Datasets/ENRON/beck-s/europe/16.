Would still like to catch periodically - can your assistant contact me to 
discuss ( say ) a fortnightly/monthly call ?

Unfortunately, some of the slides sent to you were drafts and are now 
somewhat outdated.  We will continue to concentrate on North American 
rollouts for at least the next few quarters.  There is no formal date on the 
schedule for a European rollout.
