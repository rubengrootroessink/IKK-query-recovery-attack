No we are not planning to do a separate process around exceptions to 
currently defined standards - Doug Imrie is acting as co-ordinator here in 
Europe for reporting into Mike - we are awaiting the standard template for 
consolidation in Houston ( I deliberately did not get my guys to set up their 
own reporting stats !! ).

The below note is simply a PR exercise from John Sherriff to remind people 
throughout Europe ( and especially in Commercial groups ) that fundamental 
standards exist and must be followed ( He believes the message should be sent 
given the turnover in staff and recent arrival of Metals to Enron Europe ).;

I am keen that the basis of the note IS consistent with our global views and 
underpins our global reporting !!

Dear Mike,

Thanks for the update - it looks like you are doing much of the same thing as 
we are here.  We are currently talking to all ops groups world-wide and 
starting to report exceptions to current standards.  Let's coordinate these 
two processes.

Regards

I think the note is fine. My concern would be access to details of the 
standards themselves. People will be less inclined to come to you and me, but 
they may well click on an intranet link to the policies and procedures 
website for example.

For your consideration.

Thanks

Fernley

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Mike
