Thanks Sally.  It is great having Brent over here and I appreciate you 
stretching the North American operation to facilitate his
being here now.  Look forward to speaking with you soon!

Subject: Added Role

Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.  I look forward 
to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management 
operations initiatives.  

I talk with Brent Price several times a week.  I know that Fernley has 
appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his 
involvement to be beneficial as well.  We are almost at the half way mark on 
his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary 
to get your input on his role to date.
