Can we please have the RC that should be charged for the upgrade for Todd's 
housing from single to accompanied?

Thanks,

Jane

Matt

Please can you arrange for Todd Hall, who is coming from Houston to work for 
Barry Pearce, to stay at Dolphin Square apartments? Please liaise with him 
directly on this.

We have a bit of a complicated costing situation. Barry Pearce will be taking 
the cost of the normal one bedrooms at Dolphin Square and Sally is taking the 
rest of the cost.

Jane - please provide the costs for Sally's RC.

Thanks
Tara

Sally has decided to go with the 2 bedroom Dolphin Square accommodations for 
Todd.  Please reserve them for March 25th through at least April 15.

Thanks.
