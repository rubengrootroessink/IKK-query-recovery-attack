Sally Beck, and I discussed sometime ago the need for a meeting of the key=

business unit controllers across all commodities and locations, to promote=

a global contact network ( surprisingly, this is absent with only a few=20
business unit controllers known outside of their location )
common standards and best practices
a defined role of business controller - to raise the bar for these key peop=

individual business priorities
a focus on assessing operational risk within businesses - that should lend=

Given my definition of the role of a business controller .....=20

I have planned to take the following staff to the conference in Houston
Mike Jordan  European Middle Office
James New  Gas, Power and Credit Controller=20
Mike Wellings   UK Power Controller
Coralie Evans  Continental Power Controller
Robert Yeo  UK and Continental Gas Controller
Paul D=01,Arcy  Structured Transactions Controller
David Wall  Credit Controller
Andrew Cornfield Metals' Risk Manager ( representing Kevin Rhodes & Howard=

Carter )

This is an investment in our key risk staff and I believe the upside from=

their participation is significant. However, I have been keen to minimise=
=20
costs and time out of the office ( by flying on Sunday ) and have obtained=
=20
'discounts' where possible. The cost per person for the trip equates to=20

Economy Flights for all   o401 + tax of o56
Hotel     $250 for 2 nights
Share of meals / entertainment cost $300 for 2 nights ( estimated )

Total EEL budget for offsite   $10,000=20

Additionally  - taking all the lead risk managers / controllers out of the=
