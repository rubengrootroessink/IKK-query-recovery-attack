Sally,

It has taken a few weeks for me to write this memo, but I wanted to make sure 
that I thanked you for making Todd available to us in London.  Todd was a 
great help.  He provided the experience, professionalism and insight that we 
were lacking on book splitting team.  Todd did a very good job of moving the 
process forward and outlining some projects that need to undertaken in the 
future.  I hope that he will have the time to come back to London once or 
twice to help evaluate the progress made on his ideas.  

Thanks again,

Joe

PS If you have anyone of Todds caliber that needs a new challenge, please let 
me know.
