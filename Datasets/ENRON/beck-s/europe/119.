Tara,

I talked withTodd today, but we still don't have anything firm yet. He 
currently intends for his family to return to the U.S. sometime the week of 
May 8th with or without him. If that is the case, he himself should be able 
to be out before May 15 even if he has to relocate to a hotel. However, he's 
asked for another week to get things in order. 

We agreed to talk again next Tuesday, April 25, to nail down exact dates. Is 
this okay? Are there any constraints that require us to firm this up before 
then?

Thanks,
Tom x33926
