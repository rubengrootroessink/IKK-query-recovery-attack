I had arranged for this process to move along in Europe in parallel with 
Joel's instruction of AA in Houston. Do you foresee any issues here ?

Subject: Risk TRAC Clarification

Just to clarify, I believed you would like me to document the process of the 
feeds from the deal capture and valuation systems (Power 99 etc.) into the 
Risk TRAC database which flows through to CAS.

David Hardy was not in the meeting today, but Oliver Gaylard made a good 
point that Simon Sear (ie the Strategic Initiatives) Group may be doing this, 
do you want me to continue with this?

Kind regards

D
