Rick,

The attached report is an updated version of the document we discussed on 
Friday of last week. Some of the numbers in the exposure analysis are still 
draft and I expect firm numbers in the next few hours. 

My aim would be to streamline this report for the presentation to Joe Sutton, 
but I would welcome your steer on how you plan to conduct the meeting and 
whether or not this format is appropriate.

Regards

Fernley
