In order  to improve efficiency and segregation of duties within 
International Global Products, a new Coordination team is being created in 
London to take on the Control functions currently performed within the 
Logistics team.

This will allow the Commercial Logistics team to concentrate on improving the 
bottom line results by negotiations and arrangements with outside parties. 
The Commercial Logistics team (Europe) headed by Graham Cane will now report 
to Chris Mahoney.

The Coordination function has been set up by Cindy Horn, who will be handing 
over the leadership to Becky Millerchip on following the implementation of 
SAP for Global Products. This team will handle all paperwork and 
reconciliations with regard to product movements of Global Products generated 
by the London and Helsinki offices, and the further processing of this 
information to the systems and users downstream. 

The Coordination function for Houston and Panama City will be headed by 
Michelle Bruce, with the Logistics team headed by John Harrison now reporting 
directly to John Nowlan.  Michelle will build her team during the third 
quarter.

A similar rationalisation of roles in the Far Eastern offices will be 
announced in due course.

Please join us in congratulating Graham and Becky, Michelle and John  on 
their new responsibilities, and in thanking Cindy for her hard work in making 
this happen.
