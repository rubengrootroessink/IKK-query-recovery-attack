As you are aware, the SAP Financial Systems will be implemented for the Enron 
Gas Pipeline Group, Enron North America and Enron Energy Services companies 
on July 1, 2000.  To effectively transfer the invoice processing from the 
legacy MSA system to the SAP system, the following dates should be followed:


June 23: Invoice processing on the MSA system will stop except for emergency 
payments, wire transfers and ACHs.

June 26: Invoice processing on the SAP system will begin for the GPG, ENA and 
EES companies.  Accounts Payables will input invoices into the SAP system 
starting on this date, but checks will not be printed until the first payment 
run is processed on July 5.

June 28: Last day to input employee expense reports with ACH in the MSA 
system.

June 29: Last day to input emergency payments and wire transfers in the MSA 
system.

June 30: Accounts Payable to clean up outstanding open balances in the MSA 
system.

July 5:  All invoices will be entered into SAP and the first payment run is 
processed.


Please remember, all invoices sent to Accounts Payable on or after June 23 
must have SAP general ledger coding applied to the invoice.
