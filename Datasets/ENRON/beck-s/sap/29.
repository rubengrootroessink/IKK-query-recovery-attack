I gave a copy of this document to Wes Colwell immediately following last 
week's meeting with a note that he needed to respond to you.  He is the most 
appropriate respondent from ENA.  --Sally

At the Financial Council meeting last Thursday, we distributed a write-up 
entitled "Workshops".  In it we discussed the work performed to date, the 
results, and three options for proceeding.

Could you please take a look at the document (it's a very quick read), call 
me if you need more information, and then "vote" for which option you would 
prefer?  I would appreciate your response by this Friday.  if you don't vote, 
then you will get what the majority votes for.  If there is significant 
division in the votes, we can discuss a "tailored" approach at the next 
Financial Council meeting.

We are trying to do what YOU want; we just need you to tell us which approach 
you prefer.  Thanks!
