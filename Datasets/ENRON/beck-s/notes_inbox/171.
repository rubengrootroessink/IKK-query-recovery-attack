Subject: List of Primary and Backup Book Administrators

As part of the Risk Task Force I am requesting for you to have your book 
administrators fill out the attached spreadsheet in order to have a complete 
listing of all Book Administrators and what book(s) each is responsible for 
officializing. I have included an example sheet in the workbook but if they 
have any questions please have them call me at 3-5686.  I would like to get 
this information returned electronically by close of business Friday, 
November 10, 2000. Thank you
