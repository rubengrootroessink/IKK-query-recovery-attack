We have figured out why the credit group is getting so many "New 
Counterparty" names in gas.  The spreadsheets that they are getting that 
information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.  The value is 
captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would 
be doublecounting credit risk.  The spreadsheet download has a specific 
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name  (which in 
this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)  I am working with Debbie to 
figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty 
at all from the spreadsheet.  It will be done as quickly as possible.

Thanks
