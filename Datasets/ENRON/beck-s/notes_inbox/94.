Sally, 

Thanks for your message this morning.  Attached is an E-mail that Amy Gambill 
sent out along with Todd's resume.  I was a little worried about forwarding 
Todd's resume directly to Shona since her husband is an ERM/Audit manager at 
KPMG.  Todd wants to make sure that noone at KPMG finds out that he is 
interested in Enron.  I thought it would be better if you forwarded his 
resume to Shona along with a note insuring that  this is keep quiet.  Please 
feel free to call me with any questions about Todd and thanks again for your 
help.  I honestly believe that Todd is a top performer at KPMG and would make 
a great addition to your team.

Thanks,

John

Hi guys!

This is an employee referral which came to me from John Mackel in EES.  I've 
spoken with Todd, and though he is happy in his position with KPMG and not 
actively seeking other opportunities, he would not mind exploring 
opportunities at Enron should a good fit for his skills come up (John's been 
telling him wonderful things about Enron).  He would be particularly 
interested in a trading analyst/P&L/mid office type position.  John had 
mentioned Sally Beck's world to me and Todd mentioned the same.

If any of you do have anything in mind, please let me know.  Should any of 
you consider contacting Todd, it might be best to contact him at home.  Since 
he is happy with his current employer, he was really concerned with 
confidentiality when we spoke.  I assured him that you guys always handle 
contacting prospective candidates with a great deal of respect for their 
privacy.

I really enjoyed my conversation with Todd.  If any of you guys have openings 
which may fit his skill set, I think he'd really be worth giving a call.

Thanks!
Amy
