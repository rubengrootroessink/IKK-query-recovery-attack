Veronica
It's in the Doorstep folder in my directory.

To be done prior to 10am meeting (Veronica has THE presentation)

Insert Schedule as page 2 (page 1 being Title page)
Insert Summary of Findings (Sherri to give to Veronica) as page 4, behind 
page 3 "Institutionalized"
Fix page numbering
Resolve open issues (Moscoso, Hayden,etc.) - (Shona to get back with Veronica 
to make changes to presentation.)
6 Copies (black and white) for 10 am meeting (get AC/Rita to do)
