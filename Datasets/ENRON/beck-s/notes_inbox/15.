As discussed with you earlier, here is the summary of changes/enhancements to 
the DPR group (to be implemented in order of priority):

Violation memos - to be prepared by 12pm by the next day for review by 
Chris.  Within two weeks of today this time should move to 10am, the goal 
that within the next 2 months certain violation prelim reporting will be done 
the evening of trading.  
Process - 8am or before DPR group to obtain understanding of violations for 
previous day of trading.  8-10 am write explanations, ensure sign-off 
obtained by trader.  10am - give violations to Chris for review. Issue 
violations as soon as group numbers are final (as a opposed to total DPR 
being final).  To be performed by Johnny Thibadeaux
Daily logs of problems - 
Late submissions - Michael/Johnny to print out log of late daily submissions 
and provide to Chris.  Chris to call business controller to let them know of 
late reporting
Listing of special problems - everyday the DPR group works on special 
problems.  Johnny & Chris to take over more of the resolution of problems (to 
free up Michael for putting the DPR tgether).  All problems and the time it 
took to work through them to be reported on a daily log provided to Chris.  
Chris to call business controller to let them know of problem
Daily prudency reporting - DPR group to start daily reporting of prudency.  
Audience to be determined (RAC wants it but I am opposed to putting it on the 
website)

Johnny is to push through these process changes.

If you have any questions/comments please call me.

Best regards

Shona
