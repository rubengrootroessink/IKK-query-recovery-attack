First of all I want to thank you and David for the two Orange Bowl tickets.  
It has been a wonderful season for the Sooners and it is certainly one I will
not soon forget.  I am very excited about the chance to play for our seventh 
National Championship,  **(Texas has three, just in case you were 
wondering)**,
but enough of that Texas-OU, excuse me OU-Texas trash-talking.  Due to 
various reasons, I have decided not to make the trip to Miami.  None of my 
friends
were going to be able to make it and it would have delayed some of my 
financial plans for the upcoming year.   I will nonetheless be there in 
spirit as I 
raise the roof at Ruggles in Enron Field, site of the OU watch party.  I 
believe that Nate Blackburn and Rafael Avila plan to make the trip and our 
still looking for tickets.  I have not mentioned your tickets as I thought 
you may have someone else in mind.  If by some stretch of the imagination you 
have trouble finding takers for the tickets please let me know.  Once again 
thanks for the offer and I hope you and David have a great time in Miami.

Jody
