Hey Guys - can you help please?

I need an good accountant to help set-up and run a 'Real Estate & 
Co-Location' Book for EBS. Full time - senior specialist level.

I've tried the 'market' - but it's thin. Can you help? Can you assign be 
somebody from Corp or someplace else for the rest of the year?

Thanks.

Barry.
