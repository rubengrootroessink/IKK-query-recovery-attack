To better leverage intellectual capital across Enron Net Works, we have several organizational announcements to share with you:

Sally will continue to lead the day-to-day operations of our mid & back office.  In addition to leading the development and marketing of Commodity Logic, Tom will have primary responsibility for the marketing of our mid & back office services.  Beth will continue to lead IT development for the Americas, including Commodity Logic and all other systems necessary to deliver mid & back office services.

Sheri will move to the mid & back office commercialization effort reporting to Tom Gros.  Jennifer Denny will assume Sheri's responsibilities as the lead for product control.
