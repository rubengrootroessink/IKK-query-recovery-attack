Sally,

I ordered the lily of the valley.

Are you having PMS?

(Just kidding--I never mind suggestions...it is their 50th and I think Mom
will be expecting the orchids and the lillies--and we all know what hell
there is to pay when we don't meet those expectations....)

Cindy

What is lily of the valley?  I don't know.  Would it add anything special
to the coursage?  If so, I would be glad to spring for it.  I just don't
know enough about flowers to make an educated call.  Could the florist tell
you how wonderful it is for $60?

Meagan and Michael often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate -
maybe only key for the "young set", and not those who buy pens to
commemorate a 50th anniversary. White rose will be great if the florist
feels like the coordinated thing would be weird.  We will be upgrading dad
from a carnation, anyway.

You know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.  I don't mean
for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful!!  (I am saving that in
full force for later life -- only kidding!) --Sally

   Got ones with white orchids--but the lily of the valley would be an
   additional $60--what do you think?  Got a white rose for dad.
