Vladimir,

The resume did not come through with Sally's email.  Can you please resend?  I will review and get him in front of the right people.

Thanks,

Robert

I printed copies of this resume the day that I received it from you.  I met with Beth Perlman that day and gave her the resume in person.  I also called Philippe Bibi and sent him a copy of the resume.  I am also by way of this e:mail message going to copy Robert Jones on this resume.  Robert heads up HR for Enron Net Works.  Feel free to give Beth, Philippe and Robert a call to add your personal comments about the candidate.  --Sally

Sally,

Per our conversation, I am attaching a resume of James Kantara. This gentleman is one of the smartest classmates in the Executive MBA program at Rice, and I highly recommend him.
