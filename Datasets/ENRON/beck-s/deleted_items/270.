Sally,
I  have been thinking of you and the first time we met at a conference in New York.  Much more innocent times. 

 To answer your question, I went to Euro Disney in october and I am scared of rollercoasters.  However, Teddy being 8 years old, I had to go on them.  I found Space Mountain (roller coaster in the dark) much easier to handle than a similar one where I actually could see the danger that I was putting myself in.
 
While it must be difficult for your people, they could do a lot worse than have you in charge.  Good luck with this situation.  I hope to speak to you soon.
Best to David and family.
Ted

Are we having some fun now?  Thought about you today - in fact, ran across a business card of yours that I had in a file from Phibro Energy.  

I know that I have missed your insight and opinions into Enron's roller-coaster.  Is this ride better with eyes open or closed?  --Sally
