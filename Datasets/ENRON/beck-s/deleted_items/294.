I have been sort of waiting to talk to you about having a small event for my direct reports to thank them for their efforts until things cooled down at the company overall, but -- I don't see that happening any time soon.

We have not really done anything at all this year, and I wanted to do an event similar to the one you had last summer for us.  They have worked so hard and we can't ever all get away from the office at the same time  -- even to have a lunch.

Was thinking about having them over to my house for drinks and then out to eat at a restraunt.  For my direct reports and spouses.  Will include both Global Services and EES.  Was thinking of Friday night after work Dec 7th.  Need to get planning if I get the go ahead.

I have a reasonably priced italian restraunt in mind, and it would be about 20 people.   Are you ok with that? And if so, would you and David want to come too?

Let me know your thoughts

Beth
