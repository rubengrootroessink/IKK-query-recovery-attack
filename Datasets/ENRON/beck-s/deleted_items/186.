You guys have probably seen this, but wanted to make sure -- London is kicking off a huge effort to look at replacing the AS400 for metals.  (See presentation attached below)

Paul Freeman should be very good in this capacity, based upon what I know of his prior experience.  They have also assigned some fairly senior people to work with him full time.

Am discussing with Mike Jordan in further detail on Thursday, and will encourage him to provide another status update on the Metals business (including recycling)
