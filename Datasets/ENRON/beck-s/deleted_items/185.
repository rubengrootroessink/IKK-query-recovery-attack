	The attached document is the summary inventory report of HPL active records that will be turned over to AEP at sale closing.  We have identified a total of 
30, 632 linear inches of paper documents as well as electronic meta data and images.  Deal confirmations to be turned over to AEP have been identified and are being printed from Livelink.
  
	The inventory of active records is complete.  A paper copy of the detailed report will be delivered to you.  We will continue to track and monitor the location of these records during the transition of personnel from Enron to AEP and update the report accordingly.

	Please contact me if you need further clarification or additional information.

	Carolyn C. Gilley
	Manager, Information and Records Management
