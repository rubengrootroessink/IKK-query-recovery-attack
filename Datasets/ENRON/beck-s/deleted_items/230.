I am happy to say everything is going well, we are on track, all pc's in place and powered, fault resolution in progress.

We had a small issue with the power 24hr phones, all inbound calls were intercepted at portland on the rollover group, the issue was rectified and all is working as designed

I will keep you updated as we progress
