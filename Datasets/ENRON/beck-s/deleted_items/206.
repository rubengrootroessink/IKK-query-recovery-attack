Sheri is on your calender Tuesday to discuss your help.  I assume she will get some of your personal help and also alot of help from Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, etc.

As you know, we will only get one chance to make a good impression and it is our sale, not EA's, so we are in complete control of what we pitch and how we pitch it.

On you going personally, I am not real sure who the attendees should be so let's discuss that next plan next week. 

What are your initial thoughts at possibly doing their mid/back office?  Lot's of physical and financial gas and power in North America.

Do you want my help in preparing something for Paul?  Would you like me to go with you when you meet with Paul?

Paul,

Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work and responsibility these days.

Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever increasing transaction flow.

In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would like to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team what we mean by "outsourcing" your mid and back office functions to our "ProsessCo/ServiceCo."  I think we have identified what types of services we could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically, you have risk reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation, nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and cash payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it hopefully makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to accomodate your growing business instead of you building it from scratch.  

I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on security/neutrality, comparable service levels to Enron, term and the ability to do financial easier than physical.  We can go through all that as well.

I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

Let me know your thoughts.

Piper


PS  Let's do another dinner with McGowan, etc. soon (or play golf some time or catch some beers).
