Sally - I'm sure this is one of several copies you have received but I wanted to make sure you saw it.  I was also curious what Mark Palmer has to do with this project.   Leslie

Subject:	Initial Valuation Model / Back Office

Hi All:

I was talking to Fred today and we thought that it would be a good idea to distribute a summary of the initial valuation model of the Back Office opportunity (as created by Marc Eichmann).  

It'll be great to get feedback and work together so we can validate this assumptions and refine the model as much as we can. Please pay attention to the following:

?	Enron cost per transaction
?	Sale prices (assumptions)
?	Profit margins (these are derived from the sale price per transaction)
?	Transaction counts

Please note that there are three scenarios, P50 being the expected case.

We will also need to validate all the revenue related assumptions with market and customer information (Is there any sort of market or customer research done? Do we know how much will a customer be willing to pay for the services?, etc.).

I'll be glad to meet with you and explain the assumptions and how the model works.

I can be reached at extension 54658. Thanks for your time.

 
Sergio
