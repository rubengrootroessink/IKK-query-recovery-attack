Effective, February 1, 2001, ENW Contractors are required to utilize the SAP/CATS systems to record all time worked.  Each Cost Center Owner is responsible for keeping track of their Contractors' hours on a monthly basis, as well as ensuring Contractor compliance with this mandate.

At the end of each month, ENW Accounting is providing Contractor reporting to Office of the Chair.  However, the accuracy of this report is dependent on Contractors entering their time into SAP.

As a result, going forward, a second "non-compliance" report will be submitted to Office of the Chair on a monthly basis, detailing Contractors not entering their time and the Contractor supervisor.  Please contact Diane Latson (X5-7184) if you believe your contractors are exceptions and should not be entering time.

Contractor Time Entry

Contractors are required to enter their time in eHRonline to one of the following: (1) project numbers, which are called WBS Elements; (2) cost centers, which are associated to a specific department and not a formal project.  It is the Supervisor's responsibility to ensure Contractors are provided with the proper project or cost center coding.

Unlike invoice coding, SAP will only accept a Cost Center or WBS element number for each time entry line.  This means that you cannot enter a Cost Center and a WBS element number on the same line.  SAP will read this information from left to right and will only pick up the first entry.  For example:

		CostCenter		WBS Element			
		123456		c.9999.99.99.99		

The system will look at this entry and all time will be charged as expense to Cost Center 123456. 

Any questions regarding  time entry coding should be directed to ISC HR support x5-4727.
