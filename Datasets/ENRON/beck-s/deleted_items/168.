Sally wants to have the opportunity to interview all prospective manager candidates before we extend an offer to them.    Please facilitate this request with a gentle reminder to the hiring manager when they decide to extend an offer.   
Also, all previous Enron employees who reapply with EOPS need to be scrutinized by the Hiring Manager and Sally regarding possible poor past performance.   We do not want to rehire poor performers.    In some cases a poor performer has been rehired more than once.  
This request applies only to EOPS Hiring Managers.   It does not currently apply to EIM or EGM Commercial Support.
