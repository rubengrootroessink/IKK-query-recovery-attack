Looking forward to our discussion today.

I've jotted down a few thoughts for an agenda.  I think that it is
important that Kenny and I get a good understanding of what the scope of
the operation is and what it's relationship to the Netco is.

Please review this and let me know if I have missed anything or if you all
have other thoughts.

Thanks and look forward to it.
