Sorry for the delay in getting back with you.  This has been a wild week
and a half - end of school activities for the children, birthdays of both
of my daughters and at work a move to a different floor, one full day
offsite meeting and all of the details around the sale of our intrastate
pipeline completed May 31.  I have commitments for a business dinner on
Wednesday, June 6th (moved from the 29th this week, the rescheduling of
which had a bearing on my availability next week). Patti said that you
asked about dinner on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  Coorindating with
the home schedule, it looks as if Thursday would be the better evening for
dinner, if you are still planning to be in Houston.  I would certainly not
want your new attire to go unused!  I will be leaving the office shortly to
drive to Austin - 50th anniversary celebration for my parents.  Patti will
be in this afternoon and I will ask her to talk with you to see if
Thursday, June 7 works for your schedule.  --Sally

   Sally,
   So sorry we haven't been able to connect.  Here I went out and purchased
   a
   new spiffy 3 bottom suit, shirt with French cuffs, spit shinned my
   shoes,
   new cashmere socks, Allen Edmons shoes, exquisite tie and bought the
   finest
   parfum from Boucheron...and here, I sit.  Hopefully this finds you well.
   All my best,

   Geoffrey Mann
