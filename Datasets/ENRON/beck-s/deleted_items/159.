Patti,

I don't know if you can remember back a few months from when I was last over in Houston but you mentioned the possibility of being able to see a baseball game when I was over in June.

Well I will be over in Houston from 10th of June for 2 weeks and was wondering if the tickets were available. I will be coming over with 2 other risk managers for those 2 weeks so 3 tickets would be perfect.

Thanks James
