Sally -

We had a conversation today with Kishkill.  He said that he was more interested in just understanding how the back office was presently working.  His concern is that the volumes will be picking up substantially in Sept./ Oct.  and we will not be properly staffed.  He also said that he would be back here towards the end of June and he would try to meet with you.  

If the volume picks up significantly,  we should look into the following (in my view):

1.  Setting up the back office shop in South America,  or
2.  At least hiring a back office liason between the two offices so that both commercial and controls have a comfort level.
