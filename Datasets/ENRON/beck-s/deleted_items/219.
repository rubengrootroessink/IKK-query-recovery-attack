You have the relationship with Paul, so I would suggest that you go.  I think that only one of the two of us needs to be there, given the additional attendee list of Tom, Tommy, Sheri and Bob.  I would say that of that group, the most credible (i.e. knowledge of the business, the operations functions and our systems that support them) are Bob Hall and Tommy.  If you feel like we should cut down the number of Enron attendees, this is just my two cents worth.  

Just for a time-frame reference regarding Thomas McAndrew's departure date, I took the role over operations in January 1997.  I still owe you the "bear in the bicycle story" over a beer sometime to give you an idea of the state of the union when I took the role.  We did a lot of upgrading of personnel in 1997, changed our internal definitions of acceptable performance, and created dedicated teams to work on the implementation of Sitara and Unify (in 1998 and 1999).  We probably weren't doing a great job in operations when Thomas left.   

I got with Sheri right after our meeting and gave her slides that I thought would be most effective in the presentation.  I also gave her appropriate stats for operational performance.  I will review the revised presentation tomorrow morning before you see the next version.   I will also take a look at Bob Shults' presentations, as it sounds as if the tone is similar to the one that we would like to use.  It is working for Bob, so if there is something there that we can copy, we will do it!  --Sally

On the Calpine meeting Thursday, should I go and/or should you go?  

The meeting we had today was not real focused and I want to make sure that your personal touch is on that presentation at a minimum.

Your thoughts?
