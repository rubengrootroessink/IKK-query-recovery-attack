Please remove the pre-offsite meetings with Greg Piper from your calendars:

Sally - Today at 2:30 p.m.
Beth - Friday at 8:30 a.m.
Tom - Friday at 9:00 a.m.

Sally, Beth and Tom will be presenting on mid/back office together at the Management Offsite on May 30.  I need to schedule a meeting for Sally and Beth to meet with Greg.  Patti and Cheri, please forward availability for tomorrow and Thursday for a 1-hour meeting with Greg.

Brenda, please let Tom know that Sally and Beth will start working on the presentation and Tom can catch up with them when he gets back on Friday.

Thanks,
