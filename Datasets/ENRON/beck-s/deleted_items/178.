I have the final audit report from AA.  It was delivered with the reconcili=
ation that we requested AA to perform.

If you remember, AA finished their study about the time of the final negoti=
ations with AEP.  After discussions with Brian
the audit was findings were put on hold.

I agree with Ed about AA being caught in the middle.  They were really func=
tioning as our internal audit staff, plus
trying to stay neutral about their findings.  If Enron is going to audit th=
e last year of service ending April, I would like to
go ahead and notify Reliant/Entex and find another firm to perform the audi=
t.=20

Let me know the next steps if any.

Thanks

bob

A summary of AA's final audit results was never delivered to me, Brenda and=
 Bob (I have added Brenda and Bob to the distribution) were handling the AA=
 audit team and I have never seen a compilation of the items we agreed to i=
n our last meeting with AA just before the HPL sale negotiations started.  =
This does not mean Bob or Brenda may not have the information but I have ne=
ver seen it.  (Confidentially, I think AA was struggling with their role in=
 this because Entex/Reliant is such a large customer of theirs)  In our las=
t meeting we agreed to use the audit issues as leverage to clarify the inte=
nt of the contract.  Who were the other suppliers, how were they allocated,=
 clear definition of which citygates HPL served off-system and access to ba=
lancing information on a real time basis for planning purposes.  A better u=
nderstanding of Entex's transportation agreement on Midcon and a more proac=
tive role in the management of the transportation contract  Or, if we could=
 not get some of this information and cooperation, HPL would reduce its rol=
e with Entex to deliveries at HPL's sales point (basically out of HPL's ass=
et) into Midcon, etc.

Clarification of contract issues will help HPL identify those Entex markets=
 we can consider incremental on other pipelines (currently Entex/Midcon cla=
ims some Midcon citygates are outside the 10 bcf commitment and additive to=
 Midcon's supply contract with Entex (part of HPL's audit issues is that th=
ere is no definitive agreement on which ones).  Indentification has the aff=
ect of determining those Entex markets HPL should spend their capital on be=
cause theoretically we have the other markets via the transportation agreem=
ent.

Other issues revolve around Entex's allocation proceedure for R/C and indus=
trial gas users.  As you all know, there is a significant difference in pri=
ce between the two.  Entex's allocation proceedure needs to be clearly docu=
mented and supported.  HPL is in the unusual position of having its custome=
r (Entex) determine the allocation and whether or not the customer (Entex) =
has met all its obligations, naturally, the customer rarely falls short of =
its contractual requirements with this process.

Any monies recovered in this process belong to the desk, it was their perfo=
rmance risk, storage revenue, P/L etc that was at risk during the contract =
year.  Additionally, a new audit period for the last contract year will be =
at the end of this month.  If Enron is going to pursue this, it would be ap=
propriate to contact Entex for preperation for an additional audit.  I sugg=
est we avoid the AA conflict (we should have enough work papers etc. to sup=
port the effort) and go with one of the other large audit firms who has no =
alliance to Reliant or Entex.

Team:

I met with Brad Blevins and Jim Ducote today regarding credits and obligati=
ons (implied, documented or otherwise) between Entex, ENA and HPL.  We need=
 to pull the above group together to get a consistent view on:

1.=09The definition and transfer of ENA obligations to Entex and reserves a=
gainst those obligations to HPL/AEP.

2.=09The creation of an A/R invoice to Entex for payment based on the defin=
itive results of the audit.

Brad/Jim:  can you email the note you gave me today to the above group.

Tom/Ed:  can you pull together a summary of the results of the audit showin=
g what Entex owes HPL and what Entex owes ENA.

Lillian: can you arrange a meeting with the above group to discuss.

Thanks,
Brian
