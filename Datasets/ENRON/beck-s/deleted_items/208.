I completely agree. If you don't mind, please give her a call and introduce yourself. I expect Sheri as part of her transition to introduce Savita to the relevant folks in the operations organization. If it were not for Jennifer Deny taking maternity leave I would expect her to fulfill the role Sheri had with operations, but I would like Savita to develop those relationships as well.

As a point of interest, why would I ever not support Savita maintaining the free flow of information between the groups ? I have absolutely nothing to gain and everything to lose from this not occurring.
