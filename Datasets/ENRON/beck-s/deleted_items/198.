Mike and Sally:

I have attached a spreadsheet which contains graphs reflecting the following numbers.  These numbers are from the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Unfortunately, I do not have any recruiting numbers reflecting back before I began recruiting at Enron.

I will be happy to meet with you to provide further explanation and to discuss our participation in the endowment and trading floor sponsorship.

Please let me know if I can provide additional information.

Thanks!
