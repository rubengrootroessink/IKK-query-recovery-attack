  I am concerned that Mark has gone back into a group that we will end up with From Evan Hughes.

Wouldn't that be ironic!

I am not sure which piece Bob Hurt is responsible for, but I know he works for Evan.

Janie,

I am joining Bob Hurt's organization in company 0985, cost center 120041 (please validate the cost center). I went into redeployment on 5/29, and effective 5/31, I am working for Bob. Please transfer me out of redeployment and into Bob's organization. Please give me a call if you have any questions.

My office number will be changing this weekend. I can be reached on my cellular phone at 713-854-4444.

Thanks,

Mark Evans
