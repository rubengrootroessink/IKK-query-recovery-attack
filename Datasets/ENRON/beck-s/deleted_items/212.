Not a problem - we have not decided exactly which slides, if any, will be taken to Calpine.  I am putting something together for Tom this morning, and will give you and Beth a copy today for your input.

I understand from Greg that he got a little more direction from Paul about the Calpine meeting that has been moved to Thursday morning.  Please send Beth Perlman and me a copy of the revised draft of the meeting document that you are preparing, in addition to Tom.  Thanks.
