Dear 1977 UT Graduate:

Come celebrate the Class of 1977 25-Year Reunion on Saturday, March 2,
2002.  It is going to be a fun-filled day of reminiscing with friends
and reacquainting yourself with the UT campus.  The day will start at
the Alumni Center for a university-wide kickoff, including a welcome
from President Larry Faulkner and a continental breakfast.  The reunion
is being held in conjunction with "the Biggest Open House in Texas",
Explore UT!
http://www.utexas.edu/events/exploreut
which will be open from 11 am - 5 pm on Saturday.

In addition to Explore UT, the schools and colleges (with a few exceptions)
are holding events especially for their 1977 graduates on the afternoon
and/or evening of March 2.  After these receptions, you might want to head
back
to the Alumni Center for the March 2 Casino Party, sponsored by the Texas
Exes
Austin Chapter, who are offering a special 25 Year Reunion price!
