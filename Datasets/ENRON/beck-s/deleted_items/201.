Just fyi, the HoustonStreet agreement has been terminated.  Looks like we are making progress with Truequote and we could go live as soon as Monday.  We will work with the respective members of your teams to test transactions from the exchange (once we have transactions to test).  I will keep you posted on the status.

Today we will be performing stress testing on the Truequote interfaces which if successful will clear them for a three day functional test and potentially a May 21, 2001 go live date.

5/15 Stress testing and acceptance
5/16 - 5/18 Truequote quiet period (no software of hardware changes); Funtionality/stress testing and acceptance
5/16 - 5/17 Truequote replicates test code to Truequote production environment
