Did the numbers that we gave you yesterday on Operations hold up after your meeting with UBS?

Amy Fitzpatrick is calling me to get names.  Our primary focus yesterday was on number of positions.  We identified names in most cases, but not all.  Before that is finalized and I pass names along to Amy, I wanted to know if we were okay with the numbers.   Please let me know.  Names can be finalized this afternoonis we are set on numbers.
