All,

Earlier today, an individual at Enron was contacted by someone claiming to be Jackie Buckhold (HR) from Dynegy.  The caller was requesting a copy of an organisational chart.  Evidence now seems to point in the direction that the caller was not Jackie Buckhold at all, but a recruitment consultant.

Please be aware that we should be exceptionally careful when providing information externally to maintain the confidentiality of Enron.  This is a common tactic of recruitment agencies, please emphasise to your staff that all external requests for internal information should be passed through yourselves or HR.

thanks and regards,

Lucy
