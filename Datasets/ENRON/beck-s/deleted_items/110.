Hiya,

Why don't you let me take care of the flowers--I'll call Tarrytown Florist
and pick up the flowers for the 2nd.  I'll also do flowers for the tables.
Can you forward me the email from mom?

Do you have an idea of what you want in the announcement--I'll take care of
that as well.

Am still curious about that statistic regarding siblings of MS people.  I
know that the agent that causes MS is found in people moving to the
NorthEast (or other industrial North sections)--but if you are born there or
move there as an infant, you are generally immune.  Also, if you move there
past a certain age--like 12, you are also not at risk.  Think that is
particularly interesting since our move to CT proves that out--Cara was too
young and you were too old to be at risk....will still ask again next time I
see the neurologist.  It's amazing how you learn to cope--I sort of forget I
have MS most of the time.

I think Geoffrey wants to take you to dinner...he's thinking of flying
down..

Cindy
