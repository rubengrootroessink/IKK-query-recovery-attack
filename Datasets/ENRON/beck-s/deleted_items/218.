Thank you so much for joining us at the Enron table at the Girls, Inc. luncheon tomorrow!   It takes place at the George R. Brown Convention Center (Grand Ballroom - 3rd floor) at 12 noon.  The honoree is Dr. Judith Craven and the keynote speaker is Lyn St. James, the first solo woman driver to win a pro road race.   

The people sitting at or table are:  Sally Beck, Michelle Cash, Elyse Kalmans, Janet Moore, Carrin Patman, Marian Ragland, Myrna Salina, Cynthia Ventura and me!   
  
If you have any questions, please contact me directly.  Since so many of us from Enron are going, the shuttle will pick us up at 11:30 in front of the Enron building.
I'm looking forward to seeing all of you there!  

Thanks,
Misha
