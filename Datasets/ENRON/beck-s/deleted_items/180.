Tammy, 

Attached is a spreadsheet with a list of the employees left to be moved to the 5th floor?

 
Please let me know if there is anything further I can provide you.

Heather, 
Attached are the seating assignments for the 6th floor of the new building provided to me by Ina Rangel.  Will you kindly review the list and compare to the names you provided so we can develop a list for Sally of who will need to be seated on the 5th floor?

Thanks,
Tammy
