Sally,

Let me know if next Wednesday (May 23rd) looks good for lunch at Irma's. If
so, I can just plan on picking you up in front of your building around 11:15
if we need to be there by 11:30 or whenever Patti makes the reservation for.
Feel free to ask Jody if you would like for him to join us too. If Wednesday
is busy, then Thursday would be fine also. Just let me know and I will plan
my schedule accordingly.

I will be in the office tomorrow (Wed) then will be out till next Tuesday.
David is going to e-mail me directions to Champions. That ought to be fun
and the weather should be better than our originally planned outing this
past January.

Look forward to seeing you next week.
