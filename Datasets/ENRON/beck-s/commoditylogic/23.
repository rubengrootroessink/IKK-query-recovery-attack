Please make the following changes:
1. Please change the title to read: "CommodityLogic Brings e-Commerce to the 
Back Office"
2. Please spell my last name with one "s", not two.
3. Please note that Sally Beck is co-head of CommodityLogic.
4. Please get approval to publish from Louise Kitchen, ENW CEO.

All the best,

Tom

Tom -- Here is a draft of the internal E-biz article we would like to run 
tomorrow.  To fit the format, I still have a few words to shake out but hoped 
you might be able to approve the accuracy and spirit of the message.

Thanks

Vance Meyer
