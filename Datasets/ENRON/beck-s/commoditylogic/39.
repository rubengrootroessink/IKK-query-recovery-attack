Dan and Tom,
As we discussed, I am aggressively seeking well qualified top talent 
permanent and contract personnel for both Commodity Logic and Deal Bench.  We 
have specified our requirement for specialized technical experience 
(WebLogic, Java, JSP, HTML) and we are receiving many promising resumes in 
response.  We talked with Andersen Consulting, PriceWarterhouse, Enform, 
Valtech, Common Vision, Delinea, etc. and we made it clear that we want them 
to augment our permanent staff rather than doing a turn-key operation to 
which they have all agreed.

Attached are some of the preliminary resumes and fee schedules from EnFORM, 
we expect many others to be in approximately same range of rates.  If you 
have any questions, please let me know.
      Thanks,
      Inja

Inja and John,
Again, it was a pleasure meeting with you yesterday.  As promised, I am
sending the resumes of candidate architects and developers along with a
short proposal for your review.   I also included the resumes of a few very
capable Junior Developers in case you see a need for additional horsepower
at a very low rate.   If possible, I would like to stop by for a short 10-15
minute meeting with you on Monday so I can deliver a hard copy and then walk
you through our proposal.

As you can imagine, we are very interested in working with Enron so we have
given you the selection of our best folks and we have priced these
individuals very aggressively.  I look forward to working with you in the
near future.

Regards,

Dan Martin
