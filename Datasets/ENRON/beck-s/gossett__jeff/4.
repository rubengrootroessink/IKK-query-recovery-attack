Sally -

The IT group has developed a strategic plan for a single point of entry for 
non-structured type deals.  (the less complex deals)  Dana Docherty called 
yesterday to inform me that they have some resource issues and it may take 
longer than they originally thought.  (One Month)  She also informed me that 
Dave Nommenson would be responsible for the decisions on how quickly this 
gets done.  I have left Dave a voicemail to stress the importance of this 
issue in light of where gas is trading today.  Would you also mind letting 
him know?  I think that this might allow him to better set his priorities.  

Thanks for your help.

Jeff
