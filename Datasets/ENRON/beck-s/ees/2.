Sally,
Thought this might be something you could offer to help the gas desk with.  They currently handle all the logistics for gas and power.   

Call me if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda

Due to the severe shortage of pipeline and LDC scheduling personnel and the current hiring freeze, we are incurring 
unknown imbalance penalties and we are not able to make deliveries of gas.  In an effort to give remaining personnel 
a chance to catch up with deliveries and imbalances I am shutting down all pricing curves for the WEST GAS DESK 
including city gates in the following states:  CA, CO, NM, NV, AZ, NE, TX, WA, UT, and OR until further notice.  

Please do not transact any new deals until we have fully staffed our scheduling desk for the West.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.  Please pass this on to anyone you believe would need to know this 
information.
