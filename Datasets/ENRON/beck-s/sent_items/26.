You have mentioned several times that we would talk about the organization to support wholesale, but the opportuntity to do so hasn't materialized.  We have had meetings about specific issues, but have not generally discussed how we will manage the Estate going forward.  What role do you envision that I will play?  Can you make time to discuss that on Monday?

 I have talked with Delainey about providing infrastructure for NewCo, and had independently come to the conclusion that we must manage mid and back office for all estate activities (liquidating activities and building activities) in one group to provide the best coverage and flexibility for resources.   With the still anticipated spin-off of Netco, I have created a plan to reorganize the operations teams' efforts.  I will be glad to share that with you as we work jointly on the infrastructure to service all estate needs.  --Sally
