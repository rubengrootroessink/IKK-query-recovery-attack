A quick summary on where ENW is relative to NetCo and the Estate.
=20
Some quick numbers first (all numbers are exclusive of the pipelines and St=
eve Hotte's group). =20
=20
We will have about 117 employees remaining in the estate on the application=
 side (Perlman) after about 100 go with NetCo.  We will have 121 employees =
remaining with the estate on the infrastructure side (Rub for now) after 60=
 go with NetCo.  We will have 9 on estate EOL IT (that will end up with the=
 estate application group) after 40 go with NetCo.  We will have about 48 f=
rom EA operations (Hall) remaining with the estate after about 170 go with =
the NetCo.  We will have a few EOL operations people after about 40 go with=
 NetCo.  We also have individuals remaining on the operations side for EGM =
and EIM under Kevin Sweeney.  We also have estate employees under Dayao wit=
h EES IT who have gas and power skills as well as EES operations people und=
er Beth Apollo.  These numbers are all fluid and are not final as the NetCo=
 deal and the people associated with it ebb and flow.  Currently, the estim=
ate for ENW employees going to NetCo from all IT, operations and EOL operat=
ions is approximately 410.  Remaining in the estate to support non-pipeline=
 IT and operations is approximately 453.
=20
As we discussed this morning, we are trying to determine if the approximate=
ly 453 remaining ENW employees are the right number of people for the estat=
e (EA, EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, Corp, etc.) for IT and operations as well as if =
they are the right people period.  We have draft org charts for estate infr=
astructure and estate application and are doing a skill set review of the e=
mployees in IT who are slated to stay with the estate but until NetCo is a =
done deal and the estate wholesale unit finalizes business plans, most of t=
he IT estate people will be a pool of resources supporting both efforts.  A=
lso, everyone in ENW knows which list they are on.
=20
Also, we have spent money on additional hardware and a particular Unify lic=
ense now (did it through Bowen and Weil as ordinary course) so that effecti=
ve duplication of all wholesale applications can be completed hopefully by =
the end of January.  Therefore, the plan is to split ENW people out the day=
 a NetCo deal gets done, split ownership of hardware the day a NetCo deal g=
ets signed, agree that NetCo owns all the IP with all the Enron developed a=
pplications and they get a complete copy and the estate has a free license =
back in perpetuity and gets a copy of the same set of applications the day =
a deal gets done. We will get that duplication of all those applications do=
ne by the end of January (target date anyway). We will also begin a 6 month=
 services agreement the day a deal gets signed.  Even though we will do the=
 above, NetCo will still have their hardware and their applications sitting=
 on that hardware initially in estate data centers (34 ECN, 9 ECS and Ardmo=
re) and NetCo will also be on the estate network.  Hopefully NetCo will tra=
nsition off those in that 6 months, hence the need for the services agreeme=
nt.
=20
We also submitted a 2002 cash budget to Corp. based on our estimate of rema=
ining headcount, licenses, etc. but until we see what it is we are supporti=
ng, it is a placeholder.
=20
Your thoughts on this?
=20
Continue to include Sally in all your meetings if possible so she can coord=
inate the right support across your complete wholesale efforts going forwar=
d.
=20
Thanks.
