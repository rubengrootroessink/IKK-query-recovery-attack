What is it that Oxley is looking for in the ENW PRC report that you mentioned?

FYI below.

You mentioned today in the PRC meeting some numbers on VPs across Enron Corp.  I was surprised at the total number of VPs in the company that were not commercial.

ENW has 14 VPs, 1 MD and 3 in the OTC for a total of 18 employees in ENW at or above VP across commercial, commercial support, specialized technical and technical.

Of the 14 VPs, 5 are specialized technical, 2 are commercial and 7 are commercial support.

Although I have a large number of employees to look at in the coming months for both budget and PRC, I do not have very many at senior levels.

We will have an ENW PRC report as per your request from the meeting today by next Wednesday.

GP
