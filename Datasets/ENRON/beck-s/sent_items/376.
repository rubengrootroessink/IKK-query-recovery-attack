Please check to see which reports will be reviewed in this meeting.  I have forwarded a few to you today to have printed in color.  If there are some reports to be reviewed that we don't have, can you get copies of those for me?  I want to take a look at them before the Oct. 10th meeting.  Thanks.  --Sally
