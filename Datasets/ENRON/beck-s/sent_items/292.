In case you missed this, just wanted you to see that this Enron Net Works publication that to date has focused only on the IT organization has now been broadened in scope.  The hot link to the site should work, and if you click on Features and then Energy Operations you will see the article referred to below.  The editor has spoken to a couple of you also.  Her plan is to get with each one of you and to run a series of articles about Operations.  --Sally
