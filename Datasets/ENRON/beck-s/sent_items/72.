Thanks for your call a few weeks back.  Has been totally crazy here, with incredibly long hours over the last 6 to 8 weeks.  Today is my last day in the office until Monday, December 31.   I need the break!  Has been hard to squeeze in time to get ready for Christmas.  And we are hosting Tyler's 4th birthday party on Friday this week.  Christmas at home, as usual, and the Meagan and I will be off to New York the morning of December 26th with her friend Nicole and her mom.  We thought it would be a fun trip with our seniors!  Shopping, eating and seeing plays - will be back on the night of the 28th.  

Our upcoming trips are to Orlando for four days in early March with the high school drill team for nationals competition. Then spring break in mid-March in Telluride for our first family ski trip!  Hopefully we will all come back in one piece!

Have a wonderful Christmas and enjoy the sun in San Diego.  Christmas cards are coming - you may just receive yours after Christmas.  Mo is in town and will join us for dinner tomorrow night. Grapevine has it that she is skinny as a rail!  

College update:  Meagan got her applications in to UT, OU, SMU and TCU before November 1.  She has acceptance letters from OU and SMU in hand, and is waiting to hear from UT and TCU.  I have no idea what her decision will be!  

Our best to Paul and the girls.  --Sally

Howdy,

Seems like our companies have been getting more than their fair share of
business magazine covers lately -- BW had Enron last week and HP this week
-- it is interesting for me to feel so closely tied to some of the biggest
stories in the business community right now -- I'm thinking that you would
choose a word other than interesting!

This has been a fun holiday season for us -- I took Rebecca to the Festival
of Trees -- a fancy tree decorating fund raiser and The Nutcracker Ballet --
it was very nice for Boise.  Tomorrow is her school program and tomorrow
night I am taking her to the Botanical Gardens, which are decorated in
lights this time of year.  But her main goal is getting to Christmas day and
opening presents -- she drives me nuts asking to open presents 55 times a
day :-)  On the 26th we are heading to San Diego for 4 days in the sun -- hp
is pretty much shut down from Dec 24 - Jan 1 opening Jan 2nd.

Are your winter plans taking you to Salt Lake for the Olympics?  Paul and I
will be there Feb 12 -15 -- I have tickets to the men's short and long
figure skating event.  As you can imagine,  I am VERY excited.  Not too much
else planned for the winter -- if you and your family want to sneak away for
a winter ski trip, think about Sun Valley.  I'd love to set something up for
us all.....except Katherine....she just starting walking...not quite ready
for skis!

Take Care,
Stephanie
