Subject:	Background Statistics for Discussion by the Inclusiveness Committee

I attach an Excel file with some statistics on minority owned businesses in
Harris County.  A few interesting facts that we can conclude from the
charts are:

   Minorities represent 57% of Harris County population.
   Minorities own 23% of the businesses which have employees (i.e.,
   ignoring one-person businesses).
   Minority firms on average each have 40% as many employees firms of all
   ownerships in Harris County.
   Minority owned businesses generate 5% of all the sales of Harris County
   based firms.
   Revenue per employee is about half as great in minority owned businesses
   as in all businesses and compensation per employee (at around $18,700
   each) is about 60% as great at minority firms as at all firms.

Something that is not disclosed in the numbers but which would be
interesting to know is how much higher a fraction of company employees are
minorities in minority owned businesses.  Does anyone have any information
on that subject?

A couple of other interesting points that I have come across include:

   Texas is second among the states in the fraction of firms that are
   minority owned (California is first).
   Harris County is third among all counties in the U.S. in the fraction
   that its minority owned firms compose of  all statewide minority owned
   firms.

We can discuss the implications of all this information when we are
together again next week.
