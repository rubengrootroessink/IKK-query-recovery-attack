Thanks for the note and your words of encouragement.  It is exciting to work on something that helps build a strong franchise for Enron.  I appreciate the opportunity of being a part of that.  --Sally

Guys,

Just wanted to send you a note of congratulations, given Q3 EES results  - you are and will continue to be a key and integral component to the success and growth of EES. 

I know there is a lot of heavy lifting and difficult decisions but I do believe we are starting to put a dent in the issues.  At the same time, we are developing a significant franchise of which Enron can be proud.  

Thank you
Dave
