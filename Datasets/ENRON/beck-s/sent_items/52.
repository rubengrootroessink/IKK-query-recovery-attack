Subject:	Canceling Post Petition Meeting


The Post Petition Meeting which took place every Tuesday and Thursday at 9:00 am is being cancelled.  We are currently organizing an Enron Wholesale Meeting and will communicate once finalized.  Issues that were addressed at the post petition meeting will be handled at either the Management Committee Meeting or the new Wholesale Meeting.

Thank you.
