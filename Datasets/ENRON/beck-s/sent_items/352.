I have an ENW budget review meeting with EGM (McConnell and Shankman) set for 1:30 to 2:30 on October 15th. My intent had been to join Rick's meeting at the halfway point at 2:30 under the original schedule.  With the time change of Rick's meeting to a 1:30 start, I will now miss his meeting.  Please let him know that I will be in the budget review meeting with EGM during that time period.  Thanks.  --Sally
