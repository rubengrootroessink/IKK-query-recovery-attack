Do you have a few minutes to get with me this week?  You seem to be the "in charge" person for the Estate.  I wanted to visit with you about the needs that you see for the Estate and the role that I might play.  I am focused currently on aiding in the due diligence work around the formation of Netco (from an operations perspective), although I am not on the list to go with Netco.  I am also working with Jim Fallon on supporting the business plans for the remaining wholesale  businesses within Enron.  Greg PIper and I also still share the OOC responsibilities for Enron Net Works as well. 

I am committed to Enron, but would appreciate a frank discussion about the timeline you see for me at Enron.  I need to have a job, and want to be appropriately prepared if the timeframe for me at Enron is limited.  Thanks.  --Sally
