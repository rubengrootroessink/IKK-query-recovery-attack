Attached are the latest communication materials.  We DO NOT have a deal yet, but I am sending these so that you have time to review before holding floor/staff meetings in the event we have an announcement later today.  Please do not forward these materials, as they are not yet final.  If there are any changes in these materials when the deal becomes final, I will resend them.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
