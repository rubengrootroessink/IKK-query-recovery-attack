Here is Rick's response - sounds more like a concern on his part on losing people and some of their reasons cited for leaving.  Do you know who has left?

Sally- got your voice mail as well. Don't want to create more meetings. Just had a total of three market risk people quit or transfer and each one said one of the considerations was they spent so much time on operational issues that they weren't developing as they should analyzing portfolio risk. I think it might be best if we have a meeting or two and see what issues are identified. It may be better to split in two meetings as you suggested. I need to hear what the nature of the problems are. Some I know like ees, metals, uk power but I think there may be some other fundamental issues that are hindering progress here. No need for you to attend. I will let you know what we come up with including if there are no issues at all! Rick

Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea.  I would like to visit with you to understand what you mean by "operational issues".  My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that vary with need.  A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum.   --Sally

I think the daily IT issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing problems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues. I would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operational issues as well. 

I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday. Can the RAC people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues.

Thanks, Rick
