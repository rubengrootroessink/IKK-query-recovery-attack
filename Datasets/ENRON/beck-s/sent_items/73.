James will be a real sport to fly with us and then turn around!!  Maybe he would like to do some Christmas shopping!!  That is a great fare - thanks for including us as buddies!..

My hair cut appointment is on Saturday morning, the 29th, so the timing on our return on Friday the 28th is very flexible for me.  Whatever flight you think would be best for us to return on will be fine.  

I am getting the phone number for the hotel and will forward that to you.  I will also get Meagan to coordinate with Nicole on their choices on Broadway plays and then I will get tickets for us.  --Sally

Sally,
I was able to list on the following flights.  James did the calculation for
the cost.  It will be $125.00 per ticket.  It is calculated with a $50.00
service charge + the tax on the highest coach ticket to New York, which I
believe was $1200.00 or so.  We listed James because if he travels up there
with us we can get a higher priority than traveling alone.  He probably will
just turnaround and return to Houston.

These flights seem to have the greatest possibility of getting a seat.  A
positive regarding the early arrival into New York is perhaps to catch some
after Christmas sales!!!.  The arrival is into Newark while the returning is
out of LaGuardia.  We can always change the times and/or airport, if we
check the flights the night before.  But I did remember that you had a salon
appointment on the 28th.  This would get us back rather early --8:40am.

Let me know if this works for you guys!!
