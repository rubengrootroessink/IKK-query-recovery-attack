Exciting news on the house, but I know that you must be busy!  When we moved to Champion Forest, we did the same thing.  Called the real estate agent to list our house on a Monday, got a contract on our house on Tuesday, and put a contract on our new house on Wednesday that week.  You and your husband must be into quick decision making as well!!  

Yes, life at Enron is interesting these days.  Kind of like a soap opera.  Difficult for everyone to stay focused.  We are ready for some good news here. 

With your move, let me know how I can help more with this December newsletter.  It is on my list for the weekend to recreate Lori Ewalt's article as a word attachment and get that to you.   I am glad that you have the permission slip in hand.  --Sally

Sally - Yes, I have the permission slip for December's newsletter.  Wow!  Is it really time to think about next month's?  We are closing on our house 11/26 (this all happened very quickly - a house in our neighborhood went on the market and we looked at it and bought it, listed ours & have a contract on it, too - in all of 3 weeks!) so things are nuts around here!!  I will be very disciplined and try to have the December newsletter ready so it can go to Sally Walker before Thanksgiving.  We didn't plan this closing date very well, did we?!  Thanks for the kind words, and your speedy transmission of articles!  Robin
