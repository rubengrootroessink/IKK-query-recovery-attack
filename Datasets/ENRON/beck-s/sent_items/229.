Here is agenda for Causey's offsite next week.  I told Sharron that you would be in town and she said that you (and Anna) would certainly be welcome for all or part of the day.  FYI - the location for this meeting is at the Adams Mark Hotel.  This is not very close to downtown - would require a car or cab.  I would be glad to have you ride with me -- just let me know which things you would like to attend.  My thoughts are that I will not attend for the entire day - through lunch looks like a good point at which to break and head back to the office.  Let me know what you want to do so that we can schedule meetings around your choices for Wednesday.  --Sally
