FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 24 hours a day.  We often get notices like the one sent on March 29 below without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact.  Bob Superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for us in gas scheduling.  This is a good team that knows how to react quickly.  --Sally

Sally, Bob - FYI 

I was able to get 5 telephone numbers set up on a temporary switch so if our counterparties call into the Enron building during the outage (Friday 10:00 PM until Saturday 6 AM) they will get the voicemail of the 5 key schedulers that we selected. The voicemail gives the caller contact info. (page & home #'s). In addition if they hit zero it will be forwarded to our off-hours dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information for every pipe we do business on.  The schedulers were also instructed to call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and cell #'s.

If I had my way all of our schedulers telephone numbers would have been put on this temporary switch but five was the best we could do. Considering the time period I think we have minimal exposure however you never know when a pipeline of market emergency could occur. 

Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob
