I am following up with someone that was on Mary's team that now works for Beth Apollo.  We will get back with you on this shortly.  --Sally

Sally,
I gather that Mary has taken extended leave.
Can you advise who might know anything about this system?

Thanks,
Richard

Mary,
Are you around - your voicemail message has said you were out for the day, for weeks.
We have a need for a CRM system, but not a very complicated one, and I thought that the one that Tony Mends demonstrated a couple of years ago might fit the bill. He tells me that it is in your area of responsibilities!

Thanks,
Richard
