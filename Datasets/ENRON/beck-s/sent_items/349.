Absolutely, we would enjoy having Angela Dorsey join us for dinner.  I am glad that you made the suggestion.  Please extend the invitation to her now so that she can reserve the date on her calendar, and if you will send me her e-mail address we will send her an invitation as well.  

Thanks for the congratulations.  Yes, the title is an new one - announced just a few weeks ago.  

I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday evening.  --Sally

As I have in previous years, I look forward to joining you, your colleagues
and mine at the reception and dinner.

Subject to understandable space constraints, may I be so bold as to suggest
you consider inviting my Center for Energy Finance Assistant Director
Angela Dorsey, who has been closely involved with all UT energy finance
activities?

I take this opportunity to congratulate you on what I believe is, at least
to me, your new title.

Best Regards,
Ehud Ronn
