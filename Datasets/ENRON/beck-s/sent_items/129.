In a meeting with Louise Kitchen today, she mentioned that Bob Superty was very impressive in a presentation that he made to the Peoples Energy Board of Directors on Wednesday.  She was very complimentary.  I have let Bob know about Louise's praise.  Thought that you would like to know as well.  --Sally
