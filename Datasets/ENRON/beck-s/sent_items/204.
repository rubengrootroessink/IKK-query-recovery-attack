Tom/Sally,
The Financial and Power Confirmation team performed testing this morning as well as this afternoon on the ConfirmLogic module.  Testing went extremely well in both cases.  We feel very comfortable with the functionality and display of information contained within the module.  All of our major issues have been resolved.  Therefore, I am comfortable giving my approval that ConfirmLogic is ready for release to the Beta Customers for testing.  Below is a comprehensive list of the current business parameters as well as the business issues to be discussed and resolved during Beta testing.

Dear Kim:

The CommodityLogic team presents ConfirmLogic to Enron for the beta program, which Enron will be a key participant. The following are the current parameters for how the system will perform during this program.

Negative Confirmation
?If deal status is 'Pending' and current date is 3 business days past the post date; ConfirmLogic changes deal status from 'Pending' to 'Confirmed'. 


Updating Existing Deals
?No restrictions on updates - counterparties can send deal changes at any time for any deal.

	
Viewing Confirmed Deals
?ConfirmLogic allows view-only capability to deals that have been confirmed (user cannot post inquiry or add deal number).

Deal Types Offered
?ConfirmLogic will be offering the following deal types:  
Financial Natural Gas: Swaps, Gas Daily Swap, Options, Gas Daily Options Swaptions
Financial Power: Swaps, Options, Swaptions
Physical Power: Forwards, Index Forwards, Options, Swaption 

During the beta program the following open issues related to the system functionality will be discussed with our beta clients in order to establish an industry standard.  The goal will be to modify the system with the final business rules for the commercial release.  Enron will participate in the discussion and decision making process during the program.

Negative Confirmation
?Mirror industry standard and apply same rule for all deal types.
	
Expiration of Inquired Deals
?Expire inquired deals when no actions have been taken for a defined period of time.


Updating Existing Deals  
?Allow updates and develop method for defining intent of information published to CommodityLogic.

?Assumed agreement for terms not presented in ConfirmLogic in place between counterparties before committing to use module.





Regards, 
Kathryn Cordes, ModuleManager ConfirmLogic
