Got your note.  I am not incredibly attached to Commercial Support and I agree that overall it probably sounds second class.   Professional Services sounds fine to me.  I have forwarded your message to a handful of my direct reports to get their comments - Bob Hall, Brent Price, Beth Apollo and Peggy Hedstrom.  I should hear back from them today, and I will pass along any pertinent comments.  Thanks.  --Sally

Subject:	Proposal to Change "Commercial Support" peer group label to "Professional Services"

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

David
