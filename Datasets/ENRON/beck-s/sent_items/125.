Is this going to be a shower?  If so, I would like to get my own gift for t=
hem, if that is okay.  Or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute =
to the gift basket?  What time on the 20th - I'd like to put that on my cal=
endar.  Does Louise know if it is a boy or girl?  Thanks.  --Sally=20
