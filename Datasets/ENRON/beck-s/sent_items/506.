In case you have your blackberry with you while in line with the masses, just learned from Brent Price (via Mike McConnell) that there is a daily meeting led by JIm Fallon with CEO's at 11:00 that reviews cash usage within the businesses and where a list, although not final, is being reviewed relative to lines of business and locations (i.e. Tokyo, Singapore, etc.) that may be exited.  It is key for ENW to anticipate these changes and seems that we could add something to the discussions from time to time.  Did you know about this meeting?  Seems like you should be there.  Can you nose in with Jim?  --Sally
