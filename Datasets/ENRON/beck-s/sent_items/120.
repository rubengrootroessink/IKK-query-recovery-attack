I am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at Champions Golf Club on Saturday, May 5 for my operations team and their spouses.  Greg and I talked about this today.  He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.  If he and his wife are available, I will let you know details as it gets closer.  Thanks for your help.  --Sally
