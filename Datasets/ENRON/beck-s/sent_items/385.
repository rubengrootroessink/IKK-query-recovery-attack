Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk. =
 We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involve=
d in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objecti=
ves.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.=
  Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's =
businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the "wholesale businesses", or =
is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide? =20

I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list t=
o have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complemen=
ting, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's =
internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being pilot=
ed in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA aud=
its, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the vario=
us operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other =
Thursday with you and Rick Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate =
representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cove=
r this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. =20

I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilit=
ies at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quan=
tifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the impl=
ementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit=
 levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implement=
ation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-deve=
loped operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business uni=
t/functional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be form=
ed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but m=
ay not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiat=
ives. =20

Finally, the second bullet point in Wanda's list below is already being add=
ressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure t=
hat information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate a=
nd efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spa=
nning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a =
steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closel=
y with Debbie Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, res=
ource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of =
stakeholders from Operations, IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in =
order to review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for fina=
l input.  My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for D=
ebbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed pla=
n and timeline.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight=
 when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate=
 to take this item off of the Wanda's list.  We can certainly update the cr=
oss-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new tea=
m to focus on this bullet point. =20

Subject:=09Operational Risk Management


As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addres=
ses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop system=
s and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk. =
 To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the=
 "Operational Risk Committee"), which will be jointly accountable for meeti=
ng this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assuran=
ce Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderso=
n. =20

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk i=
s to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) impr=
ove the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelin=
es for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be=
 our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate expos=
ure to operational risk.  =20

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operation=
al risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of=
 the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial go=
al, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/o=
r report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's object=
ive, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistica=
tion of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitati=
ve assessments and quantitative measurements. =20

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional tea=
m has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
=09
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  =
This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards t=
o identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management w=
ith a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmati=
on that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, =
CreditAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the abil=
ity to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spread=
sheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop "rules of use" for financial valuatio=
n models and spreadsheet "books"
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor interc=
ompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and repo=
rt variances=20
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operationa=
l risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team. =20

Thanks,

Rick Buy
