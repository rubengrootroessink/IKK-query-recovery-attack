Where are we on decisions on promotions?  Last time I asked, it was under consideration.  Kevin has a good idea here.  Can you give us an update?  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,

Someone brought up an interesting idea that might help motivate people and retain them.  Recognizing that we are constrained from a cash perspective, does it make any sense to still promote some people who deserve it so that at least they get recognition in terms of title and recognition by their peers, however have their salary remain the same?

Just a thought.

Kevin
