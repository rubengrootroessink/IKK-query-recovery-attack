EIM's budget meeting with Lay/Whalley/Frevert has been moved from Wednesday, October 24 to Monday, November 5.  Kerry Roper sent you an e-mail message today with revised dates for budget reviews.  

McMahon is out of town today, and Ray Bowen's preference is to push the review of our revised ENW budget for EIM back to Wednesday (tomorrow).  I am coordinating with Kent Castleman on this meeting with Ray and will give you an update tomorrow after the meeting with Ray.  Kent believes that our current allocations are now acceptable to EIM.  They will okay the current EOL allocation, but are also very interested in the revised allocation methodology.  

Brent has had to unexpectedly drive to Austin this afternoon to lecture to a class at UT - a Rick Causey commitment that Rick asked Brent to fill today.  When Brent is back tomorrow we will regroup on the EGM budget with the intent of sign-off from Mike and Jeff by end of day tomorrow or Thursday.  

Whalley budget update - I reviewed this with Kerry today.  I suggested that on the Whalley recap sheet that we footnote that numbers were as of 10/22/01, and represented final agreement on EA charges, and revised charges (subject to final sign-off) for EIM.  The footnote should also say final reviews with EES and EGM are expected this week, so ENW charges to those business units are still preliminary.  I also suggested to Kerry that we footnote for Whalley the break-out and total (expense and capital) of budget reductions since our review with Whalley 10 days ago.  --Sally
