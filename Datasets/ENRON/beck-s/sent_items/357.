I am glad that you will be able to join us.  Yes, we are planning on cocktails first and then dinner.  I am waiting for a response back from Dean May to confirm the time - tentatively set for 7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner.  We can probably either officially slip this schedule back by a half hour to 7:30 and 8:00, or unofficially stretch this to work with your schedule.  We would be happy to have your husband join us as well.  Let me know whether to expect one or both of you. --Sally

Hi Sally, nice to hear from you again.  I will certainly be in attendance...I do have a one-time a week class on Tuesday night (from 5-8) so I wanted to see if there was a cocktail half-hour or so planned that I could stretch out my arrival slightly.
Regards, 
Holland
