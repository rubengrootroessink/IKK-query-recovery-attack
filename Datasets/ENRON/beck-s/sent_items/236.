As I am sure you are all aware recruitment of key quality people is paramount to the success of Risk Management. You should also be aware that many of us spend an awful lot of time on recruitment from talking to agencies to interviewing.

We currently have a number of vacancies and have been finding the CVs we have been receiving from recruitment agencies have not produced the pool of talent we need. As a result we have today placed an advertisement in the FT a copy of which is attached below. Of course none of you will of seen the advert because you don't look at the recruitment pages but just in case this is what is happening and why.

If there are any queries please give me a call or better still nominate someone and see if you can get any entry for the Z3.

James
