If I were you, I would talk to Wanda and let her know that Ken is the point person as it relates to currently handling this matter and that we will trust that she will keep him fully informed and involved.  We are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with Ken.  Let me know if you would like me to underscore this with Wanda, and I will be glad to.  Might be a good idea to send a note to Dave, Janet and Dan stating that legal has named Wanda as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and execution that Ken must be fully involved - and that you have asked Wanda to make that part of her responsibility.  Copy Wanda on the note.  --Sally

I will talk to ken and make sure that he keeps Murray and I in the loop.

Are you OK with Wanda's involvement.

We just need to make sure we keep an eye on her
