I remember you well, Christine, from the recruiting process.  I would love to visit with you to catch up on what you have done at Enron to date and to talk with you about a rotation in my group.  By copy of this memo, I will ask my assistant to set up a time for us to get together.  I look forward to seeing you.  --Sally

Sally,

My name is Christine Milliner, and I'm currently an analyst under Rod Hayslett in ETS finance and accounting.  I was also one of your recruits from UT in the fall '99 semester.  I have spoken with Ted Bland about options for my next rotation, and he mentioned your area as a possible fit.  I'd like to meet with you to discuss opportunities in your area and the contibution I could make to your group.  My resume is attached, for your review.  I appreciate your time and consideration.

Thank you,
Christine Milliner
