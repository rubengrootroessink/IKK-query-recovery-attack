Jennifer,

Can you get with Shirley and Vlady and get this meeting scheduled for next week.

Vlady,  I am going to be in the Woodlands in some training Monday and Tuesday so perhaps we can do it later in the week.

Wes and Wade,

Rick Buy and the RAC/EES team have compiled a list of EES projects, the so-called "Points of Light" list. Its objectives are the following:

	- articulate the progress of EES initiatives to the BOD
	- ensure that important activities are not overlooked
	- assign responsibilities to appropriate individuals
	- monitor completion of projects against a set timetable

I suggest that we revise this list to reflect reality better. Also, you could use this list as a management tool to ensure that in six months EES issues are properly addressed.

I could meet with you and walk you through the "Points of Light" list.

Vlady.
