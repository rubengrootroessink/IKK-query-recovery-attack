I have asked Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens to attend.  I don't have confirmation yet on whether or not all three will be able to attend.  I thought that if asked three, that this should work on one of their schedules.  I will let you know later who will attend.  I will be out of the office that day.  --sally
