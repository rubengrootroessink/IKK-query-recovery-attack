Sally, Bob - just a thought about where we currently are and how we help ma=
intain solid leadership for the future. As I looked around the room at your=
 breakfast meeting today it appeared many of the people in important manage=
ment roles were probably at an age where they would like to stay at Enron, =
work hard and hopefully be able to take care of immediate family needs (col=
lege, etc.) and then retire with a enough to enjoy their elder years. Other=
s were probably at an age where career changes are in their plans so it's t=
he quick hits that will make a difference. Maybe the mix was 50/50. Clearly=
 I'm in the former category. Several people at the meeting commented about =
the severe impact the current situation has had on their retirement plans a=
nd how the time left to make this up is a concern. In my relatively short t=
ime here (3 1/4 years) I have made the following observation. Enron has a g=
reat Associate and Analyst program and these employees contribute immediate=
ly to the company. In addition Enron has a very young and mobile workforce =
that provides great flexibility and energy to our efforts. No doubt this ha=
s led to the great success over the years. However at the end of the day th=
e business requires a level of maturity and experience that very effectivel=
y complements this young and very talented workforce. Helps pull things tog=
ether and keep the sanity. In many cases this translates to employees in th=
eir mid to later years of their work life. During the good times no problem=
 as bonus $'s and other vehicles take care of things. However we are possib=
ly in a situation where those are limited or reduced to some extent for som=
e extended period of time. =20

Question: Do we need to do something positive, send a signal, to our middle=
 aged and more senior employees that we understand the importance and value=
 you add to the company and are willing to take a look at our pension/retir=
ement plans. When we come out of this current situation what will the compa=
ny look like? Will most of the younger crowd leave for the "quick hits" els=
ewhere? How do we maintain and protect our more senior employees. How do we=
 keep them here before they take another job that offers them additional se=
curity? Listening to Ken Lay at the employee meeting when asked a question =
about pension I don't believe he really knew what type of retirement progra=
m we have in place. It really is, save all you can in your 401K and then we=
'll give you this cash balance vehicle to subsidize it. I know the cash bal=
ance option is a newer vehicle that many companies are moving to but Enron'=
s is rather weak. Many companies apply a larger percentage than Enron's 5%.=
 Obviously this all has a cost, I know these plans were carefully considere=
d over the years and changing anything at this point is not going to happen=
. In addtition this probably goes against our culture in many respects and =
I'm not saying lets make this a job for life. We still need to manage our w=
orkforce as we have in the past and deal with employees that do not contrib=
ute regardless of age.=20

Just wanted to share some honest thoughts and observations. I get concerned=
 when I look at the makeup of our workforce and think about commitment, loy=
alty and ongoing leadership. I promise this isn't about me although I certa=
inly have my concerns as I know you do also. =20

Thanks for listening - Bob
