Dear Sally,

Thank you for agreeing to review my resume and qualifications for a position
at Enron.  Your company has a fine reputation for innovation and growth.
I will call you Tuesday afternoon concerning any questions we both may have
and to arrange an interview if we deem it is appropriate at that time.
I appreciate you consideration and look forward to meeting you.

Sincerely,
Matt Moses
