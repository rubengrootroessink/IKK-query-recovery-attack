Thanks so much for your note.  It is certainly nice to know that your thoughts are with me.  I, too, enjoyed visiting with you at our Woodlands session.  I was so sorry to miss the second forum, but I certainly feel that I made the right decision to be here.  When some of this is behind us at Enron, I do hope to get reconnected with the on-going efforts resulting from the CHF.  --Sally

Sally,
We missed you at the Center for Houston's Future last weekend.  I know you have a lot going on & just wanted you to know I enjoyed visiting with you at the earlier meeting & am thinking of you.
