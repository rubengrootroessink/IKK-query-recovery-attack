Your list looked good and I approved all as reviewers.  We can talk about how the VP PRC process works - there will be an opportunity there to provide info to various commercial MD's that will be in attendance at the meeting.  We will make sure that we prepare the attendees well.  --Sally

   I put some review customers in the system.  Don't feel all that great about them, (from a commercial feedback standpoint)  Wondered if you feel these are appropriate.  We may not hear from some of these people -- but it is worth a shot.

I am open to any suggesions you have
