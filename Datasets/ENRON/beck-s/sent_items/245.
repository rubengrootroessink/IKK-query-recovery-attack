Patti is sending you my slides for the offsite - I finally got out of meetings long enough to review them!  

There will be four parts to the Mid/Back Office hour and a half on the agenda:

	Global Risk Management Operations - Overview of Services (Beck providing slides)

	IT Systems - Overview and Organization (Perlman providing slides) ) 

	CommodityLogic Modules (Gros providing slides)  

	Commercialization Effort (the three of us are working on a few slides - to come later today)
