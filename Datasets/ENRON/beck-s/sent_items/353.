Sally,

On the presentation, I noticed that the "Commodity" in CommodityLogic didn'=
t show up on the slides because it was a very light lavender.  Do you want =
me to get that fixed before Friday?

I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last =
Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future =
all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work bes=
t for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I h=
ave worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics tea=
m so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Frida=
y.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We ha=
ve two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you =
will enjoy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the di=
scussions and have time for questions and answers. =20
