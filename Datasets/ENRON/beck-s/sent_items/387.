Sally -- just FYI in case it comes up, a counterparty search was done on the potential Terrorist list related to the Asset Freeze that bush ordered

We found one name in the system that matched, and we are currently working on determining if we have actualy transacted with the person.

Will keep you posted if we find out that we have or are doing business with him

Beth,

I have voice mailed John Brindle, Sr. Director, Corp-Public Affairs, who according to Bill Donovan is currently responsible for International Security and the correct Enron Contact on this matter.  

In summary, the CP in question (Mustafa M Ahmad - only a name match we are not certain of an exact match) was set up in GCP as an EES Gas customer as part of the legacy cleanup during August.  A CP with this name is listed in the HP9EESOCA billing system as active.  The record has been suspended in GCP by London and based on our records and research there is no active A/R or MTM exposure.

Expect that upon further instructions from John Brindle, and confirmation of an exact match, we will proceed with Settlements and potentially CSC as appropriate.

Awaiting further instructions from John Brindle.

James

James

In response to the recent order from President Bush to freeze any assets held in the name of a published list of groups and individuals suspected of terrorist activity, we conducted a search of the GCP database to ensure we did not have any established relationship with anyone on the list.

We found no such relationships with Enron Europe.  However, we thought we had better inform you that we did discover one record, created for Houston EES, with the following name which did appear on the list:

Mustafa M Ahmad GCP ID 130061.

The ID has been suspended by my GCP team here.  Please let me know if you need any further information.  

Kind regards

Anna
