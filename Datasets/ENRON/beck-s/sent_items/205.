Please see if you can get this to print so that I get all of the info.  I tried it 100 times on Friday and could only one page to print, which did not include all of the information.  Thanks.  NEED THIS TODAY.

Sally,
The attached file shows the detail of plan headcount for December 31, 1998 through 2001.  The only number that I still have a question about, is for EGM December 2001, the number I have in the file only represents the people moving into Networks from EGM (Brent's group).  I left a message with Tom Myers, to get the correct number.  
I have also added the graphs that we discussed, which show increase in headcount along with increase in deal counts.
If you have any questions, let me know.
Thanks,
Brian
