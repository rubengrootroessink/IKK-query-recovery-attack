I left individual voice mail messages for Chris, Johnny, John, Tom, Keith, Susan and Susie tonight, thanking them for spending part of their Saturday in the office.  I appreciate your personal organization and leadership of the team so that the DPR could be completed Saturday morning and delivered to RAC for their further analysis over the weekend.  Thanks, too, for spending part of your weekend in the office.  Your willingness to pitch in and your constructive suggestions on leading and motivating employees is very much appreciated.
