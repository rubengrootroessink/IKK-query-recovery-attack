Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know in a few days I would appreciate it.
