This is mid-day info from EOL trades today, compared to a full day recap for the same time last month.  We can recap for you at end of day, if you would like.  We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron. We can give you a complete recap at end of day.  

Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions.  If you have not talked with him, I would suggest that you do so.
