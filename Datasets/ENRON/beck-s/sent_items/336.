Ramesh and I combined our pieces to form an explanatory for the items in our worlds. 

The numbers shown here, are the Direct Project costs and do not reflect fully loaded costs.

 
I'll be in early in the morning, if you need to see this differently... I'm assuming its mainly to show how we got to the significant cuts/changes...
