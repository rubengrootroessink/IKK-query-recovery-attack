Pumpkin recipe dip attached.  

Absolutely - I would love for you to continue on the newsletter for next year.  Perhaps you would consider being the official Editor for next year?  That is the job that you are really doing!

Meagan sent her application in to OU today.  It's one of four schools to which she will apply, so nothing definitive yet.  But it is nice to get one out the door!  --Sally 

My assistant is faxing the two pages regarding news from national.

Sally - We can probably use the pumpkin dip recipe; with so many ads we may need 2 pull-out pages (calendar/minutes being one).  Plus, it would be great for everyone to have it for the upcoming holidays.
Faxing or email will be the best way to get info to me today - it's back-to-back dentist appointments, manicures (my indulgence!), tumbling, cheerleading, etc. so I will out more than I'm in.
I really enjoy the newsletter and will be happy to remain in this position for next year (if you'd like me to!).  With my advertising/journalism background - although it's been a lot of years since I've used it very much - this is just my "thing".  And with such rapid changes in technology, it's a challenge to learn new skills!
Have a great day, and I'll look for the additional info - Thanks!  Robin
