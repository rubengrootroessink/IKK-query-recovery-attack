Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I wi=
ll meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to "m=
ass mail" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday after=
noon or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vicke=
rs and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and pow=
er covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation i=
n person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will like=
ly come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presenta=
tion could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sen=
se to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the w=
ord to the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We =
can start those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logi=
stics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really t=
hink that we need one.   =20

Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to de=
liver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from=
 Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him =
on that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and=
 will be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with=
 her that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as=
 the other "out of towner" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the nex=
t time that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April=
 17, 18 or 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with hi=
m perhaps in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west=
 power risk team.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetin=
gs here in Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I ca=
n discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentatio=
ns at lunch tomorrow. =20

I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage=
 and input.  Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?  --Sally=20

Why don't you and Rahil agree on the draft ASAP and then let Rahil send it =
out in draft form this Friday afternoon to all these individuals for their =
review and comments.  Rahil can work with these people directly next week o=
n their comments.  Rahil is free from the day-to-day operations issues and =
has the time to push the product menu to the EA Originators.

We can still set up an offsite to finalize, but we need to get something ou=
t because these individuals are already out selling as we speak.

Shukaly resigned and left.

But I assume the invitation will be extended to all of their groups so that=
 whoever they want can attend.=20

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the=
 groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting =
an offsite together.  How about circulating the presentation and then letti=
ng them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.  One =
on ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.  We n=
eed to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks.

Let's aim to get a least three customers this quarter.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services ar=
e, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue =
sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the=
 DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft=
 by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  W=
e are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can =
catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting wi=
th all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we c=
an set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will sim=
ply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attend=
ees are:

Gas=09=09=09Frank Vickers (East)
=09=09=09Laura Luce (Central)
=09=09=09Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives=09=09Fred LaGrasta

Power=09=09Dave Duran
=09=09=09Ozzie Pagan
=09=09=09Ed Baughman
=09=09=09

Portland=09=09Chris Calger

Calgary=09=09Ladain

Mexico=09=09Max Y.=20

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary g=
uy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL mar=
keting team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunit=
y to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha=
 and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well. =20

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will wo=
rk for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if yo=
u would like.  --Sally =09

Weren't we supposed to be having a meeting on costs of back office services=
 with the Heads of Origination?  Are we close to having this?

Thanks
