Do you want my help in preparing something for Paul?  Would you like me to go with you when you meet with Paul?

Paul,

Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work and responsibility these days.

Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever increasing transaction flow.

In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would like to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team what we mean by "outsourcing" your mid and back office functions to our "ProsessCo/ServiceCo."  I think we have identified what types of services we could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically, you have risk reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation, nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and cash payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it hopefully makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to accomodate your growing business instead of you building it from scratch.  

I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on security/neutrality, comparable service levels to Enron, term and the ability to do financial easier than physical.  We can go through all that as well.

I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

Let me know your thoughts.

Piper


PS  Let's do another dinner with McGowan, etc. soon (or play golf some time or catch some beers).
