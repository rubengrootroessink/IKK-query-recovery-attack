Thanks for the note.  I wish you well as you continue to build your business outside Enron.  Unfortunate circumstances here have caused us to make some tough business decisions that impact contractors such as yourself.  I appreciate your hard work over the last several years and the contributions that you made in helping to manage various businesses within Enron.   

I am saving your e-mail address and phone number.  There may be an occasion for us to work together again. 

Best wishes for you and your family.  -Sally
