I look forward to seeing you again on Thursday morning and to meeting Mr. Mann.  You will need to check in at the front desk in the lobby.  Usually, the process is that they will call to let me know that you are here.  My extention is 35926.  You will get a visitors badge and then you will go to the 33rd floor.  There is a reception area on 33.  I will meet you there.  --Sally Beck

Tom,

Thanks for returning my call. Our CEO Geoffrey Mann is in Austin from New
York and he and I will be meeting with Sally Beck at 9am on Thursday at
Enron. My understanding is that Sally will walk us down to your office after
we finish.

I look forward to discussing how we can assist you with your e-learning
needs on Leadership Training and other content that needs to be technology
enabled.

Please contact me with any questions.
