FYI - You may want to review the process for managing stacks on EOL and be certain that those to whom access is granted is in compliance with the list of authorized traders maintained by RAC.  I don't think that RAC needs to have approval, but we should be cross referencing requests to manage stacks on EOL with the approved trader list.  This may be part of your process.  If not, it probably should be incorporated.  Then you may want to educate the RAC team on your approval process.  Let me know if you need and help or support from me.  

Hope that all is well.  --Sally

Help!

It appears that EOL is being given out to people who have not received authorization to trade.  The latest is someone reporting up through Jean Mrha. (John Grass)  Why doesn't RAC require that anyone requesting authorization to get EOL get approved through RAC.  I'm sure Lavo doesn't know (or maybe he does) that we have yet another unauthorized trader to rein in.

Any suggestions?

Frank
