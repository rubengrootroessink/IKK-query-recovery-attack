I forwarded to you most of the ibuyit stuff still in my e-mail.  Please check all to see if they have been approved.  From this point forward, I don't want to automatically approve anything without my seeing it.  Please scan the rest of my e-mails to see if there is an ibuyit request that I failed to forward to you for you to check.  Please be sure that anything that has already been approved is deleted.  Thanks. 

Please go through my e-mails and print everything from Melissa Becker, put it in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in Galveston) for me.  I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either Rick and/or Melissa.  They have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.  Some of the e-mails from Melissa relate to volunteers for my team.  I think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name.  Can you create a list (with contact numbers) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?  Thanks.  Then please delete all e-mails from Melissa.  

Also, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Center for Houston's Future.  I need to review these.  Most is from Marilyn Schoppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.  Then delete all of these e-mails.  

E-mails from Lexi Elliott regarding recruiting.  Please print all so that I can review them.  Please delete all e-mails after printing.  Thanks.  

This effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remain.  Thanks.  --Sally
