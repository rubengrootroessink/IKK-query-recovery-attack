I am just a little tardy in working my way through e-mails!  I understand that you will be joining Beth Apollo's risk team in EES soon.  A win-win situation for everyone involved, I believe.  Please let me know when you will next be in town - would love to see you.  --Sally

Sally

Hope all is going well in your new role as COO (and they are not working you too hard !)

As you know the European Office is currently undergoing a restructuring with voluntary redundancies etc.

I am currently working in EBS Europe as controller for Mid/Back Office - I have responsibilities for the following functions:-
- Contract Mgt / Documentation
- Risk Mgt
- Settlements
- Trade Accounting & Financial Reporting

This covers basically the whole of the Mid/Back office function.
Now EBS in Europe is not looking in good shape at the moment (with only 3 trades completed last month, and the whole of the Telecoms industry in a bit of a recession - with no indicators asto when this will change), so I think now is the time to start looking at other opportunities that may be available in other Enron business units.

As you may already know I have 9 years experience in Enron (7 yrs PQE since qualifying as a Accountant) gained in Finance, Structuring, new business set-ups (Gas, Continental Power, J-Block, EBS).

I have already spoken to Fernley Dyson & Barry Pearce as to what roles may be available in Enron (they are both getting back to me) and was wondering if you had knowledge of any other roles, given my particular skill-set both here in Europe and the US.

If you can't think of anything it doesn't matter - just though I would drop you a note on the off-chance.
But if you can think of any areas or have the names of people I could contact I would be most grateful

Thanks

Neil
