I have almost completely lost my voice today and am also running a fever.  I have coordinated with Bob Hall this morning and he will attend the 10:00 meeting in ECN 30C1.  He will be able to give a good overview of operations and will be able to coordinate any other information needs they may have.  All that I could do at this point is cough and nod! 
 
I could certainly answer any questions for the Euros via e-mail, if needed, over the weekend.  Call me at home (281-370-8568) and I will be glad to do so.  
 
I do expect to be in the office on Monday - hopefully with a voice.  --Sally
