Today was parent/teacher conference day at Tyler's preschool and I had signed up for the 9:00 am slot.  Sorry that I couldn't make the meeting.  I had asked Bob Hall to attend in my place - I know that he also had an 8:30 am meeting related to retention, so I don't know whether or not he made it to your meeting.  

What is your calendar like for drinks next week?  --Sally
