Per the email below, and for unknown reasons, please be advised that our Gas Operations move to the new building has been delayed
until next Friday, November 16th.  

No information about the delay of the Power Operations Move has been announced.  I will keep you all informed as I receive any updates. 

Thank you,

Please communicate to your groups that the move for tomorrow has been delayed until next week.  At this time I do not know if Power will continue to move on the 16th.  As soon as I know I will let you guys now.

Thanks!
