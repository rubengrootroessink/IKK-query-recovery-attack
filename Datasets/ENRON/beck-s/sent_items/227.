Sally,
This is the communication summary we discussed.  I have detail behind the steps if you have any questions or would like to see more.  

Please note that the "Management Closing Meeting" is referring to the meetings w/you and Wes that Bauer/Sorrells have been conducting in the past.

Thank you.
Mechelle


 
P.S.  Enjoyed lunch today!
