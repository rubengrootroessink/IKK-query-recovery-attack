Could I be included in these update meetings?  Rather than read the material after the fact and have you review it with me separately, it seems that it would make sense for me to be included in the update meeting that you hold with Rick.  Assuming that Rick is comfortable with that, can we do that going forward?  If all agree, please ask your assistant to let me know if a date has already been set for the next update.  Thanks.  .
