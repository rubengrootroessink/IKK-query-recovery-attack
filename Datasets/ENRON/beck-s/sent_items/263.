We may have a few more transfers given the final decision on the management of the settlements function.  We had a lunch meeting with John Lavorato, Dave Delainey, Wes, etc. on Thursday last week, and will have fleshed out a the details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the settlements function under EWS and leave the service management component (Evan Hughes) under EES.  Final decision expected this week.  --Sally

Attached is the final list of employees currently identified to be transferred to EWS and ENW from EES.  These transfers should be made effective July 1, 2001to effect a clean cut-off for accounting purposes.  I am sending these today to give you as much lead time as possible, but please do not make them effective any sooner.

Could each cost center lead please keep up with who is on their list today and, if employees are hired or terminated between now and July 1, 2001, make the appropriate adjustment with your respective HR representative to make sure they are transferred properly.

Rachel M., can you use this data to pull together a Q3 and Q4 plan for each cost center (working with the leads of each area).

Thanks

Wade
