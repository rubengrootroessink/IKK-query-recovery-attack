Is this for all assistants within ENW?  How many are there?  I would certainly be glad to split the cost with Mark and Greg.  --Sally

Sally -

Tina had asked if you want to split three ways for Assistants Christmas gifts this year?

Ladies,

Attached is a spreadsheet showing the cost for each of the Tiffany items you want to see.  Included are the 15% discount, 100 minimum quantity, tax.  It's also assuming that I can negotiate free shipping.  I think we need to stay under $10,000.  Even if we end up splitting it 3 ways, I would be afraid to go much higher.  Given that, I'll ask Leslie with Tiffany to bring everything under $100.
