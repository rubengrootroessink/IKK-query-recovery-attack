Thanks for copying me on Michael Brown's note.  Brenda Herod flew to London last night and should be in the London office today.  I am sure that she will be spending some time with you on this.  She and I visited briefly yesterday about an effective model for support in London for the pulp and paper effort.  So as to not steal her thunder, it will suffice to say that I am comfortable that the two of you can hit upon a good solution and that it will feel much more cooperative than the existing EGM model.  --Sally

Industrial Markets (led by Bruce Garner in Europe and Jeff McMahon worldwide) is expecting significant growth this year.  

Jeff and Bruce expect that by year end, they will have approximately 45 commercial people in Europe and will need significant support for their efforts.

This is a very exciting new business area for us in Europe and we need to ensure that they have sufficient resource dedicated to help them in their efforts.  Could each of you sit down with Bruce and agree the resource which will be dedicated to his group.  As a base proposition, all resources should be sourced out of Europe and each group must have at least one person who is accountable to Bruce for support.  Costs will be re-charged in the normal way.

Please let Jeff and I know what is agreed and call me if there are any difficulties.

Thanks.

Michael
