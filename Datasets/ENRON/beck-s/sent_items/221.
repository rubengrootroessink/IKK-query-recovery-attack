Here are the two for Brent.  Please get copies of resumes from Jana.  Please set up a meeting for later this week with all who will be supervisors of interns.  Include Brent as well.  Thanks.  (thirty minutes will be fine)

Sally,
The only people that will go to Brent's world are M. Yee who will be reporting to Todd Hall and Anne Beylin who will be reporting to Tom Myers.  Sorry about not getting them on the list.  We will work with Sheri through Andy Zipper's world going forward.  Thanks so much and if you need anything else, please let me know.  Thanks.

Your list does not include any interns under Brent Price ( he is one of my direct reports as well).  I understood that he does have some summer interns.  Can you update this list for me to include his interns?  

Also, as of April 1, Sheri Thomas now reports to Andy Zipper in ENW, and not to me.  We included her on the distribution of resumes for summer interships since she originally was part of my team.  From this point forward, however, you should communicate directly with Sheri and Andy Zipper regarding Greg Carlson's internship.  I just want to make sure that nothing falls through the cracks for these interns as we make organizational changes.  .  Thanks.  --Sally
