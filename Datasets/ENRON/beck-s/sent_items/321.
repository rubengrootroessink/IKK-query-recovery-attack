It's about 6:45 pm right now - I need to spend 15 minutes or so on open items on my desk, then I will be headed home.  Commute takes about 35 minutes this time of night.  Try me in the car about 7:15 pm tonight and I can fill you in during my commute.  Feel free to call me at home tonight as well.  Best after 9:30 pm - 281-370-8568.  Other option will be during my commute tomorrow morning.  Try me in the car about 7:15 am.  --Sally
