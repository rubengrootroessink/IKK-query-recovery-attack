I don't recall making this request.  Who did you hear this from?  Maybe tha=
t person could shed light on this for both of us.=20

There was some confusion among the HR groups a couple of weeks ago with the=
 name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes - didn'=
t match the organizational name that is used for your group.  I wonder if t=
hat is where this is coming from?  Norma (whose last name I don't know) who=
 works for Robert Jones in HR was in the midst of the confusion.  The RC na=
me that was used had "IBS" in it and was rather long, but didn't obviously =
seem to relate to your team.  Question was whether or not this RC reported =
in through Operations.  When I asked Norma to read me the names of employee=
s in that RC, it included Kathy Reeves and her team.  I told her that we ha=
d not used the term "IBS" in a while.  Norma asked if the RC name should be=
 consistent with the organizational name of the group.  I said that makes s=
ense and she said she would follow up on that.  But that should have been a=
 name change, not the opening of a new cost center.  See if any of this inf=
o gets us back on the right track.  --Sally=20

I understand that you requested that a separate Cost Center be set up for t=
he Calgary Risk group.  Any special reason?  Do I need to set up separate C=
ost Centers for the rest of my departments? =20
