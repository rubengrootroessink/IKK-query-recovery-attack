Thanks for the update.  I am forwarding your message to Beth Apollo.  She is the VP on my team that manages our Global Services, and this Executive Report Viewer falls in that arena.  She will be closer to this than I.  You may want to get her feedback as well.  --Sally

Sally,

I just want to give you an update on the Executive Report Viewer project in case you are not aware of the status. The development of the ERV project has been completed and delivered on schedule. The feedback from the demo was very positive. The application has been handed over for user acceptance test.

Thanks

Zhiyong
