I think that your Phibro card is from our original meeting in New York, a lifetime or two ago!!  

Sounds as if your rollercoaster experience with Teddy was perhaps a preview of the subsequent weeks at Enron.  Thank goodness for those little guys to go home to every night.  

My little guys aren't so little any more.  Meagan is a senior this year - had all of her college applications submitted by November 1, and feels pretty good just knowing that her part is done.  She has gotten one acceptance - University of Oklahoma.  She also applied to UT, SMU and TCU and is waiting to hear from them.  She may hear from SMU and TCU before Christmas - UT probably after the first of the year.  (By the way, David and I are strongly talking up the state school thing, given the current Enron share price, or diminished portion thereof.)  This senior year is going by all too quickly, especially since the last month or so I seem to be hearing about it second-hand having spent way too many hours in the Enron Building.

And mentioning the building, I moved to Enron Center South (the new building) in mid September.  I'm on the 4th floor - one of the trading floors.  Kinneman is on this floor, too.  Kind of a cool building, but weird because it is not really finished.  Our floor is fine, but you have to walk through a maze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator - and some elevators are "panelled" with rough plywood inside.   The sky ring thing is cool, too, but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continue to finish out the space.  We walk under open ceilings with wires hanging down.  Not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate, but we are here!  

Do let me know if you are going to be in Houston anytime soon.  I would love to get together with you.  Between 9/11 and our current cash constraints,  my previously planned November London visit is not happening!  

Enjoy your Thanksgiving in London.  --Sally

Sally,
I  have been thinking of you and the first time we met at a conference in New York.  Much more innocent times. 

 To answer your question, I went to Euro Disney in october and I am scared of rollercoasters.  However, Teddy being 8 years old, I had to go on them.  I found Space Mountain (roller coaster in the dark) much easier to handle than a similar one where I actually could see the danger that I was putting myself in.
 
While it must be difficult for your people, they could do a lot worse than have you in charge.  Good luck with this situation.  I hope to speak to you soon.
Best to David and family.
Ted

Are we having some fun now?  Thought about you today - in fact, ran across a business card of yours that I had in a file from Phibro Energy.  

I know that I have missed your insight and opinions into Enron's roller-coaster.  Is this ride better with eyes open or closed?  --Sally
