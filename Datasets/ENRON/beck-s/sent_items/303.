Sally - as discussed in the meeting today attached is the consolidated list of cash flows for tomorrow.  This forecast includes all expected activity with the exception of NYMEX broker wires and OTC margins which are not available until approximately 6:30 a.m. tomorrow. Those numbers will be given to Paul Garcia as soon as they are known. I gave a copy of this spreadsheet to Paul and Mary Perkins about 6:15; they have my home and cell # if they need additional information tonight.  If you have any questions about the data please let me know.  

Thanks,
Leslie
