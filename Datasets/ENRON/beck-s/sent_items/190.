Glad you followed up - I don't know why you would have been deleted, but I am glad that is straightened out. I will look for the feedback form via e-mail.  Thanks.

Sally,

After some phone calls today, I learned that I was deleted from the attendee list for May 16 and 17.  However, they stretched and admitted me.  Because of the "late" entry, the process for soliciting feedback is different than other attendees.  I provided my list today, and as I understand it, they will be sending the solicitation via E-mail to you.

Just wanted to give you a heads up.

Thanks for your feedback.

Brenda
