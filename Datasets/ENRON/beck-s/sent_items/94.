Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with=
 regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has con=
tributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the developmen=
t of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective =
systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate Mary's pers=
onal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary we=
ll. =20

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works =
of the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy Z=
ipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its e=
arly stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a=
 smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges n=
ecessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team =
has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  ope=
rations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri'=
s team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team wi=
ll continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, De=
alBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her t=
eam and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  Sheri, Andy and I me=
t with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment. =
 Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the p=
ast 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work c=
losely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce bus=
inesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look for=
ward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team.  =20
