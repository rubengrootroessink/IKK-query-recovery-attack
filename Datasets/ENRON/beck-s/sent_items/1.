FYI - While I simply received an assessment from Jenny, there is obviously a listing of equipment that exists.  Looks as if Paige Cox on Jenny's team would be the person to get with on this.  --Sally

Sally,  it doesn't appear that the fax machines already in ECS will be sufficient for your needs.  Let me know if you would like us to assist your group in getting additional fax machines.  I have to believe that there are numerous excess machines around here.   JR

Jenny --

There are 25 owned and 6 leased fax machines on ECS 05 & 06 per the UBS asset scheduled.  After doing a walk though on the floors, the machines are concentrated in certain business areas.  Current machine placement will not accommodate the type of usage that I suspect Sally's group will need to have.

My suggestion is that the settlements group(s) bring their fax machines with them, and we have the numbers changed.
