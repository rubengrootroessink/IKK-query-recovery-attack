Thanks for your nice note.  Did you get the job?  I certainly hope so.  

I appreciate your thoughts and prayers - both are very much needed!  We are all still somewhat in a state of shock over the state of the company.  I find myself working lots of hours on things that several months ago we wouldn't have thought about.  Life is always interesting - it may take a while to see where this twist is leading us, but I do know that it will be interesting!
