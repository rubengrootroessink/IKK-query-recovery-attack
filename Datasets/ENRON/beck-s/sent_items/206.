You are welcome to attend any of these.  In fact, it is helpful for cross calibration purposes if there is some cross over in the meetings.  Do get with Jeff and Stacey before the meetings to give them ffeedback on those book administrators who are problematic.  

PATTI:  Please add Beth to the attendee list for the Risk and Settlements PRC meetings.  Thanks.

Do you mind if I attend the Risk Management PRC   -- I really want to bring up the folks who are creating problems on a regular basis for Shona's team

Also wouldn't mind attending the Settlements one  -- just as a reference point for some of the GCP folks

Subject:	Preliminary Schedule & Attendee List for Mid Year PRC Meeting

The dates have been set for the Mid Year PRC pre-meetings (with exception of EGM & EIM) and Sally's final PRC meeting .  I have attached a preliminary listing of the meetings and their possible participants - most of these names are from last year's list.  Please check your pre-meeting list and make whatever additions/deletions that you see fit.  Additionally, if you have a major conflict with any of these dates, please let me know immediately.  Please return this back to me with your final attendee list - by Monday if possible.

Thanks for your assistance,
Patti x39106
