As a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for EWS, I will have a timeline for your review on Monday that will pinpoint key dates:  Unify conversion, EES absorption, HPL sale, commercialization, Todd Busby's arrival, etc.  I will also have details of resource needs.  We can use this to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of these initiatives.  I will welcome your comments on the timeline.  --Sally
