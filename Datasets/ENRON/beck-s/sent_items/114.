I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more than anything else.  --Sally

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  

		29th Floor (trading)	67 employees		EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk 

		30th Floor (trading)	35 employees		EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products) 

		31st Floor (trading)	52  employees		Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR 										and MPR teams
		
		32nd Floor (trading)	117 employees		Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis

				 
		37th Floor			148 employees		Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services 	

My suggestion would be to add to more floor meetings to your schedule - one on the operations end of the 32nd floor and one on the 37th floor.  
					
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally
