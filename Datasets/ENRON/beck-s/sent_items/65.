I am out of the office on vacation Thursday, December 20th - Friday, December 21st.  I will be in town and can be reached by cell phone over the next few days (713-417-1591).  On Wednesday, December 26 - Friday, December 28 ( following Christmas), I will be in New York.  My contact number/hotel while in New York is listed on the attached in the event something critical should arise.
