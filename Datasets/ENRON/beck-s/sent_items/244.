Glad that the two of you could make the trip to Houston this week.  Hopefully, your the time spent here was worthwhile in terms of sharing ideas and further developing contacts.  I Anna, I will look forward to continue dialoge as we explore commercialization opportunities.  Mike, I will get back with you next week on potential dates for the annual global risk management operations offsite (late Oct) and on likely dates for my next trip to London. 

I enjoyed the shopping and dinner.  --Sally
