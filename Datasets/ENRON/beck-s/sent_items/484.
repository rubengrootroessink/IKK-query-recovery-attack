Dear Bob Hall,
We would like to invite you to participate in a paid ($75.00) online survey for the Councils of Advisors.  This survey consists of 12 questions and should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.
 Click Here  to participate or learn more about this survey.  
Here is some more information:

Survey Title: Energy Trading Industry Dynamics
Compensation: $75.00
Number of Questions: 12
Description: This is a survey of North American electricity and natural gas traders to determine how North American trading volumes have been affected by Enron's credit downgrades and potential liquidity problems. Please do not take this survey if you are not a North American energy trader.  This survey is independent and was not commissioned by any company other than the Gerson Lehrman Group. All responses will remain anonymous. This survey will close when the required number of participants have responded.
