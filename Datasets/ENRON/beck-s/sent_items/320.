Several people gave me ad requests for the November newsletter.  I have had a crazy day at the office - should actually have been travelling to OU to interview students today.  Here are the ad contents.  I will try to call you on my way home and see if it is convenient to drop by the forms and the money.  In case I miss you, here are the contents:




Ashley Stone

Other newsletter items:

Nancy Ramsey wanted to mention that sympathy goes out to Theresa and (her daughter's name?) on the death of their mother-in-law and grandmother

There will be a food drive for TEAM and NAM at the December tea - Claire Loria was to check with philanthropy chairs to find out if certain items would be needed by the TEAM and NAM food pantries - did she send you that detail?
