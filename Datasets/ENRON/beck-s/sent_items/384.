Sally, this may not be in your area at all, but I am passing on to you, if applicable and any interest.  Thanks.

Hello Kenneth,

I am writing this short note in an effort to further my understanding of
Enron and establish some rapport with you regarding your ideas on voice and
video conferencing.
Polycom Network Systems manufactures the Accord infrastructure that allows
you to have multiple participants in video and voice conferences
simultaneously.  Fundamentally, I am interested to hear your ideas on voice
and video conferencing and perhaps have a discussion on how your
requirements (if they exist at all) may be addressed by Polycom Network
Systems in a dually beneficial business relationship.

I have attached two short introductions to the Accord Product Line to
eliminate the anonymity of this correspondence.  The Multi Network
Communication attachment furthers your knowledge about video conferencing.
The V2GC-20 attachment discusses the many features that the Accord Product
Line has to offer.

All the best to you,

Jenny Moore
