I didn't have an opening that looked quite right for Dan's experiece.  I have, however, given has resume to Tom Gros who has been leading CommodityLogic and is also paired with Beth Perlman and me on evaluating the potential for commercializing our mid and back office services.  In this effort, it is likely that Tom will to put together a marketing team.  I suggested that he consider Dan for one of those positions.
