Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.   Under the tab labeled "Documentation" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase "Global Management" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.  Bill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database.  Contract administration for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.  --Sally

The lawyers have come back and ask if you are including any of your global counterparty or contract admin.  Have we covered this function?
