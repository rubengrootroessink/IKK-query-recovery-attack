The decision was made last Friday that June 1 would be the closing date for the sale of HPL to AEP (there had been some discussion about moving the close date to July 1).  Brian Redmond has compiled a list of action items to be completed before the close.  Bob Hall is leading this effort for operations and we do not anticipate any problems meeting the June 1 date.  As I explained earlier, our involvement will continue with HPL through June, as invoicing and cash collection for the production month of May will be handled in June.  After the end of June, their may be some involvement on our part in following up on any unpaid invoices or answering customer questions regarding activity prior to June 1.  The effort on our part should diminish substantially after June 30.
