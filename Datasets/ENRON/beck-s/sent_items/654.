Yes, I think that it makes sense to keep the system available over the weekend for the foreseeable future.  I had operations teams accessing critical data, available only in SAP, on Friday evening and Sunday this past weekend.  It is very likely that our need to do so will continue, unlimited to weekdays.  Thanks.  --Sally

Normally, these scheduled SAP outages are planned with the major user bases via a communication released 3 weeks in advance and subsequently approved.  The notice you received today was a reminder notice.  This outage is due to our quarterly production build schedule for SAP upgrades to the HR environment ("hotpacks").  

We rescheduled this weekends outage earlier today after consultation with HR and the tentative and future date will be mid-January.  At this point no additional outages are planned for the remainder of the year.

The revised (cancelled) notification will go out tomorrow.
