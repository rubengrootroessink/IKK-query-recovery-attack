The last message in this trail is McMahon's note to the Management Committee members regarding allocations and an attached spreadsheet with his proposed acceptance of allocations.  Just FYI.  

I met with Kent Castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where McMahon has questions regarding our Net Works budget.  I will pass those along to Brad, Jenny, and Beth today, and will copy you two on that note.  Bowen has already reviewed Kevin Sweeney's budget for Operations.  Kevin reduced his direct costs by $1MM relative to the original budget submitted, and Kent says that Jeff and Ray are fine with that one now.  I don't anticipate much conversation around that on Monday.  --Sally

Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.
