Thanks to those of you who attended the ENW all-employee meeting today.  It was great to see Brent, Bob and Kevin upfront and center.  All of you must have done a great job in reminding, encouraging, arm-twisting or forcing your teams to attend, because the ballroom was full!  

A morning meeting means that our logistics schedulers can't attend.  So we have reserved EBN 5C2 for Friday, October 12 from 2:00 to 3:00 so that we can show the videos and walk through the slides with the schedulers.  If a few others who missed today's meeting want to join, there should be room.

Thanks for the feedback so far on staff members to participate with Melissa Becker on one of the follow-ups from Causey's offsite - Attracting and Retaining Good People.  If you still have someone from your staff that would like to participate, please send me their names by Tueday next week.  

Golf on Monday, November 19?  Let me know early next week if you would like for a foursome from your team (could certainly include you!) to play in the afternoon tournament at Raveneaux Country Club.  If you have some team members who have worked hard on a project or put in some unusually long hours for you, this could be a nice reward.  Did I mention that David is in charge of this tournament?  

I will be out of the office on Monday, October 8.  Meagan and I will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  I hope that the streets will be ORANGE when I get there.  I will have my cell phone with me, if anything critical comes up.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday.  Have a great weekend!  --Sally
