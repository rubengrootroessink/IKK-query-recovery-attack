Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week regarding the commercialization of our services.  While we will certainly draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this to be the core resource team.  We want to continue to build momentum for this effort.  Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us informed and in alignment.  Thanks!
