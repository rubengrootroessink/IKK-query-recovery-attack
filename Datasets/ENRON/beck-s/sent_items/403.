Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=
ch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=
 week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=
le availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=
hedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=
o hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=
ot been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =
that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=
 a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=
at Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=
gh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =
religious holiday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on =
Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=
her.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=
strated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=
eting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=
mitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =
that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=

Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=
 budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=
he appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=
 of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=
ne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =
is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=
d and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=
ed split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=
ision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=
e chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=
ogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=
 block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=
t 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=
hat works for both of us. =20

We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =
until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=
 components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=
ts and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussio=
n.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=
een reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=
iscussion on that.    --Sally=20

I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in sepa=
ration.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.=
   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operati=
ons?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just=
 have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling d=
iscussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most =
sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 p=
lan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious =
holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminsk=
i to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms=
 of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics an=
d attendees as follows:=20
