Subject:=09Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan




A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read=
 this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages=
 after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will b=
e rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building,=
 Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name ha=
s been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments a=
re finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th a=
nd 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as ea=
ch trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be avail=
able at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with =
your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are =
finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed =
dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piec=
e of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently,=
 we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the =
number lists as a last resort.
=20
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or specia=
l needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need=
 to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or br=
ing supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work =
environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limi=
t access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of=
 a work stoppage. =20

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows: =20

I.=09During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to mo=
ve to the backup location. =20

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown o=
ccurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected t=
o make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.=09After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup locat=
ion as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distrib=
uted.
