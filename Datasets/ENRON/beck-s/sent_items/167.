Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks.
