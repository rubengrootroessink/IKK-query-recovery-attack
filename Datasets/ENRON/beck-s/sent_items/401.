Anthony:  It's after 5:00 today and apparently the break out by project for ENW IT Development Capital is still outstanding from Rob.  Although we have missed our commitment to get restated (and fully footing) info back to Dan Leff and Wade Stubblefield today, I think that we need to be able to follow through on this tomorrow.  This is just one of a number of budget meetings that we are having to prepare for as Net Works, and it would be great to get one of these packages finished.   

Jenny:  Can Ken get this wrapped up today so that we can finalize all of this tomorrow.  We will just move today's plans -restated pages to you, Beth Apollo,  and Anthony by noon and, with your sign off, distribution of revised packet by afternoon - to Thursday.  Thanks.
