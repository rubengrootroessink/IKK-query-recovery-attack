I regret that I will miss the first Global Accounting Steering Committee Meeting on Tuesday, May 15.  I am taking that day as a vacation day while my parents are in Houston for Amanda's piano recital. 

I will be in attendance at the next two meetings in May - the 22nd CAO Meeting and the 29th Steering Committee Meeting.
