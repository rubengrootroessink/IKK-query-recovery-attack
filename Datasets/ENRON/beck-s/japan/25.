Hi Sally

  Thanks for the attached.  In light of your response I think I'm after 2 
things:

   1. A spec that outlines Eugenio's role, and
  
   2. A spec that could be used to hire a Japanese national to replace 
Eugenio at the end of Eugenio's assignment in Japan.

  Hope this helps. If you could revert asap I'd appreciate it.

  Thanks

  Phil

I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the 
attachment.  If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do 
with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to 
create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in 
Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a 
position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use 
in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the 
risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different 
descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use 
this.  

Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you.
