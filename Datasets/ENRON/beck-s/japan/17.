I have been at Enron for eight months and work under Sally Beck.

In December I attended the Exotic Energy Derivatives conference, where I met 
Masayuki Fujita from the Mitsubishi Research Institute.  He is doing research 
on the deregulation of the Japanese power market.  We had lunch together and 
chatted for some time about his work (I worked in a Japanese company for 8 
1/2 years and speak fluent Japanese, so we got along easily).

He was in Houston this week and came by to visit.  On Monday, we met with 
Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson and later had dinner with them.  Sally 
suggested that I introduce him to Alan Aronowitz and you.  Of course, you 
were out of town, but we did meet with Alan who said you would probably want 
to meet him back in Tokyo anyway.

Would you like for me to set something up?

Regards,



Eugenio
