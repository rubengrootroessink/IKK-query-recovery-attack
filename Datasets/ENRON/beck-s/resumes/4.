Sally,

Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today and telling me about the 
exciting opportunities you have at North America.  I reviewed the 
presentation that you  gave me and found myself already thinking about how to 
make it happen.  I would very much like to work with you to make this a 
reality.  Attached is a copy of my resume.  I look forward to continuing our 
discussions next week.



Gay
