Dear Ms. Beck,

I am writing to you to express my interest in working for Enron.  I have
long been interested in a career in business, and I would love the
opportunity to explore business in Enron this summer.

As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) and various
entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to
form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, I have learned a
great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective.
This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as
well.  I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian
Impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  I am also co-leading
the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer.  Because
this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer,
I will be in Houston from mid-July to mid-September.  If there is a
position available at Enron, I would enjoy working for it while I am here.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world.
The combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called
for in the business sphere intrigues me.  The integration of global and
analytical thinking also piques my interest. I have attached my resume for
you to review, I will be in Houston from March 27-31 if you would like to
interview me. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing
from you!

Sincerely,

Natalie Carnes
