Looks like we can get some help to automate the swaption notification process 
going forward...

Souad,

There are expiration dates for swaptions/options on the "Detail" button in 
TAGG Deal Capture.  Let's
do the following.  Go into TAGG Deal Capture and check to make sure these 
dates are valid for swaptions/options.

We will write a report that you can run that identifies deals that are  
expiring.

Thanks, Ron

We really need to raise the priority on getting this done.  We had a swaption 
with significant value to Enron not get excersied this month due to 
breakdowns in the manual process.  Let me know how extensive this will be 
from an IT perspective.  Thanks

the reason for this message and the other message addressed to Jeff Johnson 
is that we have system modifications that due to system resources may or may 
not get done.  note the ClickPaper comment.

Souad,

We can implement this - the question is "when". As I indicated to Jeff, we 
are currently working on ClickPaper
but we will work on whatever is a higher priority from Enron's point of view.

Thanks, Ron
do to get your request

Subject: TAGG modification request

Ron,

A series of significant events took place this week where it made it more 
apparent that a modification in Tagg is highly needed.   Without going into a 
lot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an 
Expiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a 
date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In 
addition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a 
message box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later 
time, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the 
expiration date becomes current).  

This request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of 
risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue 
was addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.

Can we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed and 
your feedback is appreciated.  

Thanks. 


I work on the confirmation desk, reporting to Jeff Sorenson.  Please call me 
if you have any questions or suggestions (X37580).
