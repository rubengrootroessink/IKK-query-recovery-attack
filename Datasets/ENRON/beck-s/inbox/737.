[IMAGE]  =09 Dear Sally,  Thank you for choosing WorldCom Conferencing for =
your virtual meeting needs. I'm sending this message as a follow-up to the =
conference call you held with WorldCom in the last few weeks.  With our con=
ferencing services, you now have the flexibility to conduct meetings anytim=
e, anywhere. We can help you maximize your productivity, communicate more s=
wiftly and drive cost savings straight to your bottom line.   You can creat=
e meetings to match your precise business needs by choosing from our wide v=
ariety of conferencing features and service levels. For example, if you req=
uest a question and answer session, you will need the assistance of a confe=
rence coordinator and our Premier Service.   The following service levels a=
re available:   Premier Service: Ideal for planning high-visibility meeting=
s, presentations to large groups or any other event that requires a dedicat=
ed meeting manager and operator to handle your call from start to finish. S=
tandard Service: Ideal for planning meetings for medium-sized groups, such =
as staff, training or project management meetings.  Unattended Service: Ide=
al for small internal meetings not requiring operator assistance.  Instant =
Meeting: Reservationless conferencing allows you to hold meetings at any ti=
me, without reservations and without operator assistance.  Enhance your nex=
t meeting with Net Conferencing services. Participants can view meeting mat=
erials over the Internet while they attend meetings on the telephone. Enhan=
