Andrea

Per our ealier discussions please forward the Sally Beck data direct to Hector as I have to leave the office due to prior committments.  As discussed Sally requires this info today.

I would be grateful if you could copy me in on the e:mail so I can track from an EWS perspective.

Thanks, Karen.
