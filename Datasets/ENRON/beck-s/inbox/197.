Mike:  Do you have time to get together on Thursday to review the budget data that you have in hand?  Assumptions regarding number of employees within business units and the timing of the sale or shut-down of certain lines of business have a direct impact on the ENW revised budget for 2002.  --Sally

You should get the latest from Mike Deville.  Hopefully, they are very accurate as we are using them for the DIP lending process.

Rick:  Do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are "baked enough" so that it makes sense for us to relook at the ENW budget in light of revised plans for the various business units?  My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.  Which would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 2002 budgets that you have are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the ENW budget.  
 
Let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information to rework the ENW budget, if necessary.  Thanks.  --Sally

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally
