TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE
News from The University of Texas at Austin
NOVEMBER 2001
____________________________________________
Dear UT Friend:
We received many positive responses to last month's premier issue of TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE. Some readers' email software had problems with the logo header. We apologize if you were among that group and hope you enjoy this logo-free second issue. Look for the fall/winter printed edition of Texas Tribute in December, and another TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE in January.
Now, on to the news:
WHEN PROFESSOR EMERITUS JOHN J. MCKETTA was teaching, he would say to his students that he could visualize where they would be 15 years into the future. "I'd tell them they were going to be presidents and vice presidents in industry," recalls the eminent chemical engineer and energy adviser to five U.S. presidents. His approach has encouraged and motivated countless incipient engineers in his 55 years at UT. One of those is Peter Buenz, a 1960 chemical engineering graduate who, with his wife Claire, has given $30,000 to endow a scholarship in honor of his mentor.--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/index.html
BEATING THE AGGIES is a reward unto itself, but one group of students is channeling its collective team spirit into a good cause. The UT Austin Army ROTC cadets will run the game football from the UT Tower to Kyle Field to raise money for the Pentagon Victims Fund, established in the wake of the Sept. 11 attack. Runners will leave the UT Tower the morning of Nov. 21, arriving at Texas A&M's Kyle Field in time for the Nov. 23 UT vs. A&M game. The Longhorn Victory Stampede will take the cadets along Highways 79 and 6 en route to College Station. Participants and donations are welcome.--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/depts/arotc/index.html
UNIVERSITY STAFF MEMBER ARTHUR RAUCH decided it was time to put his money where his mouth is. Rauch, a longtime counselor at the Learning Center, has made a bequest to UT that will create a $700,000 scholarship endowment for members of Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity he has served as campus adviser for more than 20 years. Rauch says he hopes his donation will provide an academic incentive for students, and that it also will serve as a catalyst for other alumni to make Greek-related scholarship gifts.--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/index.html
GO BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR to the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art to catch two dynamic exhibits. "Past Present Future: Notions of Time in 20th-Century Art" draws on the Blanton's renowned collections of American and Latin American art, focusing primarily on works created between 1915 and the early 1980s . Reaching further into the past, "500 Years of Prints and Drawings" features works on paper representing the 15th through 20th centuries. Both exhibits end December 30.--> SEE http://www.blantonmuseum.org/
SPEAKING OF THE END OF THE YEAR, it's almost here! If you're considering a year-end donation to the University, please remember that your gift must be received by Dec. 31 for a 2001 receipt to be generated. Also, you may have the opportunity to double or even triple your gift if your employer has a matching gift program. To ensure that UT receives the maximum benefit from your investment, ask your human resources office if a match is available.

As always, your feedback is both welcome and appreciated. Hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving holiday.
