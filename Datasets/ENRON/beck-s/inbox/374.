Sally, 
Thank you for your continued support of Avistar.  As you probably know Brent Price has approved additional Avistar equipment for his direct reports in Houston, London and Singapore.  We will begin to install these additional desktop conferencing units within the next couple weeks.  
I know we had also discussed a possible deployment to Stace and Jeff's groups.  I am in Houston this week if you would like to discuss their possible project and get a sense of the budget requirements.
Please feel free to reach me on my cell phone if you have any additional questions, 650.281.3860. 
Thanks 
Brian Wood
