Ladies,
     Do to time restraints in  presenting the prospective Provisionals to the Board prior to their  invitations being issued and the Provisional Orientation, I need to change the  Feb. Board meeting to Feb. 4th.  Lisa will send meeting  reminders when the location is confirmed.  If any of you see any problems  with this please contact me ASAP.  Please confirm you have received  this.  Nancy
