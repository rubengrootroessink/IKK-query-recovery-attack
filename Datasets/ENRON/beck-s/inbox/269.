As part of the HPL transition, we are reviewing imbalances on shipper contracts.


Attached below is the list and where we stand on reconcilations.  About 50% are reconciled, meaning that
the counterparty agrees with our number.

Most we are waiting on information from the counterparty.

The big items are the imbalances with Duke Energy, Gulf Energy, and Tejas.

Rita and I have people working with these counterparties to get good information.

thanks

bob

Attached is the updated imbalance file showing net positions by counterparty.  You can expand the detail to see the contracts that make up each of those total counterparty numbers.  I have also color coded any companies that are doing business under several different companie/subsidiarys down at the bottom of the file to show their net position as well.  The numbers in this file represent what we currently have on our books as of 2/01 production, 3/01 accounting and we are still getting confirmations in from the customers on those imbalances where there is not anything in the  "imbalance per customer column".  Since the meeting, the Exxon King Ranch number has changed significantly and I will have someone look more closely into that and provide an update/explanation.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.  

Thanks,
