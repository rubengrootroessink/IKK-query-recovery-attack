Sally/Janet - I wanted to forward Christine's resume to you for review.  I have asked her to set up a time to meet with each of you (or someone in your area) to explore potential rotations in each of your areas.  She is presently working for Rod Hayslett and he speaks very highly of Christine.  He told me her strengths were in the qualitative area and that she is good at quantitative work.  I think she would be a good fit in either one of your groups/business units.  Thanks.  Ted

Mr. Bland,

I am currently working as an analyst under Rod Haslett in ETS finance and accounting.  I am up for rotation at the end of this month, and would like to meet with you to discuss opportunities within the analyst program where my skills might be a fit.  My resume is attached for your review.  I appreciate your time and consideration.

Thank you,
Christine
