Mike & Sally,

Below is the information that we received on the project.  I am still waiting on a cost center from EES for the expense portions to settle to.  Look over this information and let me know if you still want to meet to go over this.  

This is the EES project, which is set up on EES to capture the capital portion of the project costs.  The expense portion should settle to an EES cost center.



The project set up shown below is the Networks project, which I set up, but have not yet released.
Only Release 1 is shown below.  There are three releases set up, but only the first one will be released at this time.  All three releases or phases will look like the other phases. 

As you can see below, the capital parts of the project (Solution Definition, Design & Build, and Implementation & Testing) are set up with three basic WBS elements.  These elements as described below will settle to the EES project as follows.

Project Coding on Networks Project					Settles to EES Project WBS
C.300000.01.SD.OU	Rel 1 SD Outside Consultants Labor		C.007730.22.01 Outside Professional
C.300000.01.SD.EN	Rel 1 SD Enron Labor				C.007730.22.03 Enron Labor
C.300000.01.SD.OE	Rel 1 SD Other Expenditures			C.007730.22.05 Other Expenditure

C.300000.01.HW Hardware Purchases					C.007730.24.01 Hardware
C.300000.01.SW Software Purchases				            C.007730.24.02 Software

This will allow the costs on the Networks project to be tracked in a manor that will support how the charges are settling to EES.  So if EES has any questions about the charges we should be able to pull up the detail very quickly.

The following items will settle to an EES cost center since they are expense related.
  C.300000.01.PI.TR	Rel 1 PI Training Dev & Delivery
  C.300000.01.PI.PI	Rel 1 PI Post Implementation Support
  C.300000.01.PI.GA	Rel 1 PI General & Administrative
