given that we (ENE) are going to undoubtedly be undergoing a whole bunch of change in the next months - it may be worth thinking about how Energy Ops would look 'post-change'...

i guess i'm thinking along the lines of one central Energy Ops core - with as many centralized functions as possible - running off as many centralized systems as possible - like a bank model - a central processing facility (Houston) - with regional/product 'swat teams' in each/any business units - really just Risk Admin folks and Deal Capture - front end

commercial folks may ask this anyway - especially as a cost saving opportunity - it might be good to suggest it/plan for it in advance.....at least get some thoughts together

just thinking out loud
