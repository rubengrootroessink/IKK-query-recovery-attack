Sally - 

I know where we need to go with this.  

Primary focus is on the areas of the business managed by Beth and Evan.

I'll set something up to discuss

Thanks - Dan

Since you are the lead, I assume that you have an idea from Dave on what he is looking for.  Since Dave referenced ENW, I assume that we will include roles with regard to IT development projects.  Do you think that he also wants to pick up definition of Infrastructure roles as well?  --Sally

Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could have this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Regards
Delainey
