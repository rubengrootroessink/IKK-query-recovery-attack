Would the hard copy that Janet refers to be helpful to me as I try to get a better grasp of the legal work involved in Newco?

Following is a very basic list of contracts we are currently expecting to perform to/serve as an ongoing concern in the estate. This is not nearly the detail you need, but it's a start:


Gas
Retail Gas Book (900+ contracts behind 18 LDC's)
Enovate/Peoples Contracts
FPL Gas Agreements
Midland Cogen 
Keyspan (Lilco)
Dominion Oklahoma
City of Tallahassee
Oxy
Miscellaneous wholesale contracts TBD

Power 
West Retail Book (140+ Contracts, All-Requirements, avg. 1000MW load)
West Whlse Book (32 Contract groups identified, @ 1000MW load too)
Nepool Retail
East Wholesale(Currently 19 contracts)
Miscellaneous wholesale contracts not yet identified


Other
There will be numerous other "physical" assets that will be a part of this including:
generation development sites
Bridgeline/LRC
Napoleonville Storage
Michigan Asset Mgmt.
Sithe contracts
East Coast Power contracts
LNG contracts
etc.

Sally has a hard-copy with a little more detail. Several of us will be getting together either tomorrow or Sunday to put together as much of the infrastructure together as possible. We're going to need at least a draft of the backoffice people and boxes. We'd also like you to be a part of it if possible. We'll send out an email/voicemail to let everyone know when/where.
