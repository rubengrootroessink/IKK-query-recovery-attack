Hey Sally- 
This note got kicked back to me when I tried to send it to  you yesterday, so hopefully it will make it through this time.
Thank you for your wonderful letter explaining your  decision to stay and display "visible leadership" during this very difficult  period. I read an excerpt of it to the group, and everyone's hearts were with  you. You were greatly missed, but of course we all understood and supported your  decision.
It was wonderful meeting you and I thank you for your  wonderful contributions to the first session. I hope once things stabilize a bit  you'll have a chance to re-engage with the group. 
With all best wishes-
Margaret Vaughan
 
Hello everyone-
 
Congratulations on a great Forum. It was an immense  pleasure meeting and working with all of you over these last two months.  
 
Attached is a Word document containing the action plans  created in the second session in the 5 areas of Inclusion/Diversity, Quality of  Place, Education, Leadership and Business Retention. Betty Alexander will of  course be getting the complete report to you in a week and a half or so.  However, we wanted to give those of you who were not able to attend the second  session or had to leave early an opportunity right away to engage with the plans  that were generated -- someone from the group will be giving you a call in the  next week to go over these plans with you. 
 
In the meantime, please look over the attached  document and see where you might want to join in -- there is plenty of  room for volunteers in a number of areas. For instance, Gaurdie Banister and  Brian Landrum are looking for volunteers to help them move the  Inclusion/Diversity initiative forward, and opportunities abound in the area for  Education to aid with the Teacher Network (James Calaway: 713/627-1466) and the  Annenberg High School of the Future project (Jonathon Day:  713/225-7011). Also, Ron Lewis (713/229-1125) and Sally Jeffcoat  (713/756-5008) are looking for people passionate about enhancing  Houston's social services to join their working group at The  Center. 
 
To volunteer for any of the initiatives laid out in the action  plans, please contact Marilou and she will get you plugged in.
 
Again, it was a great pleasure and honor working with you, and  I look forward to following your efforts to bring forth a fantastic future  for Houston!
 
All the best-
 
Margaret Vaughan
