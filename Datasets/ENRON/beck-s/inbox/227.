Attached are the revised settlement documents we sent to BakerBotts on
Christmas Eve.  We, of course, have not yet heard back.  Was Rod Hayslett's
concern just going to the Closing Date concern you raised (which we will
try to address, perhaps by requiring "X" days notice of a scheduled
closing)?

While we are sure clean-up is needed (such as converting the defined term
"Mutual Release" to a new defined term ("MCTJ Settlement Agreement")
throughout the documents and, we suggest, defining Dynegy Inc. and Dynegy
Holdings as "Dynegy" for simplification purposes), the attached are
designed to address your major concerns, including that CGNN not be a party
in the Adversary Proceeding, with protections designed to prevent Dynegy
from using that change to attempt to preclude Enron from suing for damages
for wrongful exercise under the Option Agreement -- which we understand to
be part of the agreement reached last week.  We look forward to your
comments.  Merry Christmas.
