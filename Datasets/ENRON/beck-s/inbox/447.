Sally and Wes,

The Integrated Solution Center has prepared a report for ENA called "Monthly Dashboard"  for the month of May 2001.

The purpose of this report is to provide you the statistics of your business area's utilization of the ISC via the SAP Hotline. The report's content was carefully selected to summarize the criticality of issues.  Each priority level is broken down by the total number of tickets as well as the number of exceptions.  The report also presents the grand total of tickets and total number of exceptions, which are benchmarked against the SLA.

The ISC recognizes the importance of communication with our customers will therefore provide this report to you via email on a monthly basis.

Should you have any questions, please contact Lisa Darnell, Manager of Customer Assurance, 713-345-6734.

Thanks,

Jeremy Merritt
