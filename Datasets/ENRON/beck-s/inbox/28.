Sally,

You had mentioned in a voice mail that you have a spreadsheet that helps track the assets that NewCo is looking at.
I would like to work off the same sheet for consistency.

Also, when you get the chance I'd like to sit down and discuss Dave's plan of moving all the 'risk mgmt' team on the 31st 
floor of ECN.

Regards,

--anthony
