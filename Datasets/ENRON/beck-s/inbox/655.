Sally-

Yesterday at the floor meeting on the 32nd floor, I asked you a pointed question regarding trust of company management.  I appreciated your effort to confront the frustration that many employees currently have.

However, you also requested other questions.  I have a number of questions, and I have tried to collect a number of questions from those that I have heard around the floor.  In addition, I have a couple of suggestions for what could be done to build badly lacking morale.

I am sorry for the long list, but in reality this is probably just the tip of the iceberg regarding questions and concerns out there.  I hope that you can answer some of these questions, and I hope that you can ask some of these questions to those who might know.

I have sent this to my two supervisors as well.

Have a nice day.


Tom Chapman
