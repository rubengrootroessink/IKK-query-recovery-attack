Steve,

Attached is the source code and documentation for the VNG Gas Control website. This is the last outstanding item needed as part of the agreement. I have changed all references to Enron on VNG.SEQUENTENERGY.COM and refer them as SEM or Sequent. I will be available if you have any questions.

Cheers,
