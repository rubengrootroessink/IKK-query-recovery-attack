Attached is a summary report of the EWS tactical (revenue driven) and strategic (educational) visits to Enron supported by experience ENRON in third quarter 2001.

Coordinate BU subject matter experts (SME's) to tell the Enron story, i.e. EOL, trading, etc.
Customize agendas aligned with Enron and customer objectives
Shorten sales cycles
