Just to keep you in the loop.  I have encouraged here not to go for the "Executive Program" but to go for a regular MBA at U of H  -- there will be no time off of work, it is an evening/weekend program.

I am in the process of filling out a reference form for her.

My understanding is that this falls under the normal Enron Educational assistance program and we don't have to get any other approvals.

Is this the correct approach?
