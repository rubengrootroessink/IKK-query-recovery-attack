Hi,
I was looking thru some papers and I saw the Copy Club receipt of yours so I mailed it to you in case you need it to get reinbursed...Also,Becky Pearce and Kathy King said they would take over our newsletter jobs for the December issue since Sally Walker and I have seniors.  I think Becky Pearce wanted to do my job but thought I'd let you talk to them...Thank you..Joan
