ENW EBS IT -  Weekly Status Report  (as of 10/26/01)


Executive Summary :

EnFiber:   Real Estate Book requirements gathering and documentation is 100=
% complete; obtained all approvals; development is 25% complete.  User acce=
ptance testing for Scheduling Phase 1 is 85% complete; the implementation d=
ate has been changed to 10/26 per user's request.  Waiting for final signof=
f from Jim Terrell. Successfully implemented FACT Release 1.2 on 10/15.  Co=
mpleted development of IP and Local Loop options for Valuation and began QA=
 testing. =20

PPCS/TRPS:=20
TRP demo by Dorado is well accepted by Enron audience. The prototype is abl=
e to fix the biggest problem in the current EBS bandwidth trading process -=
- not able to show the actual hardware inventory of network elements in ord=
er to make accurate port striping and cross connect. Through their auto har=
dware discovery device driver, switch inventory will be presented clearly t=
o the users in a nice graphical layout, so provisioners don't have to spend=
 huge amount of time to maintain various IT systems to gather the knowledge=
 of bandwidth capacity allocation.  TRPS will gather information for both T=
DM and IP.
Settlements (Saber):  Users are approximately 50% complete with User Accept=
ance Testing.  Users were successful in posting first invoices to SAP with =
no errors.  A demo of the GUI for the Flash to Actuals reconciliation proce=
ss is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 29.  Production Implementation will be mid=
-to-late November,  a couple weeks ahead of original schedule.   =20
Remedy:  Started discussions for release 2.0 of the EBS Change Management a=
pplication.   Changes to include schedule maintenance notices and test & tu=
rnup.  These changes does not require mandatory approval. Added automatic r=
eporting functionality to the EBS Trouble Ticketing system.  Continued web =
development on the MSN document routing and approval system.   Functionalit=
ies completed include submitting new request, approvals and comments.
Livelink thespotlight: is currently providing storage for 24606 documents. =
Currently work is in progress to incorporate Engineering and Operations doc=
uments into the system, as well as migrate the system into the Corp domain.=
 Below is a more detailed description of this week's activities and next we=
ek's deliverables.
 EBS Application Infrastructure:  Provide oversight and project management =
activities of the EBS application infrastructure with ENW.

EBS Database Technologies:   Provide on-going production and development da=
tabase support for both external and internal EBS database systems.

Utopia: The proof of concept was completed Sept. 21st. A demo has now been =
given to Rick Paiste, Inja Chun, Rick Fehl, Paul Racicot and Sue Klinke, al=
l reactions were favorable. The next steps will be to refine the presentati=
on and re-present to upper management for further approval. Al Nahas will b=
e demoed the product next week. We have identified issues with several of t=
he dBs and this would require additional work to correct these data problem=
s between the systems, this will not be an insignificant task.

Voice Minutes Trading:  USTeleNet has agreed to accept Enron routing data v=
ia an automated exchange (XML format) as opposed to the current labor-inten=
sive process..  This will require USTeleNet to develop an interface to thei=
r TMS system.  We are also working with Nortel to interface with their Nort=
el switch via software (i.e. API).  Nortel has a proprietary DMS 250/300 op=
erating system which requires manual input every time a route is changed;  =
we will continue to investigate the feasibility of interfacing internally-d=
eveloped software to improve efficiencies & accuracies.  Many suppliers' ra=
tes have been downloaded to our environment for purpose of finding least-co=
st supplier's rates for our traders and creation of rate sheets for confirm=
ation.  New Product Management and Supplier Rate Management modules have be=
en developed and are now being tested by users.  Trader Ratesheet developme=
nt should be completed & available for testing within the week.     We have=
 scheduled 11/8 & 11/9 for the 4tel / Telesciences software demo.     =20
Deal Prospects / Contact Tracking:  Reviewed options including existing sol=
utions such as EnGAGE, Siebel (off-the-shelf) and an internally developed w=
eb-based tool.  Goal is to provide a simple, cost-effective tool that can b=
e used by commercial teams (starting with Mid-Market, DRAM, Minutes ?) to t=
rack prospects & contacts.   =20
Enron  kicked off an enterprise-wide CRM initiative with the goal of recomm=
ending a CRM strategy (including Sales Force Automation) to senior Enron ma=
nagement by October 25.   EBS will only be participating in the assessment =
/ evaluation stage.=20
Media Services / Strata:  Developed a Tactical Deal Capture product ; in pr=
ocess of completing Sales Invoice functionality for Tactical Settlements, i=
ncluding the ability to generate Sales Invoices on the basis of Physical Sp=
ots, Survey-Based GRPs, Overnight-Based GRPs, or PreBill (prior to actual s=
pot airing).  Tactical Deal + Settlements are integrated, using Strata core=
 data coupled with Tactical Deal data.   Continued systematic daily process=
ing of Nielsen Overnight TV & Cable Ratings data (nearly 100,000 lines/day)=
, along with systematic aggregation of Quarter Hour data for each TV progra=
m.   Created Buy Statistics & Market Statistics UI against existing Strata =
data.  =20
EBS Contracts (tactical): Continued development of v5.2.  This release incl=
udes enhancements to add attributes for Minutes contracts.  The scheduled r=
elease date is 11/06.
EBS Contracts (strategic): Completed updating project plans and will provid=
e to business next week.  Completed database modeling for tasks and reminde=
rs.  Began development of client-side (browser) validation for commercial c=
ontracts.
EBS Facilities:  Continued development of v3.3.  This release will include =
the ability to query key systems for their dependency on Facilities and aut=
omation of the short description.
Global Counterparty/Common Codes:  Corrected problems with wire information=
 and address roles that were identified during Saber/Globals testing.

Debbie corrected NRC in Liquidation/Settlement Report in user test.  Judi s=
uccessfully re-created the oce files for each Brio query.
Added capability of pulling deal via term_strips_lit_vw when npa/nxx not se=

rating an exception.
Resolved the 'OnVariant' error that is generated on Deal Patrol when any EO=
L deal is transferred to EnFiber

Deliverables Scheduled for next week =20
Finish development to remove xconnect and disconnect from PPCS.=20
Coordinate with network engineering, network security, provisioning groups =
and NOC to determine when PPCS network security setting will be upgraded ag=
ain.=20
Prepare db migration and production freeze.
 Enron continues to furnish up to date business requirement of PPCS replace=

Ardmore server goes into production date is 11-19-2001

Issue=20
Need to work with GNM to reset network security for PPCS before 1.1.2 goes =
into production. (Eric Liu)
Need to make sure current PPCS 1.0 contract will not send out disconnect co=
mmands after the network security setting is upgraded and before 1.1.2 goes=
 into production. (Eric Liu)
Need to implement and communicate the new operation procedure to filed engi=
neer and provisioning. So physical cross connect from SNMS will occur befor=

r PPCS stops collecting PM. (David Workman)
Follow up with Terry Hoop's to find out whether the Luent 2.5 G test switch=

Dorado needs to provide a complete set of final source code of PPCS 1.1.2 t=
o Enron. (Dorado)
PPCS access level has been downgraded to prevent cross and disconnect comma=
nds sent to the switches. Because of the change, PPCS stop collecting PM da=
ta for newly entered contracts 'cause PM initialization requires the same l=
evel of access right as cross & disconnect. So security level for PPCS need=
s to be upgraded before George Babaz's team can continue to enter missing c=
ontracts to the system. But the timing is very tricky otherwise there maybe=
 a possibility some existing contracts on version 1.0 will be terminated by=
 PPCS. (Eric Liu)
Dorado needs to start deliver TRP related documents to Enron. (Dorado)
Dorado needs to package PPCS 1.1.2 delivery CDs with all the fix. (Dorado)
Installation documents from Dorado needs to be further flushed out. (Dorado=
