Dear Ms. Beck and Ms. Apollo, 
It was a sincere pleasure to meet with you yesterday. The information I  learned during the interview served to confirm the feelings I have always had  about Enron. Unfortunately I received the disappointing news that Enron was not  pursuing employment possibilities with me further. 
I feel strongly that Enron and its  products and services have an exciting growth ahead, and  I  definitely would like to be considered for opportunities available in the  future. 
Again, I appreciate your time and  consideration, and hope to hear from you in the near  future.
Sincerely,
Ariel  Sandin
