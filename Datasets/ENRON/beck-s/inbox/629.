Here is an updated version of the Energy Ops Overview (Total Budget/Headcount broken out by Business Unit) and the Headcount Report by Business Unit/Function.  We've  verified these numbers with Fin Ops so everything should be in order.

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Karen Snow
