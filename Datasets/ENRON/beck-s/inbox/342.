Sally,

I thought you may be interested in seeing this as well.  We'll make sure you are kept in the loop also.  Meredith and Wanda have been the primary drivers behind the mid-office issues.

Wes,

Per Wade's request, attached is the latest EES internal control scorecard. This scorecard represents a compilation of the "highest risk" audit issues identified by Andersen and is the tool we use to track progress on resolving these issues. We also share the scorecard with Rick Causey and the EES Internal Control Committee on a regular basis (about every other month).

I will continue to keep Wade informed on the progress of these issues as most of the issues relate to the risk areas transferred to Wholesale. Also, I will copy you on all future scorecards. 

Please let me know if you need to talk about this further.

Thanks,
Misty
