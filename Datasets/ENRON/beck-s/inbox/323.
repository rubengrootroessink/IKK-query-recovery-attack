  <B>Enron</B>, the country's largest marketer of natural gas and a
business
partner of independent producers since 1985, is expanding its
services to a complete menu that will help producers more
efficiently manage their entire business.

  Thanks in part to technical advances such as wellhead measurements
that are more accurate than ever and strategic partnerships with
application service providers (ASPs), <B>Enron</B> Producer Services can
now deliver any technical or back-office service necessary for
natural gas production and accounting.

  From its traditional menu of transportation, gas treating and
processing, risk management and financing options to asset, risk and
capital management, and now a full complement of
information-technology and backoffice services, <B>Enron</B> Producer
Services can deliver any service a producer needs to focus on
managing the growth of a competitive and profitable business.
  For the first time, <B>Enron</B> enables producers to choose any
service,
from pipeline connection to royalty payments-to begin and end at the
wellhead in one seamless transaction.
  APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS
  <B>Enron</B> Producer Services helps producers reduce overhead costs by
eliminating the need to maintain administration, accounting and
information-technology staffs.
  <B>Enron</B> can supply the trained personnel, equipment and facilities
to
perform administration, accounting and financing duties such as E&P
accounting, joint venture accounting, revenue accounting, financial
transaction processing, expenditure authorizations, tax payments,
regulatory filing, royalty payments and full production accounting.
  Outsourcing such back-office responsibilities to <B>Enron</B> and its
strategic partners will result in higher productivity, lower costs
and improved customer relationship management. All financial
information resides securely in one integrated system, yet the
producer has no need to make a long-term investment in costly
technology infrastructure or personnel-intensive backoffice
services. Growing companies can thus focus on their core business
while <B>Enron</B> ensures the producer has secure, real-time access to
its
financial data anytime and anywhere.
  Through its business partners, <B>Enron</B> Producer Services can supply
all forms of state-of-the-art industry hardware, software, services
and highly trained technical professionals.
  Bob Tretiak, chief executive officer and president of Applied
Terravision Systems, one of the business partners, says, "The
business relationship between <B>Enron</B> and ATS will facilitate a
dramatic change in the production operations of an upstream
petroleum company by providing new operating efficiencies,
flexibility and other significant benefits-thus allowing a company
to focus on its core competencies."
  <B>Enron</B> has the ability to provide producers with crucially
accurate,
real-time information about the quality, quantity, composition,
destination and ownership of the natural gas they recover. <B>Enron</B>
guarantees realtime and accurate data delivery, thus enabling
producers to make the decisions that will directly lead their
business to achieve its full potential.
  For example, a business partner with <B>Enron</B> Producer Services,
Hanover Measurement Services, uses leading-edge technology to
electronically meter and monitor natural gas production of large and
small wellheads at thousands of facilities on a 24-hour basis. With
such accurate and real-time information, producers can manage their
day-to-day operations more efficiently than ever before. For one
Houston-based organization that owns more than 5,000 miles of
pipeline and transports approximately 2.5 billion cubic feet of gas
per day, Hanover reduced lost and unaccounted-for gas to 0%-a
significant eight-- figure savings for calendar year 2000.
  Hanover is also developing an Internet-based system to provide
secure, real-time management and transmission of gas measurement
information-offering accurate energy measurement and the reliable
transmission of that information tailored to meet each customer's
specific needs.
  The system allows <B>Enron</B> Producer Services to capitalize on
economies of scale and offer the most cost-effective measurement
services to the industry.
  BUILDING THE FUTURE
  <B>Enron</B> Producer Services also has the experience and expertise to
provide all the commodity risk management services that producers
need to stabilize their cash flow and earnings. Using a custom,
strategic combination of caps, floors, swaps, collars and other
risk-management tools from <B>Enron</B>, producers can reduce their
company's exposure to volatile prices, enhance shareholder value and
thereby attract more investors and lenders.
  <B>Enron</B> has the capital resources, the infrastructure and the
desire
to help producers maximize business potential and exceed their
goals. It can customize a menu of its value-- added services and
pricing plans to suit any producer's needs, thereby reducing
overhead and streamlining back-office tasks so producers can
concentrate on building their core business.
  <B>Enron</B> Producer Services will partner with producers to help
efficiently manage their day-today operations and back-office
infrastructure, thus allowing them to attain their long-- term goals
for business growth, profitability and competitive success.
  Working with <B>Enron</B> Producer Services has several immediate
benefits: it eliminates overhead, it provides accurate, real-time
information and measurements on a daily, not a monthly, basis,
positioning their production to be responsive to the hourly
transactions demanded by the power market. It further capitalizes a
producer's operations-both technologically and financially-to afford
the company better business decisions. In this way, <B>Enron</B> is
helping
producers to reap greater benefits from their commodity, effectively
leverage their core capabilities, gain efficiencies, find
opportunities, and therefore profitably respond to an increasingly
complex and competitive natural gas market.
  The <B>Enron</B> Producer Services team represents an experience level
in
wellhead transactions of more than 35 years for <B>Enron</B>. No other
company has combined the physical commodity with the technology,
resulting in a wellhead-to-burnertip transaction with no further
distributions necessary when producers receive their production
payment. This powerful combination of the physical and the technical
creates an immediate impact on the producer's bottom line, today and
for the future.
  <B>Enron</B> has created the Wellhead Desk to help customers manage
their
physical commodity. The service is a comprehensive suite of products
inclusive of nominations, scheduling and balancing. The Wellhead
Desk is capable of managing all of a producer's commodity needs,
ranging from logistics to physical risk mitigation strategies.
Customers will interact directly with the Wellhead Desk and it will
act as an account manager for customers. <B>Enron</B> will interface with
various internal business units to maximize value for producers.
  "In this time of capital constraint, <B>Enron</B> offers a convenient
one-stop shop for the producer community allowing them to focus on
their core competency-developing reserves. The value extracted from
developed reserves can be maximized when associated company
infrastructure costs (i.e., accounting, scheduling, marketing, etc.)
can be minimized," says jean Mrha Beach, vice president, <B>Enron</B>
Upstream Products.
  Whether the producer is large or small, <B>Enron</B> can provide a
fee-based service on request, which will be both affordable on a
cost basis and profitable on an earnings basis. In the mind of
<B>Enron</B>
Producer Services, the producer truly is No. 1.
