Greg:  Attached is a spreadsheet that summarizes the economics on the POPS deal.  The capitalized costs of POPS that is on the books was gathered by working with Allison Millan from Kerry's group.  Two costs that have not been included are Barbara Gray's time to draft the license agreement and my time to negotiate with AEP.  Please let me know if you need additional information or if there is a formalized process that should be followed here.  Thanks!

Can I see the proforma economics on this deal?

It looks like we are close to nailing down the license agreement for POPS with AEP.  There are no major issues with the license agreement.  They want us commit to assigning a resource for about two man months of work to help them bring up the application.  We would bill them $150/hour for this service in addition to the $1,750,000 for the license and source code.  If we can work out a schedule for half days at Enron and the other half at HPL then I think we have a deal.  -  Tommy
