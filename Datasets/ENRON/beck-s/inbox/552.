Sally & Mark,
	Attached below is the executive summary for Beth's project management initiative. I would be happy to discuss this effort in more detail if you like. There is several deliverables to the organization before the end of year to help with monitoring and consistency of projects across ENA/EGM/EIM. Also, EES, ETS, and EEL have been in discussions as to our direction and timing and the solutions they currently have in place.

Richard

I will schedule a more detailed status update meeting within the next 2 weeks.  

Please call with any questions you may have.
