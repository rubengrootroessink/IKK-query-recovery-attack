Kristin,  I spoke with Rick Joseph today.  The September 10 Lyceum is to the 3rd Year PPA students.  This is the overall Enron presentation.  He said that most of the "firms" presenting at the Lyceums are bringing more than one person to present the different aspects of the company.  He said that in his original correspondence he sent an evaluation form that gives the points of interest to the students.  He also said that many of the "firms" presenting use a video about the company.  He said that the students would be interested in knowing where Enron is going and what the long range goals are for the company.  They would also benefit from knowing the skills that are important to those seeking employment with Enron.

I hope this helps.  The September 12 Lyceum is to the 4th year PPA students and Rick Causey has committed to that presentation.

We need to figure this out ASAP.

Hi Rick,
I'm in the process of planning the U.T. 2001 Fourth Year PPA Fall Lyceum series scheduled for every Wednesday in the fall.  As you know, this series brings to campus distinguished practitioners who address our 4th Year PPAs (the equivalent of college seniors) on current issues in accounting and current trends in business.  Last year, you delivered a presentation in this Lyceum on "Global Equity Markets."
I'd like to invite you back this year to make a presentation on Wednesday, September 12, from 4:00 to 5:15 p.m. (new time) in UTC 2.102A.   This presentation would be in addition to the Enron company presentation scheduled for Monday, September 10 at the same time and place.  Please let me know (1) if the Wednesday date is convenient for you, and (2) the topic you would like to discuss.  Also let me know if I can facilitate your presentation in any way.
Best wishes,
Rick
