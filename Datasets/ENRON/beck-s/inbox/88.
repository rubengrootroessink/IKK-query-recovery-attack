Sally and Kevin,

Fariba Karimi does the Accounting for Equity Trading.  She has been in our group for about a year as a Senior Specialist.  She will be released from her current role at the end of January.  She is very interested in finding another spot at Enron.  

If you are aware of anything in either Operations or Accounting, please give me or her a call at 5-2510.

Thanks, 
Sheila
