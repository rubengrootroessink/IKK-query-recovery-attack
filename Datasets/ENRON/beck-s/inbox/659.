As discussed in our meeting on Monday, Net Works will be conducting a year-end talent review to identify the top 15% of its employees.  In order to prepare for this meeting, please refer to the attached guidelines and criteria.  The top 15% should be those individuals who have strong long-term potential and are critical to retain under the current company circumstances. Your Human Resources representative will be contacting you to offer assistance.

Names of individuals should be submitted to Marla Barnard by 4:30 p.m. today.  This information, along with the next steps for the process will be discussed at our
