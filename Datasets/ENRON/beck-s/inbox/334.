All,

I have not yet gotten Don's employee information yet and am waiting until I can move everybody at one time so we have a clean cut-off for everyone.  If we have missed the May cut-off for an April 30 transition, we'll make it effective May 31.  Also, I am considering just making it effective June 30 so we have a clean quarter cut-off.  So, continue to use your current cost center until you hear back from me.

Also, Kerry, is the description of the cost centers standard (the ENW ENA)?  Will this be confusing to existing ENA descriptions?  Would it be better to call them ENA/EES or EWS/EES.

Thanks

Wade
