Hello, everyone.  I'm hoping you know of someone who would be a good fit fo=
r an interesting opportunity in Market Risk Management in RAC:

We're looking for a director level accountant or risk management operations=
 person who can join the Strategic Risk Management (SRM) group within Marke=
t Risk Management to work on the Asset/Liability piece of Enterprise Risk M=
anagement project as we team up with Vince Kaminski's Research group on thi=
s challenging new initiative.

The ideal candidate would have Enron experience and be a good project manag=
er, accustomed to working in self-directed situations, able to work with an=
d gain the team support of  mid and upper level management in  research, ac=
counting, risk management operations, finance, treasury, RAC, the business =
units, etc..  They would need to be able to articulate for top support and =
commercial management any project issues and implementation challenges, and=
 would be working with risk mgmt operations and the business units on the i=
mplementation efforts and process design.  Someone able to take full respon=
sibility for this long term project from its infancy through completion, de=
signing a plan of attack, and then leading the implementation effort.  This=
 person might also act as a consultant for SRM's other initiatives that imp=
act accounting.  Ideally, of course, this person would understand risk mana=
gement (risk books, trading operations, etc.), but someone who understands =
the different types of risks inherent in our strategic assets and accrual a=
ccounting contracts might also be a good fit if they're self-motivated and =
willing to dig in and learn the risk management business.

I think it's a great opportunity for someone to broaden their resume and ga=
in market risk management expertise.  We've met with top risk management co=
nsultants, and this is a cutting edge initiative that will put us head and =
shoulders above our peers.

If you want to forward this to potential candidates, below are some links t=
o websites that may provide some overview information on asset-liability / =
EW risk management (I haven't reviewed the sites myself yet).  Also, Vince'=
s outline on Enterprise Risk Management from early last year is attached be=
low. =20

Please call me if you know of someone who might be interested.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.
