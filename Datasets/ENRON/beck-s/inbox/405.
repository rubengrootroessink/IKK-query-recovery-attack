Beth,

Just to keep you in the loop.  We have a lot of stuff to fix in Unify
espeically after we killed Sitara.  If you remember, imbalances, storage, fuel, unaccounted for gas and agency
information was all to reported and booked to the general ledger from Sitara.  We now must 
put those  process controls back into Unfiy.


talk to you soon.

bob

I had fininshed with them yesterday and had given a select few out for review/corrections.  Since I have not heard of any corrections, I can send them to you asap.

However, these include only those I have been working on and does not include Bryce's entries or any other additions beyond what we added in our meeting.
Items in Red need some action done by us and may not be priortized yet.  If a password is required use "unify".

Any idea on when you'll have the spreadsheets up to date.  I'd like to get them in the new Lotus Notes db soon.

If you can give them to me both spreadsheets after you're done, I'll work with Dave Magee to get them in the DB.

Let me know if I need to help.
