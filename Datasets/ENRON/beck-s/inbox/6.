Hi Sally,

I know it's very early to be contacting you, but I hope that you will
remember KPMG when you get to UBS and need help with systems
integration/data mapping type work.  UBS was one of my clients when I lived
in Switzerland and I was very involved with the implementation of a system
called DACFA 2 which was used for global data pooling and consolidation.  I
have actually re-initiated contact with people I know in UBS Corporate Audit
in Zurich and will be providing them with general information concerning
wholesale energy trading.

We would very much like to speak to you regarding your planned role in Netco
and the direction you think the company will take.  Again, I realize that's
it very early, but I know that you will continue to operate at Enron speed
and if we wait it will be too late to help.....

Best regards,

Randy Wilson
