Greg,
I have attached responses to these questions.  We can discuss them and decide how to best present them when we resend the entire package to Whalley.

Some things that jump out at me on the Whalley packet page labelled Global Support Dollars - 2002 Plan vs. 2001 Forecast Variance dated 10/23/01
 
Under EGM, increase of 5,573 in operations expense and increase of 16,159 in IT development expense.  Doesnt that sound like a big jump?
 
What made EIMs infrastructure go up 2,334?
 
How is energy operations for EES down 9,092?
 
What did EES spend capital on in 2001 to make the capital IT infrastructure variance be down 19,726?
 
What is going on at Corp. with a positive IT infrastructure variance of 13,924?
 
On the front page or Whalley summary page, why did depreciation go from 62,028 to 30,124 to 57,843.  I know some of what you said Kerry but we need to make sure that Enron knew the 2001 depreciation number in the 2001 plan and that 62,028 did get depreciated accurately and that it just so happened to turn out that only 30,124 got done on our books.
 
You get the point.  I think this is what Whalley will do too with the entire packet on all pages.  I know the numbers are right, they just beg alot of questions so make sure we have an updated, very accurate cheat sheet with all the explanations so when he gets the packet today, he can follow it!
 
I assume everything ties that should.
 
Thanks.
 
GP
