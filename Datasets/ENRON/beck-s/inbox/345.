Tommy,

I see we have another issue with the tariff reporting process.

I would hate to see all this work go down the drain.

Can't we trade this application for something else?  I think
the actual expenditures are in my RC.  If they are I would like to 
trade this app for services that AEP will be providing in June.

The app has no benefit to us at all once HPL is out the door.

If need be, I can have a person on my staff run the app for them
and deliver the reports.

Let's talk, 

thanks

bob

hi Bob,
	it's been awhile!!  it looks as though this regulatory app will have to be run from Mike Potter's machine.  this means that once a month (about a week in duration) Irene & Juanita will be visiting the 32nd floor to run the program or have Mike Potter run it until we can figure out a way to handle this.

regards,   mve

I do not think it makes sense to pay Enron to develop a piece of software
that depends totally on Enron systems since theywill be going away.  Do we
have specs on the needs?  If so, forward them to me and I will have one of
our programmers take a lok to see what we can do.

hi Don,
     have you had a chance to think about which way we want to tackle this
issue ?  currently, Mike Potter can run the app from his desk top at enron,
or Juanita and Irene could from his station.  i guess that could be our
back up plan going forward until we have time to determine the best way to
handle this.

      Application

Don:  I met with Mike Eiben on the Regulatory Tariff Filing Application.
As you know it was not an application named under the IT Services
agreement.  It seems to be still something of a work in progress but has
some good functionality that it delivers today.  Unfortunately it will
require some rework to make it work after the sale closes.  The VBA Access
application is currently stored locally on the client workstation or PC.
It uses ODBC and the local NT ID to connect to Global and Unify and pull in
data to update it's database.  It currently has no network login process
and doesn't lend itself to a terminal server set up without some work.
Since we have spent money on a contractor to develop the application I'm
hesitant to just give it away and have you load it directly on an AEP PC
without some type of reimbursement for the development costs.  Even then
we'd have to work through the process of updating the data.  This
application would have to come through Enron's firewalls to get updates and
that would probably not be acceptable to Security.  We could redesign the
interfaces to be more of scheduled push from Enron but we'd want to be
reimbursed for this cost.  Even then you'd have to rework the data feeds
for the application after our service agreement terminates to get data from
your applications.  From talking to Mike I understand that up to 3 people
once a month used to pull all of this data together manually in the past to
make these filings.  How would you like to move forward on this?  Do you
want us to come up with options and estimated costs?  I will hold off until
I hear something from you.  -  Tommy

   Can you explain what this is and what we need to do?

   Mike Eiben advises that there is another system that needs to be added
   into
   the document you are reviewing:

   "We've called it the "Regulatory Tariff" filing.  It is an
   automated way for HPL to report to the Texas Railroad Commission all of
   HPL
   sales customers, (both onsystem & offsystem) what we sold gas to them
   for,
   and the time frame.  This info is pulled from Unify Settlements"

   I don't know if you've already sent it back or not, but if not, can the
   Regulatory Tariff Access db be added.

   Thanks.

   Theresa
