FYI.  Looks like we got the extension of the Suncor outsourcing agreement.  They had some key staff changes about a year ago and the team has worked very hard to build relationships with the new players.  Is it possible to get 8 more of the 100 point Enron bucks.  They would be a nice token to give the key players in the logistics group as a reward for contributing to this renewal.  Let me know what you think.

Peggy, Laura,
On Monday this week I completed negotiations with Suncor to extend the services arrangement for a 3 yr term out of Jan 1, 2002.  The scope of work will remain as is today, and we will cover IES and SEMI volumes as we do today.
Over the whole negotiation, one item that was never raised was the quality of our back-office services.  They never questioned the quality of the work of your two groups (or the commercial group for that matter).  The issues during the negotiation were related to cost, scope, strategy (do they want us at all) and term.
Thanks as always for the great work of your teams.  I'd be happy to review the deal with the key individuals as we did with PCOG, if you wish.  I'd just like to wait for the signed agreement to be in place - 'cause you never know.  Peter already has the first draft of an agreement ready so we should get that through soon.
