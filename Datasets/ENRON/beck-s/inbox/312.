Dovie, 
Until we make all the appropriate changes in SAP would you please make the following changes in PEP:  

Sally Beck should be listed as the supervisor of Meredith Eggleston and Mark Evans in PEP and Hector McLoughlin as the HR Rep.   

Persons in the following EES cost centers and departments should show Hector McLoughlin as HR Rep. for Mid-Year PEP purposes only.   All contractors are excluded from the list.    I only need access to Analysts; their HR Rep. will remain the same.
