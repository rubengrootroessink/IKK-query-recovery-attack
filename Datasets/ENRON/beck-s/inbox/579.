Subject:	Curve Validations - Extremely Short Fuse
Importance:	High

David Port and Rick Buy are requesting to see curve validations (immediately).  Primary concerns are that we sufficiently address curve validations requirements per risk management policy.  Please forward to me any curve validations (most recent) you have regarding your desk.
Wish it wasn't on such a short fuse,
Thanks,
Frank
