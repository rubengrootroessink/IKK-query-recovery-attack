Subject: priorities for 1/16 and accomplishments for 1/15

1/15 - 

curve val: we have scoped the curve val project and have discussed it with PwC. I've talked to E&Y in general terms and have a meeting with them on this at 10 today. We have also had initial discussions with the different risk groups about the holes in the curve construction & upload process and our deliverable for the end of today is a list of where the holes are and a plan to fill those holes.

We spent significant time with E&Y to go over the make up of the DPR. 

We are working with the different groups on the 12/31 DPR information. So far, we have only had one request for it. My gut feeling is that EIM & ENA are complete, but ECTRIC & EGM need a bit more time. Chris should have a complete status ready for today.

Our systems are fixed (hooray!). Yesterday we caught up on the Enovate and Bridgeline DPRs as well as spent significant time with IT to get the systems fixed.

Susie is still working on the SEC VAR for 10/31, 11/30, and will start 12/31 as soon as all of the information is available. She has also started the net assets work.

Lastly, the whole group had CAS training so once we get access to the system we can start pulling info by counterparty.

 

Today our goals are:

Curve val - finalize memo (getting agreement from PwC, E&Y, and Enron estate), put listing of curve construction plan fwd, start determining what the different buckets of curves are and what tools are available to perform analysis

Field more E&Y DPR qus

Have a complete status report on the 12/31 DPR.

Prepare ongoing reporting (Enovate, Bridgeline etc).

I also hope to get some time to familarize myself with the CAS environment.
