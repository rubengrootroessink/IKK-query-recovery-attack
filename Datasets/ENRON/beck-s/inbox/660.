  Dan - we prepared this high level chart on responsibilities, and I think an update session was scheduled late last week, but was cancelled due to all of the confusion/ ancicipation of the Dynegy deal

I will have blanca work with Esmerelda to get You and Evan and I back together for 15 minutes to go thru this chart

Beth
