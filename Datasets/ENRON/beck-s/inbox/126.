Bob,

We all realize these are difficult times and we must all adjust and work together but I would like to make you aware of the recent support changes that pose some issues for Logistics.  We are told that the Solution Center is not available after 7:00 p.m.  Monday through Friday nor are they available on the weekend.  We are continuing to schedule gas in Logistics albeit on a limited basis during these after hours so is there anyway IT can manage to provide some level of support?

We appreciate your efforts to work with us to develop a solution.  

Regards,

Tammy Lee-Jaquet
