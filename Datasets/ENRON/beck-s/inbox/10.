Hi Sally,

I am not sure if the new company with UBS needs people, but I wanted to
forward my resume to you just in case.  At Enron, I worked in your Global
Data Management group under Steve Venturatos and James Scribner.  ANY
available positions in the trading support group would interest me,
including risk, settlements, data support, scheduling, etc...  If you should
need any further information, please contact me at 713-334-2887 or
713-302-9570.  Thank you.

Yours truly,
Kelly Hermann
