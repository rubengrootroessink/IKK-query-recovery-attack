Gary,

Attached is a spreadsheet which shows people that remain in London related to the middle and back office.  These individuals are not solely working on winding down EGM activity there, and we need to make sure that EGM does not pick up total cost when those people are not 100% focused on EGM.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Shanna/Tom,

Are we currently picking up this total cost and allocating as appropriate or are we only paying our percentage?


Kevin
