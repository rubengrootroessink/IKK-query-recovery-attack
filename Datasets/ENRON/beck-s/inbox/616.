Hi Sally,
 
Attached is the first cut at average deal count and tenure information for EOL and non-EOL trading. The only missing pieces at this point are European Metals and "Other", both of which we should have from London first thing in the morning.
 
I will send an updated file as soon as we have that information, and we wil be standing by tomorrow in case there are any revisions needed, or additional requests.
 
Thanks,

Torrey Moorer
