We are getting closer to finishing up the agreement to sale a license to use POPS and its source code to AEP.  It looks like we agree in principal but I'm not comfortable with some of the language proposed by AEP.  Since Barbara Gary is out until next Tuesday I don't anticipate us finishing up the agreement until the end of next week at the earliest.  Given the timing we need to be able to turn around and deliver the application & documentation by the end of November in order to receive all of the funds this year.   I will be setting up a meeting with the application, DBA, DA and technical writing teams to make sure we are all on the same page and ready to deliver the application by the end of November.   -  Tommy
