Sally, 
Attached is the updated of the headcount file I sent you on Friday.  I misunderstood the original request and provided December 31 plan for all four years.  I have now updated the file with December 31 actual headcount numbers for 1998 through 2000 and plan for 2001.  I have also updated the EGM numbers and inserted a summary tab.
If you have any questions, let me know.
Thanks,
Brian
