Shona-
The officialization process that EGM - Global Products uses was developed w=
hen we were implementing our Global Risk Management Worldwide Close process=
.  We (at that point) had an excel speadsheet that would search ERMS by boo=
k codes and pull in the officialized post id for the day - if there was a b=
lank, the book was not official at which point the book administrator then =
goes back into the ERMS database, officializes and then we run VAR and our =
daily reports.  We are now doing this via our Global Reporting database for=
 Global Products.  In developing the process, it was myself, Scott Earnest,=
 Mark Fondren and Simon Thurbin (London office).  We now have Bill Kazemerv=
isz and Vera Ilyina who are running the database daily and making certain t=
hat all listed books have been officialized.  John Swinney is our Risk Mana=
ger of the Global Products team and he is involved making certain that the =
risk managers are updating our new books list so that we are certain to mar=
k them official nightly as well as integrating any new processes relating t=
o VAR, exotic file uploads, etc. =20
As you can see, it is very much a team effort that has really paid off on "=
next morning issues" for our group. =20
If you have any additional questions or comments, please call me. =20
Thank you,
Michelle

During the morning meeting today Rick Buy commented on what a good job EGM =
has done in the officialization process.  He took your names because he wan=
ted to know who to thank for this.  His comments are based on the summary g=
raph - his words - EGM has by far the most books but never shows up on the =
log - who can we thank for that?

Keep up the good work!
