The following org chart is for the entire back office for Calgary.  I think there have been a couple of changes, but not to my group.  I believe that Accounting and IT Infrastructure each had to reduce by one person.  As discussed, this org chart includes the proposed promotions.  Let me know if you have any questions.
Peggy
