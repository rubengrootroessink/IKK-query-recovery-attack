Thanks for the follow up.  

Need the cost data as early on Friday as possible.

Beth and Evan meeting went well.  All around circumstances and pressure have "merged" them into one team.  Every situation has its upsides.

5:00 PM meetings are going well...making a lot of progress.  Real $'s moving in the door faster.

Need a big kid to manage CSC asap.

Soccer season is over.  Elizabeth's team - 2nd place overall.  Medals, trophies, the works.  All were excited - and now in bed.

Thanks and see you on Friday.  Stop by anytime.

Dan

Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time to get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.  

Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.  Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting required a visit with David Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with you at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen.  

How are your 5:00 pm meetings?  

I will catch up tomorrow.  --Sally 


Hope that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight!!
