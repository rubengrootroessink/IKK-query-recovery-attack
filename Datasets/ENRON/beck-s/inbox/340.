Meredith and I will not be available at this time.  There is another meeting that has been scheduled for a week now that cannot be moved.  Is there anyway this meeting can be rescheduled so that one of us is available

Jennifer,

Can you get with Shirley and Vlady and get this meeting scheduled for next week.

Vlady,  I am going to be in the Woodlands in some training Monday and Tuesday so perhaps we can do it later in the week.

Wes and Wade,

Rick Buy and the RAC/EES team have compiled a list of EES projects, the so-called "Points of Light" list. Its objectives are the following:

	- articulate the progress of EES initiatives to the BOD
	- ensure that important activities are not overlooked
	- assign responsibilities to appropriate individuals
	- monitor completion of projects against a set timetable

I suggest that we revise this list to reflect reality better. Also, you could use this list as a management tool to ensure that in six months EES issues are properly addressed.

I could meet with you and walk you through the "Points of Light" list.

Vlady.
