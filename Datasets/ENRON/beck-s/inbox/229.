Hi Sally,

Wish you & your family a very Merry Christmas and a wonderful new year!
Hope everything is going well for you & you have been able to get sometime
with your family during the holiday season.

I hate to bother you with this request because I realize you must be very
busy; I was wondering if you had a chance to forward my resume to Ginger
Gamble (at Reliant) and Carol Scherer (at Duke Energy).  The job market is
really terrible right now and your recommendation will mean a lot for me.
Pl. do let know if you would like me to resend my resume to you.

Best Regards,
Shruti
