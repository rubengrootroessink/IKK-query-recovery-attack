During the morning meeting today Rick Buy commented on what a good job EGM has done in the officialization process.  He took your names because he wanted to know who to thank for this.  His comments are based on the summary graph - his words - EGM has by far the most books but never shows up on the log - who can we thank for that?

Keep up the good work!
