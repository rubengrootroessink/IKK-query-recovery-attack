Kerry,

As you are probably aware, the EES Risk Control organization is moving under Sally as of April 30, 2001.  Our initial thought was we would keep all the former EES employees together in a new ENA accounting entity, but have now decided that the Risk Control group needs to be captured as part of Enron NetWorks.  These were previously set up under a new ENA company number (#1596).  I don't know if within SAP we can simply repoint the profit and cost centers set up below to roll-up under ENW now instead of ENA, if not, we will need five new ones set up as follows:

	Executive (Meredith Eggleston)-27101 [Simper, Keith]  ,150260
	Risk Analytics (Neil Hong)-27102 [Simper, Keith]  ,150261 
	Strategic Operations, Process & Systems (Scott Mills)-27103 [Simper, Keith]  150262 
	Deal Capture/Confirmation (Meredith Eggleston)-27104 [Simper, Keith]  ,150263 
	Global Data Management (Mark Evans)27105 [Simper, Keith]  ,150264 

Thanks and don't hesitate to call with questions.

Thanks

Wade
