I am printing the budget stuff now.  It all seems to be here.  I probably will have no comments on EES before I get back.  I assume on EIM and EGM, you are getting the respective OTCs to approve in detail in front of everyone their invoices for 2002 as Louise did. 
 
I wont be able to look at the Whalley stuff real close until tomorrow morning so you and Kerry and Mark agree it is OK relative to what we gave him October 15th and I will call in tomorrow morning to give my views.
 
Any  feedback yet on the all employee meeting?  I also listened to your voice mail last night.
 
thanks.
