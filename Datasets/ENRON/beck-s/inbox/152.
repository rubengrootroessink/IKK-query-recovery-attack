Sally,

As we briefly discussed yesterday - can we chat about identifying ENW resources for each of the Business Units in Jim's world. Basically in 3 groups - IT Infrastructure, IT Systems Development/Maintainence and Operations Spport.

I'm trying to compile a overall Headcount Summary - by Business Unit. Both bodies & $.

We also need to touch base on the 3/4 EBS move planning stuff.
