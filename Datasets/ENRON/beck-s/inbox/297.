	Lisa Trofholz is a former Enron employee that has applied for and meets  all of the qualifications for the wellhead desk. She left Enron due to the sale of Enron 
	Liquid Services gathering assets.

	Lisa reported to me at NNG  as a scheduler for the pipeline. She did an excellent job then and I am sure she will do an excellent job for us on the wellhead desk.
	Her experience with Enron as well as her experience gained since she left, make her uniquely qualified to have an immediate impact in establishing the wellhead 	desk.


	I would appreciate your considerling Lisa for re-hire.
