James is at it again.  He actually stated in the meeting this morning in front of Rick Buy that this is all IT and that they have no control over IT.(Stupid comment) Rick buy just said, privately, I bet if we cut back their limits they will prioritize these problems.

As you can see they had more failures today, even after my call with Fernley yesterday.  And tomorrow is their deadline to turn on VAR for RiskTRAC

I have a conf call in the morning with Mike, James AND Fernley to discuss status, etc.

I am also giving Rick Causey a quick update on the situation at 10am tomorrow.  I left him a voicemail as a heads up yesterday, and he said he wanted a quick update.  

This morning I think Rick Buy was a little happier, as I let James have it a little in the meeting and told him in no uncertain terms that they needed to fix this.

sending an email around should not be the solution.  They just need to get this crap right!  Will work on them tomorrow.

I'll continue to keep you posted

Subject:	PLEASE READ - Enron Europe Risktrac Feed Summary 8 May 2001

In order to provide greater clarity around the issues we face on providing a daily feed to RiskTrac, to minimise the potential for miss communication and to remove the need for those attending the daily conference call to scribble away when Europe is outlining the reasons for failure, we will provide a daily written summary to the above list. 

We will aim to produce this by 1pm London time on a t+1 basis which is 1 1/2 hours before the daily conference call which should allow all concerned time to review prior to that call.

We have adopted the definition of failure as not having the daily data loaded into RiskTrac by 6am Houston time which is the time the corporate VAR is run. Times will be taken from the RiskTrac intranet site (http://risktracfeed.corp.enron.com) which is clearly visible to everyone. 

It should be remembered that we in Europe (Risk and IT) only control the process to the point where data is moved to RiskTrac. From there is needs to be processed by RiskTrac in Houston and we have no control over the time this takes. On days like today where the Nordic feed took 75minutes to process we may well fail based on the above definition. Failure to meet the 6am Houston deadline does not necessarily meant that we will be unable to calculate book VAR or produce the daily DPR that day it is just that we have failed to provide the positions and prices for the 6am corporate VAR run.

Please get back to me if there are any comments.

James
