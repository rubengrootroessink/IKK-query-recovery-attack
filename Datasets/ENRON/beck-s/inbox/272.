I discussed the AEP/ENA standards with Barbara Gray and passed the draft document to her on Monday for review and modifications as needed to a legal document.  Jeff will follow-up with Barbara later in the week on the status or if further input is required by Global Counterparty.

The QA team has completed the preliminary testing of the Counterparty Request System for AEP and Global Counterparty will begin testing tomorrow.

Per your conversation with Bill Hare, here is the documentation we have prepared for AEP access to the Global Counterparty request system. Let me know if you need anything else.
