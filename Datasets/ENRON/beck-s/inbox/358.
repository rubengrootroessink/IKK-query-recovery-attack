I know you get this daily log stuff all of the time, and probably ignore it, but wanted you to check out the new  - more summarized reporting that we are instituting at the 8:30 meeting.  I think Rick Buy liked it this week, and hopefully this will lead us to more conclusions/trends than just reporting incidents that appear random.

A small step, but one in the right direction...
