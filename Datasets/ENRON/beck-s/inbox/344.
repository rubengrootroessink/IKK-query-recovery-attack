Subject:	RE: POPS cut over to AEP/HPL, CP ID 95005

After meeting with the AEP and Enron management team yesterday a decision was made to close the HPL sale on June 1st.  Verbal approval from the DOJ has been received with the written documentation to follow next week.  The pigging of the A/S line has been completed and no additional major damage has been found.  

Now it's up to us to execute and get this done.  

Ed:  Please get with Romeo and decide on the best time to make the Pipeline change within POP's.  You may want to do this right after sending your latest HPL nom for May today.  Then after the switch we probably need to send another EDI file to make sure everything is OK for HPL.  

This evening we should kick off the replication push of the transport contracts into POPS.  That way AEP/HPL should be ready to start bidweek next week.

Please let me know if anyone has any questions.  -  Tommy

Subject:	POPS cut over to AEP/HPL, CP ID 95005

After a few meetings, several emails and some testing here is the plan for cutting over POPS to recognize AEP/HPL CP ID# 95005 as the owner of the pipeline HPL.  

On the evening of Friday, May  18th: 
Switch the pipeline within POPS to be AEP/HPL or CP ID 95005.
Switch the Pipeline ID within Global Facilities to be 95005 effective with 6-01 -01 gas day. Matt will go into Unify and change the pipeline owner table to recognize CP ID 95005 as the owner effective the 5-19-01 gas day.  This will allow nominations for the rest of the month to go to CP ID 95005 within POPS.
The duns numbers will stay as they are.  CP # 1321 will keep the current duns.  CP# 95005 will keep the dummy duns.

Please keep in mind the following facts related to the cut over:
The Unify conversion to SQL Server is scheduled for the weekend of June 9th.  The AEP Settlements changes will not be moved into production until that time.
Once the cut over is made retroactive noms before that date will have to be kept in sync manually between MOPS and POPS.  EDI for retroactive nominations will not work after the switch.  Nominations going forward for both HPL  and AEP HPL will work fine through EDI.  By going with the  18th date we give Logistics more time to clean up the past days in case something was missed.  
No AEP/HPL transport contracts will replicate into POPS until we switch the Pipe ID within POPS to 95005.  By cutting over on the 18th, HPL will have the whole bidweek to prepare the pipe for June 1st. New transport contract for HPL, CP ID 1321, after that date will need to be brought to my attention as we will need to coordinate getting the contract into POPS.


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  

Thanks!

Tommy
