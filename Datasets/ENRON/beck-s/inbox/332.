Sally,

I did not know if Meredith had provided these to you yet, so I wanted to pass along.  These were the original budgets, I know Meredith is revising them to provide you a more accurate going forward view.

Meredith - 

Here are the existing budgets for Wanda's group (her cost center, yours, Neil Hong, Mary Lynne).  Mary Lynne is in the process of revising her budget right now.  Please let me know Monday how I can assist you in revising these budgets.

Thanks!
Rachel

Meredith-

Please email me with which you need assistance.  I am in a meeting all day on Thursday, but should be able to help you or delegate the task to someone on my team.

Thanks!

Yes, Rachel should still be helping.  I know she is tied up through tomorrow in trying to re-roll the EES plan, but should free up Thursday when the operating committee is offsite.
