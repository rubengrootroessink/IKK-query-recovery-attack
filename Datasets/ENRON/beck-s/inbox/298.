Sally,

I am also working with the Commodity Logic people, and we thought it will be great if we can sit down with the CL Module Managers and some of your people (maybe James Scribner, Beth Apollo and Leslie Reeves) to talk about the pricing assumptions and estimates for Commodity Logic. I think your group can add a lot value here by validating prices (would you be willing to pay x dollars for the product?, etc.).

Do you think a meeting is a good idea? If not, can you think of a better way to capture this valuable input?

Thanks for your help!

Sergio
