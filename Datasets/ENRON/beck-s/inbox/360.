Who is responsible for status in the database - updating has not been done, access has not been widely circulated so therefore we are at risk of informing people that open items have not been closed when they have been.

Can we discuss

Mike

Subject:	quarterly doorstep update - action requested

Sherri and I are in the process of putting together the quarterly update for the doorstep reviews.  Sherri is concentrating on ensuring the finding status is the most current.  Please coordinate with her (this week if possible) regarding the findings in your offices if you feel the status listed in the database is not the most updated.

Also, if you have an outstanding report for a review that has been completed, please send me a copy of the draft.

Thanks

Shona
