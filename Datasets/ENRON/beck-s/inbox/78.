1)  Did you add to the numbers that Jeff and I reviewed with you on Sunday?  You had mentioned folding in some analysts and associates - did you do that?  UBS was asking me about numbers today, and I wanted to be consistent with the answers. 

2)  What about Calgary?  You were going to ask Rob M. to have Peggy Hedstrom coordinate over the weekend.  Didn't hear from her.  Are you handling this through Rob?  Or do you want me to include Calgary operations in the final org chart for Netco Operations?  --Sally
