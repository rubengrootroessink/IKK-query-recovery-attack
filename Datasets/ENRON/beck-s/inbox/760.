Sally - Your work schedule - and environment - must be truly terrible right now.  Never having been through a merger/buyout, it's hard for me to comprehend the stress everyone must be feeling . . .
I did not get the article from Lori, just the Curfew Exempt form.  I'm sure a pull-out would be fine, if you could coordinate that with Sally Walker for printing and collating.  It doesn't look like Nancy got the download, and Janet couldn't read portions of it (funny how some fonts are not supported by the software), so I'm dropping a hard copy off at Nancy's in the morning when I take the car in to the dealership.  Fortunately, it's on the way!  My computer will be out of commission from Tuesday afternoon until sometime Thursday, so if there are changes it won't arrive in-home until a little later this time . . .
Good luck, and have good week!  Robin
