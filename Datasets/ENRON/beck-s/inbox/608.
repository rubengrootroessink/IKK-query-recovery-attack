Following this week's discussions, we have recalculated the absolute minimu=
m number of people required to keep your present systems in production.  In=
 recalculating this number, we have eliminated everything except that which=
 is required for "non-elective" maintenance.  Although many of the systems =
have been in operation for some time, we still frequently encounter problem=
s which interrupt production.  Such events require emergency attention and =
are what we refer to as "non-elective" maintenance.  Therefore, in recalcul=
ating these support staff, we have excluded any effort for improvements or =
other changes that the users have previously identified for next year's wor=
k.  Also, we are suggesting excluding any further effort on the Saber Settl=
ement, GeoQual, Market Intelligence, DPC Tax & Media Services systems which=
 we will simply wrap up as those are and put them in "moth balls" for possi=
ble future use.  As the result of this process, we have come to a core mini=
mum number of 19 people required to simply ensure that the remaining system=
s continue to function.  The only way that we can logically reduce this cor=
e number any further would be to "turn off" other production systems.  Alth=
ough we recognize that the concept of turning-off other production systems =
is unattractive, it would be far better to have this happen in a planned, o=
rderly fashion than having them crash in an unrecoverable condition later. =

As we discussed at the Lunch meeting yesterday, we have previously reviewed=
 all of the EBS systems to determine the minimum staffing required to keep =
the system operational (maintenance) and to meet any currently identified m=
odifications (future development).  The summarized numbers are shown on the=
 attached cover sheet by each system with accompanying backup details.  The=
 details cover major functionalities of systems, magnitude of system (i.e. =
# of deals, # facilities) and other information that Greg Piper asked in th=
e meeting.  Also shown on the last column is an estimate of the impact on o=
ur users and customers, if the computer systems were no longer available.  =
 I look forward to discussing these issues with you on Monday, and please l=
et me know if you have any questions in the meantime. =20
