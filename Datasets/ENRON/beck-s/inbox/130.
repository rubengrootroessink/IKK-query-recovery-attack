All,

Due to the great work by Ron Nolte and the rest of Deal Clearing team, all deal clearing systems have been tested and will be migrated to production tonight.  The development team felt comfortable enough with the modifications and the testing that was done to migrate all systems to productions tonight.  Please let Ron or myself know if you encounter any problems.

Thanks,
Chris
