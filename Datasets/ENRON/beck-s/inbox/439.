Peggy, 
I need to get proxy rights (security) to do approvals for purchases of $5,000 made on work order c.005171.  Currently James Scribner is the sole approver for this work order.

We would also like to add Karen Snow (manager) to have approval rights.

Please let me know if you need any other information.

James,
This is only temporary, a new release of iBuyit will come out in July, which will allow the manager of the person that is ordering the equipment to approve the order.

Thanks,
Brian
