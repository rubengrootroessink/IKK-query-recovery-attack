These guys are new - system is ready for beta testing.  Offering an ASP solution for mid and back offices, including lots of reporting and credit.


May 3, 2001---A new middle and back office Application Service Provider (ASP) solution has been launched by Derigen Consulting. The Derigen Trade Center is designed to provide small and mid-sized trading and marketing operations an entry point into a comprehensive trading system. (5/4/2001) 
The product is said to provide a trading system that automates the workflow of trading operations in a secure, scalable and reliably environment for any energy trading organization. Derigen Trade Center provides trade capture, profit and loss reporting, position reporting, contract tracking and confirmation generation, settlement accounting, physical scheduling, and credit management functions. 
"We know that many of the smaller and mid-sized trading operations are not purchasing trading systems because they either don't want to make large capital investments in software or they don't want to have the IT responsibility of maintaining a mission critical application" said Robert Jacobs, CEO. "By providing an ASP solution to our clients, they no longer have to purchase expensive equipment and maintain extra IT staff to support it. All they need is an Internet connection and an up-to-date browser so that they can log into our secure site from anywhere over the Internet." 
"The Derigen Trade Center is based on mature Oracle and Java technology and capitalizes on the knowledge of Derigen Consulting's experience in creating energy trading systems for the past 20 years," said Jeffrey MacInnis, President of Derigen Consulting. "We've learned how to make reliable and secure systems that reflect our clients needs." 
Derigen is inviting companies to apply as candidates for the beta phase of the application where clients would get to use The Derigen Trade Center while helping to test for bugs and suggest customizations. The Derigen Trade Center is expected for final release of version 1.0 later this summer. Check the Derigen web site www.derigen.com for information on how to apply for the beta program.
