Hi Rick,
I'm in the process of planning the U.T. 2001 Fourth Year PPA Fall Lyceum series scheduled for every Wednesday in the fall.  As you know, this series brings to campus distinguished practitioners who address our 4th Year PPAs (the equivalent of college seniors) on current issues in accounting and current trends in business.  Last year, you delivered a presentation in this Lyceum on "Global Equity Markets."
I'd like to invite you back this year to make a presentation on Wednesday, September 12, from 4:00 to 5:15 p.m. (new time) in UTC 2.102A.   This presentation would be in addition to the Enron company presentation scheduled for Monday, September 10 at the same time and place.  Please let me know (1) if the Wednesday date is convenient for you, and (2) the topic you would like to discuss.  Also let me know if I can facilitate your presentation in any way.
Best wishes,
Rick
