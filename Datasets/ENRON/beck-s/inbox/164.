FYI, update below.

We are trying to get our language in so we at least have a chance to do your idea.

Muller (head of Corp. development) responded saying he will try to get the ideas in to the final agreement with Lance Schuler.  Anne Koehler and I said McMahon supported these ideas.

Basically trying to get the proper language at this (past the 11th hour) so Delainey's NewCo and a service company have a better idea of what the systems can be used for after NetCo.  I don't think the existing agreements actually prohibit it but it is not as clear as it should be for a service company or NewCo wholesale.

Thanks.

My suggestions and issues with the latest assignment and license agreement.

First, I have not seen the Contribution Agreement so I don't know the definition of affiliate.  Delainey's NewCo will be interested in that since the document licenses back all the applications to Enron and its affiliates.  Also, if an affiliate becomes a 3rd party due to sell down or sale, we need the ability to continue the sub license to the 3rd parties.

Second, section 2.2 says within 3 business days after Closing Date (as defined in Contribution Agreement) Assignor will deliver to Assignee one tangible copy of Source and Object Code and documentation.  I don't think that follows the plan to duplicate everything by the end of January or early February then get going our separate ways.  I am worried that Enron can't meet that 3 day demand since we are in a process together to copy everything.  Webb should comment on this.

Also, we need the ability to license the non-EOL applications to a third party so they can use them to offer and build a service company around them, including gas and power logistics and settlement.  This 3rd party would not trade against NetCo but would offer mid and back office services to trading companies.  This would actually benefit NetCo since this entity could improves scheduling and settlements in the industry.  Existing NetCo management would understand this.

Also, I think non-compete issues should be at the commercial level in the agreement, not the systems level so I would vote to remove in 3.1 (a) the language around sublicenses in the field of use with trading, etc. as we discussed today.  I am not sure what trading means for this or other documents.

Finally, in section 4.4, what are the prohibited commodities?

Thanks.

Greg:
Here is a copy of the template assignment and license agreement.   There is
also a version for Wind that splits out the two into an upfront license to
an Enron affiliate followed by an assignment to Wind subject to the
license.

Let me know if you need anything else on this front.

Roger
