Hi Sally - tough times indeed. Yes - we have provided a list of our key employees and Mike is on the list.

Let's talk soon - it would be good to catch up.

Fernley.

Tough times - and lots of work.  I know that you must be swamped, and that you had already been immersed in what was believed to be a tough budget process.  I am sure it is even tougher now!

Got a call from Melissa Becker today regarding retention.  On Rick's behalf, she was asking about London operations.  I assume that you have covered that.  Her specific question related to Mike.  I told her that you and I hadn't talked, and that my assumption was that you had this one covered.  Accurate?  


Take care. 

-Sally
