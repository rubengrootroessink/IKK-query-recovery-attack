Hi Sally,

I hope this message finds you well. Just a short note to let you know that I have settled into my workspace at EB 3089F. I am very excited about my summer internship with Enron, and when you have a free moment, let me know; I would like to stop by and say "hi". Feel free to contact me at (713) 853-4750 or at michelle.yee@enron.com with any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Have a great day,

Michelle
