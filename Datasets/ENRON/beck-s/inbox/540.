Sally/Greg,
 
I have been offered the opportunity by Giga (our IT research company) to have their head researcher come in to give an informal talk to our ENW leaders on what Giga see as major trends in IT in 2002. I've accepted this offer and will have him present at our ENW staff meeting on 8th November. I think it might be quite interesting, hope you do too.
 
Regards
