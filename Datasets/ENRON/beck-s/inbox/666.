Mark and Jim,
As part of pulling together Data Room for possible EBS sale, we are asked to come up with information regarding in-house developed software and labor cost. I would like to have your direction on the policy question whether to include Enfiber and Sabor Settlement systems.  Sabor Settlement system is using Unify Settlement as the foundation and Enfiber is patterned after EnPower which potentially could give some valuable competitive insight into our Trading.  Do you think these systems should be included in the EBS sales package?  As shown on the attachment, those systems are included at the present time.  Thank you.
(including PPCS/Dorado)
