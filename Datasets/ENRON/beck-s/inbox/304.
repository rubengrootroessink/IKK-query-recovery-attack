Suzanne  -- here is a summary of our headcount by group from 98 to 2001 (plan)

There is some verbage discussion about major business changes that have had an effect, and also we attached 2 graphs which show the Huge increase in the number of new deals (from the introduction of EOL in fall of 1999).  1000% for Gas and 500% for all products on an average basis, which would certainly account for a level of headcount growth, which we believe has been minimal in relation to the huge growth in transactions and commodities since 1999

Hopefully, this will help you answer the questions.  I am happy to discuss any other info we can provide or slice the info a different way, if necessary.  Just let me know.

Beth
