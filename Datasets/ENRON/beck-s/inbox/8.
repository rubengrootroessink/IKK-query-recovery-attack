I am currently scheduled to fly to Houston with the following itinerary:

	Arrive Houston - Sunday, Jan. 27 at 5:35 pm
	Depart Houston - Tuesday, Jan 29 at 1:55 pm

Laura is planning to remain in Houston on Monday & Tuesday as well.  Can you let me know what the schedule is for Monday?  Where should we plan to go and at what time?  

I will be in the office this morning until around 11:00 Calgary time.  Our UBS offer letters are finally ready, so I came in to handle the distribution to my employees.  You can page me this afternoon if you need to talk to me.
Peggy
