Sally - Lloyd Will and I would like to swing by and make a quick introduction.  Also....we would love to talk you out of a high level org chart of your organization.   

I work for Ozzie Pagan in EES and am tasked with getting the EES Retail Operation Center (ROC) off the ground.  My technology guys report in to Anthony Dayao (thru Mike Fink).  We have linked up with Lloyd Will in ENA so that we don't have to hire operators and re-create the functions he has already pioneered with the hourly and cash desks.  I'm also working with Evan Hughes and Murray O'Neal in Beth Apollo's group to define roles/interface points for DG and Load Curtailment products (on the billing/settlement side).  Finally, I'm working with the team that is attempting to define consolodated Risk Systems (Dayao/Accencur et all)

a)  could Lloyd and I get a high level org chart for your org so we recognize/understand/get to know your folks?

b)  Lloyd and I would like to come by for 10 minutes and introduce ourselves - we will attempt to schedule thru Christina

Regards
