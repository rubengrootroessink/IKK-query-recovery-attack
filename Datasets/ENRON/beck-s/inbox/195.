Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.  They have to be offered ou=
t to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.

All agreements remain with the Estate and will be managed by the estate.

I will check with Canada on their status but I presume its the same.

Subject:=09IT & Back Office Service Agreements

Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office=
 Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the e=
state's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment onc=
e a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate=
.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these=
 services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser=
vices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has n=
o way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enro=
n for everything from email, internet, network services and office applicat=
ions as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are c=
oncerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in =
Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastruc=
ture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support =
services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy=
stem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our =
Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support=
 their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications =
into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal w=
as to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  =
Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it=
 may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges=
t that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on =
the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro=
m one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee=
n the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog=
ether a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

The AEP and Bridgeline deals must be investigated.  There is no way the est=
ate can support a production environment.  I will be reviewing the contract=
s to determine our obligations and possible alternatives.

Subject:=09Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary



Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by =
Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books=
, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some co=
de changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens=
ure the applications still talk to each other.=20
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio=
ns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app=
lications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional perm=
utations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degr=
ee.=20
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin=
g their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise =
that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio=
n system level before the enterprise integration test starts.=20
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point).=20
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es=
tate and New Co.=20
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex=
ecution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to=
 support go live to production.=20
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve=
rsion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integrat=
ion Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too=
 tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility.=20
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co=
nversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical pa=
th for New Co.=20


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi=
ng first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down=
 dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and fina=
ncial on Jan 20.=20
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A=
EP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and=
 HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need=
 to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w=
e're in synch.=20
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single l=
icense of Unify.=20
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for coun=
terparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must qu=
ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin=
g hard coded reference id risks.=20
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these =
potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi=
red to support day one trading.=20
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline cons=
iderations. The time window will be very small.=20


Core Conversion Team =20
1) Steve Stock - Applications
2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure
3) Ziyong Wei
4) Steve Nat
5) Dave Nommensen
6) Ken Harmon
7) John Warner
8) Bob Ward
....

1) Jeff Johnson
2) Iain Greig
3) Aftab Saleem
4) Terry Sanvido
5) Regan Smith

Program Coordination=20
1) Jane Henry
2) Steve Simpson

Next Steps For Integration Test Team
1) Due 12/20. Define integration test approach and id test script and expec=
ted results templates. Owner: Aftab Saleem / Regan Smith
2) Due Jan 3. Application system flow diagram at appropriate granularity fo=
r communicating flow on integration test for core systems. Owner: Terry San=
vido / Steve Simpson
3) Due 12/20. Identify list of core systems for test purposes. Identify key=
 IT owner and key business owner and respresentative for integration test. =
Owner: Iain Greig.=20
4) Due 12/21. Define integration test workplan for integration test plannin=
g and execution for both Estate and New Co. Owner: Jeff Johnson
5) Ongoing. Participation in daily program management coordination meeting =

6) Due 12/21. Organize meeting with key users and IT contacts to communciat=
e foundation assumptions, context, team and approach for integration test. =
Develop first cut at sample trade transaction set. Owner: Iain Greig / Afta=
b Saleem.=20
7) Completed. Contact Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Bob Superty, Brice Baxter to=
 communicate above and set up meeting to begin planning with them on the in=
tegration testing process. Owner: Jeff Johnson
8) Due 12/21.  Refine core system list with IT owners and Business owners f=
or integration test purposes. Owner: Iain Greig.=20
