RAC is responsible for updating the database, but they must get info communicated from the action item owners to know what to update.  Shona and I oversee that process.

The purpose of circulating to the reviewers is so that we have the most updated info, and we encourage more updates before the presentation to Causey and Buy next week.

I am not sure I see what is wrong with pushing these guys to get more updates in.

Certainly, we would communicate with any process owner BEFORE presenting to Sr management, if we feel that a major finding has been overlooked, in order to get a better understanding of the status, and why there has not been progress, as a final back stop to ensure that the wrong info is not communicated.

I think we are getting together late tomorrow.  Happy to discuss then.  
Beth

Who is responsible for status in the database - updating has not been done, access has not been widely circulated so therefore we are at risk of informing people that open items have not been closed when they have been.

Can we discuss

Sherri and I are in the process of putting together the quarterly update for the doorstep reviews.  Sherri is concentrating on ensuring the finding status is the most current.  Please coordinate with her (this week if possible) regarding the findings in your offices if you feel the status listed in the database is not the most updated.

Also, if you have an outstanding report for a review that has been completed, please send me a copy of the draft.

Thanks

Shona
