Hi Sally,

Attached is the approval letter from the National Council BOD for your
chapter's logo product sales at the upcoming convention.  Please let me know
if you have any questions after reading it.

Also, the 2002 National Convention Committee is contemplating allowing
chapter logo product sales on Thursday, April 25, 2002, the day before
convention.  A time for the sale hasn't been specified yet, but would
probably coincide with convention registration and check-in.  I need to know
ASAP if your chapter would be interested in doing this.

Take Care, Kathy Hoyt
              National Council Ways & Means VP
