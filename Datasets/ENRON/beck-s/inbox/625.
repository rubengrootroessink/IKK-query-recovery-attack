Risk Controls
Scoped out new Rho & Drift process with IT (1.5 months to completion)
New process will be web-based reconciliation of Infinity Rho & Drift and ERMS Rho & Drift.  Infinity numbers will be taken off the website Sheila is building and we will pull the ERMS numbers directly from ERMS
Models - completed testing of website (looks great)
Tested Options NYMEX reporting - testing didn't go as well as for the model website - we still need additional IT work
Building of Sch C web based tool put on hold to devote IT resources to Rho & Drift

Risk Analytics
New books and curves web based tool documented with IT
Started scoping exception reporting tools (enhancements to current tools as well as new tools) with IT
Started using the one fully functioning exception reporting tool (Post ID's not captured by RisktRAC - cleaned up all 47 missing Post ID's) - put daily process in place to use this tool
Took over the daily credit exception reporting from IT (used to be part of 830) - now there is no need for the 830 - 830 completely done away with!!

Merchant Assets
Recalculated 99, 2000, and 2001 SEC VAR for earnings restatement.

Other
Obtained 1 RAC IT resource from Steve Stock
