BP bids $25 million for Enron back office/IT assets
NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Oil major BP (quote from Yahoo! UK & Ireland: BP.L <http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BP.L&d=t>) has bid $25 million for a small portion of Enron Corp.'s (NYSE:ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>) assets, mainly back office functions and information technology systems, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 
Enron's full energy trading business is scheduled to be auctioned in a federal bankruptcy court on Jan. 10. 
``We're bidding for software, business processes, and license rights,'' the BP spokeswoman said. 
Once the world's leading energy trader, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, after questions around its financial dealings led to the company's collapse. 
BP may be interested in bidding for other Enron assets if the current auction process breaks down, the spokeswoman added.
