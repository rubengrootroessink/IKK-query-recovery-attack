I am in the process of developing a website for the Global Risk Operations group and wanted to take over the referenced URL.  It currently belongs to Sally Beck and she has agreed that my group can take it over.  I have been told that you, or Ed Ray, are the people to talk to about acquiring a URL.  Let me know what we need to do to accomplish that.

Thanks,
Chris Abel
