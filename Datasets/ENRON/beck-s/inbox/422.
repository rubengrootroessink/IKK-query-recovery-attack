Lexi Elliott forwarded me this message concerning the Lyceum date that Rick Joseph would like Rick Causey to speak at on Sept. 12th.  But we are confused as to what the first date of Sept. 10th is and what this engagement is concerning.

Please Help!  Is anyone already slotted to speak at this engagement?

Regards,

Kristin
