Hi Sally - I hear that the luncheon today was fun. I'm sorry to have missed it! Girls Inc. would love to have an Enron exec on their board and I wanted to see if that is something you are interested in doing. If so, I can get you detailed information about the board commitment, etc.
 
Let me know what you think. I'm working from home tomorrow (Wed.), but I am checking both voice mail and e-mail. Feel free to call me here, also - 713-524-2555. Thanks again for attending the lunch today.
 
Missy
