Sally
Considering the commercialization project and the changes you are instituting I suggest when you have the time to complete and submit the Birkman Questionnaire per the instructions.  I am of the opinion that we will see some significant differences and will identify some strenghts to build upon for the next adventure.

Respectfully

Tom Hopwood

1.  Log into the Web Questionnaire Area
        Web Site Address:  http://www.birkman.com/individuals

2.  Click the 'First Time Here' button.

3.  Enter the Company ID and Password provided below and click 'Submit':
        Corporate ID:  EXAD-54T6-000
        Password:  QDBDK-7781-PGGDR

4.  Choose a unique User Name and Password.  This allows you to return
    to this area to complete the questionnaire if you have to stop
    before you have completed the questionnaire, or if you get bumped
    from the Internet by a computer problem.  You can select any name
    and password -- similar to AOL or other on-line services.  It does
    not have to be your real name.

5.  Complete the Personal Information Form (PIF) and click 'Submit'

6.  Type the words 'I accept'.  This verifies that you have given your
    approval for your sponsoring company or any Birkman consultant
    authorized by your company to review your report.

7.  Complete the questionnaire in one session (approximately
    30-45 minutes).  If an interruption is unavoidable, carefully
    follow the on-screen instructions to restart the Questionnaire.
    The program will take you back to the Personal Information Form
    for you to review or edit.  Retype the words 'I accept' and the
    program will take you back to the last uncompleted question.
