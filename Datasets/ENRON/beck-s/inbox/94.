In order for the estate to determine possible future WARN obligations, it i=
s important that we have a predicted estimate of the number of employees th=
at may be identified as RIF, in the next 90 days (i.e.. between now and Apr=
il 14th).

This information is critical as it is part of a legal discussion on the est=
ate's future financial obligations and clearly WARN may affect those. If yo=
u're not sure of the exact numbers, then please give us the spread e.g. 150=
-250, and an approximate date when you think this RIF will occur.

Please let Robert know (and cc me & Kalen) the estimated numbers, dates and=
 BU's by close of business on Tuesday.

Thanks

Tim
