Sally -- Brian and I are putting some comments in the summary page  for you to review  -- give us until this afternoon, and hopefully you will be ok with sending.

I left a message for Suzanne Brown on Friday night saying that we would have it for her today, but have heard nothing more, so assume that this isn't that urgent from her standpoint.

Will copy you with the new version this afternoon

Sally, 
Attached is the updated of the headcount file I sent you on Friday.  I misunderstood the original request and provided December 31 plan for all four years.  I have now updated the file with December 31 actual headcount numbers for 1998 through 2000 and plan for 2001.  I have also updated the EGM numbers and inserted a summary tab.
If you have any questions, let me know.
Thanks,
Brian
