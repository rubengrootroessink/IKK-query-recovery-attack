A man flying in a hot air balloon realised that he was lost. He reduced hei=
ght and spotted a man below. He shouted down: 'Can you help me? I promised =
to meet my friend half an hour ago, but I don't know where I am.' The passe=
r-by shouted 'You are in a hot air balloon hovering 30 feet above a field. =
The field is located at 40 to 41 degrees latitude and 59 to 60 degrees long=
itude'. The balloonist thought for a few moments and replied: 'You must wor=
k in risk management.' 'Remarkable,' said the passer-by. 'How did you work =
that out?' 'Well,' answered the balloonist, 'everything you've told me is u=
ndoubtedly correct. However, I haven't the slightest clue what to make of i=
t and the fact is that I'm still lost.' The passer-by gave him a knowing lo=
ok and replied: 'Why didn't you tell me you were a trader?' The balloonist =
looked amazed and said: ' How did you work that out?' 'Simple,' replied the=
 passer-by. 'You don't know where you are or where you're going. You've mad=
e a promise that you've no idea how to keep and expected me to solve the pr=
oblem. Having done as you asked, you're in exactly the same situation as yo=
u were before we met, but now, somehow, the whole thing's my fault.'
