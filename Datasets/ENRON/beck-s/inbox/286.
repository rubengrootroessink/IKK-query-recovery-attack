Do you mind if I attend the Risk Management PRC   -- I really want to bring up the folks who are creating problems on a regular basis for Shona's team

Also wouldn't mind attending the Settlements one  -- just as a reference point for some of the GCP folks

Subject:	Preliminary Schedule & Attendee List for Mid Year PRC Meeting

The dates have been set for the Mid Year PRC pre-meetings (with exception of EGM & EIM) and Sally's final PRC meeting .  I have attached a preliminary listing of the meetings and their possible participants - most of these names are from last year's list.  Please check your pre-meeting list and make whatever additions/deletions that you see fit.  Additionally, if you have a major conflict with any of these dates, please let me know immediately.  Please return this back to me with your final attendee list - by Monday if possible.

Thanks for your assistance,
Patti x39106
