Enjoyed meeting with you this morning.

If in fact the UBS merger requires fewer than the 800 or so people currently slated in NetCo, I think it would be a good idea if a couple people from NEWCO could take a look at those people (especially from a risk management/scheduling perspective.)

Speak with you soon
