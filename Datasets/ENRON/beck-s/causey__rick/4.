The Following memo will be hand delivered to you in hard copy form on Tuesd=
ay=20
morning, Feb. 20.  We will enclose the pledge form and=20
an Enron matching gifts form for your convenience.




Our meeting with Bob May, Dean of the McCombs School of Business at=20
UT-Austin, was a great success.  We had 14 attendees who received an update=
=20
from Bob about the many great things going on in Austin, as well as=20
opportunities to participate in the =01&We=01,re Texas=018 capital campaign=
.

After Bob=01,s presentation, the 14 Enron officers met separately and were=
=20
extremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner=
=20
to the McCombs School.  This was evidenced by an expression of intent in=20
giving totaling about $175,000 from just the 14 people!

Here is what we propose and how it would work.

1. The UT Alumni at Enron would pledge $1 million over four years to the=20
McCombs School.  This would consist of $500,000 of gifts from employees and=
 a=20
matching $500,000 from Enron.

2. The matching program provided through the McCombs gift to the Business=
=20
School would match the $1 million.

3. The result would be a permanently endowed $2 million =01&Enron Chair=018=
 to=20
support =01&star quality=018 faculty for the school.  This will represent o=
ne of=20
the largest Faculty Chairs at the Business School.

A few additional details:

1. Each individual=01,s contribution will also be credited to their name (a=
long=20
with the Enron match) for recognition purposes in Business School=01,s Annu=
al=20
Report, President=01,s Associates, etc.  In other words, a $10,000 contribu=
tion=20
matched by Enron will be considered as a $20,000 contribution by that=20
individual for recognition purposes.

2. Enron has agreed to not count it=01,s match against an employee=01,s ann=
ual=20
matching gift limitation of $15,000, as long as the gift is coordinated in =
a=20
way that makes it a part of the =01&Enron Chair=018.

3. The gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the =01&=
We=01,re=20
Texas=018 campaign as long as that pledge is not supporting a separately na=
med=20
contribution.  Please let us know that this is your intent.

Please carefully consider this request.  I do not plan to finalize the pled=
ge=20
until I receive responses from enough officers to support this contribution=
. =20
We have about 40 officers of Enron who are UT alumni and with some=20
participation by each of us, we will achieve this level of gift.  Our plans=
=20
are to follow this up with a broader opportunity for all Enron employees th=
at=20
are UT alumni; however, the leadership of the group will determine our=20
success.

Thanks for your consideration and continuing support of The University of=
=20
Texas.
