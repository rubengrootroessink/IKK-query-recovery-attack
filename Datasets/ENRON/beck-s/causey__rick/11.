Please plan to attend the kick- off of the Process Leveraging and Reporting 
teams, two of the seven teams that I introduced at the conference in San 
Antonio.  This full-day meeting will begin at 8 am on Wednesday, October 18 
at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 2222 West Loop South.  This is an important next 
step in completing the SAP implementation and achieving the benefits that we 
identified before Project Apollo and Beyond began. 

The objectives of this meeting will be 1) to identify management's 
information needs and priorities related to the accounting and reporting 
processes and 2) to prioritize and focus the efforts of the Process 
Leveraging and Reporting teams based on management's needs and priorities.  
Therefore, it is very important for you to attend, to ensure that your BU's 
needs and priorities are considered in these projects.  I realize that this 
is a very busy time, but it will probably continue to be busy through yearend 
close.  If we can get started as soon as possible, it is my hope that we can 
complete the projects and see the results soon, possibly by the January close.

Attached is a list of questions and other information that you should 
assemble and bring with you to the meeting so that we can make 
better-informed decisions.  We will collect your completed information sheets 
to use for further analysis and follow-up after the meeting.  If you have 
questions in completing the pre-work items, please contact Jan Johnson at 
x33260. 

A preliminary agenda is also attached.   Please plan to attend the entire 
day, as individual segments of the agenda will not make sense without full 
participation

Please RSVP to Dortha Gray (x35903) by tomorrow at 2pm.  A continental 
breakfast and buffet lunch will be provided.  If you are unable to attend, 
let me know who will represent you.  Thanks for your help.
