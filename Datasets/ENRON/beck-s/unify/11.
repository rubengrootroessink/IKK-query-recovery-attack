Sally, 

Thanks again for the positive feedback. Members of your team were 
instrumental to the success -- specifically Jeff Sorensen, Bob Klein, Becky 
Ford and Melissa White.  I'm talking with Beth about the possibility that we 
might recognize key people on the team with some sort of 'project success' 
bonus. 


Below, I've attached an invitation to a meeting that we've scheduled for 
Wednesday. We will present plans for 5 immediate projects that we're 
proposing to address Unify issues. Let us know if you'd like to attend. Also, 
please forward names of anyone that should attend that we've missed. 

Thanks.
