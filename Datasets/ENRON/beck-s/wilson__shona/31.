Dear Vanessa,

I know our meeting to discuss putting trading offices on the web site keeps 
moving, but here is what we receive from London which represents Enron Europe 
information.  We should put this on the site.  I also have a list of all 
trading offices world-wide.  At some point, I'd like to merge the two.

Best regards

Shona

All

Please could you all have a look at the attached monthly report - it has 
changed format this month (as has the key).  Please could you update the 
colours, comments and staff numbers in your respective regions where relevant 
asap.  A final draft is due by the end of this week.

Many thanks for your assistance

Best regards

Rob
