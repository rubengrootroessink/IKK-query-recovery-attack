Dear Sally,

I may have already sent this to you.  It is a process flow for how we should 
structure, execute, and follow up findings.  Let me know if you have any 
changes.  I've already given it to Donna, Cassandra, and Lynn Bellinghausen 
as a draft.

Also, just to let you know, the schedule is still being revised.  The latest 
version is with Cassandra.  I'll send you a new copy once they've revised 
it.  It will then goto Lynn's group.

Best regards

Shona
