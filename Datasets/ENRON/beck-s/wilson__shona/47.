I'm in the process of putting together some slides for the presentation on 
the 7th.  In doing this, I was reviewing the global operations presentation 
and  noted on the global operations initiative slide one of the initiatives 
listed is "creation of due diligence checklist for acquisitions." I know 
Naomi Connell has put together the SOAP which her group in London uses for 
this purpose which might be useful.  

Naomi - could you send the three of us a copy of this document?

Thanks

Shona
