Dear Ms Beck 
Thank you for taking your time to interview me for the Enron MBA Excellence Scholarship today.  Through our conversation, I have learnt more about your firm and experienced firsthand how its corporate values are embodied in you and your colleagues.  Given a chance, I would also love to hear more about your area of work.  It sounds to me like a field that I am very interested in.  I am currently taking a second-year class on Derivatives and Risk Management.
I am still in the process of locating a summer job and would really appreciate it if you could give me some feedback on my interview performance.  It would be very helpful to me.
It was a pleasure meeting you and I hope you enjoyed your brief visit back to UT. 
Warm regards 
Soo Pang Tang
