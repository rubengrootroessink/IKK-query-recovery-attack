Andrea, Karen, Loftus, Roger and Sally, 
Thanks for taking the time to interview me for the Enron Excellence Scholarship.  The interviews were a welcome change of pace and I actually enjoyed them.  Hopefully, you all enjoyed them as well.
I hope that you each have a safe trip back to Houston. 
Thanks again for the opportunity, 
Chris Cashman
