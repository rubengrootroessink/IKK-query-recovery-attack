Hi Sally,

Am assuming you got the OU stickers for your new vehicle and that David has
already put them on by now.

I will be in Houston the end of this month (May 30- June 2) and would like
to take you to lunch if possible and get caught up on everything.  I have
also asked Mike McConnell to join us if possible. Hopefully the two of you
have a free day available for lunch and can coordinate a time and day. Let
me know if and when the two of you would be available and I will schedule
around your plans.

I guess Michelle, Clay and Blake will have been there for a week when I am
there.  I was sad to see George leave the recruiting side, as he really did
a good job of promoting Enron to both OU and my students. I know he will do
a great job at Enron OnLine.

Hope all is going well with your father and that you are not constantly
traveling around the world and being away from your family.

Look forward to hopefully seeing you later this month.
