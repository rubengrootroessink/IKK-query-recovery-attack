Sally,

Have you had a chance to look at UT presentation for Monday?  I will need to 
email final copy to Lexi by Monday morning (her flight is 2:00 PM) and she 
would like a cd for backup.  I can handle that.  She has supplied me with new 
dates for last page.  If you get a chance to review - just fax pages to me at 
713-345-8100.  If not, I can work on it monday morning.

Again, I am so happy for you.  It's such a BIG deal to be promoted to MD.  
Please share any thoughts you might have with me on how this affects my role 
as your assistant and what I can do to better assist you.  You know, this job 
that I have now with you is the job I have waited for all my life.  It is 
challenging, fast-paced, and has a lot of potential for growth.  You make me 
feel like I the work I am doing is important and valuable.   I have an 
enormous amount of respect for you as a person and of the work that you do 
and know that I am extremely lucky to have this job.  

Patti
