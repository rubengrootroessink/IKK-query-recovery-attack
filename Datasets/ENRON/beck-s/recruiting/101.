We will be meeting for dinner at Legends restaurant at 5:00pm with Ted 
Jacobs, Tim Rasnic, and some of the students from the JC Penney
Leadership and Energy Management program. Following the dinner, we will 
proceed to the presentation at the Oklahoma Memorial Union in 
the Scholars/ Associates room located on the third floor and the program will 
start at 8:00pm. Jody Crook will introduce the presentation and 
then Steve Venturatos who will talk about his career and how he has 
transitioned from Land man to an Enron director. I will facilitate the 
discussion 
and pass the questions to the team. A social will follow the discussion and 
last until approximately 10:00pm. I will have a rent car for the group and 
take everyone  to and from the dinner, presentation, airport, etc. I will be 
in the office all day today and until 11:00am tomorrow if anybody has any
questions or concerns. Thank you for your help.
