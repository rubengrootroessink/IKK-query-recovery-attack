I agree.  I will coordinate with Kristin (for the Associates) and make it 
happen.
Once I have a date in mind I will let you know.  The latest start date for 
interns is June 4, so I will try to schedule it for the last week in June or 
very early in July.

Thank you!

Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their 
assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback from 
the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it 
would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so 
that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums throughout 
the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer?  
It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will 
be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.
