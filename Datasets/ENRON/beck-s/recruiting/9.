Dear Ms Beck 
I have received the good news and really can't thank you enough for selecting me.  I feel deeply honored and this sum of money will go a long way to easing my financial burden.  My family in Singapore was overjoyed when they heard the news!
Sincerely, 
Soo Pang

Dear Ms Beck

Thank you for taking your time to interview me for the Enron MBA Excellence Scholarship today.  Through our conversation, I have learnt more about your firm and experienced firsthand how its corporate values are embodied in you and your colleagues.  Given a chance, I would also love to hear more about your area of work.  It sounds to me like a field that I am very interested in.  I am currently taking a second-year class on Derivatives and Risk Management.

I am still in the process of locating a summer job and would really appreciate it if you could give me some feedback on my interview performance.  It would be very helpful to me.

It was a pleasure meeting you and I hope you enjoyed your brief visit back to UT.

Warm regards 
Soo Pang Tang
