Whittney:

The internships are slated to last from 10 to 12 weeks.  If you are able to 
complete 10 weeks, there will not be a problem.  We actually had the same 
problem with candidates last year.  Please just indicate your date 
considerations on your offer letter so that HR knows you will not be here a 
full 12 weeks.  As long as we know in advance, there should not be a problem.

Thank you so much!

Lexi,
I have a concern regarding the summer internship position....
I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I
have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer
job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12
weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks.
The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents
a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the
offer if these circumstances were okay.  But I do understand otherwise. If
you could let me know as soon as possible I would appreciate it!!
Thanks so much.
Whittney Skinner
