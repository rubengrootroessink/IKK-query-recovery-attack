Jeffrey's/Josephine sounds excellent.  I could go for the decorating
thing--that would be fun for me....I still think somethign like a limo is in
order.  It may not be our personalities but I think Mother likes a big
to-do.

okay - I would advise this though:  Since we may all be spending $$ on a
trip on Nov. as well, I think we can be a bit judicious about what we do in
June.   I don't think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . I'll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well.

I tell you what might be nice:   Jeffrey's has a private dining area (think
called Josephine's house) - we had Crockett Int. Christmas there last year -
and Sally had some Enron doo there - I think we could decorate it a bit and
it would be quite nice.   -c.
