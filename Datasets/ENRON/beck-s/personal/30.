Hi Sally,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week's issue of Business Week has Enron in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,
Stephanie
