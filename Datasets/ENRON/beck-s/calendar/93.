This will be the first of a regular series of IT updates targeted specifically for Energy Operations.

As this is the first meeting, we will be presenting a consolidated list of projects, and each of Beth Perlman's directs will be invited to discuss their projects in more detail, and then we'll leave some time for discussion, and some feedback on the format of the meeting.

I'll arrange for lunch.

regards

Steve
