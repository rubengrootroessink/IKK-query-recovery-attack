Dwayne and Gary,

At the request of Brian Redmond, I have prepared and am forwarding to you a 
draft of an Amendment to the Purchase and Sale Agreement that will reflect 
the agreement that the HPL Bank Accounts will be retained by Enron after the 
closing and that AEP will set up its own new HPL accounts at its preferred 
banks after closing.   It is my understanding from Mary Perkins of Enron that 
the procedures set out in the amendment were agreed to by Jana Soward of 
AEP.    Please review the enclosed and let me know if you have any 
comments.    We would like to get this one issue resolved and out of the way 
as soon as possible.  Thanks and hope you both are doing well.
