Fran,

List below are some questions that HPL personnel are asking:

What will happen if I tell AEP I do not want an offer?

We have heard from pretty reliable sources that AEP only wants 60 to 75 
employees.  Do we know anything about this??

Can I post, even though I have only been in my current job less than one year?

What happens to my balance in the current pension plan (cash part)?

What happens to my options left to vest?

Will my time at Enron bridge to AEP for vacation and retirement?

Will Enron review all of the offers to make sure they are equivalent?

Who will decide if it is an equivalent offer?

If it is not an equivalent offer, how long before 1) I am severed from Enron, 
2) how long will I
be in the redeployment pool? 3). What will the severence package look like?  
4) When will 
severence be paid?

Let me know.  I'll keep gathering the questions.

thanks

bob
