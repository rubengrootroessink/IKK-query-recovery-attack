I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office.  
Tried to leave you a voice mail message, but no one in the office knew how to 
transfer my call into voice mail.  They were good about answering your phone, 
however! 

I will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 8:30.  If I miss 
you, I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back.  I will be 
in meetings with operations people from London and Sydney tomorrow, but can 
easily step out to talk with you.
