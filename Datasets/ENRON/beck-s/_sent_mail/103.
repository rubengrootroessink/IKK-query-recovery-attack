Subject: Presentation for the Management Conference

Enron Net Works has a 40 minute slot at the Management Conference.   I have 
roughly sketched out the following agenda:

Net Works Businesses  -  20 minutes (Greg/Louise)
The Fund - 10 minutes (Jeff McMahon)
Video - 10 minutes 

As a base for the presentation, please could you review (of course please 
write complete new ones if you want to) the slides incorporated in the 
presentation attached below (which was the last board presentation done by 
Greg) and send all updates to Jason by the end of play today.



Thanks

Louise

ps Please don't forget the slides for the budget too  which I would like 
tomorrow.
