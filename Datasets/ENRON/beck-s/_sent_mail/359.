This is my first day back from vacation.  We need to augement e:mail so that 
requests sent when someone is on vacation can be routed elsewhere if urgent. 

This is request is approved.  

Why are there so many different formats for granting systems access?  Some 
have an approval button, some don't.  You requested a return e:mail.  It 
seems as if each time I look at one of these it is different.  The status 
button and detail button below contain no information.
