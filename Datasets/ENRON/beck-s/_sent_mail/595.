The draft of the memo looks good.  However, your memo says that the memo will 
be sent to all US employees of ENA.  ENA by definition includes Canada and 
Mexico.  Therefore, please send the memo to all ENA employees, not just those 
in the US.  Several of those referenced in the memo as being promoted work in 
our Calgary office, so the memo should certainly be sent to those employees 
in Calgary.  I am at x35926 if you have any questions.
