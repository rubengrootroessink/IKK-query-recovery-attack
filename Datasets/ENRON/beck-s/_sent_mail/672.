I would love to visit with you about a rotation.  I plan on being on vacation 
next week, but I will be working between Christmas and New Years.  What are 
your plans?  With a PRC tomorrow (Tuesday, December 14) and the crunch of 
finishing a number of items before I go on vacation, it may be tough to get 
together this week.  So get back to me with your schedule.  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,
It looks like my Costa Rica deal is dead so I will be looking for a new 
rotation starting in late January.  Rick suggested I talk with you about 
possible rotations in commercial support.  Please let me know if you have 
some time when we could meet.
Thanks.
Jim
