I liked the new signs for the new hire network this morning, as opposed to 
the signs for new hire orientation.  Just wanted to let you know that I 
noticed the difference!  I will be curious to hear about changes to the 
content as well.  

Hope your are doing well.  We will have to have lunch after you get through 
January!  --Sally
