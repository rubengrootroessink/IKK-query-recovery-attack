I had the same reaction.  We didn't get much of a break between the January 
and February meeting!  Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for 
Feb?  And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?  I could certainly host 
if needed.  Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the 
girls about car safety?  I would be glad to call them and make arrangements 
if you let me know.  Any ideas on car care?  Seems like Joy Martin mentioned 
her husband as a possible "expert" there.  Or should we try to call Firestone 
or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?  I am headed to Calgary 
for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls 
before I leave.  

On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the 
girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  I would be glad to 
meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from 
Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.  I can get you this list 
if you need to meet with the committee before then.  It may be tough to get 
the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a 
slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?  

The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy 
tickets at the door ($4).  Problem is that SAT's are given that day.  Meagan 
is signed up to take them.  I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT 
that day?  If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay 
if Meagan misses.  If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work.  
Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she 
contacts them about this weekend's meeting.  They could check their schedules 
and then we could get a count.  I will also look into other possible dates 
and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.  

I will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.  --Sally

Yikes!? Just looked at schedule and realized ticktocker  meeting is next 
week, can that be?? I am snowed under today (Sunday), as  everyone is going 
in a different direction, Gary leaves town for a week in the  a.m.? Tomorrow 
I will see what I can pull together, and try to catch you  Monday pm or 
Tuesday am.? Abi is on nominating committee and says she will  sit down with 
me tomorrow and look at schedule, so those girls and both of us or  one of us 
( I am pretty free the rest of the week), can get together.? Talk  to you 
tomorrow. Linda
