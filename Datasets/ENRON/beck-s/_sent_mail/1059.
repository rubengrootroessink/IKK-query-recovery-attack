The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the 
DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and 
Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for 
trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 
22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official 
business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as 
long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.

Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December 
22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for 
December 22nd.  If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a 
preliminary and rough DPR on Tuesday, December 26th with the information that 
you provide.  For locations that will not calc and officialize books on 
Friday, December 22nd, you will still need to contact Chris to give him your 
best estimate of trading results.

Thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information 
for the worldwide trading organization.  I hope that all of you enjoy your 
holidays.
