In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic.

 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.
