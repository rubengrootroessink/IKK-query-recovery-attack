Thanks for the update.  I am forwarding your message to Beth Apollo.  She is 
the VP on my team that manages our Global Services, and this Executive Report 
Viewer falls in that arena.  She will be closer to this than I.  You may want 
to get her feedback as well.  --Sally

Subject: Update for Executive Report Viewer project

Sally,

I just want to give you an update on the Executive Report Viewer project in 
case you are not aware of the status. The development of the ERV project has 
been completed and delivered on schedule. The feedback from the demo was very 
positive. The application has been handed over for user acceptance test.

Thanks

Zhiyong
