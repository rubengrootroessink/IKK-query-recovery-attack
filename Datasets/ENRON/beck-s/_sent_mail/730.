This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples 
Energy Board this week.  Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive 
in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others 
recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).  We may be able 
to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal 
purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external 
marketing tools. --Sally
