I read the applications, letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane 
to Austin and in the hospital this weekend.  Below are my suggested seven 
appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board.  I made the selections based on 
their answers to the application questions, plus I attended to get a mix of 
male and female, commercial and merchant service analysts rotations, current 
operating company assignments, undergraduate schools, etc.

I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in the meeting today. 


Analyst  School  Current Rotation Rationale

Ilan Caplan  UT   CALME Structuring Both MSA and Commercial Analyst rotations

Erin Rice  Trinity   CALME Structuring Vocal; good to be part of the 
solution; female minority

Brian Hoskins  Vanderbilt  ENA Trading  I will trust Jeff Shankman on this one

Carrie Southard  Texas A&M  ENA - EOL  Current MSA rotation

Alejandro Veiga Rice   ESA - Venezula  Good ideas; diverse background

Courtney Votaw  Pepperdine  Corp. - PR  Adds interest to the mix with her 
rotation & background

Adrian Woolcock Rice   EES   Sounds mature; good ideas
