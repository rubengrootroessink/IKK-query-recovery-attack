Thanks for the update.  I want to send her some flowers at the house.  Can 
you let Patti know if she is headed home on Friday?  Thanks.  --Sally

GOOD NEWS!!!!!!!

Mary Solmonson had surgery this morning at Hermann Hospital;  her surgery 
went well.    It took about 2 hrs., 20 mins.    She's now in recovery and 
coming along nicely.

She will probably be able to go home tomorrow (Friday).

Will keep you posted.
