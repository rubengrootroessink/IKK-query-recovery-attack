I just spoke with Elyse Kalmans, my boss, and she wanted me to be sure that 
you have the UT MBA Excellence Awards dinner on your calendar. It is 
scheduled for September 7th at Jeffries (in the Josephine House) at 7 p.m. in 
Austin, TX. Though she will contact you with additional details after she 
returns in August from maternity leave, she wanted me to be sure to inform 
you of the date.

Regards,

Charla
