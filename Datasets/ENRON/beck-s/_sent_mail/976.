Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  I have the dubious 
honor of being here late enough on Friday night to have seen the arrival of 
the promotional memo via e:mail.  I will be in the London office next week 
and I believe that we have some time scheduled together.  I look forward to 
the chance to visit with you then.  --Sally
