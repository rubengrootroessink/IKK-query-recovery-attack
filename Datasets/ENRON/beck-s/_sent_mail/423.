Thanks for the note.   I'd love to do lunch when you have the time.  It will 
help me in serving Energy Ops.

That meeting was about my 13th of the day that began at 7:30, and that was 
day three of the week with that kind of scheduling.  I apologize if I seemed 
impatient in the meeting.  I know that you are working for the best interests 
of Energy Operations and  Enron.  By the end of the day I was probably 
looking for crisp, clear solutions to an issue that probably doesn't lend 
itself well to that.  

Why don't we set up a lunch so that you and I can have the opportunity to 
talk separate from immediate issues at hand?  I will have Patti get a date on 
the calendar.  --Sally

Dear Sally, 
I should have and I could have made a better job of trying to sell my idea at 
yesterday's meeting.   I'll be the first one to admit that all of my 
suggestions are not always the best alternative but,   I hope that you 
believe that I do have your best interests and Enron's best interests in mind 
every time that I make a suggestion.   
I hope to earn your trust as we continue to work together.
Sincerely, hgm
