Wes asked me to pull the above group together to discuss the who, and the 
mechanics of how, people from each of our respective EES groups move over to 
EWS as part of the reorganization underway.  It would probably be a good idea 
to bring copies of your most up-to-date org. charts (Wade, Wanda and Kalen).

I will have my assistant, Jennifer Bryan, contact your assistants to schedule 
a time that fits.  Wes indicated he would like to have this meeting Monday or 
Tuesday of next week.

If you have any questions, please do not hesistate to call.

Thanks

Wade
