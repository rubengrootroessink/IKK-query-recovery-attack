Thanks for the Pappa's gift certicate.  For a woman who can't remember the 
last time that she cooked dinner, this will come in very handy!  Thanks, too, 
for the beautiful flower arrangement that has graced my desk for the past two 
days.  I will take that home with me tonight and I will enjoy it during my 
upcoming days off.  

I hope that the Christmas holiday brings each of you the joy of the season -- 
and some rest, relaxation and time with family and friends.  Thanks for your 
enthusiasm in your role at Enron and for your continuing and tireless 
effort.  It is through working with each one of you that I find my job to be 
fun.  1999 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for Energy Operations - 
a direct result of your contributions.  I look forward to meeting new 
challenges in 2000 through continuing to work together.
