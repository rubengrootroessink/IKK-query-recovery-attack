Just a word of thanks for setting up the interviews last week.  I was 
thoroughly impressed with the groups and saw several areas which I would like 
to explore further.  I will be following up with Beth Apollo, Brenda Herod 
and Brent Price to explore opportunities in their areas.  Again, thanks for 
your kind gesture and even more so, thanks for meeting me at the suggestion 
of Liz Taylor.

Regards,
