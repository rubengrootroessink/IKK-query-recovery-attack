I will be thinking about you and Brenda over the weekend and know that you 
will both be glad for her to return home.  I have mentioned to you before, 
Hector, that an Enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.  That 
is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels 
patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If 
you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a 
more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to 
contact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a 
brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy 
meeting.  I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly 
welcome a conversation with you.  

I will be in the London office next week, so we will have to coordinate on 
merit increases from there.  I will be back in the office on Monday, January 
22.  -Sally

I saw Brenda last night and she was doing very well.   We expect that she 
will remain in NICU until approx. this afternoon and it is hoped that she 
will be able to come home on Monday.   As Frank has probably already told 
you, the Surgeon could only remove 50% of the tumor.   He believes it was 
benign and we'll have confirmation today.   
Brenda will need several MRI's and Gamma Knife therapy (radiation) 
treatments.   We don't know the particular demands of this therapy but, we do 
look forward to having it provide a long term solution.   
I anticipate at this point that I will need to work from home or stay in 
touch from home on Monday and that I will be able to return to your good 
company on Tuesday.    I remain available and in touch via my cell phone, 
pager and e-mail.   Please don't hesitate to call.    Working with you is a 
welcome distraction. 
Thank you very much for you support and prayers.   I look forward to seeing 
you soon.
