Thanks for your homework on this.  We will definitely take a look at these 
two places next week while we are in London.  Let us know what we need to do 
to schedule this.  I look forward to meeting you.  One of your earlier 
messages suggested meeting on Monday morning.  Monday is great, but we would 
have to make that an afternoon meeting.  Brent and I will be on the flight 
that leaves Houston at 7:00 PM on Sunday evening, arriving at Gatwick around 
10:00 AM.  By the time we clear customs, take the train, check in to the 
hotel and shower, we will not be in the office before 12:30 or 1:00.  Do you 
have a time available to meet with us that afternoon?   Thanks.  --Sally

I have two options available below. I have not seen these apartments, 
however, so would recommend that you both have a look when you arrive next 
week. Please let me know if you find these suitable. Neither of them are 
located in South Kensington or Chelsea but I think you will find that 
Kensington and Marylebone are also very nice, close to parks and high 
streets, etc.   Also, is Fernley the person from whom I should seek approval 
for costs of accommodation and per diems or is Houston picking up these 
charges?

Kensington High Street - We have a block of apartments here that offer
accommodation of a high standard. They will have a newly  refubished
spacious flat free with 3 bathrooms, 24 hour porterage, Mon-Fri maid
service, and an underground car parking space included.

Please however note that this flat will not be free until the 03rd or 04th
of April.

OR

Baker Street W1 - Spacious 3 bedroom flat in porteraged block close to the
station. This flat has been newly decorated and re-carpeted throughout. One
double bedroom with bathroom ensuite and 2 bedrooms with 2 single beds in
each. Fully equipped kitchen and comfortable lounge.


Regards
Tara
