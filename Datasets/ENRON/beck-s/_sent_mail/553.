FYI - This should make things easier in London as there will be one point 
person to focus on global.  I am not sure that her background will bring a 
lot to the table in the early stages, but she did seem sharp when I met with 
her last week.  This announcement did surprise me a bit, as when I last 
talked with Fernley he was not leaning in the direction of utilizing Tani in 
this role.  ---Sally
