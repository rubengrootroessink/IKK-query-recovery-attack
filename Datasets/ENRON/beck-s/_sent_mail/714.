I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note 
regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, 
I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our 
commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 
people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor 
meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and 
yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with 
our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and 
Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net 
Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key 
Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in 
this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more 
than anything else.  --Sally

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services  

My suggestion would be to add to more floor meetings to your schedule - one 
on the operations end of the 32nd floor and one on the 37th floor.  
     
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally
