reviews and have Richard Sage here from London to go over several things. =

Since our meeting a few weeks ago I have had time to reflect on our=20
discussions on the explosive growth within the ENA business sectors.   I am=
=20
in the process of narrowing down my options and plan to make a decision=20
within the next few weeks.  In reviewing my skill sets and how they align t=
o=20
ENA=01,s businesses, I feel I could contribute to your teams growth and=20
success. =20

I met with Jeff McMahon and Louise Kitchen and it appears that their=20
businesses are experiencing new or continued growth which will require seni=
or=20
operational management support and guidance.  I would like to meet with you=
=20
and discuss these businesses from your perspective, as well as any other=20
business sector you feel my skills would align.

Please let me know your availability during the week of September 11th to=
=20
discuss the points noted above.

Regards,
David
