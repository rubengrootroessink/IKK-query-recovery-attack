Barry,
Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.  A lot of people will be tied up 
all day Feb 29 at this offsite.  She would, however, like to set up time to 
meet with you in Houston on Wednesday, March 1.  Sally is available from 1:30 
- 5:00 in the afternoon.  Please let me know if there is a one hour slot that 
will work for you.

Thanks,
Patti Thompson x39106
(Sally's Assistant)
