Glad you enjoyed the game.   It was certainly a panoramic view from up 
there!  I am that you continue to be pleased with your decision to come to 
Enron, and I am  certainly glad that you are here.

I just wanted to say thanks for the Astros tickets.  My wife and I enjoyed 
seeing the ballpark and watching the game.  I am really enjoying my work here 
at Enron and am excited about the challenges ahead.  When someone asks me if 
I think I made the right decision to come to Enron, I say yes without 
hesitation.  Thanks again for the tickets, as well as all your support.

Bryce
