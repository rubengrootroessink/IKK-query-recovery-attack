thanks--would it be easier to read it to me over the phone so you don't have
to type it tomorrow?

Yes, you are nuts!  I can't believe that you already have so many
gingerbread houses made.  The cookie exchange was fun - fudge is definitely
the easy route on that one.

I will get the recipe from home tonight and will e:mail it to you tomorrow.

Hey--how was your weekend--fudge delivered?

Got my bake sale item done--an 18 layer cookie tower.  Have 9 houses baked
with 3 to go.

Now to show that I really have gone nuts--I thought I would cook breakfast
for the 2nd grade at school on Friday morning....can I have your breakfast
pizza recipe?  We all thought it was great and I think the kids will think
it is fun....

Thanks!

Cindy
