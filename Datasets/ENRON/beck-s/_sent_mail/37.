Is there anything that I can do to help you and Jo?  Tyler has school on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays, but my nanny is at home with him on the other days.  
Would it help for her to take Albert?  --Sally

Unfortunately she's developed pnuemonia - she's in Conroe Medical Center.

She's pretty stable - fluid on the longs.

Thanks for your concern, I'll keep you posted.
