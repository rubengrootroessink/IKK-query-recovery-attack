Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally
