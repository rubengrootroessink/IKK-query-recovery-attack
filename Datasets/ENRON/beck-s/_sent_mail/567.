Was it not January when we were back and forth and back and forth to 
London/Helsinki?  And despite the fact that the date sequence from London 
looks funny, it would seem that Nigel on the 17th of February is talking 
about beginning the process (actually debating the process) of background 
checks?

If they are still employed (presuming all but Ilkka are still on the payroll) 
then I believe this should be requested.  As a matter of principal it should 
have been done for all in the first place and there should be no reason why 
it could not be done now.  Admittedly the reasons will now be obvious for the 
request, we can simply tell those checked that it was overlooked originally.  
Relative to Ilkka, there is no harm in requesting it as well.  Presuming he 
won't consent then we can discuss further.

Subject: Background Checks

I have made contact with the security folks in Houston and been advised of 
what we need to do.  One obvious point is to understand the legal aspects of 
such a check.  I have now spoken to a Finnish lawyer who has advised that any 
employee background check (to include credit checks and bank checks) must 
have the prior written approval of the employee concerned and this would need 
to be provided to the source of the information before it is handed over.

I assume we need to re-think whether we want to go down this route given that 
this check process will now have a very visible profile in the Helsinki 
office.

What are your views?
