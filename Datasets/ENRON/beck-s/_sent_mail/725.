Is this going to be a shower?  If so, I would like to get my own gift for 
them, if that is okay.  Or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute 
to the gift basket?  What time on the 20th - I'd like to put that on my 
calendar.  Does Louise know if it is a boy or girl?  Thanks.  --Sally

Subject: Baby gift for Louise & Marcus

If you are interested in contributing toward a baby gift for Louise & Marcus 
please see me.  I will be getting a gift basket from Saks Fifth Avenue.  I 
will have a card at my desk for everybody to sign and I would like to collect 
the money by Wednesday, April 18th.  There will be cake and punch for them on 
Friday, April 20th to present the gift to them.  I will send a reminder 
closer to the date.  Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Tammie

P.S. Please forward this to anybody I may have missed on the distribution 
list that would like to contribute.
