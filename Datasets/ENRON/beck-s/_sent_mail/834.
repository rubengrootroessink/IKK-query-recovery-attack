Subject: Manual Wires

All,

Sheila will be on vacation next week, and we'll be looking for someone to 
sign any manual wires.  We have further reduced the amount, so it should only 
be 1-2/day.    Thank you very much for your help!  Ana Rizvi will most likely 
be the person calling for a signature.
