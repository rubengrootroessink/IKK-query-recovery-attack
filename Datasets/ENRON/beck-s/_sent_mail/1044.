Thanks for letting me know.  I am sure that you have communicated with the 
Portland risk group regarding this slip up.  What assurances have you gotten 
from them about their diligence in the future in officializing books?  Do you 
think that everyone there is on board and aware of how important this is?

I just wanted to let you know that the West Risk Management group did not 
officialize one of their calculations last night.  I have had calls from 
Credit & VAR.  The Interest Rate group was not affected because their new 
system caught the error and the were able to use yesterday's cash flows.  I 
officialized the book this morning and everyone is rerunning their 
applications.  I'll let you know if there is any other fall out.
