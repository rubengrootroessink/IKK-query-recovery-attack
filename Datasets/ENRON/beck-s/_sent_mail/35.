To my surprise, I was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge.  
The judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on 
Wednesday or perhaps on Thursday.  I will be back here working after trial 
hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the 
proceedings.  I will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is 
fulfilled!  

Enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days.  I sat by 
Mark Koenig in the jury assembly room today, and he too was chosen to serve 
on another jury.
