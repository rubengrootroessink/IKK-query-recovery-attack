I am forwarding a message from a Wellesley student which includes her 
resume.  Let's make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return 
visit in November.  I talked with her quite a bit before the presentation, 
and was impressed with her.  She has followed up with phone calls and this 
e:mail.  I am sending her some additional information on Enron at her request 
to help familiarize her with the company.  Her work experience to date has 
been with more traditional energy companies. --Sally

you again.

I understand that you must very busy now and I attach my resume to gain
more time to discuss how my background fits Enron's requirements and
business objectives.

I will call you at 4.30 pm today.

Thank you,
