All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great 
and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules 
next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want 
to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's 
letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting 
these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who 
the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes 
and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --Sally
