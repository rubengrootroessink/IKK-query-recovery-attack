Thanks for your note.  Between meetings today, I will construct a loose job 
description and e:mail that to you later today.  I realized after you left 
that we did not talk about compensation.  It would help me in creating this 
role with our HR group if I knew ballpark figures on compensation.  We have a 
good comp team that can research that for me, but a short cut would be to 
know from you what you are currently making and what you would be looking 
for  in making a move.  Feel free to call me or respond via e:mail.  My 
number is 713-853-5926.  --Sally

Dear Sally,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I enjoyed our
discussion greatly.  I am very interested in helping Enron construct and
implement standardized global risk management procedures.  I look forward to
hearing from you.

Best regards,

Shona Wilson
