Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving 
to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for 
the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our 
weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for 
Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I 
can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York 
office.  

It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn 
could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London 
office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some 
feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very 
early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to 
Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well 
organized and control minded.  Understands Enron's business.  Managing a 
group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that 
people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are 
a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her 
based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  

Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.  
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would 
definitely represent an Enron point of view.  They have two small daughters - 
she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost 
that way.  

This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you 
could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally
