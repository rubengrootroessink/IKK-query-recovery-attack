Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the 
notation is that information is being compiled?  My guess would be that the 
one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest 
number of transactions.  That means that the lion's share of the work is 
still to be done.  Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner?  
As I mentioned to you before, I would not hesitate enlisting Jeff Sorenson to 
do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done 
promptly.  Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent 
Price.  I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get his caught 
up.  

Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle for the 
RMT Confirmations?   Will we have some sort of report that we can send to 
Stephen each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he 
is comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date?

Stephen,
As a follow-up to my earlier voicemail message, the status of the RMT 
Confirmation Project is as follows:

Financial Gas:           RMT Confirmations complete through December 1999
   Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 2000
Financial Power:      RMT Confirmations complete through November 2000
Financial Weather
and Liquids:  Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 1999 and 2000
Financial FX:                       Laurel Adams is assessing the work to 
compile the data for 1999 and 2000

From this point forward, the RMT Confirmation will be prepared on a monthly 
basis for each commodity. 

As far as the Year End RMT Project, I spoke with Bob Bowen this morning as to 
the status.  What he told me was that he was supposed to receive a file 
containing the deal information of the deals involved.  This was per the 
meeting that he attended last week.  As of this morning he had not received 
anything He stated that he was expecting the file last week but never 
received any information.  He was going to follow-up with the appropriate 
individual.  I will give you an update in the morning to make sure that he 
has the data needed to complete the project.  

If you have any further questions, please call me at ext. 31771.

Kim Theriot
