Sally,

Please let Cynthia know that Sally is out of town recruiting today.  I did 
speak to someone in her office (I thought it was her assistant) and Bobbie 
Power a week or two ago to let them know that Sally would not be available on 
this date.  Sally does, however, want to be a part of this group, so please 
notify us for the next meeting.

Thanks,
Patti x39106
(Sally's assistant)
