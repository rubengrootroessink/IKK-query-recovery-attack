I am glad that you asked!  I will be happy to bring your things back for 
you.  Niki is finding a spot for me to occupy while I am there next week and 
she is coordinating my schedule, so we see one another quite a bit.  It will 
be easy to do this.  --Sally

Subject: Things From London

If your kind offer still stands, I have just thought of something I need from 
London.  I had ordered some beauty products from the salon in the Tonezone 
and they are now in (cleanser, toner and exfoliator).  If it's not too much 
trouble would you mind bring them back for me?  I will have them delivered to 
Niki Scott just in case.  They are already paid for.  If you do not get a 
chance, not to worry, I'll just have them shipped.

Thank you very much.  Have a safe trip.

Nicki
