The address list on the memo below contains the names of all ENA Energy 
Operations employees who worked in the offices in Houston, Denver and Calgary 
on January 1st to test our systems.   Does it work for you to copy and paste 
this for Cliff's note?  Let me know if it would be better to provide this to 
you in a different way.  Thanks.  --Sally

Subject: Thanks for January 1, 2000

I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the 
office on January 1, 2000.  I appreciate your willingness to devote part of 
your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.  

As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business 
will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in 
working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan 
for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this 
process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the 
office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as 
usual.  

I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to 
work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to 
all that we will accomplish in 2000.
