Flight is charter on Miami Air, leaving IAH at about 4:30PM on March 2 
(Thursday), and returning about 6:30 PM to IAH on March 6 (Monday).  

I do not plan on checking messages, so if something critical comes up, please 
leave me a message at the hotel.  We are there with the Klein High School 
Bearkadettes, in case you need to know that to get a message to me.
