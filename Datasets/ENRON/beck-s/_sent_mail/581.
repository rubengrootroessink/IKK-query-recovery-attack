Mike & Scott,

Sally asked me to forward this to you & wanted to know if there was any way 
possible you could attend. I apologize for the short notice, but with Sally 
going out of the country, things have been really hectic.   Sheila Glover 
will also be attending. 

Please let me know as soon as possible & I will let Paige know.

Thanks,
Patti

Enron Implementation Offsite
Doubletree Hotel - TBA 
Wednesday, February 16,2000

You are invited to an Enron Implementation Offsite to discuss FAS 133.  The 
session will focus on the development and enhancement of the 
post-implementation FAS 133 functional processes.  We will then further 
develop the implementation plan for the detailed development of these 
processes and systems requirements.  Your participation in this stage is 
vital, as the final process will impact all of us.  

Questions regarding content can be directed to Paige Grumulaitis at x36271 or 
Ron Baker at x35562.  Please RSVP to Donna Jones at x 33175 by Friday, 
February 11th so she may have an accurate count for seating and 
refreshments.  

We look forward to working with you at the Offsite.

Ron Baker & Paige Grumulaitis
