Was this memo just to inform me of this meeting, or did you cc me to invite 
me to the meeting?  I am not available on March 9th from 12:00 to 1:00.  Does 
this meeting pertain only to IT personnel?  If so, I will ignore this.  If 
you did want someone from my group to attend, let me know and I will ask an 
appropriate person to attend.  --Sally

Subject: Contractor Process Focus Groups

I would like to invite you all to a focus group to discuss the new contractor 
engage and renewal processes.  During this focus group we will run through 
the processes and each of you will have the opportunity to offer suggestions 
as to improvements.  After all focus groups are complete and all ideas are 
discussed I will finalise the process and have training sessions for all 
supervisors and Admin. Assistants.  You all are an integral part of the 
success of these processes and all input will be appreciated.  We will be 
meeting on Friday March 9, 2001 from 12:00-1:00 in 49C3.  Lunch will be 
provided.  Please e-mail me to let me know whether or not you will be 
attending.  I am looking forward to meeting you all and hearing your 
suggestions.  Thanks.
