I am not especially surprised that you and Kristin did not get a copy of this 
report.  My "assumption" in my message was wishful thinking and not 
conviction that the sign-off meeting between you and AA had occurred.

Sally,

Thank you for the copy.  Contrary to your assumption, this is the first 
Kristin or I have seen the draft.  I'm sure Kristin will discuss it with you 
and her displeasure with AA.  

Thanks,
Leslie

I hope that the two of you received a copy of this. Although Jennifer;s 
message doesn't mention it, I assume also that she reviewed the findings with 
you.

Attached are the results of our East Power review.  Although some of the 
identified areas for improvement are outside the responsibility of East 
Power, we wanted to bring these items to the attention of management for 
their consideration.  

There is no planned Monthly Audit Meeting to discuss this report as we have 
done in the past; therefore, if you have any questions or comments and would 
like to set up a meeting with either of us, please feel free to contact us. 

Thank you
