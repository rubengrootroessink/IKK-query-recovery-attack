Hope your long weekend was a good one, uneventful on Monday, at least.  Got 
your message last Friday.  It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested 
in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim 
Fallon.  The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.  May be 
the end of this week, may be next week.  I think it will still be good for 
you and Kristin to talk in person.  Kristin and Todd are both very qualified 
and you would love working with both.  Kristin's established working 
relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.  I don't want to 
lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same
 time.  So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.  

I got your message on housing/location in Houston.  I am headed out of the 
office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.  I 
will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some 
options on housing.
