I suspect that you meant to include Bob Hall, the VP that reports to me, on 
this mailing list.  His assistant (Heather Choate) is included in your 
mailing list.  The "Robert L Hall at ET&S" to whom this is addressed is not 
Bob Hall in Networks who reports to me.  You should address this to "Bob 
Hall" - if you do this the e:mail address should pop us as Bob M 
Hall/NA/Enron.   Thanks.  --Sally
