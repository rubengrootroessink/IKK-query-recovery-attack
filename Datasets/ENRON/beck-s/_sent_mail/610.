Thanks for forwarding mail to me.  I apologize for the inconvenience of 
this.  My current e:mail address is sally.beck@enron.com, as suggested within 
the past few months by the technology group that all addresses use the long 
name.   HOWEVER, my e:mail address prior to that was sbeck@ect.enron.com.  
That was printed on my business cards, many of which are still in circulation 
I am sure.  When ECT became ENA, I changed my e:mail address to drop the ect 
reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck.  So I can see why you 
would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated 
guess on the address or referencing my old card.  SInce there are at least 2 
sbeck's here, have you thought about adopting use of your long name address 
rather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between 
us?   That might help eliminate confusion going forward.
