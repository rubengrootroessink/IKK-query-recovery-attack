Lexi:  In our meeting last week, I thought that we handled both Greg and 
Ryan, and were comfortable with Round 1 interviews only (2 interviewers) with 
this disposition:  Greg as a keeper (wasn't he the one who worked in the 
career center?) and no to Ryan.  

I will be glad to do a phone interview this week with
