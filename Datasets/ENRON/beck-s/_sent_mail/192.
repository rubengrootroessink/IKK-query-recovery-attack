This request is approved.  Your request forms that you send still don't 
provide enough information in layman's terms so that I know what you are 
asking to be approved.  Are we working on this?

Greg Carraway is a member of my group.  Since Brad Diebner is no longer in 
Financial Settlements, I am trying to set up Greg with access to the terminal 
server so that he can use a laptop from home.  It is part of the inclement 
weather plan.  I didn't know the approval would go to you, otherwise I would 
have prompted you for the approval.

Thank you,
Becky

I can never tell from these things what they are asking to be approved.   
Since Gregory's address looks as if he is at Corp., just let me know who he 
is and what I am being asked to approve.  Please reply with history 
attached.  Thanks. --Sally
