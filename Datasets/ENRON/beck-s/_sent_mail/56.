The responsibility for granting access to the DPR and associated reports 
available through the Executive Viewer on line is being shifted from Scott 
Tholen's team to my operations team.   (This makes a lot of sense, since it 
is our group that prepares all of these reports.)  Fernley Dyson has 
requested access to this information via the Executive Viewer.  In insuring a 
tight distribution list for these reports, please let me know via return 
e:mail or voice mail (x35926) that you would like for Fernley to have access 
to the Enron-wide DPR.  Thanks.
