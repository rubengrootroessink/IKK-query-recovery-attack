My travel lately has not allowed time to interview.  Gretchen Jennings in HR 
is supposed to be setting up interviews with appropriate candidates for me.  
She has a stack of all of the resumes that either I have received or those 
that responded to the posting.  I hope to start interviewing next week, 
although I will only be in the office Monday through Wednesday.  Feel free to 
move forward with whatever you need to do.  I trust that I will have several 
good candidates to consider, and Patti is doing a great job, also.  I need to 
find out if she would like to  be considered for the fulltime position.
