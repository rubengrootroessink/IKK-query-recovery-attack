Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might 
interest you.  The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just 
accepted a job offer from me.  James and I worked together previously at a 
bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  When I asked if 
he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that 
we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very 
bright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at 
Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist 
role as she learned Enron and would then "earn" her way into managing special 
projects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate.  
If you are not interested or do not have a need, please pass this referral 
along to other HR groups.  

FYI - James will start work here on April 3.
