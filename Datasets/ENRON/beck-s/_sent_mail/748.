Does Vanessa know anything about this?  I know that we had a definite 
interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.  We shelved it at the 
time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In 
the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that Mary 
was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it 
with Brenda Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in 
Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for 
others.  --Sally

Sally,
I gather that Mary has taken extended leave.
Can you advise who might know anything about this system?

Thanks,
Richard

Mary,
Are you around - your voicemail message has said you were out for the day, 
for weeks.
We have a need for a CRM system, but not a very complicated one, and I 
thought that the one that Tony Mends demonstrated a couple of years ago might 
fit the bill. He tells me that it is in your area of responsibilities!

Thanks,
Richard
