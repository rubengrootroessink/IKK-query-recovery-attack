Subject: Junior Achievement & Enron

Cliff Baxter is representing Enron on the Board of Junior Achievement.  One 
of the programs that he would like to continue at Enron is the Job Shadow 
program.  This program entails a half-day commitment once per month beginning 
with the fall school semester.  The high school students are first given an 
overview of Enron and then a tour of the building.  The students then spend 
approximately 1-1/2 hours directly with individuals within specific 
departments.  Cliff would like to have as many departments as possible 
participate since this may be the only exposure these students have to the 
business world.

Please advise if you are willing to have your department participate, who 
your contact person is, and how many students that you would like to host 
each time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Susan
