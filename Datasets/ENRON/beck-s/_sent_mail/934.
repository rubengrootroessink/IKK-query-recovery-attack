Please check the dates for that OpRisk seminar in New York and put those on 
my calendar tentatively.  I got a message from Shona trying to schedule a 
trip to Mexico and she thought that the week of February 5th looked good.  I 
assume that she checked with you and that my calendar looked clear.  While I 
have not yet made a decision on attending the NY seminar, I do need to hold 
those dates.  I left Shona a message telling her that the week of February 19 
would be better.  --Sally
