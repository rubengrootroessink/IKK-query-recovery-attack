I am sure that you are enjoying your break from school.  It is always great 
to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front 
of you. 

No doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after 
graduation.  I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about 
your offer while you are going through that process.  Enron had a fantastic 
year in 2000, and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  We 
hope that you will be a part of that. 

My number at work is 713-853-5926.  Please feel free to call me any time.  If 
it is more convenient for you to talk during the evening or on the weekend, 
my home number is 281-370-8568.  Don't hesitate to call.
