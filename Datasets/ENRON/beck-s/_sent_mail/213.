Geynille,

Thanks for calling in list to me yesterday.  Sally is trying to juggle her 
calendar in order that she will be able to attend presentation on Sept. 28.  
Her plan at this point, is to attend dinner & presentation on 28th but not 
dinner on the 27th.  Unfortunately, her schedule will not allow her to be out 
on Thursday.  She was also wondering about details of dinner - said in the 
last meeting it had been discussed to possibly do a western theme - with 
jeans (?).  Is that still on?  If not, is dinner to be held at Stone Davis 
Hall?  Can I get the address of Stone Davis & address, phone, & fax for 
Wellesley Inn for Sally's itinerary.

Thanks,
Patti x39106

Please review the following attachments for details regarding the 
Presentation.  I have attached the Itinerary, along with details regarding 
the event.  We have changed the interview dates again.  The next possible 
dates to have the interviews are November 28th and 29th.  Anything after that 
would have been the last week of the semester in December or  in February.  I 
have attached the strategy also for your review.

Please don't hesitate to call me with questions.  I will be on the road and 
can be reached via my cell phone.
The number is 713-417-2236.

Thanks, Geynille
