Sally,
Theresa Brogan has been meeting with Kathleen Garcia Spicer under the 
TEAMLEADERSHIP Program.  Theresa and I are pleased with the progam.
I would like to request that Clara Carrington be added.  Clara is taking on 
many new responsibilites assuming the lead for the Rate & Currency Trading 
Desk and I think that this program would be of assistance in making that 
transition even more successful.

Okay?
Thanks. Sheila
