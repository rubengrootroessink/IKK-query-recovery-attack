Sally - I had a chance to meet with Norma Tidrow today.  Norma is currently 
the Corp. Secy. at Azurix.  I worked closely with her in the International 
business and have a very high regard for her work.  Norma's background is as 
a senior legal specialist.  She has advanced to a Director level at AZX.   I 
believe she would be a very strong candidate for the right job within Enron.  
She is a very quick learner, and her documentation and process-oriented 
skills are exceptional.  Pls. expect a call from her to discuss 
opportunities.  Thanks for your consideration!  Paula
