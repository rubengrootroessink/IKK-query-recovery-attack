Subject: CAO Staff Meeting

The CAO staff meeting tomorrow November 21 will be in 49C1 at 8:30.   This is 
a new location for this meeting. 

Many of you have said that this is not on your calendar.  It has been a year 
since we started these meeting and if it was placed on the calendar for 1 
year it has fallen off. 


Everyother week at 8:30 on Tuesday.   49C1
