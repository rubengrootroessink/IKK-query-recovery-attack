Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the 
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time 
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally
