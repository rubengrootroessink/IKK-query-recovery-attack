Have fun in Wharton -- remember that Hines BBQ is the best bet in town.  
Leave room for the pie!  Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a 
time for you or you and Chris to visit.  ( I will keep that date 
confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.)  --Sally

Yes, it's good to have my hubby back!   Am going to Wharton tomorrow to meet
with Trav - as far as we can tell, the Wharton County Tennis Assoc. is the
oldest in the state and I'm going to write an article about them.  Hope all
is well.  Hello to all!   Love, Cara
