Requesting update access for what?  (can't tell from this request what it is 
that you want me to approve) 

Is this request for Sheila Glover or Rebecca Ford?  (unclear) 

Next to Sheila's name is the word Trader.  Is this supposed to be her 
title?   She is not a trader.  She is a Business Controller.  

Can you provide some clarification so that I can act upon this?  Thanks for 
your earlier phone message, Leola.  This is still a bad process and the 
information is not sufficient to give an approval.
