Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea.  I would 
like to visit with you to understand what you mean by "operational issues".  
My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we 
have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that 
vary with need.  A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the 
appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting 
to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being 
covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum.

I think the daily IT issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing 
problems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues. 
I would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operational 
issues as well. 

I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday. Can the 
RAC people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues.

Thanks, Rick
