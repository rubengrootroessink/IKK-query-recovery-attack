Thought you might want to see what we are preparing for the DealBench team.  
This was our first third party auction.  Although we had some major technical 
issues (the site went down for over an hour between auctions), Sabre saved 
over $500,000 which hopefully made up for the down time.  My team did an 
excellent job calling the auction participants and reacting very quickly as 
the site was brought back up.  

Let me know if you have any questions.
Sheri
