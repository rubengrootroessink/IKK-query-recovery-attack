Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  Meagan called this afternoon 
to tell me the news.  I will perhaps get more details when I get home 
tonight.  I hope that Laura and the baby are doing well.  Let us know what we 
can do to help.  I am sure that Jackson is a proud brother.  We will be 
anxious to meet our newest neighbor.  --Sally
