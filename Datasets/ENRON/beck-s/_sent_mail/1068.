The Analyst/Associates Program plans to send the PRC reps a final listing of 
the PRC results by Tuesday, December 19th.  They asked that we not 
communicate results until after that date.  I did not write down all results 
from the meeting, so I would be glad to let you know, but would prefer to 
wait until I have written documentation of final results in front of me 
before doing so.  Both Remi and Don Black were able to add to my discussion 
around Erwin, so he was well respresented in the process.  I am scheduled to 
be out on vacation next week, but I will check e:mail messages from home and 
will get back with you via e:mail next week to let you know final results.   
Hope that you enjoy the holidays.  I will be back at work right after 
Christmas.  -Sally

I'm curious to know how did he do on Wednesday.  Any news?
Thanks.
