Janine,

When  is Beth's last day in London?  I need that date before I can proceed.  
I think it might be today, but I need to confirm that before I have 
everything switched over.

Can you please let me know when Beth will have her new Houston log-in set up 
and what it will be so that I can have her emails and H://drive tranferred 
over?

Thanks
Janine
