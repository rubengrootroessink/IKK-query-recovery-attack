I don't know Mog Hue.  Please return this request to the person who 
originated it so that the Manager section can be completed.  By including the 
manager's name, that will help me to identify who this person is, what job 
they perform and whether or not the request makes sense.  I have over 400 
people in my group, so without more detail on these requests it is not worth 
taking my time to approve these.  --Sally
