This makes great sense - glad to have you as a true ENA resource. 


Thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday.  Let me know how I 
can best support you as you make the changes that you outlined.  I was 
impressed with my brief glimpse of Jeff at yesterday's 5:30 meeting.  --Sally

Guys, in response to the offsite, Beth Perleman is now a dedicated ENA 
resource on the IT side of the business.  She will be joining the ENA 
Management Team of which you are all a part.  She will participate in the 
Friday Management Meeting to address IT issues and opportunities. On Friday 
May 18th, Beth will go over her management team and her available resources.  
At every Friday meeting, she will present the current project queue (with 
associated cost/capital budget and sponser) and the Management Team will set 
priorities and necessary incremental resources.  

Regards
Delainey
