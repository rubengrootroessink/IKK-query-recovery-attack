Technology is wonderful - I can log on here in the London office just as I do 
in Houston.  I feel very in touch.  Sounds like you have been busy - I think 
that the variety of items for the Sunday meeting sounds good.   Thanks for 
taking care of all of this.  

London is cold but sunny - so very nice.  I do love coming here - hope to 
make the trip once a quarter this year.  I will be back at home by Friday 
evening, so let me know if there is anything that I can do before the 
meeting.  Otherwise I will see you on Sunday. 

Too bad that Nancy doesn't want the input from  the girls on presentation.  I 
think that taking likes and dislikes would be good - no commitment to make 
changes that the girls' might suggest, but I think that it would be wonderful 
to have their input.  They are the honorees.  Oh, well .....as you say, this 
is volunteer work and probably not worth getting too worked up over the whole 
thing.  --Sally

Sally:? Hope all is well in London, it could not be more  "soupy", rainy or 
overcast than it has been here.? Sunday is shaping  up...Nancy at Elegant 
Accessories by Nancy has a presentation for us, but is  unable to give it due 
to market or show or something.? I will pick it up  from her and run through 
it on Sunday.? I am trying to get Debbie VanDyke  to do Habitat and the lady 
from Applause to come.? Have been working on  form for Nominations...The 
meeting is at Nancy Galante's house, I have spoken to  her about the girls 
listing favorite things from Sat. pm and she was (nicely)  opposed to that, 
as the girls really only get limited choices---oops.? She  did tell me, 
however, that three girls have already selected dresses...(are we  already 
behind?) and she will speak briefly on dresses and registration and ask  for 
questions.
At Mondays patroness meeting (which was pretty non-newsy), I  gave all Jr. 
moms a "heads-up"? that March meeting would be at dress  shop,or bridal shop, 
and that they would be invited, just for scheduling  purposes.
?
I have spoken with Barb Lindsey..a NCL member whose husband is  with Houston 
Police Dept.? He is realitivly cool, as far as a dad police  combo, but does 
have girl and boy twins in college, so he knows  teen-agers.? He is willing 
to talk to girls about what to do in case of  accident, when to leave your 
car, safety and so on...thought we could tie that  in with car maintenance 
meeting.
?
I will let you know as the Sunday plans progress, I am afraid  that this is 
going to be a "catch-all".? Know you are busy, no need to  respond, call 
Friday pm or Saturday if you have questions.
?
Linda
