I am looking forward to involvement with the NABA and the prospect of hiring 
some strong candidates.  If you want me for the photo shoot, February 23 
looks good.  I will be out of the office on March 2nd - two days of vacation 
on March 2 and 5 to chaperone Meagan's drill team to state competition in 
Dallas.  With 90 girls on the team, that should be fun but exhausting!  

It was great to see you and Grady last night at the rodeo.  Let's definitely 
plan on a ball game in April as a chance to catch up.  I just checked the 
calendar, and it looks like we are on for lunch on March 28!!  A few weeks 
away, but at least it is on the calendar!  If your schedule were to free up 
suddenly, just give me a call and I can see if I could change mine to have 
lunch sooner.  --Sally

Subject: NABA photo shoot

EES and Sally Beck's organization in EWS are joining forces to underwrite 
Enron's recruiting presence at the 30th Annual National Association of Black 
Accountants National Conference and Job Fair this August in Dallas, Texas.  
NABA is an professional organization of 100,000 African Americans in the 
fields of accounting, finance, consulting and IT.  

We are planning a photo shoot of a check presentation to the Executive 
Director of NABA, who is making a special trip to Houston for this purpose.  
The photo and caption will appear in the pre-conference NABA newsletter to 
its members (not a paid advertisement).  We would like to have Cindy, Sally, 
Wes, Ted and the representative from EES in the photo, if possible.  We also 
need to decide whose signature should appear on the mocked up check for the 
photo - what do you think?

We are checking on dates for the shoot now, and Debbie Nowak will be 
contacting you/your assistants to check for your availability.  (likely 
contenders are Feb 23 around mid-day and March 2)

We are excited about Enron's participation in this conference and look 
forward to some great hires.

Thanks,

Gwynn
