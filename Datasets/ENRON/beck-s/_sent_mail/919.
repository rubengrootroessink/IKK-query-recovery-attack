Thanks for your note.  Sorry that all we managed last week was a wave.  My 
last trip to London was March of 2000, so I certainly had a very full 
agenda.  Mike Jordan kept my schedule very full, but productive, and even 
lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings.  

Do stop by when you are in the office next week.  I should be in town all 
week.  --Sally

Hi Sally

Congratulations on your promotion!

I was hoping to congratulate you in person while you were in London - but you 
seemed really busy.  Every time you walked through our area I was on the 
phone!

Hope to catch up with you next week when I visit Houston.

Best wishes 

Amita
