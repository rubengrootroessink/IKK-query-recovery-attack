She will check with Dad and let you know?????  I don't quite get all of this 
either. 

Do you think that she might have been hoping that Dad would come up with a 
plan?  (Despite her comment that they were not "celebratory" about the 
occassion.)  Who knows...

Keep me posted - and please do me the favor of shaking me if I get like that 
too.  --Sally

Sally,

I talked to mother last night about the dinner idea---boy is she hard to
read on this--told her out idea about a dinner in town and that she might
want to invite cousins--told her we probably wanted to go ahead a reserve it
because June was a busy time---she said she'd talk to Dad and then let me
know!!!????!!!????

As an aside, Brigeda's school year will be extended a week--until 6/1
because of losing a week for the air quality testing--so am not sure if we
could have made the N.C. deal anyway....

If I get to be like Mom or Dad, smack me around, ok?

Cindy
