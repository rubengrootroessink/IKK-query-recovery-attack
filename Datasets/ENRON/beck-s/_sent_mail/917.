On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel i=
n=20
downtown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and=
=20
back office services we could offer to the commodity industry.  To complete=
 a=20
plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20
integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at=
=20
their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20

I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig=
n=20
session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t=
h=20
in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called =
a=20
DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos=
ed of=20
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you=
=20
have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20
regard this session as different from any working session you have previous=
ly=20
experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven=
=20
to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.

A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were=
=20
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=
e=20
DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=
=20
little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results=
=20
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=
=20
entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=
t=20
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =
=20
This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=
o=20
that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=
=20
these two days.

Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=
=20
and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=
=20
has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning=
=20
the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.

I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc=
e=20
for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00=
=20
p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone=
=20
else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to=
=20
take your place until you and I have discussed this.

I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo=
u=20
in Dallas!
