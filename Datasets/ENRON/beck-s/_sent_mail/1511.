The Associates PRC was completed on Monday, July 24.  As the PRC rep, I will 
communicate the final ranking from the PRC process to your supervisor.  I 
received a copy of the rankings from Charlene on Friday while I was on 
vacation.  I will be communicating the final rankings to each Associate's 
supervisor today.  It is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your 
performance review and the ranking.  In your case, I would guess that Jean 
and your new supervisor will have to work out which one (or both) will do 
your review.  --Sally

Sally,

I don't know whether you or Jean (or Paul?) should be doing the feedback 
meeting.  If you will be doing it, please respond with your earliest 
availability to conduct that meeting.  I am fairly open currently except for 
3pm-4pm Mon-Thurs.  

Thanks,
