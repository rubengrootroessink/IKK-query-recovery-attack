You are kind - and that's one of the things that I love about you!  I suppose 
that we should get serious about the dinner for Mom and Dad, since it is two 
months away.  I will be glad to handle invitations.  I will look for some 
this week and coordinate with Mom on final names and addresses.  Cara had 
sent an e:mail a few weeks ago with some detailed questions to answer.  I 
still have a copy of it, but haven't focused on it to date.  I will call you 
tonight and we can go through it and offer to Cara to follow up with 
Josephine's House if that would help her given her current charge at home.

I actually think you look young in those pictures--you are way too
critical!!!

Exactly!  Mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with Anna.  I could
easily be mistaken for her grandmother, I'm afraid.  I see pictures of
myself and wonder who that older person is?!?  --Sally
