It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.  I 
will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an 
on-going resource for operations in London.  If you are comfortable with my 
idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this 
week.  We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week.
