Glad you could make it yesterday.  I don't play (at least not in front of 
others), so I do look for golfers from time to time.  I will keep your number 
handy!

Sally, I really appreciate being able to play on your behalf in the 
tournament yesterday.  It was a very nice course and we had a great time.  
It's always nice to interact with your peers outside of work.  If you ever 
need an extra player again ... my clubs are in the car.

Thanks again.

Dave
