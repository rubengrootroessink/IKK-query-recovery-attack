What does "completed" mean?  My first request was to give me access to review 
all e-mail messages that Mary has received since March 1 through yesterday's 
date.  I asked if they could be transferred to my mail box to simplify my 
review process.  Has this been done?  I don't see any new messages that have 
been transferred from Mary's mail box to mine.  --Sally

Subject: Access to Mary Solmonson's e-mail

Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since 
March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All 
business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business 
unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following 
tasks:

1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming 
e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that 
I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle.   
Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete 
this review?

2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's 
e-mail box that states "I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being 
forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response."

3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to 
Vanessa Schulte's mail box. 

  Thanks in advance for your help on this matter.
