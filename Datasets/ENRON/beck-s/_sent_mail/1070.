I didn't get back from the meeting with Causey and Buy until just before 6:00 
today - not that the meeting was long - Rick Causey was just running late so 
we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting 
started.  I decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office 
dedication, so I did not call!  Enjoy your time off tomorrow and on Monday.  
My plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the 
week between Christmas and New Years.  I wouldn't recommend taking your time 
during your day off to call, but if you finish your Christmas shopping and do 
want to call, my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow.  Wish I 
could send you with a shopping list for me!!
