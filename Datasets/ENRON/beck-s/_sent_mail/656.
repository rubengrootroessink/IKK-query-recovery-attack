Did you get a copy of this?  It looks as if in September that our=20
intercompany balances were relatively low (EES and ENA), with an increase i=
n=20
October with Enron Europe.  Do you have details behind this?  Are EES=20
balances gas only, or gas and power?  How do we have imbalances with=20
ourselves?  What kind of reporting do you get from financial ops on a regul=
ar=20
basis that gives you the details behind this?  I am assuming that these=20
imbalances are created from commodity transactions, so that we would really=
=20
be closer to the details than would financial ops.  Is that a good=20
assumption?  --Sally=20

Please find attached the intercompany imbalance analysis for Enron Corp. an=
d=20
its subsidiaries for the accounting month of October 1999.

Please note that intercompany imbalances are extremely significant this=20
month. This is due primarily to various issues surrounding the London group=
's=20
first close on its new general ledger system.  The majority of these=20
imbalances are expected to be resolved with November close and the remainin=
g=20
imbalances should be cleared by year-end.  Because of the abnormal spike in=
=20
all trends due to these issues, we have elected to keep the graphs in the=
=20
same scale as previous months rather than scale to fit this month=01,s numb=
ers.=20
This continues to allow for legibility of the other months=01, and other=20
business units=01, trends.

Please call me at extension 37659 if you have any questions.
