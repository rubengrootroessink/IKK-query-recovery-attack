Looks as if this date will work for Mike McConnell and his wife, too.  I 
thought that I might also invite Ted Jacobs if he plans to be in  Houston 
that weekend.  Do you have an e:mail address for him?  Thanks.

Subject: Re: Summer Cookout  

The 30th of July works great for me.  The interns should still be around and 
it would be a great way to end the summer.  I will put
a list together of recent graduates and send that to you.  I will also 
contact Shelly Jones and get a list of those starting in July.  I think 
it would be a good idea to include  friends/dates.  There are not that many 
of us Sooners here and we have met  most of our friends 
at Enron.  Let me know of anything else I can do.

Thanks Again,
Jody
