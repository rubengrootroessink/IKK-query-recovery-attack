Subject: SAP / Global/ Unify replication problem on Friday June 30th


On Friday June 30th, Unify's production performance was impacted by a large 
volume (30k) of replication/ configuration transactions from SAP.
The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected Enron's business 
throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and 
missed nominations.

Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again:
Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for 
Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss 
new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.
SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 
'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak 
time.
