Greg, the communication and interaction between the Logistics and NomLogic 
teams during the product development phase has gone extremely well. Both 
Carrie and I are committed to making sure this continues through the internal 
testing and beta release with the customers. I have a strong group of 
experienced Logistics schedulers working closely with the NomLogic team and 
expect that their involvement will help us identify as many issues as 
possible before the customers get to see the product. 

Please feel free to call if you have any additional questions or concerns, 
thanks - Bob Superty (x30957)

Thanks for the input in yesterday's meeting.

As a follow-up, I wanted to confirm that Carrie and Bob (as module manager 
and mid/back office representative) will be working closely together over the 
next month or so to have NomLogic technology, business rules, legal structure 
and a system test complete before the outside customers arrive for the beta 
tests.

Thanks.
