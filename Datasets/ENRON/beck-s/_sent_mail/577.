Wanda

I have just spoken with Barry about arranging a visit for him to Houston.  He 
mentioned the week of 28 February being good for him.  I hope this will suit 
you and wonder if it will be possible to arrange any meetings with him on the 
Tuesday 29 Feb and Wednesday  1 March? I will book for him to arrive on the 
Monday and leave Houston on the Thursday.

Kind regards
Clare.
