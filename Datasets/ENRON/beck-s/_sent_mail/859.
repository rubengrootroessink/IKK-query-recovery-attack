Wouldn't it be the four of us?  - You, me, Cara and baby to be named?  Good 
idea.  I'll call you this weekend.  Sorry didn't reply earlier - was in 
Calgary. --Sally

I've just looked at some beautiful photos--hand colored done by our project
manager's wife--she is a professional photographer.  How would you all feel
about having a really good, artistic picture done of the three of us for a
gift to Mom and Dad?  Let me know--we could do it while Sally is here for
the shower....
