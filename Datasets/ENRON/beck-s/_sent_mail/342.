Sally is out of the office today, but checking her calendar for Wed or Thurs 
of that week, it looks like Wednesday, Aug 9 would be a good day for her.  
She or I will confirm that date with you when she returns to the office on 
Monday.

Rick and Sally:

I am currently trying to set the date for a UT Intern Happy Hour.  Would 
Monday, August 7 work for you?

Thank you!

I am unable to attend August 4.  Friday is probably not a good day to have a 
happy hour since a lot of people make other plans.  I would suggest August 7 
or 8 - at this point I am available both days.

I am currently working to reserve a room at Ninfa's.  The dates I am 
currently trying for are: August 4 or August 7.  Is either day better for you?

Any plans for a UT intern/analyst happy hour before the intern's last day?
