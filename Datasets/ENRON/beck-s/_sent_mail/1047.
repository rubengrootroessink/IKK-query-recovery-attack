Can you put a referenced as of date on the spreadsheet itself?  If you print 
the spreadsheet for reference after receiving the e:mail, there is no as of 
date that appears on the print out of the spreadsheet.  Your attachment 
includes the date as the name of the file, but this does not appear when you 
simply print our the attached spreadsheet.  Thanks.  --Sally Beck
