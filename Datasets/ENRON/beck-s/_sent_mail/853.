I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better the 
cost too much by looking around.  Cara, would you like for me to hold the 
reservation on my credit card?  Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting 
yours, so I would be glad to do so.  

I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don't 
necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.  This is a good year for 
me to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversary 
party, David and I  were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy and 
Richard covered a lot of the costs.  Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a good 
year at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward 
to good use.  --Sally

Ok--being the one that probably doesn't really have the dollars to do this I
would still say "yes"----will try to make room on a credit card for
this--have until June so I think it is ok.....

Will call the picture lady tomorrow and see what the price would be for
that--will email you the results.

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed "17" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara
