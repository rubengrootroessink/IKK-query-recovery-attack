Thanks, Sarah!  I was so focused on getting that in the mail that I obviously 
didn't proof the content very well.  Thanks for looking out for me!  --Sally

Sally,
 I added league hours to your hours report for you as you attended all
patroness meetings (Oct and Nov) and the Holiday Tea.  I added 5 hours for
those meetings for a total 12 for this qtr. If it should be more, let me
know.  I wasn't there in Oct.  That makes your year to date league 33.5.
Thanks for  all your hard work with the girls.
Hours/Awards,
Sarah Marshall
