Enron Europe Ltd. has played a vital role over the last few years in the=20
global expansion of  Enron=01,s  business.  Now, EEL is taking a strategic =
role=20
in setting the standards for global operational performance.  Accordingly,=
=20
EEL will work closely with Global Risk Management Operations to assess our=

We are very pleased to announce that effective April 10, 2000, Brent Price,=

throughout all of our operations.  He will work actively with the operation=
s=20

(FERNLEY =01) This would be a good spot to perhaps make a reference to the=
