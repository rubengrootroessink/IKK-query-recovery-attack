Late Jan sounds great.  Meagan does have a couple of big things on the 
weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big dance 
that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter 
party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a row, 
January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work well (and 
I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for you?  And do 
you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably works better 
for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday 
afternoon!!

Hi...

Talked to the little mother-to-be.  She said a shower would be grand.  She
has some big presentation mid-January.  How does late January sound to you.
Should we set a date now?  Am I turning into Mother?

Cindy
