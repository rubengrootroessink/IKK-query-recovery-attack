It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I appreciated 
your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.  I am sure 
that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody and Nate 
participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have done a 
great job in changing and promoting the program.  

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer 
interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware of 
the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully with a 
change in our strategy! 

If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We 
will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets may 
already be sold.  

On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of 
compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school 
shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get 
merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know 
-- we can probably place a few orders through you!
