Thanks for the update.  Good to know that the current due date still looks 
likely - always give or take a week or so!  I have just returned from drill 
team contest in Dallas - lots of fun and the Bearkadettes did great!  First 
place in their division (super sized schools), best in category for all four 
team dances, first place solo, first place duet, first place officers dance, 
and two special judges awards - one for a perfect score of 100 from all three 
judges on one team routine (which Meagan was in) and one for creativity and 
presentation.  

Keep me posted on baby news!! --Sally

Hi - Had my doctor's appt. this morning.   Dr. Mingea went ahead and did a
pelvic exam.  She could feel the baby's head, so she has successfully
dropped into the pelvis.  Cervix has not softened any, however, so the due
date still looks pretty good.  Just keeping you posted!    -c.
