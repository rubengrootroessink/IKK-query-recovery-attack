I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet.  You had 
included my name, and I did not put in a preliminary rank.  Brent Price's 
name is missing.  I would put him in the Excellent category at this time.  
Let me know if you need anything else.  It is possible that I may change a 
few of the preliminary rankings as I get more information from my direct 
reports who supervise certain directors.   I will let you know.  --Sally

Sally,

Attached is a spreadsheet with pull down boxes allowing you to assign 
preliminary rankings of your people.  If you have any questions please let me 
know.

Please assign preliminary ratings and return the spreadsheet to me by close 
of business Wednesday, November 29th.

Thanks,
Kim
