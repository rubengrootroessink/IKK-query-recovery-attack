Per my earlier e:mail message, I am forwarding to you the draft of the report 
on the operations/controls review of Singapore.  (It is an attachment to the 
message from Scott Earnest to me.)  The most current drafts of the reports on 
Oslo and  Frankfurt were compiled by the AA team in London.  Nick Swingler is 
apparently out on vacation this week.  I have asked AA personnel from Houston 
to coordinate with their London office to get you a copy of those two draft 
reports.  Given the time difference, you should receive thos reports via 
e:mail from AA on Wednesday.  --Sally
