I took the Executive Influence and Impact program in May 1999 and also took 
the follow up Communications program in 2000.  Is this another program that 
you are contacting me about, or would Enron like for us to repeat the 
program?  Hopefully HR records indicate that I completed the two programs in 
1999 and 2000.  Just let me know if I need to sign up for anything.  --Sally
