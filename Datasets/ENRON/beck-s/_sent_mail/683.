BABY ALERT!

Mike and Gill Jordan have a new baby daughter called Emma who was born at 
about 11am today.
She weighs 7 pounds 8 oz and they are all well and happy.

Well done to Gill - and Mike of course for your part in the proceedings - and 
congratulations to the Jordan family!

PS if I have missed anyone, please pass on the good news!
