Thanks for your help on getting Chris Hanz lined up to talk with Chris 
Hoyle.  If you don't get anyone to talk with John Rodgers, don't worry about 
it.  I may have someone that could talk with him from the EnronOnline team.

Sally,

I have arranged for Chris Hoyle to meet with Chris Hanz, Sr. Director 
Business Analyst at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow in EB1812.  Lexi is going to bring 
Chris to the 18th floor and pick him up at 11:30.  I am still trying to 
arrange for someone to meet with John as well and as soon as I have that 
information I will let you know.  I am having some problems due to the fact 
that we have one of our office visit events taking place during that time.

Thanks,
Ashley

This will work well, assuming Steve and Chris are available.  Hopefully, Lexi 
will have their resumes for you tomorrow.   Thanks for your help.  I will be 
in touch on details.
