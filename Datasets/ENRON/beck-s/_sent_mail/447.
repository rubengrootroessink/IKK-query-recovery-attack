Subject: Summer Analyst Information Session

THANK YOU .... to those of you who attended the summer analyst info session.  
For those of you who couldn't attend,  the information will be delivered to 
you via inter-office mail.  

As we discussed yesterday, our goal is to ensure a quality summer for all of 
our interns.  To continue in those efforts we encourage you to schedule a 
meeting with your intern during his/her first week to:
 explain group/department initiatives
establish roles/responsibilities and define performance expectations

ALSO, PLEASE NOTE:  interns starting on Monday, May 22 will be available to 
report directly to their supervisors following lunch.  Due to availability 
and limited space, PC training will take place later in the week.  Interns 
that start on June 5 will report to their supervisors that afternoon 
following PC training. 

Thank you again for your time and your support.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions.
