Patti:  I left Cindy a message last week about attending the NCL convention 
later in April.  She says that Ken and Jeff encourage board membership in 
community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of 
that.  So according to Cindy, the days at convention will not be counted as 
vacation days.  I guess I would view this as if I were in LA on business, so 
no notation on time out of the office.  Thanks.

Subject: Community Board Position

Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of 
board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful 
to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year 
that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of 
National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization. 

We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 
through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local 
nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics 
volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with 
children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It 
is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a 
focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only 
on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will 
remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.
