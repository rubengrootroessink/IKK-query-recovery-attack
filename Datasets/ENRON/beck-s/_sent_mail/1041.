I have always worked right up until my due date.  There is a lot of waiting 
and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the 
office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my 
last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' 
Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of 
days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I 
was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week 
late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 
18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of 
course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was 
out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably 
depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have 
everything at the house ready.  I still had a lot of energy at the end of my 
pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed 
working as long as I could.  

Definitely make a point of you and Chris going to some movies at the theater 
before the baby comes.  You won't be able to do that for quite a while 
afterwards!!

Hi, Sal.  It's kind of a drag coming back to work after Christmas, huh?   I
am wearing my new denim maternity shirt today!   Thanks to my sister, Sally,
I have a decent maternity wardrobe to carry me through several more months!
On that note, I have a question for you:  I am trying to schedule the next
few months and wondered what your advice is on working up until the due
date.  Would you advise working up till the date?   Or taking a couple weeks
off before?    -Cara
