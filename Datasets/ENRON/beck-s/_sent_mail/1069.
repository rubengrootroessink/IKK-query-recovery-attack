FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find 
this note interesting.  Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several 
schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that 
lure students to join them.    Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of 
time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.  See note from Lexi 
below.

Dear OU Team:

I just received notice from Jon Beck that he is declining our offer.  He has 
accepted with E&Y in Dallas.  They have offered to pay for his Master's of 
Accounting at the University of Virginia BEFORE he begins working for them.  
This is truly a wonderful opportunity for him, but I know how disappointed 
many of us are to see that he will not be joining the Enron team.
