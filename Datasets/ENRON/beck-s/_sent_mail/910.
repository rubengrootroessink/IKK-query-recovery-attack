Congratulations to you and Lanettte on the birth of Nicole Mackenzie.  What a 
pretty name!  I was in London last week and got the news while I was there.  

I hope that everyone in your household is doing well, although I know that 
you are probably a bit sleep deprived.  That will pass - although with your 
first one that is really hard to believe.  Please stop by as soon as you have 
pictures.  I would love to see them.  --Sally
