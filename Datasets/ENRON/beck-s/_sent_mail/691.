FYI - after discussions with appropriate groups I will let you know of any 
impacts and/or issues.

Thanks,

All,

Starting with the April accounting month Corp is cutting a day off of our 
close process as part of Project Sunrise.  This means that we will have only 
five days to get all activity booked.  I will be calling a meeting for later 
this week or early next week to discuss any issues that may arise from this 
and future implications of Project Sunrise.  Feel free to call if you have 
any questions.

      Greg x35399
