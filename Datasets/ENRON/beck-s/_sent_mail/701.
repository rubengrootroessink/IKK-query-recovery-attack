This is the note that I mentioned that I sent to Philippe today about space 
in the new building.  You can take up the cause with Philippe when he 
returns.  I am meeting with Tammy Shepperd at 1:30 tomorrow on some space 
planning details.  I will tell her that Sheri's group should be located with 
yours, and by that time I should be able to tell her that Sheri's group will 
be reporting to you.  

I will call you tomorrow after I talk with Sheri - should be by 11:00 am.  
--Sally

According to Tammy Shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the 
new building, a location for Sheri Thomas' Product Control Group remains up 
in the air.  Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to 
discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with 
their groups.  My understanding is that you have designated a certain number 
of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not 
included in that count.  Can we get together when you return to the office 
next week and discuss floor space?  Thanks.  --Sally
