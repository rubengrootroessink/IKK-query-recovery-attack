Mike,
Please provide a the Drift analysis for 2001 and the expected new deals' 
impact on the PV of the Gross Book Balance over 2001.

This is  a reasonable request for a the Rate & Currency Group  and I do not 
think I should have to provide you Objectives supporting this request.
Sheila

Mike and Beth,
I would appreciate a copy of the drift number submitted for Budget 2001 and a 
copy of the analysis for Enron Europe. 

 I would also like a copy of the expected new deals for 2001 reflecting the 
average increase/or decrease in the PV of the Gross Book Balance.  I need 
this infomation in Dollar terms not percentages. I need to have the new deals 
separately for GBP, NOK, and EUR.  We are reviewing Drift and our 
anticipated  Interest rate position vs. expected 2001 economic climate.  

Thanks. Sheila
