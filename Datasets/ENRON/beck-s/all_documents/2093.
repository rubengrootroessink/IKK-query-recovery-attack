Already taken care of......  I discussed this with Sally Beck and Brent Price 
last Friday and they will assure that a Doorstep type review is incorporated 
into AA's scope.  All agree that this is key to the due diligence effort.  
Ted Murphy has been the RAC sponsor for Doorstep so I will circle back with 
him as well.  I will look the scope over and provide comments once it has 
been completed.  Call with questions.

Steve-  Brent forwarded this Doorstep Report.  On Friday, we discussed 
integrating a Doorstep examination with AA's due diligence for material 
adverse conditions in MG's business.  Shall I leave this with you to take up 
with Beth Apollo and Stan Farmer?
