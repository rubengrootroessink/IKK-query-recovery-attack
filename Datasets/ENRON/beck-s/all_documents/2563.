You may recall that we met at a JP Morgan luncheon a few years back.

Because of the unsuccessful attempt by Morgan to sell the energy business, I
find myself looking for employment. I am attaching a copy of my resume for
your consideration should a position in you organization come available.

Many thanks,
Tim
