Hope this helps

I am out of town on the 20/21 of April  so not able to make it

Friday or saturday the 27th/28th of April are fine

Saturday the 5th is ok (not the prime choice as Frank's flight gets in from 
the offsite at 6pm that night unless he changes it or comes straight to your 
house - which I am    willing to make him do)

we are out of the weekend of the 11th and 12th

and ok any other time in May

Beth
