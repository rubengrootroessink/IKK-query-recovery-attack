In a frank discussion with Barry I had to advise him that it will be very 
difficult for him to succeed in the role I proposed for him (and indeed in 
his current role in the medium term). He is standing in the cross-hairs of a 
rifle sight - one move and he's dead.

I have no doubt that we will find a role for this talented individual which 
will enable him to sustain the tremendous level of contribution that we are 
used to seeing from him.

Of course it will mean that progress in developing our trading support 
operations will be slower than it otherwise would have been. I shall be 
looking for a suitable candidate to fill the co-ordination role - as you 
know, individuals of the necessary calibre and experience are rare.

Fernley
