Congratulations on your recent well deserved promotion to Managing

Enron has requested a consulting contract and therefore I will continue to
work at my office here, as well as at my new offices mentioned above.
Therefore, you will likely be able to contact me at either location for the
next few months.

In my ten years of experience at Enron I have been responsible for
Intellectual Capital, Organization Development & Training, Executive
Development, etc. and I am looking forward to being able to continue to work 
directly with Enron and other companies interested in these areas.
