Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Beth
