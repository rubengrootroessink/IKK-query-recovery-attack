Sally - just an fyi...  Jeff Hodge requested that we send him the information 
below.  Evidently, the FERC has requested that several US wholesale companies 
provide a great deal of information to them due to the volatility of natural 
gas prices the past few weeks (it is being driven by the California 
markets).  Legal got them agree to simply giving them a weighted average 
price of gas on the 11th for delivery on the 12th.  It worked out as $24.47 
for buys and $18.14 for sales.  This is US physical next day only.
