Ted / Sally 

We took as an action from the last meeting the need to re-authorise all 
traders within the metals global businesses, sign this list off with the 
EnronMetals Managing Directors and accompany this list with a note 
highlighting the dangers of non authorised trading activity.

Due to the storm here yesterday we had to delay the operational control 
meeting with the MDs until today and therefore hope to have this out tomorrow 
with effect from COB 31 st.

Apologies for the delay - any issues please call

Regards

Mike
