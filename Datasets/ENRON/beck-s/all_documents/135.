FYI - another system issue.  I have asked Chris Schomer to let me know who is 
responsible for monitoring this or if it is a control we need to put in 
place.  Operationally - we will be able to meet close deadlines; the gas 
accrual will be done one day later than planned and I am checking into the 
financial accural.
I will keep you posted.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Leslie

All,

It appears that the Phoenix Rate Server was down for the time period in 
question.  Apparently some new Unix folks decided to clean up some files on 
the Phoenix box and deleted some Phoenix system files.  Phoenix only has 1 
support person and he is out on vacation.  Someone from the Sitara production 
support team was able to restart the system today and the extract was rerun.  
We are currently re-running the mass draft to pick up the new rates.  We 
should be good to go for Tuesday 6:00 am.

Chris

All,

It appears that we have not been picking up rates from Phoenix since December 
24th (the job was finishing, just not picking up any rates).  At first glance 
the problem may be related to our losing access to the Phoenix server.  We 
plan on the following action:

1) Run the mass drafts as planned tonight.
2) Determine and fix the cause of the problem with the rate server load on 
Monday, January 1st.  The rate server load process will then be rerun for the 
missing time periods. 
3) Rerun the current month mass drafts for all gas entities on Monday, 
January 1st.  Prior months should not be affected.
4) Put better detective controls in place to make sure any problems in the 
future get identified as they occur.

Chris
