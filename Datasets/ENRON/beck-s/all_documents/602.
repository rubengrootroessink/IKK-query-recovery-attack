I have set aside my afternoon today to complete the timeline & resource 
needs, rewrite the presentation to originators, recap today's Monday morning 
meeting on commercialization efforts this week, work on my game plan for EES 
and to get with Bob Hall to create our update for Brian Redmond's Tuesday 
meeting with Louise regarding HPL.  I will share these with you as I check 
off the list this afternoon.  --Sally

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last 
week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  
Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we 
can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that 
participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra 
participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy 
immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant 
called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.
