Hello Sally,

Thanks for meeting me last week and for discussing what looks to be a very 
interesting and very challenging task ahead for you and your group.  In line 
with our talks - I will be sending you my updated CV for your records - I 
would be interested in further discussions - should you see a commercial role 
develop within your group.

Regards,

Allan Sommer
