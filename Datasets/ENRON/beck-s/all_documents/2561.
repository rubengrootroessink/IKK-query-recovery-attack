Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I wanted to give you the courtesy of hearing directly from me that I 
submitted my resignation earlier today.    With a bright and busy 10-month at 
home and another along the way, I am finding it difficult to manage my 
priorities and balance my time with ever-increasing job responsibilities.  I 
know that I will not work when I have the second child and want to make the 
most complete and successful transition as possible for both myself and 
Enron.  

I have yet to discuss with Sally my departure date, but have left it open for 
discussion since I have no urgent deadline to meet.   I know that I owe the 
Southern Cone some more process flows, which I fully intend to deliver.   

I have greatly enjoyed the past four years at Enron, and will miss many 
aspects of my job and the company.   If you have any specific requests prior 
to my departure, or recommendation regarding length of notice, I would 
appreciate hearing from you.

 Sue
