I just wanted to touch base with you regarding trading operations in Japan.  
During the call today, it sounds like EOL in Japan may be near up and 
running.  I was wondering if we could discuss what type of plans you have for 
a mid and back office function.  I'd like to get in the loop and help set 
controls and procedures up as soon as possible.  I have a meeting with 
Jan-Erland late next week, but if there is anything that needs to be started 
before then, please let me know.

Regards

Shona
