		 Subject: Associates PRC Meeting

We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am.  I will contact 
your supervisors after the PRC meeting to let them know the final results.  
Your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to 
summarize the feedback received through the PEP system during the review.  

Thanks for providing your resumes.  I will feel more informed during the 
process.
