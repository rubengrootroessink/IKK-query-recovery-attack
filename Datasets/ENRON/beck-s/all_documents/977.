Sally - 

FYI.  Having never worked with Whalley before, I may never hear back from 
him.   We'd like to obtain documentation signed by Skilling/Buy authorizing 
the top traders for specific commodity groups (Lavorato/Sherriff/Shankman), 
then we'll get those top traders to designate head traders, and so on down 
the line.  If you have any insight as to the commodity group assignments 
listed below, please let me know.  And since you probably see Whalley often, 
perhaps you could mention it.  I think Shona's group wants to reclassify the 
DPR accordingly, but they're not certain on some of these either.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Greg -

We haven't met yet - I joined Market Risk Management working for Ted Murphy 
about a month ago, focusing on the Risk Management Policy.  One item I'm 
working on is documentation of the Head Traders and Authorized Traders.    It 
seems after the organizational anouncement last week that you are the top 
management and focal point for all of the trading activities in Enron 
Wholesale Services.  As such, would you please review the draft memo below 
(also attached) and confirm whether this appropriately documents your wishes 
as far as designation of Head Traders for each commodity group authorized in 
the policy?  We'd like to get Skilling/Buy to sign this top level of trading 
authority delegation.  Then I'll obtain from each of the Head Traders their 
respective lists of Authorized Traders to whom they've further delegated 
trading authority.  This will support Rick Buy's goal that RAC maintain a 
list of authorized traders, with the appropriate documentation of that 
authorization.

Please don't read anything into the assignments themselves if I got them 
wrong - we made an educated guess with all the recent reorganizations.  For 
example - who is the Head Trader for Southern Cone Gas and Power - is it 
really Kishkill?  And as McMahon and Bowen aren't traders, do trading 
activities for Pulp & Paper, Lumber and Steel fall to Sherriff or someone 
else?  

If you prefer me to obtain Head Trader names for each commodity group from 
Lavorato/Sherriff/Shankman, I can do so, but please confirm I have the 
commodity group responsibilities correct among the 3 of them.

Thank you,

Cassandra Schultz
