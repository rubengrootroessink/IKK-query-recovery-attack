From the Risk Management perspective I would like to add the following 
comments :

UK Power - despite much testing we still have a few production teething 
problems with the transfer to Enpower and this was the first full live day. 
The specific issues surrounding the o30m adjustment is being investigated by 
IT and we hope to have a definitive answer tomorrow.

Continental Power - the Portcalc valuation failed 4 times as a result of IT 
problems resulting is us missing the deadline.

Oslo - the officialisation was at 10.56 London time against a deadline of 
11.00.

James

James,

It appears only the UK Gas MTM made it for the V@R run in Houston today.

UK Power:  (despite the spotlight  being on this feed due to the first run of 
the new evaluation system) was officialised late and required the below 
mentioned adjustment.

Contintental Power : Officialised late ?

Nordic Power : was officialised around 11am London time - the slowness of the 
current feed to Houston prevented the feed reaching there on time (feed has 
been rewritten by IT to speed up the process  and is currently in UAT) 
however, it appears the normal time for officialisation this book is around 
10.30am which allows the feed to hit to normally hit on time. 

Appreciate if you could looked into the above.


Regards

David

David

We have a topside adjustment to put through of o(30,164,151) against South 
Western Electricity plc.  This is due to PD Deal E000535, Peer ID 41957 being 
valued in EnPower when it was supposed to be excluded from the MTM.

Regards

Mike
