Per my voice mails to you earlier, I was told that the following individuals 
were transferred to Sally Beck's group last month.  They are still showing as 
Corp accounting employees in EPC.  Please let me know the status of these 
transfers.

Sue Frusco
Jana Morse
Juana Fayett
Christine Garcia
Sarah J. Smith

Thanks.

Terry Bosien
