Evidently, we need to get Mike and James' consent to send someone over to 
London....  Clara was over there working on rate & currency which has nothing 
to do with London.

I am starting to hear more and more noise about James' attitude.  It is 
getting to the point (and possibly is already) that no one wants to work with 
him and it could isolate London operations even further from the mainstream.  
It may be time for someone to have a heart-to-heart with him (Fernley?).

James,
Clara was there to work with Shane on some items for the London Rate & 
Currency desk.  Clara was also working with the IT person we have in London 
who is  working to improve the processes of how curves are loaded as well as 
how cash flows are received.  
In the prior weeks when Shane and I met with some of the groups, I had told 
them that Clara would be over to follow-up on some of the items.

Sheila,

I am disappointed to say that neither Mike or I were knowingly told of 
Clara's visit and she didn't introduce herself or explain what she was doing 
to either of us. She also arrived at a time when Michael Kass was on holiday. 
As a result of this I am concerned about the success of her trip and some of 
the conclusions she may have drawn.

I would therefore appreciate it if you could arrange for a summary of the 
purpose, results and conclusions that followed her week's work so that we can 
all understand what the future holds.


Thanks James
