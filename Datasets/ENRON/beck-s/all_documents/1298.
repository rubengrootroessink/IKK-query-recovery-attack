Hi, Sally...

Wanted to apologize for the way I probably sounded on the phone--lots was
going on here and you caught me at a brain-overload moment!

Thanks for sending the Enron article--thought it was great--brought it in to
the office to show you off here...

Pictures of the girls were much appreciated--can't really believe how old
they look.  Brigeda's has taken possession of them and put them on her
bulletin board--although she wanted BIGGER ones like Grandmom--told her
Grandmoms always got bigger ones....Brigeda gets her picture taken next week
and will send you one--last year's was so dorky we didn't circulate them
much...

Dad actually seemed better yesterday.  He was making jokes and his voice was
a little stronger--he's on pain medication for his tongue--I think giving
him something to make him relax really does help--he wasn't loopy just not
quite so tense.   He seemed very "up" for the dr's appt in Houston.  I told
him you asked Fabe for the best ENT in Houston and that this guy was in your
church and did Meagan's tonsils.  He liked all of that information a
lot...thanks again for arranging this.  Mom and I decided if anyone could
get him to a doctor on short notice you would be able to do it--now the
pressure is on!

Hope you have a great weekend--Brigeda and I are looking forward to see you
guys next weekend.

Cindy
