Note 1:  The BOD directed us to combine some limits for some businesses, so=
=20
your individual commodity limits may become sub-limits subject to a larger=
=20
combined limit (for example, 1) combine equity, convertible arbitrage, and=
=20
financial instruments' i/r and f/x, 2) combine Softs, Grains, and Meats, an=
d=20
potentially other newer businesses as well).  We will work with you as thes=
e=20
higher level limits are being developed.

Note 2:  Cross-commodity trading authority was not pre-approved for anyone =
in=20
the company.  Authority to trade a commodity for which you are not the=20
authorized trader must be obtained from the Business Unit Office of the=20
Chairman for the commodity group that is authorized to trade that commodity=
,=20
with appropriate reporting as noted below.

Policy amendments were as follows:

u Clarify the cross-commodity trading policy to specify that trading limits=
=20
are to be applied against Enron=01,s consolidated commodity positions on an=
=20
individual commodity group basis;  Enron=01,s consolidated Daily Position R=
eport=20
should provide required market risk disclosures by primary commodity group;=
=20
(for example, Enron=01,s exposure to the North American Natural Gas market =
shall=20
be aggregated across the company).

=01) Delegate cross-commodity trading approval among established commodity=
=20
groups to the respective Business Units Offices of the Chairman, with=20
appropriate reporting to the Enron Corp. Chief Risk Officer.

u Specify the operational control requirement that all trades executed over=
=20
the telephone must be recorded electronically.

Below are relevant excerpts from the revised policy addressing the=20
cross-commodity trading guidelines.  I will distribute the entire updated=
=20
policy as soon as we incorporate the BOD's comments.

V. Operations and Controls.
 B.  Position Reporting.
"...For purposes of limit monitoring and aggregation of Enron=01,s consolid=
ated=20
trading results, Enron=01,s consolidated Daily Position Report should inclu=
de=20
the Net Open Position, Maturity/Gap Position, profit or loss, and potential=
=20
exposure (VaR) for approved Commodity Groups consolidated across the compan=
y=20
without regard to which business unit undertook the trading activity. In=20
those instances where limits are granted to a business unit for a basket of=
=20
commodities, reporting for individual commodity risk books shall be=20
maintained to facilitate aggregation of Enron=01,s actual consolidated comm=
odity=20
specific exposure.  Management reporting may separately provide business un=
it=20
sub-limit monitoring and trading results aggregated according to management=
=20
lines."

E. Transaction Approval and Execution. "Only those employees designated by=
=20
the Enron Corp. Chief Risk Officer or his designee(s) will be authorized to=
=20
enter into Transactions on behalf of Enron.  The Chief Risk Officer must al=
so=20
maintain a record of those employees responsible for the individual Commodi=
ty=20
Groups (Commodity Group Manager) as specified in the Appendices.  Individua=
ls=20
will be assigned as commodity leaders to manage Enron=01,s aggregate positi=
on=20
across the company as determined necessary by the Chief Risk Officer..."

VI.  Policy Amendment Authority
B. Cross-Commodity Position Authorization.  If in the ordinary course of it=
s=20
business an Enron Business Unit or trading desk incurs an exposure to an=20
underlying commodity or financial instrument for which it does not have=20
explicit authority to carry, this exposure should be hedged internally with=
=20
the appropriate Enron desk(s), with appropriate notification to the Chief=
=20
Risk Officer or his designee(s).  Hedge positions should be in instruments=
=20
that have an observable correlation with the underlying exposure, and shoul=
d=20
be rebalanced regularly to substantially neutralize the underlying exposure=
. =20

 Upon notification to the Chief Risk Officer or his designee(s), the Enron=
=20
Business Unit Office of the Chairman who has authority for that commodity=
=20
group may authorize a specific trader in a different commodity group to tak=
e=20
speculative positions with other Enron trading desks in commodities and/or=
=20
financial instruments other than those which that trader has explicit=20
authority to trade (i.e. the Business Unit Office of the Chairman for North=
=20
American Natural Gas may authorize a trader in the Coal group to trade gas=
=20
with the North American Natural Gas desk).    For limit monitoring purposes=
=20
of Enron=01,s consolidated trading results, these cross-commodity positions=
=20
shall be captured by individual commodity to facilitate aggregation and=20
reporting of Enron=01,s consolidated exposure by commodity in the Daily Pos=
ition=20
Report (Coal desk=01,s gas position will be aggregated with the North Ameri=
can=20
Natural Gas commodity group.)
