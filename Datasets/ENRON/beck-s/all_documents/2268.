Sally,

I wanted to forward the latest update for the Book-Split Project.  Although 
you may not find the details of the update to be that exciting, I want you to 
know that much work and time are being put into this effort.  Paul and Gregor 
are the two Desk Directors for Continental Power who report to Joe Gold.  
It's good to hear some feedback from them.

As you know, Kristin has now shown some interest in the EBS job with Barry 
now that Fallen is moving.  When Barry and I first spoke about the position 
which I would fill, I told him the Fallen might want Kristin since he knows 
her and has worked with her the last 2 years.  Although the job sounds 
interesting (Barry's a good salesman), there is not room for both Kristin and 
myself.  I'll keep you updated on my discussions with Barry.

Thanks for being a sounding board,
Todd

Subject: Book-Split Update 4/27/2000


Due to the announcement that the London office received pertaining to the May 
Day problems which occurred last year, the Book-Split "Go Live" date will be 
postponed until next Saturday, May 6.  Listed below are the updates since the 
last memo:

BOOK-SPLIT

Completed
Position report which presents peak/off-peak volumes by month, by desk was 
delivered to Paul and Gregor
Deal summaries which support the position report were also delivered
All volumetric variances between the Production and Test environments have 
been identified - the material differences were related to 2 counterparties 
which were not set up in Test and steps have been taken to resolve this issue
Discussed system changes relating to the Settlements invoicing system

Uncompleted
Test the PCS calc to ensure that it can report by desk
Separate DPRs and associated reports for the Pool and Bilateral portfolios
Testing of the Settlements invoicing system


TRANSMISSION

Talks have continued with the Houston IT team as to the Transmission deal 
type testing that must be done.  The IT group moved floors yesterday and has 
spent much of today recovering from the aftermath.  They are aware of the 
sense of urgency and level of priority to give this issue and considerable 
progress should be made during the next 2 weeks.


OTHER

Neil has been working with Miles in order to set up the necessary Cezch 
border curves so that the CEZ deal may be properly booked in Enpower.  Once 
this is complete, the Basis adjustment  (approx. 14M Eur) can be removed from 
the DPR.  Also, the Financial Iberian positions have successfully been 
intergrated into the current Continental Power DPR (leaving only the Spanish 
physical deals being valued outside of Enpower).


Please come by if you have any questions,
Todd Hall
