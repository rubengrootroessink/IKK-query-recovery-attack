Tried to catch you this afternoon, but I know that you are probably tied up 
with quarter end issues.  I just wanted to follow up on several things:

1)  Memo on Brent's role:  Have you had a chance to take another look at the 
draft that  we looked at last week?  I think that you thoughts were to send 
it out next week, which would be a week before Brent's expected start date on 
April10. 

2)  Have you heard anything from Barry this week on his impressions of 
Tokyo?  How about Jo? 

3)  I had a brief conversation with Ted Murphy yesterday during a break in an 
offsite meeting with AA on our 2000 internal audit plan.  He brought up the 
subject of Barry's potential role in Japan, and stated that he saw that as a 
good fit and a good opportunity for a new assignment for Barry.  Short, but 
positive; nothing negative.  

4)  Did you make it over to Chicago for the AA meeting?  I spent some time 
with Wes this morning, but forgot to ask him if you were there?  I you were, 
then I am sure that you are really swamped today. 

5)  Todd Hall has been working with James New in your office since Monday of 
this week.
