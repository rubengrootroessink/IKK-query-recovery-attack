Subject: Factor Loadings for VAR
Importance: High

Please explain why factor loadings were put into production yesterday without 
approval.

Please roll back last night's changes immediately.

We intend to sign off the factors today and if acceptable they should be 
loaded today.

In future if you don't have my signature on a piece of paper, no new factors 
go in. 

What I require to make the decision is as follows:

1 The new correlations per the numerical method
2 The old correlations
3 A summary of primary curves
4 A summary of major positions
5 The resulting incremental change in VAR, by commodity, desk and/or major 
position
6 Evidence of a discourse with the appropriate desk heads/book admins about 
the change

Beth, lets add this to the list of tasks for the Global Middle Office and 
agree transition.
