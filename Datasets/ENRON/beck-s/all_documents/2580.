Beth Perlman, previously in charge of application development in Europe, has 
returned to Houston  to head up ENA's application development, as well as RAC 
and Treasury applications. Beth will report directly to Philippe Bibi.  In 
order to capitalize on the enhanced global approach that we have taken, Mark 
Pickering and Beth will have joint responsibility for the development groups 
that cross regional lines, including global products trading, power trading, 
and other common operations applications.

Dan Bruce, previously in charge of RAC and Treasury applications, has assumed 
responsibility for IT support in the International regions as well as EE&CC 
and Asset Operations.

Please join me in congratulating Beth & Dan on their new positions.

Philippe Bibi
CTO
