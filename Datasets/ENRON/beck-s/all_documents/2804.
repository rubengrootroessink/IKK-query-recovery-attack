Subject: Update on Confirm Logic

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last 
week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  
Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we 
can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that 
participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra 
participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy 
immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant 
called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.
