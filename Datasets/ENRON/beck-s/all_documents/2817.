As a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of 
mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for EWS, I 
will have a timeline for your review on Monday that will pinpoint key dates:  
Unify conversion, EES absorption, HPL sale, commercialization, Todd Busby's 
arrival, etc.  I will also have details of resource needs.  We can use this 
to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of 
these initiatives.  I will welcome your comments on the timeline.  --Sally
