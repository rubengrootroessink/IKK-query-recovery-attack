As of 10:00 AM Thursday pipeline reports indicate that all of our resubmitted 
nominations have been confirmed by the pipelines and our counterparties and 
will be scheduled correctly.  These nominations were resubmitted on the first 
Intraday cycle (6:00 PM on the day prior to flow).

As a result I do not expect any monetary impact from yesterdays outage. I 
will keep you posted if anything further develops.
