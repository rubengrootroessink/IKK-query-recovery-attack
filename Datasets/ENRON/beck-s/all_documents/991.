Athena is a powerful and flexible tool.  The members of RAC have shown great 
interest in Athena, and we should expect to see several of them at today's 
instructional class.  

We think that Energy Operations will similarly find Athena very useful, and 
we strongly encourage you to sign up for Thursday's class or to stop by 
today's (4:00 in EB 3270).

Regards,



Eugenio

Subject: Rollout of ATHENA (Formerly known as the DPR database)


Dear All,
 
Risk Analytics, has recently finished developing ATHENA (the database that 
warehouses all of the official DPR data of Enron), which is designed to make 
your work easier by giving you the following tools and breakdowns:

1. P&L Component Breakdowns
? Hedge Management
? Prudency
? Curve Shift
? New Deals

2. Risk Analysis Tools
? VARs
? Maturity Gap Risk
? Net Open Position
? Daily loss limits

The warehoused information, which is broken down by books and parts (P&L 
component breakdowns/risk analysis tools), now has the visual aid of numerous 
bar graphs and pie charts used to represent the information listed above - 
provided to you at the touch of a button.  These charts are not only very 
easy to understand, but will be helpful in your daily work analyzing trading 
information.  

Now that all commodity groups are performing additional analysis and 
providing reports other than P&L and positions to both MRM RAC and commercial 
departments, the tools provided by ATHENA have been proven to be extremely 
useful.  

ATHENA makes analysis of the time trend of data an effortless process, as it 
has warehoused data for the past year for each commodity.

The rollout of ATHENA is currently underway, according to the following 
timeline:

? From now until Friday November 10th, access to the database is being given 
to the beta testers (testers already chosen).
? Monday November 13th - First instructional training class from 4-5pm. 
Conference room 3270.
? Thursday November 16th - Second instructional training class from 3-4pm.  
Conference room 3270.  
? Subsequent classes will be scheduled depending on need.
? Production users will have access to the database within the few weeks 
following November 16th.
  
Each of these sessions will hold up to 15 participants, and attendees are 
taken on a first come first serve basis.  Please contact Pamela Sonnier (ext. 
37531) to sign up for one of these training sessions.

We expect that all business controllers will want to have access to ATHENA. 
Additionally, there may be other employees in your group who need access.  
Please send all requests for access to ATHENA to Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon 
(ext. 35257), Jennifer Nguyen (ext. 57590), or Eugenio Perez (ext. 35828) 

For further information on ATHENA, or to set up a one on one demonstration, 
call Eugenio Perez (X35828), Maria Teresa Peon (X35257) or Jennifer Nguyen 
(X57590).

Best regards and looking forward to working with you,


Risk Analytics
