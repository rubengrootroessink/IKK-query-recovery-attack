FYI - 

Sally - Bob and/or I will keep you posted on how we get on.  It may be a 
better outcome if we can sell our imbalances to AEP as we will have a hard 
time resolving them after the Close.

Team,
During out meeting on Thursday, we decided that we would meet once a week in 
Brian Redmond's conference room.  Everyone with outstanding  receivables is 
invited (that is a nice way of saying Mandatory).  Brian would like for us to 
meet every week until the receivables balance is at zero.

Thanks

Next meeting time is:
 Wednesday the 18th
 4:00
 Conference room 3567

Ed, below are the outstanding transportation receivables.
 Mitchell Gas Services, LP  96,960
 Dynegy Marketing 7 Trade  118,892
 Exxon Company USA   73,892
 Entex Gas Marketing   58,127
 PG&E Texas Industrial Energy. LP 200,456
