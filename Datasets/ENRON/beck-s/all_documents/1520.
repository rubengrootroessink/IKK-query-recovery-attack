Sally,

Hi!  How are you doing?  I am back at UT and things are already pretty
hectic.  It seems like a long time ago that I was interning at Enron!

I was writing to see if you have had the chance to speak with Mr.
Skilling about speaking at our conference yet?  We are planning to get
the formal invitation out in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Steve
