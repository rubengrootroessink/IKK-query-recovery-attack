Thanks for the slides.  There really is nothing new under the sun.  The key 
is to identify the source of competitive advantage.  To my mind it's the same 
line of thought that leads us to see EOL as sustainable, but neutral B2B 
marketplaces as temporary.  Our only competitive advantage is that we are the 
largest principal member of the potential club, making our participation most 
critical.  Given this, our timing and positioning relative to potentially 
joining others may be the single most important strategic decision we make.  
I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on any other elements of competitve 
advantage that we could leverage, particularly those elements that are most 
sustainable.

Subject: Data Exchange Strategy

I just saw this presentation on EnVera and couldn't help but think this is 
the concept you were promoting yesterday as a data hub/exchange.  Seems like 
that is the EnVera strategy as well.
