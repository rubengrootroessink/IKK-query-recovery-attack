Subject: Risk Position - Eugenio Perez

Hi Sally

  I wondered if you could help me? Attached is a specification we used 
locally for the Australian risk management positions.  Could you review and 
perhaps add any comments with a view to creating the spec for the Enron Japan 
position? Please revert asap. 

Thanks

Phil
