Subject: EnVision Meeting Structures and Way Forwards


At the last EnVision Project meeting the following presentation was given and 
agreed in principal as the way we will take things forwards.  Whilst the 
names within each area have to be confirmed and agreed I thought that it 
would be useful to circulate this as many of you will be impacted.  I will be 
communicating this further over the next few days, but if you have any 
immediate questions please feel free to contact me.

Regards
