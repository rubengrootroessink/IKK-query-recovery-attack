Please edit review revise as needed the attached.  I hope you find the 
attachments helpfull.  Please note that I
did not hear back from Bob or Leslie on where gas settlements will end up.  I 
will talk to you in follow-up later
today.  Please note that  I will also drop off a diskette for Patti to use as 
needed with the attachments.
