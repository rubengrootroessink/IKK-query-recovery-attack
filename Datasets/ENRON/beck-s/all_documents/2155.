Joshua Koenig will be reporting to Bryce Baxter (Mechelle Stevens will be his 
lead) and will be working on the A/R and A/P reconciliation project.  Jolly 
Jose will be joining the risk team.  Our current plan is for him to help with 
the day-to-day P&L preparation activities on the East Desk along with any 
other projects that arise.  Jolly will report to Will Kelly (David Oliver 
will be his lead).  I have forwarded the summer schedule to Bryce and Will.  
We will make every effort to ensure the interns' have a good experience.

First, please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be 
reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer.  Hopefully 
none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made 
for desk, phone and computers for all.  

Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them 
to Enron.  

Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief 
meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be 
working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this 
summer.  I welcome ideas on this from any of you.
