Hi Sally,
Unfortunately I was out of the office for the latter part of last week and 
was unable to get back to you with my resume.  Please find it attached.  I 
understand the PRC meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow, hopefully you 
will get it in time.
Federico told me that you met with him last week.  I want to thank you very 
much for taking the time to familiarize yourself with my background and 
accomplishments.  Undoubtedly this is a challenging and time-consuming 
process, adding to your current responsibilities.  
I would like to wish you luck at the PRC meeting tomorrow, hopefully it won't 
run as long as that of the Analysts.
Regards,
Erwin

Subject: Associates PRC Meeting - To Be Rescheduled

Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name 
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in 
Houston.  My extension is 35926.
