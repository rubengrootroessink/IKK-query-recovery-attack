Here is the first draft of the strategy memo for Doorstep.  Veronica was nice 
enough to agree to check it over to ensure we have all offices that are on 
the schedule, as well as ensure othat offices are not listed twice.

I'll send you another draft once it is nearer finalization.

Best regards

Shona
