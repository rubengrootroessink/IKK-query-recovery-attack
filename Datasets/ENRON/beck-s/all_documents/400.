??????????Dear Lexi,  
?????????????????????????  my name is Andrew Haryono.? I am a UT student 
majoring in Professional  Program in Accounting.?I will be graduating this 
May 2001 with a MPA  degree.??I will also be sitting for the CPA exam this 
May.? Even  though I have an audit background,?my career interest is to do 
financial  and accounting analysis.? The analyst's job description at Enron 
matches  perfectly with my career interest.? I signed up for the internship  
opportunity through the careerportal system, because I could not find any 
full  time opportunity. As for now, I have not received answer from Enron.? I 
am  writing to ask further about the?career opportunity  with?Enron.
????????My questions  are:
1)? Is it possible to turn this analyst?internship  opportunity into 
full-time permanent opportunity?? 
2)??If that's not possible would you have opening  for me in the near future?
??? I am reattaching my resume.? Thank you  and I look forward?to hearing 
from you.
?
?
Sincerely,
?
Andrew Haryono
