Subject: Working together on the valuation model

All,

As we go forward on the next revision of the valuation model (due late next 
week or early the next for the offsite), it is important that we all 
understand and embrace some basic ground rules.  I've got some suggestions 
below and would like to hear any that you have:

In order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the 
betterment of us all - I think we ought to give one person version control 
responsibility over the model.  This person should be advised when the model 
is updated.  Relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons 
for the updating also seem pertinent.  Version control is critical if we are 
to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management.  

Related to this, Rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to 
upper management (both Sally and Greg) and be given the opportunity to give 
feedback before hand.  

Just basic stuff, but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we 
go much further, we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications.

Thanks,

Fred
