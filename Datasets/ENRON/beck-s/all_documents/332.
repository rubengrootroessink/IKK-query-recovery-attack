Sally, Bob - Just wanted to pass this complement I received about Diane's 
work. She continues to improve and add value to the team and did an 
outstanding job on this particular request.

I just wanted to let you know what a great job Diane did for us on the data 
response in the San Diego proceeding.  As you know, it was an ungodly amount 
of data, and Diane's knowledge and experience enabled her to put it into a 
format that allowed us to be responsive to FERC while at the same time 
presenting the information in a way that made sense.  She just seemed to know 
what needed to be done, and did it.  I don't know anyone else who could have 
done as good a job, and with a great attitude too in spite of the pressure.  
I know that it must have been hard on her personally, given the long hours 
she worked, including the weekend and the holiday.  I think she should get 
some special recognition for her efforts -- maybe an Employee Performance 
Award (if we're still doing those).
