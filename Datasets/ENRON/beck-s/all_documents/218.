fyi - further thoughts to consider for our prep meeting on the 26th.
  Sally - while you are in London, do you want to share information with Mike 
regarding the ASE so he can block his schedule and be planning his trip?  
Might be good to see if he has one or two Managers he would also like to 
attend.

Subject: Notes on ASE Studio

Hello Mary- 

Here is a rough strating point of the ASE Studio planning document.  I have 
included the objectives we discussed initially - we will continue to refine 
them as we move forward.  

Also, I inserted the notes I made during the offsite on Friday.  My notes 
were primarily focused on information that the participants were wanting or 
that I thought might be useful.  Also, I jotted down quite a few questions 
that came up during the session.  Some of them were addressed on Friday and 
others were not.  We do not necessarily need to address all of these at the 
ASE - and I would suspect there are others that should be addressed but are 
not listed here.  I'm sending this information in advance for your review and 
thought.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss, please let me know.
