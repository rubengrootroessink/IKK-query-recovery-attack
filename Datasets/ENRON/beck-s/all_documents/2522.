I am pleased to announce that Victor Santos, Director based in Singapore, 
will head Enron's Global Fuels origination activities for Asia Pacific 
reporting to Michael L. Brown.  He replaces Michel Decnop, who recently 
transferred to London and will now head Enron's origination activities in 
Europe.

Victor received his MBA (Finance) from Fordham University in New York and 
joined the Enron Associate Program in 1995.

Please join us in congratulating Victor in his new role.
