Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a
brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have
only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two
rooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would
probably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five
is almost too many in one room and bathroom.

I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds
like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask
about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving
travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara
