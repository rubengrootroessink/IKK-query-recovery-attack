Hi Mary,
This is the end result for Jim Brown.  He looked it over with me this 
afternoon and is really pleased with the results.  Apparently Rodney Malcolm 
has had over a month to provide this information and couldn't come through 
and according to Jim, this is the most and best he's seen!  Jim will run the 
numbers by Harold Buchanan tomorrow and let us know if that is all he needs 
from us.

Thanks,
Avril
