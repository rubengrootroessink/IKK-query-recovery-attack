Attached is a good memo from Colleen outlining her view of the transportation 
needs.

I will follow up with her.

What about Scott Mills?  Is he going to be available to work on Sitara items?

I can't remember what you said about his time.

thanks

bob

Here is an update on Colleen Sullivan's view of the transportation world.  
What she wants to accomplish has been talked about before and will impact all 
of us.  Take a look at this.  I will coordinate a meeting for next week to 
discuss the options so that we can get back with Colleen as to what is 
feasible and how this falls into current priorities.

As I indicated in my voicemail message to you, attached is the document 
outlining my notes regarding the infrastructure development that needs to 
occur in order to support an active transportation capacity trading market.  
The transportation world is quickly changing and I believe our ability to 
actively trade transportation is getting ready to multiply.  Whether ENA ends 
up developing a capacity trading system or not, our business in that area is 
going to change immensely and we must be prepared to deal with it as soon as 
possible.

I would appreciate it if you would look at the attached document and review 
the Sitara related projects (all of which we have discussed previously), let 
me know what resources you have available to work on these things, and where 
you see it in the priority list.  Since I do not know what other projects you 
are working on, it is impossible for me to know what is most important, so 
I'd appreciate knowing where you see this fitting in and an estimated time 
for completion.  I'll be more than happy to meet with you to discuss these 
projects again in more detail to help you better understand the needs.
