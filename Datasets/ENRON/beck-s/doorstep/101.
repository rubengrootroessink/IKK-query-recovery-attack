This is the latest draft that I have of the matrix.  John has seen this 
version; I am not certain if he has seen any updates.  

Please let me know the outcome of your conversation with Fernley - I am 
somewhat discouraged by John's remarks and would like to get any 
misconceptions cleared up as soon as possible (whether I assume a position in 
London or not).
