Comment as requested:

"Discussions have been held with the current holder of the authorised trader 
lists for Enron Europe. There is a  process in place (as required by the 
Enron Corp. Risk Management and Trading Policy) whereby a list of traders 
authorised to transact with third parties is maintained and signed off at 
least quarterly by the President/CEO of Enron Europe. Further work will be 
carried out to ascertain where the process broke down, generating the 
Doorstep review point."

Regards
Andy
