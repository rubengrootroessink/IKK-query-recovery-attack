After meeting with AEP this morning, some issues are revolved and new one added.

Resolved:

	Confirmations will be done out of AEP's systems for long term deals, intramonth transactions
	will be confirmed using DECAF 2.  DECAF 1 will not be used.

	Global Facilities will not need to copied to a new pipeline code.

	The HPL DUN's number will remain the same.

	Deal entry will be manual for AEP risk system and getting old deals back into Sitara.
	The need to build a cross-reference table is the main driver.

New items

	A hands-on  training program is unlikely due to time  and space constrains.
	AEP/Enron evaluating options.

	New Risk Portfolios need to created in Sitara.  List provided to AEP.
	Enron giving explanations of portfolios for usefulness to AEP.

	Manual entries to G/L and reports needed to book all items.
