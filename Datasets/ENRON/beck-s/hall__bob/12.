Please plan to attend a meeting with Brian Redmond and Bob Hall on Thursday 
at 4:00 in conference room 3567.
  Each person should be prepared to discuss the current status of each "Bad 
Debt" account that was assigned to them in February.

If you are unable to attend you will need to schedule a private meeting with 
Brian Redmond at a later date.


Janet
