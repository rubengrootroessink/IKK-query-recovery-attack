Subject: Team Leadership Coaching for Mary Gosnell

Mary Gosnell has been performing well in her new role as Manager.  I would 
like to offer Mary some coaching sessions with Team Leadership to develop her 
presence and language skills when dealing with management personnel.  Any 
problems with that ?
