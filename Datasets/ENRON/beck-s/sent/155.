Saturday?

Dear Ms. Beck,

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Irfan Iqbal
