These dates look fine -- I hope that you have something fun planned!  The 
only slight glitch is that I will receive the bonus sheets on Monday, January 
10 and that our turn around time is one day.  If it is convenient for you we 
can talk by phone on Monday night to review bonuses for your group or we can 
plan on meeting first thing on Tuesday, the 11th.  I do not yet know at what 
time on Tuesday we will have to have final changes made.  --Sally
