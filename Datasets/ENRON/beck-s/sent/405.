UGH!!  I am happy for you, but know that Enron will be losing as you leave.  
I am pleased that the opportunity at Reliant is an exciting one for you, and 
I know that you will do a great job.  It has been fun to work with you, 
Ginger, and I too will miss that.  Best of luck to you!  --Sally

I just wanted to drop all of you a note  . . .

I have an outstanding opportunity to head up Reliant's MBA Program.  I will 
begin my employment with Reliant the first week in July.  As soon as I am up 
and running, I will forward my phone number and email address.  I have 
enjoyed working with all of you! 

Ginger
