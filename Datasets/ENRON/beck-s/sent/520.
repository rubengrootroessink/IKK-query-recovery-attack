Fall sounds good to me.  In talking with Sue today, she stated that Dr. Rao 
would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and 
that it will most likely be another week before he does so.  I asked her to 
contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow 
up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at Enron.  I will keep 
Rick Causey, the other interviewers and you (or someone in your office) 
updated on the timing of notifying the winners.  --Sally

I will plan the event for the fall - I'll be back from maternity leave and we 
can get PR on campus for the event as well.  Thanks!  Elyse

Rick won't be back in the office until Monday but I am sure that this will be 
ok with him.  His schedule is really tight for the next month.

Sally and Rick:  I am fine with having the dinner in the fall if y'all are ok 
with that.  Actually, it will give us more flexibility to plan and get great 
attendance.  Please let me know your thoughts, and I will communicate 
directly with Sue White.

Thanks!  Elyse

Hi Elyse - I just spoke with Ramesh Rao (associate dean).  He has not yet
made the Excellence Fund awards, which are also part of the Enron endowment.
He would like to have the dinner in the fall, when all of the awardees have
been chosen.  He felt that a dinner the end of April would conflict with a
major E-commerce conference we're having here, and the Enron awards would
get the attention they deserve in the fall.  The other advantage of a fall
dinner is that the new students will be here, and if we have a big
announcement then, they can see what they have to look forward to.  Will
this work for you?  Thanks.  Sue

Sue:  Thanks for your email.  In speaking with Rick Causey, the only day
that he is available is Monday, April 24.  In speaking with Sally Beck, I
know that you are confirming the 3 winners and will get me their info once
they have been chosen.  If you don't mind seeing who from the university is
available on the 24th, that would be great.  Our other option is to have it
another evening that week or rescheduling for the fall after classes begin.

As I mentioned before, I am expecting a baby two weeks from today, so I'd
love to have as much of this wrapped up before I pass it on to someone else
on my team.

Thanks for your help!
Elyse
