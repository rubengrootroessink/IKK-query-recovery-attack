We are working on the details of Todd's accomodations.  I view this as a 
business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family.  ENA is 
picking up the cost associated with the family.  Sounds as if I need to make 
sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations, but we will get that 
handled. 

That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay.  

Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th.  Monday is actually 
the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th.  The Astros play St. Louis on both of those 
days., both evening games.  I would be happy to give you four tickets for 
either one of those games.  Just let me know whether you actually want the 
10th or the 12th.  

We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April.  I would 
love to see Jo as well.  We will have to work the details.  I am planning to 
be in London next week, arriving the morning of the 20th (Monday) and staying 
through Thursday, so we should see one another before April.  I am working on 
an agenda right now for next week, so I will be back in touch within the next 
day or so to confirm some time with you there.  --Sally

To recap.

1. I think Todd is going to be here on 25th March. HR eare sorting out 
accomodation for one month. Europe pay his costs, NA pick up family costs.

2. Spoke to Bernie A - Edith is going to be here for a week in the middle of 
Todd's month.

3. I'll be in Houston w/c 8th April - lets get together then for an update. 
Though I believe you may be here sooner than that?

4. Astros' - any chance of tickets for Wed 10th (v St Louis). I guess - to be 
extra cheeky - can I have 4 - to take Jo and kids? No problem if that's not 
possible.

Talk soon. 

B.
