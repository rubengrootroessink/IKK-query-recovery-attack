I have asked Patti to send Sharron a list of all employees within Energy 
Operations (a BIG list) and another one with managers and above (perhaps a 
more manageable list) for this effort.  Since you went to the meeting I 
didn't know whether or not you were following up on this.  Just wanted to let 
you know that I have asked Patti to do this.  Thanks.

In staff meeting last week, Rick mentioned that he would like to sponsor a 
year-end celebration for accounting employees and spouses sometime in the 
next month.  I need a list of accounting personnel in your group.  We need 
this ASAP because the number of employees will determine the size of the 
facility needed.
