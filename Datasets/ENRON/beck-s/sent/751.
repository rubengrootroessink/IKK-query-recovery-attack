Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.
