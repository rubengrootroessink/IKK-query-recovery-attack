Hi Sally -

My name is Albernita, in the Software Licensing department.  A couple of 
weeks ago the above mentioned Aircard was requested for you. 

I will need to send you a GTE Contract to get your aircard activated.  Would 
you please provide me with your Internal mailing address and Fax number asap.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you!
