Hope that the trip goes well.  It should be interesting to look at that 
business.  Keep me posted.  --Sally

Sally,
Gary wants me in NY tomorrow and the rest of the week.  Trena, from London,  
and I are meeting in NY tomorrow noon.  We are assessing the FX brokerage 
business of Rudolf Wolfe, the business MG had purchased recently before our 
takeover.

Sheila
