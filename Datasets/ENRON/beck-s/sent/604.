This made it!  We are still waiting today to find out if we can get a Visa 
today.  If so, I will be on the way to South America on Sunday evening.  If 
Chris' associate has any recommendations, I would love to hear them.  
Thanks.  --Sally

Our other sister says this e-mail will work.   Let me know if you get this
by e-mailing me back!   By the way, if you need any tips for South America,
one of the guys who works with Chris is from Brazil - and a bunch of them
travel down there . . . cw
