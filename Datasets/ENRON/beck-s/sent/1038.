I was just thinking about the anniversary thing, too.  I bought a book at 
Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.  I found the name 
of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought 
looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.  Another 
place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.  Both 
meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.  I will get 
info on both and we can look at it.  I worry a little bit about having such a 
range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is 
plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc.  
These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough 
variety.  I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that 
may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the 
whole family.  One of those might catch their interest as well. 

I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the 
thought of this trip could wear thin.  I would like the opportunity to be 
together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the 
two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!  Even though Dad is 
doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get 
everyone together on a trip like this.  Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be 
a toss up, but maybe worth the try.  Let's share some research and see if 
there is any place that we could get excited about going.

Hi, Sally,

Am sure you are swamped having been gone for a while...was glad to see OU
won the game--figured that made it a better trip for you!

Now that we know Dad will be around, shall we rev up the anniversary
planning again--or should we blow it off and do some great present--maybe
just send them somewhere?  Maybe it is just the increased holiday time with
them but Mom and Dad are kind of getting on my nerves right now....am sure
it will pass....

Cindy
