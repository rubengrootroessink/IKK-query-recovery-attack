and put it in a resume folder (along with some others that I have in my

Dear Sally,

This person comes as very highly recommended (my husband says she is one of 
the best people he has ever worked with).  Do you have any suggestions on who 
could use her business development skills?

Thanks

Hi Shona, Tandra does look like a good candidate.  We are holding up on our

This person is an outstanding performer.  My husband indicated that she was 
the highest rated senior in her class, and one of the best people he has ever 
worked with.  She recently left KPMG to work for a start up company, who is 
now going bankrupt.

Please let me know if you are interested.

Thanks
