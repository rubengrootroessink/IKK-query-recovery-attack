Great to hear from you.  I was thinking about you today.  I will look forward 
to your starting on the 29th.  Certainly if anything comes up with the move 
or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed.  I will be glad to 
have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working 
together.  

I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus 
Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that.  I do feel 
as if I have been the PRC queen recently.  Wes' PRC last Thursday, mine on 
Friday, Enron Wholesale Services (minus Europe) with Mark Frevert on Monday 
of this week and a full day (7:30 am to 8:00 pm on Wednesday for the 
Associates PRC.  I do need a break!  

I will be working the week after Christmas.  Although we do have a holiday on 
December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys 
will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for 
full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those 
days, so just let me know when you would like to get together.  

Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday.  --Sally

Hi there  -- As I recall you are off next week, so wanted to touch base.  I 
am sure you will be ready  -- after PRC's and the craziness that has been 
going on over there.  

Just wanted to confirm my availability   and maybe see if we should get 
together while I am in Houston  (will be there between Christmas and New 
Year's) and could come in for a few hours or meet you for lunch.  

I think you said that you will be in London in early January - is that still 
happening?  Alternatively we could get together then.

Also -- I am planning to be ready to start work with you on Jan 29th  
(hopefully I can get Lauren into her school the week before - so she can get 
used to it).   We are leaving London on the 20th (AA signs of on our year end 
earnings release on Friday the 19th)  and then I will have a week to sort 
things out at home before starting!



I am really looking forward to learning something new, and working with you.  
Thanks for the opportunity.



If we don't speak before the holidays, I hope your family has a wonderful 
Christmas. 


Beth
