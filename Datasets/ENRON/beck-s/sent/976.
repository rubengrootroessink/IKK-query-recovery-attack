I can access the global compensation system from London.  Today I have been 
able to log on and to review as read only the info that I submitted on Friday 
for bonus and LTI.  I assume that I will be able to access the screens for 
merits as well.  Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our 
instructions and time deadlines for merit increases.  I will want to give my 
direct reports access to the system so that they can input their 
recommendations.  I will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions 
and expectations.  Having asked for more funds for the bonus pool, I would 
like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases.  Outside this 
process, we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market 
data gathered by Todd Burke.  We can process those agreed upon requests, but 
will not include those dollars within our merit totals.  That way, won't have 
to request additional dollars for these worksheets.  Better not to ask for 
exceptions on everything!!!

What is the word on bonus dollars?  Is everything finalized as I submitted?  
Let me know.  If we need to talk directly, contact Patti for a number where 
you can reach me.  Thanks.
