FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my 
promotion memo from Energy Operations.  I believe that they both work under 
Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.  I am sure that they didn't mind having 
their names included twice in promotional memos!  

Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she 
wondered if I would be coming.  I will be in South America in what should be 
summer there.  I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.  In addition to 
other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in 
Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.  I hosted a 
happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last 
week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary.
