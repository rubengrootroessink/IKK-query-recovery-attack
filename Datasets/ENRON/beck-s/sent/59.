Thanks for the resume.  She has had some good experience.  Do you know much 
about her performance here at Enron?  Can I call and talk with her directly?  
I would certainly keep the conversation confidential at this point.  --Sally

I am sending you a resume of  Renee Smith, an employee of EBS.

She is considering  a transfer at some point to another position within Enron.

She has a lot of brokerage industry experience and she is very enthusiastic
about Enron.

No need to mention it's a confidential request.

Have a very happy Thanksgiving.


Vince
