Tried you this morning from the car and missed you.  Do you want to talk 
Thursday morning during my commute?  I will be out of the office Friday, 
March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high 
school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas 
experience!  A great time to support her and be around her friends.   And 
nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.  With 81 girls on the team, it 
will be loud, but fun.  --Sally
