I have not been able to schedule a review with Peggy yet, as I am still 
trying to schedule a trip to Calgary so that Peggy and I can do her review.  
She will be out of town from March 1 through March 11, so I will have to come 
to Calgary sometime after March 11.  I was in South America last week, and 
have been to London and Helsinki twice since mid-January, so scheduling 
reviews is a challenge this time around.  I will certainly get you a signed 
copy of the review as soon as I can.
