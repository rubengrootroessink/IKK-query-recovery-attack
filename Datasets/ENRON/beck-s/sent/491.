Glad you sent a note - as crazy as life is at our house right now, I did not 
get the message from Tammy.  Lots of catch up in the office last week, which 
will continue this week.  I think that Chris is home by now, and I am sure 
that you and Erica are glad to have the additional company.  We are starting 
to talk birthday with Meagan now.  I will get back with you in a couple of 
days after Meg and I have gone through the JA catalogue.  Thanks for asking.

Hi, Sal.   Just checking in with you.  I called Friday and talked with
Tammy; I wasn't sure if you'd get the message.  Have you had a chance to
comb through the James Avery catalogue (or think of any other ideas?) for
Meagan's birthday?   Hope you're well.   E-mail back when you can!   Love,
C.
