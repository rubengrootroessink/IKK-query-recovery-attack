I just wanted to drop all of you a note  . . .

I have an outstanding opportunity to head up Reliant's MBA Program.  I will 
begin my employment with Reliant the first week in July.  As soon as I am up 
and running, I will forward my phone number and email address.  I have 
enjoyed working with all of you! 

Ginger
