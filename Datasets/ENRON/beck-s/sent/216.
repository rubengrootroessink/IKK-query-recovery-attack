Yes, he is working on the short list.  I do have to say, however, that I have 
not had questions from him on any of those names.  I will leave him a voice 
mail message for an update.

I assume he is already working on the short list you told me about (Scott and 
Todd included)?

Brent,

I have begun initial interviews this week. I started with Gas Trading 
Operations and will be moving on to Global Services next week (Shona Wilson, 
Mary Solmonson, James Scribner, Scott Mills and Sheri Thomas).  I hope to get 
to your group the week after next.  However, I will be calling next week to 
set up interviews with both you and your Directors.

Everything is progressing according to plan and I still expect  the analysis 
to be completed by mid November.

I hope this helps.  Please call me if you have any questions.  I can be 
reached at X39437.

I look forward to meeting you and your group.

Kind Regards,

Todd Burke
ENA Compensation
