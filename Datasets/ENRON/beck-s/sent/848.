Thanks, Marc.  I would like to get together with you, Mary  Solmonson and 
James Scribner to begin work on the model for scoping high, low and expected 
cases around the commercialization opportunities for mid and back office 
services.  Mary has just returned today from a week's vacation.  I will work 
on schedules and call you later this afternoon to see if we can have a 
kick-off meeting.  --Sally

Sally,

First of all, allow me to express my congratulations for your promotion. I am 
following up on the conversation about structuring of the Commodity Logic 
initiatives you had with Greg Piper last week. How do you think we should go 
about looking into the projects? I remain at your disposal for any direction 
you might want to follow.


Marc Eichmann
