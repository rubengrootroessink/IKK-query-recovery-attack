On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's 
cars.  On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of 
money for a school project.  Last night, the magazine made it into my hands 
around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.  What a 
nice article!  I smiled while reading it.  How nice to see your 
accomplishments recognized in print.  Congratulations.  I hope that you have 
plenty of copies for your mom and dad.  --Sally
