Thanks for this info.  I will call the students this week.  With your notes, 
it looks as if we may be on target in terms of acceptances and the desired 
number of 6.  Keep me posted on what we hear from the students.  --Sally

Subject: OU Summer Interns

Dear OU Recruiting Team:

Based on our intern interviews conducted October 30 and 31, we identified 10 
prospective summer interns.  I have personally called each to extend offers 
for summer internships.  Their names and telephone numbers are below.  Please 
feel free to call and congratulate them.  It is important that we stay in 
touch with them throughout their decision phase.

Thank you so much for your help and have a WONDERFUL Thanksgiving!
