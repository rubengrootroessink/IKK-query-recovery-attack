Thanks for your note on the promotion.  

Patti is beginning to work on details for the 1/31 tour of Enron Field and 
dinner for Ted and his students from OU.  She should contact you for a list 
of recent OU grads so that we can get the invitation list together.  I hope 
that you have that date on your calendar!   I will ask MIke McConnell if he 
would like to join us, too.
