I would enjoy being involved in the kickoff for the first Gas Ops program.  
Keep me posted on date and time.  Thanks for attending the meeting 
yesterday.  I hope that you will let me know when and how I can best be 
involved and provide support for your efforts.  --Sally

Sally:

Thanks for inviting us to your Monday staff meeting.  We're very excited
about getting things up and running.  Your continued support has been/will
be invaluable.

Be sure and let Barbara or I know if you have any
questions/concerns/requests.......

If you're available, it would be great if you could 'kickoff' the first 'Gas
Ops' program.  We'll keep you posted on schedule, location, etc.


Take Care

Jill
