I will be out of town on Thursday.  I think that it would be great if you 
could attend this info session on CommodityLogic - it would be good to hear 
how this project is being described to a wider audience within Enron.  If you 
can make it, please try to attend.  And I would love to have a voice mail 
message afterwards with your feedback from the info session.  Thanks.
