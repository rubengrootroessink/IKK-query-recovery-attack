Thanks for doing this.  I plan to come to London once a quarter.  I will have 
to choose my dates well in advance since these flights seem to be so full!

Sally,

Per Catherine at Travel Agency in the Park, bulkhead seats were all that were 
available when she booked flight 3 or 4 weeks ago.  Says those particular 
flights have gotten quite popular lately.  Only other option for return:

Same isle (E)
 - Row 8 (also bulkhead, but maybe not as noisy)
 - Last row window seat (doesn't recline as much as other seats)

If you like either of these better that existing seat, let me know & I change 
it.
