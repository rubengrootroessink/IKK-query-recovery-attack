Just wanted to let you know where we will be over the next week.  I am still 
at the office hoping to get away before dinner so that I can head home and 
pack.  

I will call when we are back in Houston on Sunday, July 16.  Mom and Dad, 
hope that you have fun if you are going on your trip!  Love, Sally
