Subject: EnTelligence Training

Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
EnTelligence is a system developed by Enron that provides a prospecting and 
management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
(i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please 
make every effort to attend this training.  Hopefully, you will find the 
EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.  If you have any questions 
or concerns, please let me know.
