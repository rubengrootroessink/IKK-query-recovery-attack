Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport 
after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much 
easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  

Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it 
from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls 
who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  

Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little 
travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is 
that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime 
tempurature reading!).

I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with 
David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that 
is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally

Sally:? I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not 
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both 
volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call 
into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I 
thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause 
Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did 
not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can 
check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will 
let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your 
house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is 
right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that 
meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let 
you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with 
you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so 
we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan 
suggested that.? 
?
Have a good trip. Linda
