Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend.  
Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too?  This will be a meeting that we should 
have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and 
make timely decisions on how to handle those.  I am sure that there is some 
prep work that needs to be done for this meeting.  I would assume that we 
should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk 
books, OA, etc.  Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on 
content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights.  I would love for 
us take charge and lead this meeting.  --Sally
