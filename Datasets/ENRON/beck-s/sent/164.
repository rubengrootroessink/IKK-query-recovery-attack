I was in Austin the end of last week recruiting at UT and (in a sense of 
open-mindedness and fair play) was at OU on Sunday night and Monday 
recruiting as well. James and I have not had a chance to talk following your 
conversations.  Nor am I really caught up on e:mail messages.  I have some 
tight deadlines on a couple of things for Friday, so it may be Monday before 
James and I have the opportunity to talk in any detail.

Sally,
We had a good meeting with James last week - I hope you have had the
opportunity to talk with him about it. What are the next steps? Would you
like to get together and have a mini-planning session on developing the
business maturity model around your business opportunities? We got a chance
to talk with James a little on that front, but he is not sure where your
thinking is on some of these approaches. I believe that is the best way to
get the changes you are seeking and accomplish the other business objectives
at the same time. Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mike Campbell
