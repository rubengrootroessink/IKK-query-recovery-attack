I hope that you are enjoying your break from school, and am sure that it is 
even more enjoyable with that Number 1 ranking decided!  My husband (an OU 
grad) and I were at Orange Bowl, and it was really exciting to be there and 
see the team absolutely stop FSU.  

If you have any questions regarding your job offer from Enron while you are 
on vacation, please give me a call.  2000 was a banner year for us at Enron, 
and we were excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  I hope that you 
will join us and be a part of that.  

My office number is 713-853-5926.  If it is more convenient for you, feel 
free to call me at home as well.  That number is 281-370-8568.  

Boomer Sooners!!!
