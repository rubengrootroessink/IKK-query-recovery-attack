Thanks for the weather report.  I bought a good coat a couple of months ago 
with London and Calgary in mind.  Worked well in London two weeks ago, so I 
will come equipped with coat, gloves, scarf, etc.  

I can go either way on dinner for Wednesday night.  If it would be good for 
you to get home at a reasonable hour, then we can all three have an early 
supper.  (If I get in bed early my body would probably be in shock, but would 
adjust!)  Or if we don't want to feel rushed, then a drink with Laura sounds 
great.  Ask if her pronunciation in Spanish class is improved or impaired by 
alcohol.  I will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and 
outside work - either way will work well for me.    --Sally

Just wanted to let you know that our weather has turned a little colder this 
week.  We have a little bit of fresh snow and the temperature is in the high 
20's, however with the windchill it's more like 20 F.  For dinner on 
Wednesday, Laura has a Spanish class at 7:00.  We have a couple of options.  
We could go to dinner at Joey Tomatoes right after the meeting at 5:00.  Or, 
we could go for a drink with Laura after the meeting and you and I could go 
to dinner afterwards. My preference would be to eat earlier rather than 
later, but I'm pretty flexible.  Let me know which works better for you.
