An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:

Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified

I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a 
short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on 
potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due 
diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has 
other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted 
to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it 
as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent 
job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had 
created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG 
acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this 
checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the 
names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence 
effort.  

Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business

I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the 
executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price 
(my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an 
appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall 
and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has 
other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time 
that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the 
lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to 
Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to 
split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay 
involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also 
keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected 
to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week 
regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted.
