Cindy:  My schedule was so hectic before going out on vacation on December 17 
that I am only now reading your message regarding a business owner sign-off 
for Unify/SAP integration.  I have asked Stephen Schwarz to give me his 
recommendation on the most appropriate person to do so.  I think that is a 
good idea.  As soon as schedules normalized following the holidays, I will be 
back to you with a name.
