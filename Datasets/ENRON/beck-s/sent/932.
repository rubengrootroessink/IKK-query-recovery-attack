Audience for the report?  Is it you and Philippe, or will the report be 
distributed to all on your memo distribution list?  May make a difference in 
information provided.  

We can update you on progress toward commercialization of mid and back office 
operations in the report.  Would you also like some operating data - # of 
deals, bcf scheduled, etc.?  We can come up with a format and suggested 
content this week.  --Sally
