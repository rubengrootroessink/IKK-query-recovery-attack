Great idea -- hopefully we can make that happen.  These days with Mom and 
Dad, I have asked Patti to copy you, Cindy and them on my travel plans.  That 
way all of you will have numbers where I can be reached if something were to 
come up.  Hopefully, never needed!  

Have a great time in New York later this week.  I sent you a newspaper 
article in the mail today, that you may get before you leave.

Hey, Sal - just got your itinerary from Patty.  Sometime, just to be crazy,
we should try to travel to the same place at the same time - and we could go
out at night together!     -Cara
