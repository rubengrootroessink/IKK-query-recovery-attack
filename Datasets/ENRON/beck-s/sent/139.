I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday, October 20.  My 
dad is experiencing serious health problems, and he is coming to Houston for 
a doctor's appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.  I will be 
going with him to the appointment.  I will have my cell phone with me 
(713-417-1591) and I will check messages throughout the day.

trading operations issues:
