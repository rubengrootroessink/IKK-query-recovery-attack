The scholarships, while sponsored by Enron, are technically awarded by UT.  I 
will be talking with Sue White today, and I will get her take on whether or 
not the university wants to contact the winners or whether Enron should do 
it.  I will let you know.  

The 24th is a great day for me for the dinner in Austin.  So if that works 
for recepients and faculty, then that would work our well.  Keep me posted.

Thanks, Sally, for the update.  The only day that Rick is available is 
Monday, April 24 - this definitely limits us! I've asked Sharron to find out 
if others can't make it on the 24th (the recipients, Dean May, interviewers), 
would he rather have it on another day that week without him or have it in 
the fall once school starts again. Sharron will let me know what Rick says 
today.  Then, I'll call Sue White to start getting the ball rolling with 
schedules on campus.  I've tentatively booked Jeffrey's private room again 
for the 24th.

Do you want me to notify the winners?  I'm happy to do so.

Elyse

We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene 
Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this 
morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based 
on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today 
with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via 
voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule 
would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow 
morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not 
anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.  
However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients 
until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to 
confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses 
for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official 
notification from the University takes place.  

Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin 
if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the 
dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick 
Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he 
may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she 
would like to be included if her schedule permits.  

Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me 
know how I can help with these arrangements.

Sue:  Greetings!  We have not spoken in awhile, but I wanted to touch base 
with you regarding the MBA Excellence Awards and specifically hosting a 
dinner similar to last year's event at Jeffrey's.  I am expecting a baby in 
two weeks, so I'd like to get as much of this planned now as possible!  Amy 
Lee, Charla Stuart and Ali Saler who work in my group will pick up any of the 
pieces that I don't get to prior to becoming a mom, and one of them will 
attend the dinner in Austin.

I have a number of questions:  First, have the award winners been chosen?  
notified? What are their names/phone numbers? Can you help us with the guest 
list from the university?  How does the week of April 24 look on the 
university's calendar?  If we can't find a date before the school year ends, 
we could have the dinner during the beginning of the fall semester, but I'd 
like to try for the end of April/beginning of May.

I would like to use the Josephine House at Jeffrey's Restaurant again - it 
worked well last year, but I haven't called them yet - waiting to hear 
answers to the questions above...

Have a great day!  I can be reached by email or phone at 713-853-0565.

Thanks!
Elyse Kalmans
