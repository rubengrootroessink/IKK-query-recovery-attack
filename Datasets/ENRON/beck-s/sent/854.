Subject: NABA photo shoot


EES and Sally Beck's organization in EWS are joining forces to underwrite
Enron's recruiting presence at the 30th Annual National Association of
Black Accountants National Conference and Job Fair this August in Dallas,
Texas.  NABA is an professional organization of 100,000 African Americans
in the fields of accounting, finance, consulting and IT.

We are planning a photo shoot of a check presentation to the Executive
Director of NABA, who is making a special trip to Houston for this purpose.
The photo and caption will appear in the pre-conference NABA newsletter to
its members (not a paid advertisement).  We would like to have Cindy,
Sally, Wes, Ted and the representative from EES in the photo, if possible.
We also need to decide whose signature should appear on the mocked up check
for the photo - what do you think?

We are checking on dates for the shoot now, and Debbie Nowak will be
contacting you/your assistants to check for your availability.  (likely
contenders are Feb 23 around mid-day and March 2)

We are excited about Enron's participation in this conference and look
forward to some great hires.

Thanks,

Gwynn
