Great idea to run this by Louise.  She ususally has some good ideas on how 
things should look and feel online.  I would love to see it, too.  Thanks.

Sally,
It is on the list as a medium priority and we can discuss more on Monday.

I would not say that the system is totally done.  It is in User testing  -- 
Chris and crew are testing it and I will be getting a demo in the next week 
or two.  It has not been rolled out to the user community.  

I am also going to challenge them to think about whether there are any more 
quick "cosmetic" things that we could do with out much more time or cost.

Do you want to have a look before it rolls out?

Also  I thought maybe giving a preview to Louise would be good since she 
looks at the report pretty regularly, and is a big fan of automation.

Beth

Is this on Vanessa's update list?  Are users happy with the results?

Sally,

I just want to give you an update on the Executive Report Viewer project in 
case you are not aware of the status. The development of the ERV project has 
been completed and delivered on schedule. The feedback from the demo was very 
positive. The application has been handed over for user acceptance test.

Thanks

Zhiyong
