Rick:  This is a draft of the language to be used in a McConnell/Shankman 
memo to go out on their new organization.  I worked with Mike on the language 
for this paragraph.  Any comments or suggested changes?
Mike would like to send this out ASAP, ideally this afternoon.  Thanks for 
taking a look.
