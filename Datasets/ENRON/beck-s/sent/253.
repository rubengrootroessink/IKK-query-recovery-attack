As requested by Shona, attached is a blank SOAP form, a completed SOAP form 
for your review and a simple presentation on how the SOAP process operates. 
Hope you find it useful. Please come back to me if you need any more info.

Anthony

I'm in the process of putting together some slides for the presentation on 
the 7th.  In doing this, I was reviewing the global operations presentation 
and  noted on the global operations initiative slide one of the initiatives 
listed is "creation of due diligence checklist for acquisitions." I know 
Naomi Connell has put together the SOAP which her group in London uses for 
this purpose which might be useful.  

Naomi - could you send the three of us a copy of this document?

Thanks

Shona
