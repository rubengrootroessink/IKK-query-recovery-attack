Sally,

Project Apollo has asked me to come up with a functional person from the 
business unit who will be responsible for sign off on the SAP/Unify 
interfaces.   My feeling is that there should be at least one person from the 
Settlements area and one person from Georgeanne Hodges' accounting group 
involved in the signoff.

To date we have been working very closely with Melissa White and Regan Smith 
from the technical side.  Additionally, there have been design workshops 
which have been attended by Lisa  Csikos and Evelyn Aucoin.  

Who would you like to be involved in this process??

If you could please let me know or let me know if you would like to sit down 
and talk about it.

Cindy
