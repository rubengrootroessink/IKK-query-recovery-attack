Thanks for the responses -- all look great.  I like coming over knowing that 
my calendar will be pretty full.  Dinner sounds great, too.  I am having 
dinner with Beth Apollo on Monday evening to talk more about her assignment.  
I received a note from Fernley asking about dinner on Thursday evening also.  

Hope that the New York trip was worthwhile and that the trip back was 
smooth.  --Sally

Subject: Topics for next week

Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I 
was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day, - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the 
issue being that we may not in the short/medium term be able to change 
systems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process 
and tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&l, 
new activity p&l and position signoff on trade date with 'officialisation' of 
books on T+1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring process

Also I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at 
same time - more for information on this  - because when we 'solve' market 
risk reporting issues we will face big push to 'clean' credit exposure 
reporting process - Office of Chair is very insistent on this

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 
Would defintely welcome this - I can walk through the European MO issues 
trying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is Metals

I would like to spend some time on Metals with you - hence the lunch on 
Wednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for 
Metals ( Brokerage and Merchanting ) - the starting place for this will be 
the presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December.

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 
Would like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting, 
self assessment of Op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a 
small group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome 
some more background of why Rick,Rick and yourself need the process to be 
successful - I think they understand ( I have fully promoted it ) but your 
'asides' explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office 
related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR
As explained above - additionally I would like to walk you through the 
implementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross 
prioritise all IT development efforts - a meeting with Steve Whitaker, Mark 
and Fernley on this would be useful

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE - certainly in 
calendar and signed off by the executive committee of one ( my wife !!! )

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 
 - can you let me know some more of this - I am uncertain of it

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services - The below is a 
section of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow - I 
would like to expand on these and other thoughts - particularly the absence 
of vision/strategy documentation for CL

Lead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements ( note 
this is my definition of what CL should be doing ) including :-
Changing Market practices
create cashflow messaging within each transaction
create payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and 
liquidation 
re-evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes 
to terms of trade
Module/Application developments
Synergy from internal process changes ( pulling Settlements and Documentation 
together )
elimination of paper/fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic 
messaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of 
payment advices at inception ( based upon planned trade settlement  ) and at 
liquidation ( based upon actual trade settlement )

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also 
spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan 
to meet with Fernley as well.  

Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  Can I suggest we also 
cover 
Remote offices with Naomi Connell
The ledger control process - similarities and differences with Houston
Static reference control processes - ( Global 
Counterparties/Companies/Contracts/Facilities etc )
Themes from our business process reengineering reviews prior to Christmas - 
similar to bottom up Op risk assessment
A gap analysis for the risk management team - explaining the 'legacy' work 
that James New has been leading on 
Our plans for EAS in Europe 

I shall call to discuss / prioritise and then I can instruct Fiona to 
organise meetings

Mike

  
I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday - as above 
but would you also be available for dinner with the controllers and Fernley ?
