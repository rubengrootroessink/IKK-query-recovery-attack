FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this 
week.  I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.  I will be 
back in the office on Wednesday of next week. 

Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If 
not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next 
Wednesday.   

If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process 
and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back 
in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff 
Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours 
that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and 
compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which 
activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed  
to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the 
best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to 
simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.  All of the 
advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, 
auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm 
group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for 
implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.
