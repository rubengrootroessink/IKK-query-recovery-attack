Definitely take off and meet Scott at the airport.  I know that you will be 
glad to see him.

Subject: I need to leave office early today

Sally,

If you don't mind, I'd like to leave early today (2 or 3 pm) to pick up Scott 
(my son) at the airport.  He went to Denver to visit his sister for spring 
break & was scheduled to come back Monday evening.  Unfortunately, due to 
winter storm, all flights were cancelled Monday & most of Tuesday.  I wasn't 
able to get him a flight back until this morning.  Scott, however, was not 
too disappointed in missing 3 days of school (instead of 1 that we planned).  
Anyway, if it's okay with you, I will let your direct reports know that Irena 
will have numbers where they can reach you.

PT
