> >> I'll call Bruce, who identified himself as a 26-year-old aerobics

> >> well
> >> worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Bruce waiting for

> >> He is something of a Greek God - with blond hair, dancing eyes and a
> >> dazzling white smile.  Woo Hoo!
> >>      Bruce gave me a tour and showed me the machines.  He took my

> >>
> >>    Tuesday:

> >> Bruce
> >> made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air - then
