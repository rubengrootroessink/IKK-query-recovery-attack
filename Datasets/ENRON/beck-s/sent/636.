John and I haven't talked about this need, but I will certainly think about 
any likely candidates.  Danny Clark, who used to work in Deal Clearing & 
Documentation for ECT a couple of years ago, is in EES as far as I know.  He 
was knowledgeable and meticulous, understood trading as he was a risk book 
administrator in a previous life.  Have you considered him?  Give me a couple 
of days to think about potential candidates from within ENA, and I will get 
back with you.  --Sally

Well, we're a few years behind you, but one of my goals is to set up a 
confirm desk for EES.  John Echols told me he gave you a call to see whether 
there were any candidates from your shop for whom this might be an 
opportunity.  Please let me know if  any background or perspective would be 
helpful. 
thanks.
