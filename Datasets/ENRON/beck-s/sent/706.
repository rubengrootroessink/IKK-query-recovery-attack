Sally,

This includes most of the suggestions Andy made (all the word/format relate=
d=20
ones, at least).  The only one I have not made relates to our discussion=20
about adding a slide that outlines the history behind the Operations Pricin=
g=20
Desk and the various factors considered in building it.  Please let me know=
=20
if you=01,re busy and want me to glean the information from the slides you =
have=20
archived.

Lets talk about it in more detail tomorrow.  If you need me at anytime,=20
please feel free to contact me on my cell phone at 281.704.1060
