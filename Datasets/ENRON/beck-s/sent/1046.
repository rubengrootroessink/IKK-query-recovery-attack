Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 
accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let 
me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another 
delivered.  

Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill 
team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional 
attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze.
