We will look forward to seeing you in Rick Causey's CAO Staff Meeting on May 
9th at 8:30 in EB46C1.  I listened to your voice mail message --thanks for 
the clarification around the recruiting process for one analyst program.  

My dad was released from the hospital on Saturday, following what seemed like 
a very long ten day stay.  He lost a lot of weight while being fed only by IV 
for 8 of those days, so he is under orders to eat everything in sight!  
Hopefully, this most recent operation will result in overall better health 
for him going forward.  Thanks for asking.  --Sally

Sally, I received your voice mail and responded to it.  However, I wanted to 
follow-up to confirm that we would be able to attend the Staff Mtg. on May 
9th at 8:30.  We will begin so that you guys can carry on after we are 
finished.  I left some information regarding recruiting on the voice mail.   
If that was not clear please give me a call.
Thanks

P.S.  How is your dad?
