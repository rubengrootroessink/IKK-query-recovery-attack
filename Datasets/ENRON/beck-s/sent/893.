Julie called me immediately after getting my e:mail message about you.  Her 
role has changed once again at  Enron!   She is running more of a 
fundamentals group at present.  Wanted to know if you would be interested in 
that.  Told her that I couldn't speak for you.  I'd suggest that you contact 
her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first 
interest.  Can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time 
with her.  You may not then be interested in her rotation, but you'll know 
more and she will know you.  

FYI - she is a University of Nebraska graduate.  --Sally
