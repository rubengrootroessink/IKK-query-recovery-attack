I will be on vacation the week of March while my children are on Spring 
Break.  We will be out of town Monday through Wednesday, looking at colleges 
with Meagan.  We should return to Houston on Wednesday night.  I have planned 
to be out of the office for the balance of the week, but may decide to return 
to work on Thursday and Friday.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will 
have contact numbers for me while I am out of town in case something urgent 
arises.  I will also let her know during the week whether or not I will be 
back at work on Thursday and Friday.
