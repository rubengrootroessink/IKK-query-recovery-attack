Hopefully, those guys would stand out in the Woodlands like a sore thumb and 
would choose to go elsewhere.  Would be nice to have them behind bars, 
however. Doesn't make George W.'s record on executions look like such a bad 
idea, does it?  

I left Houston on Sunday afternoon.  Any new news on those 7?  --Sally

Nope - we're fine. Thanks.

The only thing we need is for the Texas police to catch the inmates on the 
run - that's making Jo pretty nervous.

Thanks for your e:mail message and your voice mail at home.  I appreciate 
your nice thoughts.  

I am in London all week - is there anything that you or Jo need that I could 
bring back for you?  Just let me know.  I will be back in the office next 
Monday, the 22nd.  --Sally

You are a top class colleague.

Barry.
