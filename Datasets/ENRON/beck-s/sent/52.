Thanks for sending the announcement to me.  You will be a great asset to 
EBS.  And you will probably be working with some of our old Energy Operations 
staff members!  Stay in touch and I wish you the best in your new role.

Please join me in congratulating Inja Chun on her new position with EBS.  
Inja has made numerous contributions to Enron's information technology, most 
recently helping to develop a new e-Commerce venture for Enron in Korea.  We 
would like to wish her success in her new endeavor where she will be working 
on the development of new systems for EBS and express our appreciation for 
her 5+ years of service in Enron Net Works. 

Dan Bruce
