Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training 
provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is 
an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for 
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away 
from the desk is not very workable either.  

After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to 
book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be 
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.    
Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this 
decision?  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,
Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further
