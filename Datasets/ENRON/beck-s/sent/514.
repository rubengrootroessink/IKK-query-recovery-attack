We would love to see all three of you.  Sounds as if you might arrive on 
Friday around 5:00 or 6:00, so we will plan on dinner together.  You can see 
the kitchen in progress!!  The upstairs is untouched, however, so you can 
make yourselves at home.  I will let everyone know tonight, and they will all 
be glad to see you.  

I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend, so I didn't know that she might 
change her plans.  I will try to catch her tonight.  

Just let me know on the $'s.  I can send that whenever you might need it.  
And I would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as 
you all get caught up on other things.  No rush.  

Love, Sally
