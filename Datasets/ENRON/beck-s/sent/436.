I did walk out of the room with the two booklets (employee profiles and 
pre-review rankings) that had been distributed, and I left a message with 
Sheila Knudsen as soon as I got back to my office on Wednesday night to let 
her know.  They were delivered to Sheila on Thursday morning.  Can you verify 
that Sheila received those from me?  Thanks.  --Sally

Subject: Help - Missing Profile Books!

Hi everyone!

We asked at the meeting on Wednesday for all profile books to be left on the 
table so that they did not get outside the meeting.  At the end, we collected 
them back and 4 books seem to be missing.  

If you mistakenly took a profile book from the meeting please return it to me 
at EB1534 as soon as possible.  

FYI - none of the ratings books were missing so thanks!

Regards,
Kim
