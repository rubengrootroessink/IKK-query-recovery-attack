I went by the store on my way home and saw a Pillsbury mix with red and green 
confetti in it - decided that cupcakes would be simpler than cookies.  Since 
it was after 10:00 when I got started on this project, it turned out be a 
good decision.  I would like your recipe so that when we are doing baking for 
the family next week that I can use it.
