Read about the Owens-Corning bankruptcy filing and what it means to Enron.

Also in this issue:
Enron keeps asking "Why"
The New Power Company hits "The Street"
Metals get recycled

It's all in the latest eBiz.  Go to home.enron.com, click Publications, 
then click eBiz, and "eBiz October 6, 2000."
