Subject: Counterparty Names

Sally - per our conversation I have attached the message Jeff sent out this 
morning.  We will follow up to ensure the source of incorrect cp names as 
well as timeliness in correcting those.  I am meeting with Debbie Brackett in 
credit on Wed. to review current process and procedures and make changes as 
needed.

Thanks,
Leslie

Please make sure that your groups are changing counterparty names as soon as 
they get the correction forms from confirmations.  With prices at these 
levels, it is vital that all information be correct in the system,  whether 
or not it has an impact on your p&l. 

Thanks
