Amanda is at camp from Sunday, May 28 until Saturday, June 10.  Then Meagan 
leaves on Sunday, June 11 and will return on Saturday, June 24.  If we decide 
to do a family vacation, it would be either the week of June 26, July 3 or 
July 10.  After that, Meagan starts Bearkadette practices through school 
start in August, with a few days at Bearkadette camp July 20-24.  Looks as if 
we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer, 
unless Amanda schedules her Austin visit during one of Meagan's two stints at 
camp.  Let me know when you want to talk dates.

Sally - Great!  THanks for the reply.  I'm glad those are the earrings.
Yes, I hope things start getting better for M & D.   I do want to come for a
visit.   Chris and I haven't even had a chance to talk about it.  We will do
that so you and I can talk dates.    Since we'll probably get to see Amanda
while she's here (and Meagan's pretty booked anyway) , I wonder if it might
be fun to visit you guys when it's just you and Tyler - that way we'll get
lots of time with you guys and Mr. T?      -Cara
