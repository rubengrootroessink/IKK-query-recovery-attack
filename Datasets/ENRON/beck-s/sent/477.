I heard this morning from Susan Harrison that Sandra had submitted a letter 
of resignation to Bryce Baxter, who reports to Susan.  I have not talked 
directly with Bryce and I have not seen the resignation letter to date this 
afternoon.   I have left a message for Bryce and I will get with him on 
Tuesday morning to see a copy of the letter and then can leave you a message 
after that.  --Sally

Jeff/Sherri,

Wanted to keep you posted on this. Without gettting into too many details on 
the conversations with Cindy Olson, Sally Beck, and Kim Melodick, I have 
decided to 
bring this to closure myself and will submit my resignation to my manager 
this morning.

Thanks again.

Sherri,

You probably already know this, but I will be meeting with Cindy Olson and 
Kim Melodick (previously met with Kim) on Monday (4/17) @ 10:00 a.m. Thanks 
again.
