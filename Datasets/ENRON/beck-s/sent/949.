The flight was uneventful, although I didn't sleep very much.  Weather here 
is cold but clear, so I am enjoying it.  Very useful trip - they have my 
schedule very full, including dinners every night.  I will be in the office 
through end of day Thursday, and then dinner with Fernley Thursday night.  I 
will be in route to Houston on Friday - catching a 9:00am flight (told the 
kids that I would be at the airport at 2:00 am Houston time to start back 
home).  

We are not going to follow the Kean/Olson memo on communicating ratings.  We 
will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be differing 
messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear 
that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help 
us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to 
find another role within or outside Enron which is a better fit).  Message to 
someone new to Enron in that category should be different.  Glad they are 
here; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they 
will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to 
learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough 
to warrant payment of a bonus...

Thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this.  --Sally

Hope you had a good flight to London and that the trip is going well.

Just a quick question about communication of rankings.  ARE WE????

Hector seems to think not, yet the memo from Steve and Cindy says something
about sat and needs improvement.

Just let me and I'll make sure we are all on the same page.

thanks

bob
