Beth Apollo has recently joined the team and Brenda Herod has recently 
married.  February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to 
try to celebrate both of these occasions.  In honor of Beth's arrival and 
Brenda's marriage, I hope that you can join David and me for drinks and 
appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions 
Golf Club.  Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also 
be happy to just have you attend.  Let me know if that date will work for 
you.
