Subject: Wholesale Deal Meetings

The following is from Mike Patrick:

Wes Colwell's Hot List Meetings have previously been held on Thursdays at 
1:30pm and attended by various parties.  This meeting has been replaced by 
the Wholesale Deal Meeting to be held at the same time and location.  The 
attendees will be comprised of each Wholesale Business Unit's CAO, 
Transaction Support lead, Tax lead and Energy Operations management.  The 
meeting will be held bi-weekly and will be adjusted as necessary.   Please 
note that the first meeting will be held tomorrow, Thursday February 22 at 
1:30pm in EB3321.

The purpose of this meeting is :

1) For the CAO/Transaction support lead to summarize the Top 3 deals for the 
quarter in each business unit, focusing on any potential issues that might 
derail the closing of the deal, and

2) For the Transaction Support team to update the group on any global 
accounting issues, and

3) To create/maintain a "Wholesale Critical Deal Sheet" comprised of 
Wholesale's Top Ten critical deals

The meeting is not intended to be a business unit administration meeting 
(i.e., floor space, SAP, etc.).  I believe Wes still plans to hold a 
Wholesale CAO meeting to discuss other non-deal issues.

Following are the dates of the upcoming meetings.  The meetings will be held 
from 1:30pm - 2:30pm in EB3321.
