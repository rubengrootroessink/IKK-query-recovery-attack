Hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that I would send a quick note 
to say hello.  Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but 
it is busy here!  Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day 
business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES 
(my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to 
find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support 
costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in 
June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services.    
All of these of course with top priority!  

I am really enjoying having Beth Apollo on the team.  She has already made  a 
very positive impact, while she is learning the details of the operations 
side.  

How is life treating you?  I know that their is a lot going on in the London 
office, as well.  How has Ted Murphy's assimilation into the London office 
been?  Do you have plans to be in Houston any time soon?  

Keep me posted tomorrow on any news that you hear from Mike Jordan regarding 
their baby.  

Hope that all is well with you.  --Sally
