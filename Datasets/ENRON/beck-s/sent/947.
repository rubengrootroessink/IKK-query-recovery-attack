Thanks for your nice note.  It is always interesting to scan the list and do 
a count of other females names.  Were not too many on this latest list.  We

Sally,

Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  It is well deserved 
and most appropriate.  In addition,  it always warms my heart when I see a 
woman promoted to the highest rank in our company.  

Best regards, Jean
