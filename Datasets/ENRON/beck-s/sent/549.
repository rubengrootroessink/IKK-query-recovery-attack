1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John 
Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft 
now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he 
made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, 
meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive 
those drafts today.  

2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply 
to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was 
asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am 
there.    

3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are 
the following:

Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide 
for you during this transition period
Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of 
the details on having support personnel in London 

Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for 
Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one 
(which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)

Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is 
appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective 
trading operations and controls world-wide

I look forward to seeing you next week.
