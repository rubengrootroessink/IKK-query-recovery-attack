Brent & Peggy,

Memo complete with exception of last paragraph write-up of your promotions.  
Sally made a beginning stab at it, but would like you to read over your 
segment and make any corrections or additions that you see fit (Peggy, in 
your case, can you fill in the blank).  When these are received back from 
you, I will call her (if it's this afternoon), and final copy will be 
distributed.  Thanks for your help.
