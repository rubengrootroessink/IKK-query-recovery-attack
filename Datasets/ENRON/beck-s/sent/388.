Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.  I should have 
had these for you on Tuesday for your PRC.  Hopefully, better late than 
never.  I am not certain how the coporate-wide PRC process will work in late 
July for VP's.  I have provided a copy of this to Dave Delainey for the ENA 
PRC which will take place on July 7.  I thought that I would provide you a 
copy as well.  

I will also have Patti deliver a hard copy to Sharron next week.
