Subject: Scott Earnest Out of Office

Scott Earnest is travelling late this afternoon to Richmond, Virginia, to 
meet with Media General.  He will return to the office on Friday morning 
around 10:00 a.m.

Scott will be in negotiations and will not have his cell phone or pager on.  
He will check voice mails frequently.  I will be available to take messages 
also.

Regards,

Sue Foust
