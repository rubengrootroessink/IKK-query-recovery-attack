Save the date note would be great if you can do that.  --Sally

Sally - HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Sorry I missed your call last night; I
was walking with another prego from the office.

Your payment offer is very generous;  I"m sure we can work it out.  I have
no problem putting it on my card for now.  We have the go-ahead from Cindy,
too - so I think I will go ahead and confirm with Jeffrey's this week.  When
you come in next weekend, maybe we can all look at the sample menus, and get
that decided as well.

Maybe we should send a little "save the date" note to the cousins to let
them know?   I would be glad to do that.

Thanks for your input.   I bet I will talk with you later today, on your
special day!    -cara
