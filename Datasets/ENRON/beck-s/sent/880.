Thanks for the info.  I am going to have to miss the luncheon tomorrow.  
Despite what seems to be a definite scheduling challenge, I am trying to do 
two lunches this week - one with operations personnel promoted to manager 
(about 15 of those) and one with operations personnel promoted to director or 
senior director (smaller group).  To make this work while the promotion 
announcements are still timely, we have had to schedule on Tuesday this week 
for one of the lunches.  I will get an update from Shona.

Subject: Upcoming Risk Management Policy Changes

Attached is a memo summarizing policy changes and revised trading limits that 
will be recommended to the BOD for approval on the 13th, next week.  We can 
discuss at the Risk Forum Luncheon tomorrow (Chris, you're invited also) - 
some DPR reporting practices may need modification to aggregate commodity 
risk across the company.

Regards,
Cassandra.
