Yes, just call Wanda and let her know that Rick has asked that we add EES 
Houston to the Doorstep review schedule.  In keeping with other reviews, I 
would not necessarily give Wanda the dates.  We should also send a short memo 
to Kevin and Marty to fill them in on the process and purpose of the 
reviews.  I should probably send that to them.  Can you remind me when I am 
back in town the week of January 22?  Thanks.

Dear Sally,

Would you like me to get together with Wanda and determine how to break this 
news?

Thanks

Absolutely.  We may need to let Kevin Hannon and Marty Sunde know this in 
advance.

Dear Rick & Rick,

Encompassed in the Doorstep schedule given to you during our last meeting 
were scheduled reviews for London and Houston EES offices.  Do you consider 
EES and EBS to be groups that should be scoped into the Doorstep reviews?  
Since we have never addressed this specifically, I'd like to get your 
thoughts.

Thanks

Shona
