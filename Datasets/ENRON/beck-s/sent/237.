I was out of town last week doing some recruiting, so I am just reading your 
e:mail today.  I have passed this along to Lisa Cousino and she should be 
getting back to you.

Subject: Petro Canada

Eric Le Dain is renegotiating the Petro Canada contract and has a question 
with regard to costs.  Canada is allocated a portion of your groups costs via 
the service agreement and we are trying to determine what portion would be 
applicable to PetroCanada.  Can you provide me with the name of an individual 
in your group with whom I could discuss this allocation.  I'm going to have 
to provide Eric with an answer by early next week.  Thanks for your 
assistance.
