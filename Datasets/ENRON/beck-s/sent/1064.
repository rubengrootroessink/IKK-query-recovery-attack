Subject: Manual Wires

All,

We are shifting from SAP pay entity 0530 to 1021 on January 1, 2000.  As part 
of this process, we will be sending ALL MANUAL WIRES for GBP and EUR and all 
intercompany payments for the first week of January.  Corporate Treasury does 
not want to open new bank accounts, but we will need our existing accounts 
configured for company 0530 until December 2000 close.  Once December 2000 is 
closed, we will be back to sending payments though the system.

Mary Perkins has agreed that the Treasury group will accept all manual 
wires.  

We will do our best not to inundate you with wire requests throughout the 
day, but instead bring them in batches.    Thank you very much for your 
understanding and assistance!

If possible, could you please let me know via email or a phone call if you 
will be in Jan 2-5?  Thank you!
