Count me in - I have really enjoyed doing this during the past two years.   I 
will review the 16 applications and will rank order the top eight for you by 
the end of this week.  For your planning purposes, I will be available to 
interview at UT during the week of March 26.  Best days for me are Tuesday, 
March 27 and Thursday, March 29.  I can make other days work as well.  For 
the luncheon during the week of April 16, I am available on April 16, 17, 18 
or 19th.  Hope this helps.  

If you do not have enough response from your list below, let me know and I 
will help put together a team to interview potential scholarship recepients 
on campus.  --Sally

From: Karen Marshall, University Affairs
 

I want to thank each of you for your past participation in the selection 
process of the recipients of the UT Enron MBA Excellence Scholarships.  As 
you know, the Enron Endowed scholarships are part of a $3 million gift to the 
school  with $1 million earmarked to endow the Enron UT MBA excellence fund.  
Our scholarships are among the largest at the McCombs School of Business and 
it is important to seek the highest level of involvement for the selection of 
this prestigious award.  Because of your knowledge of the company, your  
judgement and your leadership ability, I am soliciting your help again in 
selecting the recipients of the 2001 scholarships.  

The school has submitted sixteen outstanding candidates for Enron's 
consideration and are confident that we are reviewing the very best out of 
over 100 first year MBA students who actually applied for our scholarships.  
It is now up to us to determine who the final 3 recipients of the $10,000 
scholarships will be.  We are seeking the best and brightest students who 
exemplify the vision, values and beliefs of Enron, regardless of commitment 
to a career in energy.   

In order to expedite the process, I am sending you  the package  with the 16 
applicants for your review.  I would like to get your feedback in rank order 
of the top 8 candidates no later than March 16th.  After we have narrowed the 
pool down  to the top 8 candidates, I will contact the students and arrange 
for a face to face interview in Austin with the Enron team members that are 
able to travel to UT  to make the final selection of the winners.

The school has a very tight deadline that we must comply with for the 
selection of candidates.   Below is a timeline of the process: 

March   6, 2001  - Send applications to Enron Team for review
March 16, 2001 -  Reply to Karen Marshall with the ranking of the top 8 
candidates based on the application
March 19,  2001 - Schedule interviews on campus with Enron team and 
scholarship applicants
March 26, 2001 -   Week of March 26 students are interviewed and winners 
selected
March 29, 2001 -   Announcement of Scholarship  Winners 
April 16, 2001    -  Week of April 16th, schedule a small intimate luncheon 
with Enron executive and the scholarship winners
Sept 10, 2001-      Week of Sept 10th, schedule Scholarship Award Dinner for 
winners and their family, the faculty, the Dean and the Enron team 

If your schedule does not allow you to participate in the selection process 
this year, please let me know immediately so that we don't miss the 
deadlines.  

Thank you in advance for your support.

Karen Marshall
