Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran 
through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number.  
I think that I saw yours.  Did I miss you sometime this weekend?  With almost 
two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down 
the list in importance.  I an never quite sure that I get messages that 
anyone calls!  Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during 
my commute tonight again.  

Hope you had a good weekend.  Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and 
continuing the search for new clothes.  Our friend Mo was in town from London 
and had burgers with us on Saturday night.    --Sally
