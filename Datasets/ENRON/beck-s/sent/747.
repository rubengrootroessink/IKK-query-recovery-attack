The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session call=
ed=20
Executive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP lev=
el=20
and above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the cla=
ss=20
was very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is us=
ed=20
in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two =
to=20
three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the=20
participant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees. =
=20

Enron will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior=20
Directors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our=
=20
organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't=
=20
find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot=
=20
out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want t=
o=20
work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will =
be=20
offered in May, September, November and February (2002). =20

However, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first=
=20
session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to ha=
ve=20
several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion=20
would be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors an=
d=20
that we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as=20
directors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these=20
names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know an=
d=20
we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would ha=
ve=20
to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that=
=20
the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know=
=20
your recommendation on a substitution. =20
Thanks.=20
