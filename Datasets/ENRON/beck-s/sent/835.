I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to 
reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied 
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best 
decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of 
core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value 
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.  
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will 
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end 
users.   

Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.  
Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate 
re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few 
weeks.  
Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  While it was a tough 
decision, I feel comfortable having made it.
