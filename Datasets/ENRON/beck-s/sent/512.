Weather:  The gross book balance of the Weather Risk book is smallest after 
the winter season (majority of trades roll off in March) and alot of business 
is executed during September.  Although September would probably be OK, it 
may be helpful it the review was moved to June/July.

Pulp, Paper and Lumber-:  Looks OK.

Although it is not ENA, I would recommend a review of EBS  Bandwidth Trading 
for the latter part of the year.  I'm not sure how this would get scheduled.
