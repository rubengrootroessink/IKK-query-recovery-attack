See names below for your IT contacts tonight - one on 32 and one on 31.  Do 
you know these folks?  They should be visibly on your floors.  Let me know if 
that doesn't happen.  --Sally

Zhiyong / Jeremy,

I need to give Sally Beck a name(s) for the extended cover tonight.

Could I have this name before our meeting at 5pm please?
