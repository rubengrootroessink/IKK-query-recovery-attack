I know that you left a message with Patti about contacting David Eastlake.  I 
have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not 
get a message about undeliverable e:mail.  I haven't heard back from him.  
The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.  
I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they 
would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better 
contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before 
Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any 
students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week 
again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to 
Austin early.  

Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I 
did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will 
try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to 
school early.  

I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was 
a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.  
(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have 
an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his 
understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few 
minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you. 

Since full-time offers were changed, did we appropriately change summer 
intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that.  
Let me know.  --Sally
