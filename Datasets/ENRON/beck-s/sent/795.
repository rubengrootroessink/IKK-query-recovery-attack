Have you heard any more about this?  I didn't see it on my calendar.  This 
does conflict with Philippe's Thursday staff meeting I believe.  Maybe 
Philippe will cancel that.  Let me know.  Thanks. --Sally

Subject: Lite Bytz Panel Discussion

In recognition of the one-year anniversary of Enron Net Works (ENW), Beth 
Perlman is hosting a panel discussion at the April 12th session of her Lite 
Bytz weekly lunchtime series.  The panel, which will be comprised of ENW 
leaders, will be open forum and interactive.  We will invite the audience to 
submit questions in advance and also have the opportunity to present 
questions directly to you, at the session.  Beth indicated that this special 
presentation would not be complete without you.  This should be a fun and 
presenter-friendly session with virtually no preparation on your part 
required.  I will contact your assistant to confirm your availability for 
this special anniversary session of Lite Bytz, scheduled for April 12, 2001, 
11:30-1:00.
