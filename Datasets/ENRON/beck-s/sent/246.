Sheri Thomas (x36557), one of my direct reports, has responsibility for the 
call center that supports EnronOnline.   There is also a call center for 
Clickpaper.com.  Sheri will know the name of the person who is heading that 
effort as well.  I am sure that it would be interesting to compare notes on 
their efforts and yours.  

Welcome to Enron.  It was nice to meet you last week.  --Sally

Subject: Call Center/Resolution Center contacts

Sally,

Hi.  I am following up from our conversation during the ASE last week 
regarding Call Center/Resolution Center contacts within Enron.  As we 
discussed, I recently moved into the Customer Service Solution Manager role 
within the ISC.  I would appreciate any information (names) that you could 
provide to assist me in coordinating our efforts with those in existence 
within Enron.

Thank you,
Mary
