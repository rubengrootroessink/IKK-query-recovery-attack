Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I 
was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day,

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office 
related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also 
spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan 
to meet with Fernley as well.  

Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  
  
I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday.
