Marc,

Unfortunately, today is not going to work for the revenue model for mid & 
back office services meeting.  How about this coming Monday, Feb 26 from 1:00 
- 2:30 pm?  I have penciled in that time for Sally, Mary Solmonson & James 
Scribner.  Please let me know if that will work for you.

Thanks,
Patti x39106
