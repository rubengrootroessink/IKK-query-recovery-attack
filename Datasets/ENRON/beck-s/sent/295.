I didn't have this on my calendar, Lexi, because I wasn't on the list for 
this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy.  My husband 
has a commitment away from home for Wednesday night, and with the children in 
school already, I can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two 
year-old during prime homework hours.  Patti has some names that I have 
suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.  Very 
few of the names on your e:mail message were on the Recruiting Strategy 
Schedule that you handed out, so I would be surprised if any of these folks 
have this on their calendars.  You may need some of the names that Patti has 
for you.  
I have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and I am in the process 
of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work 
for me.

Subject: MPA Dinner Cruise -- Need Response

Dear UT Recruiting Team Members:

As most of you should know, we are scheduled to participate in the MPA Dinner 
Cruise on Lake Austin Wednesday, August 23 at 6:30pm.  We are co-sponsoring 
this event with KPMG, so our presence is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!

Rick Causey will be unable to attend as he has been chosen for jury duty!!! I 
have also had a few participants notify me that they will be unable to attend.

With this in mind, I am hoping that you will make yourself available to 
participate in this event.  

Please respond via e-mail or give me a call (3-4585) and let me know if you 
will be able to represent Enron at this event.  I will then give you the 
logistics for the event.  It is scheduled to begin at 6:30, so we are 
expected to arrive between 6:00 and 6:15.

Please let me know ASAP if you will be able to help.

Thank you!

Lexi Elliott
