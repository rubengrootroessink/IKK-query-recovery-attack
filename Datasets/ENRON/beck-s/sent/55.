Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM 
and EGM.  Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.  There 
are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through 
December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be 
held on Friday, December 8.  I invite you to sit in on any or all of these 
meetings if you would like to do so.  

The most meaningful meeting will be on  December 8th.  In that meeting, we 
will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists 
and below.  I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the 
preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting 
will not take too long.  We will then review in more detail the managers, who 
will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.  We will also review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  I can also be prepared to 
review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, 
Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally
