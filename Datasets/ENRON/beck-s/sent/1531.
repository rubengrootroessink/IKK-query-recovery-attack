Thanks for the note.  I had received a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor =
?Evaluation Form.  Today I also met with Jim and he provided me with his ?b=
ullet points on your accomplishments and strengths, as well as your summary=
 ?of accomplishments for the period.  If there is anything else that you th=
ink ?would be helpful for me to have, please let me know.  ??I will be in m=
y office (EB3015) between 5:00 and 6:00 today and Tuesday ?without schedule=
d meetings.  If you would like to stop by so that I can put a ?name and fac=
e together, please feel free to do so.  This is my first day back ?in the o=
ffice after vacation, so I have a lot of catching up to do, but I ?would be=
 glad to visit with you for a while.  --Sally ?????Nicole Palczer@ENRON COM=
