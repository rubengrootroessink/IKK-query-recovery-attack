Just remember that the DPR is used as an accounting tool as well. despite my 
constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and 
positions against board approved limits.  So do approach this as 
fact-finding; and then I would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you 
may have with Wes Colwell and the RAC group before any changes are made.  

Looks like a good group.  I hope that all will attend and participate.  Did 
Pam do some due diligence for you before sending this e:mail so that you know 
this date and time works for everyone?  

Keep me posted on progress.  --Sally

Subject: DPR - what it consists of, where it is going

I would like you to join me in discussing the DPR, this Thursday at 9:30am.  
Topics I would like to discuss are:

what is currently reported in the DPR (accrual vs mtm)
company/location groups - what we are currently not capturing
relationship with the risk policy
Economic vs earnings risk - what should be captured

I strongly encourage you to attend as your input will be very valuable in 
helping us determine how we should go forward.  Please let Pamela Sonnier 
(X37531) know whether you can attend or not.

Thanks

Shona
