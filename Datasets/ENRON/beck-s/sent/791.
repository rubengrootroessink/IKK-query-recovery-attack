Hi Dierdre,

I got your name from Christie Patrick as a contact for the Columbia Women in 
Business Conference.  Sally Beck will be attending in place of Christie 
Patrick.  Can you forward me exact address of conference site so I can 
include on Sally's itinerary.  I read in your note to Christie that you would 
be sending invitation w/ directions and address - can you send me a copy 
also?  If not by e-mail, is it something that can be faxed? My fax number is 
713-345-8100.

Thanks for your assistance.  Sally is excited about participating in your 
conference and looks forward to meeting you.

Patti Thompson
Sally Beck's Assistant
