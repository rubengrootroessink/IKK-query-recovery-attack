I think that this sounds like a good plan.  Since Michelle, Clay and Nadege 
are still pending on their fulltime offers, this should help us in the 
cultivation effort.  --Sally

Mike and Sally:

As you know, I attended the AAPL scholarship interviews conducted Tuesday, 
March 6 at OU.  Of the 23 students which interviewed, 3 are current or former 
Enron interns (Clay Shamblin, Michelle Terry, and Nadege Assale).

I have designated $1500 from my budget to be awarded at the EM Spring Awards 
Banquet which will be held April 20 on campus.  

I met with Jody Crook yesterday, and it is our recommendation to award $500 
to Clay, Michelle, and Nadege.  I think this will help impress upon the 
students how Enron values its interns.

The remaining candidates which interviewed ranged from Freshmen to Seniors, 
and I do not feel that awarding them money at this point would necessarily 
improve our success on campus.

I look forward to your feedback.

Regards,

lexi
