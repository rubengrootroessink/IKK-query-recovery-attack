I was promoted effective February 1, 2001 to Managing Director of Global Risk 
Management Operations for Enron Corp. in Houston.  In this role I manage all 
mid and back office services for all commodities markets within Enron's 
wholesale businesses: Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial 
Markets and Enron Europe.  I received my BBA from UT-Austin in 1975 and my 
MBA in 1977.  My maiden name while attending school was Sally White.
