Subject: Enron's 2001 Goals

Our vision to become The World's Leading Company positions our company for 
great success this year and beyond.  Our success is dependent on execution.  
With that in mind, we are making Enron's 2001 corporate and business unit 
goals available to employees.  

Please take a few minutes to review our 2001 goals on Enron's intranet at 
http://172.28.92.190/bowne/    We believe they will help you gain a better 
understanding of our vision for the company and will inspire you to identify 
innovative ways to help your organization and Enron achieve our objectives.  
We have a lot to accomplish this year, and with your hard work and 
dedication, we can realize another year of stellar performance.
