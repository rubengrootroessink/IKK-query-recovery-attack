The name of the restaurant that I liked for lunch was Christophers.  It is at 
Victoria Station, or in the lobby of what was or is a hotel at Victoria 
Station.  Quick walk from the office.  Apparently, there is another location 
at Covent Gardens.  

Dinner last night was fun.  It is always great to see you either in Houston 
or London.  Sorry that our goodbye was so abrupt.  I think that the taxi 
driver was afraid that we would get him killed!  I called home last night and 
told Amanda about our discussion on a day in Paris.  She is ready!!

Let us know when you will next be in Houston.  I should be here quarterly - 
probably head back in March or April.  --Sally
