TJ,

Sorry, please disregard last email - I did not see this follow-up notice.  
Unfortunately, Sally is not available on Thursday either - she will be at the 
Enron Management conference in San Antonio Thursday & Friday.  All Enron VP's 
are invited (Cassandra & Kevin?).

Please call & I can give you Sally's available time if she needs to attend.

Thanks,
Patti x39106
