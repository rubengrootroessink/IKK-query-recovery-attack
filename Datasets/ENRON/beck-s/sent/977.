Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that you are having fun in your new role.  
We will have to schedule lunch so that I can catch up on what you are doing

Sally: Just a short note to congratulate you on your well-deserved promotion. 
I always thought you had the toughest job in the Company; I guess everybody 
else finally caught on!
