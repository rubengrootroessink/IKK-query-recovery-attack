Subject: Quick note

Sorry I missed you yesterday  -- I tried a couple of times to catch you, but 
you were always in a meeting.

I will see you on Monday the 29th.  If anything comes up next week, I can be 
reached at my new temporary home (mother in-laws)  713 520 0766

Also  -- I believe Fernley has passed the Merit raise part of this year end 
comp review over to you, so I thought I would give you the facts.

Base salary $165,000
Foreign Adjustment  $30,000     these two items will go away on Jan 28th  --- 
and I am left with the base salary
Car Allowance           $12000

total regular pay     $207,000

also  -- they have had me on a 2 year contract  (not sure if they do that in 
Houston, but I am willing)  which had some annual cash kickers)


We can discuss when I get there, but in case you need it next week, just 
thought it couldn't hurt.


Looking forward to a fresh start and new challenges.


see you soon

Beth
