Gwynn,

Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted.  She put together a little something 
- if you can use it fine, if not, that's fine too.

Opportunities for accounting professionals in traditional and in 
non-traditional roles, such as transaction structuring, risk analysis and 
commodity operations.

Laura Schwartz and I are working on pulling together the article that goes 
with the photo taken last week for the NABA national newsletter.  We get 
approximately 550 words to tell the Enron story in anticipation of our 
recruiting presence at the NABA national conference in July.  Are there any 
particular messages you would like us to get out there with regard to 
opportunities in EWS and EES for accountants?  Please let me know your 
thoughts before the end of next week (the sooner the better - the final due 
date for photo and story is April 13).

Many thanks
