FYI:

Effective today, the schedulers for HPL have relocated from the 42nd floor to 
the 30th floor.  This team reports to my direct report, Brenda Herod, who is 
the Business Controller for the Asset Group and Texas trading region.  They 
are on the west side of the building, just outside my office.  While room for 
this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made 
to improve communications with the Texas desk traders.  By being within the 
same elevator bank, we can now employ "squawk" boxes between the traders and 
this scheduling team.  As we look at space usage on the 32nd floor, this team 
should be included in space requirements.  We are working with Liz Taylor on 
those requirements.
