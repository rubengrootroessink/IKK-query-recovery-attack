I appreciate the flash P&L that you are now providing.  That should help 
everyone get an early morning picture of what is going on in London.  Have 
you had an opportunity to address the need for European VaR numbers at the 
same time in the morning?

We in London shall be producing a flash P&L from today Monday the 18th of 
December. This will be sent to Shona's group at 1pm London time which 
Ibelieve is in good time for the P&L consolidation group.

Any queries please let me know.

James
