Bob & Leslie,

Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week.   1st one - 
subject:  exactly what CommodityLogic is going to mean to us and how it will 
work for us.  She wants the two of you plus:  Leslie - can you designate your 
best person for ConfirmLogic & InvoiceLogic and Bob your best person for 
NomLogic.  Probably 1 &1/2 hours Monday.  Please let me know your 
availability.

2nd one:  Will probably be Thursday morning - can you check availability for 
this one also (2 hours).  Participants would be all of the above + Greg 
Piper, Tom Gros, Carrie Slagle, Project Managers for InvoiceLogic, 
ConfirmLogic, & BankLogic + Mark Taylor in Legal.  Purpose:  Discussion 
between Project Managers and end users on CommodityLogic.

I will wait to hear from you Monday morning re: 1st meeting.  I will talk to 
Greg's assistant re: his availability on Thursday and get back with you on 
2nd meeting.

Thanks,
Patti x39106
