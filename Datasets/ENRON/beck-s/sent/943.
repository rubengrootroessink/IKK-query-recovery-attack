Silly as it may seem, have Brian Heinrich dig up a copy of the form that we 
used last year for headcount addtions.  Let's complete those for these 
positions and have Fred and Scott Neal sign them.  They need to understand 
the addtional cost associated with these requests.  They will forget later in 
the year if they aren't making much money.  

Do you agree that these positions are needed and will add value?  --Sally

Sally -

Fred would like me to hire an additional person to strictly focus on his 
deals across all commodities.  He says that his people don't have time to 
look at these reports.  Also,  Scott Neal wants 11 new physical books on the 
east region.  This will require at least two more risk people,  and probably 
two new OA people.  We told him that yesterday,  and he was fine with that.
