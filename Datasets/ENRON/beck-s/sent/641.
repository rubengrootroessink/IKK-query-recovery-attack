Sally, Attached are two draft slides that we wish to include in the analyst 
presentation. I am hoping that you will be able to coordinate the extraction 
of the data necessary to complete the slides.

The slides are basically maps of our power and gas operations but surrounded 
with some hard data on particular aspects of the business to demonstrate our 
scope and size. I would suggest that the maps are printed out and you will 
then easily see the data we require and the format we wish to use to present 
it. However , in summary the information needed is:

GAS
Storage Capability, Leased and Owned
Number of Counterparties - 1997, 1998, 1999
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Industrials, LDCs, 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Transport contracts - bcf/d - firm and Interruptible, 
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Peak daily deliveries - Btue/d - 1997, 1998, 1999

POWER
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Marketers, Utilities 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Number of counterparties -1996,1997, 1998, 1999

If there is data that you or your team believe is more appropriate to 
demonstrate our activities in these markets please let me know. I will be 
very grateful for such additional material and information . 

As always our timeline is tight and would therefore appreciate the data by 
close of business Friday.   
Let me know how this works
Thank you, 
Kathryn
