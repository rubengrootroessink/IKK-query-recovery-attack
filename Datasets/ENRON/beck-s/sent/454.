First, please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be 
reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer.  Hopefully 
none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made 
for desk, phone and computers for all.  

Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them 
to Enron.  

Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief 
meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be 
working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this 
summer.  I welcome ideas on this from any of you.
