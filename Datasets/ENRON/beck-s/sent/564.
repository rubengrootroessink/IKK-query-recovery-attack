Am just back from Disneyworld (Tyler loved it, so you will have a great time 
in a few weeks) today, and I did get your message.  I will talk with Kristin 
this afternoon.  I agree that Edith would be great.  I will let you know if 
there is someone else that we can make available if Edith doesn't work.  I 
will leave you a message tonight before I go on status.  --Sally

I left you a voice-mail. Is there anybody with EnPower Risk experience we 
could borrow for 3/4 weeks to help us split our books?

I know Edith Cross would do a great job. Anybody else available? Start date - 
yesterday etc...
