Got your most recent message.  Your observation is correct that the Enron 
Americas staff member on Shawn's team has not been involved to date with 
Doorstep reviews or planning.  Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some 
time ago, there was a long lead time for her arrival.  She did not start with 
the company until after Thanksgiving.  Since she started a couple of weeks 
ago, Wes and I have asked her to look into several specific findings from the 
most AA internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some 
solutions to issues that were raised.  There simply has not been the time to 
date to expose her to Doorstep.  

After Shawn and I meet (see below), I will briefly summarize for you the 
roles that all groups will play in the Doorstep Review process.  Before we 
move forward I want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose, 
methodology, participants and execution plan for this on-going project.

I understand from Shona that you and she have discussed the plans for 
Doorstep Reviews in 2001.  I am asking via this note for my assistant to set 
up a meeting for the two of us to spend some time reviewing the timeline, 
methodology, and the involvement of RAC, Andersen, operations and your team.  
I will be on vacation the week of December 18.  I will be working the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, so if you are in the office we can plan on 
getting together that week.
