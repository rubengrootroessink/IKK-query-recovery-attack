Glad you enjoyed the game.  That was quite a climb to those seats!  I did it 
a couple of times with my two year old in arms, and wasn't sure that I would 
make it!  That's good that you could watch from a lower level. --Sally

Thank you for the tickets to the Saturday game. My wife and I enjoyed it very 
much. We were unable to sit in the Upper Level in the seats ticketed. My wife 
and I came to the fourth level to identify the seats. When we arrived, my 
wife became dizzy as she does in most high places. We watched the game from 
the walkway at level one and were able to enjoy the game. Thanks again for 
the tickets. Enron Field is a nice ballpark.

Bob
