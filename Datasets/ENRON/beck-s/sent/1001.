Your note has made my day.  Thanks for taking the time to send it.  Your 
thoughts and support mean a lot to me.  How lucky I am to have you for a 
sister and friend!  --Sally

Sally,

Have been thinking quite a bit about the work news you told me.  We were
talking about you last night with Mom and Dad.  You really have such a great
gift--you must be able to be able to work so hard, focus so concretely, AND
come up with creative solutions AND manage people.

If I haven't said it recently, I am very proud of you!

Love,

Cindy
