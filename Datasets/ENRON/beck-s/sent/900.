I agree - he does look like a good candidate.  Please do go ahead with a 
phone screen and let me know if we should then interview him.  Thanks.

Sally, 
Looks like a quality candidate.   No industry experience but plenty of good 
background.    Let us know if you would like for our recruiters to phone 
screen him for you and save you an investment of time.

I received this resume through some contacts in the Houston chapter of the 
National Society of Hispanic MBAs.  He is interested in Enron, period.  (I 
called him to clarify his interests:  he is happy for an opportunity to use 
his bilingual skills, and is therefore interested in Enron Europe and Latin 
America, as well as Houston.  He is perfectly content to stay in Houston, 
though.)  

Let me know if this resume looks interesting to you.  Also, who should I send 
this to in London?

Subject: Opportunities with Enron


Gwynn,
First I would like to introduce myself.  My name is Javier Fernandez and I am
the Treasurer of the National Society of Hispanic MBA's Houston chapter.

I had a meeting with Martha Salinas and Kornel Rost this past weekend and
they mentioned that you are looking for bilingual MBA's to help with
European operations.  I am attaching my resume for your review.

As my resume shows, I have an MBA in International Business and am a CPA in
the State of Texas.  I have several years experience in finance and am
looking for something that meets my background.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments and
thank you very much for your time.

Best Regards,
Javier Fernandez
