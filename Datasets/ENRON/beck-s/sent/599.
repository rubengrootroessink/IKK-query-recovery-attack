Hi Sally

I think I'll be in EOL meetings on Thursday and probably won't be able to 
make lunch.

Can we schedule a meeting for Friday please.  Currently I have the whole day 
free so you pick a time which is convenient for you.  I shall book other 
meetings after I have heard back from you.

Regards

Amita

Friday won't work for me for lunch this week, but Thursday is open for me at 
this point.  Would that day work for you?  If lunch won't work, then we will 
plan some time on the calendar for Thursday or Friday.  Let me know.   I will 
look forward to seeing you.
