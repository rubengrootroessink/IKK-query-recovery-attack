I told  Tom last week that I have a standing systems meeting on Thursdays at 
9:00, so this change doesn't work for me.  Can we try 10:00 am on Thursday 
this week?  Thanks. --Sally

Brenda,

Sally has a on-going meeting Thursdays from 9:00 - 10:00 AM (Risk Systems mtg 
w/ Rick Buy, Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman and others - I think it is to deal 
with all the systems problems we have been having lately).
