I am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at Champions Golf Club on Saturday, 
May 5 for my operations team and their spouses.  Greg and I talked about this 
today.  He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar 
and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.  If he and 
his wife are available, I will let you know details as it gets closer.  
Thanks for your help.  --Sally
