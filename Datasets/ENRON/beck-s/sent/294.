If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the 
cruise, let me know.  My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on 
Wednesday night.  If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day 
for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.  This 
is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in 
response from others. But do let me know...
