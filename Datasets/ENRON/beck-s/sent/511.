I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request.  However, in my 
staff meeting on Monday ( I know that Katherine was there, and not you), one 
of the major points that I made centered around my approval of requests for 
EOL access.  We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning.  Susan 
needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form, and the manager 
should  okay this as well.  --Sally
