Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
location for the meeting will be sent to you early next week.  

I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
will keep you from attending the meeting.
