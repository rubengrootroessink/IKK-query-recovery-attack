Sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently.  Congratulations on 
the baby!  I hope that you are feeling well.  I am so happy for you and your 
husband.  My how your lives will change!!  But how enriched they will be.  
Our three are so much fun.  I will also always be honest with expectant moms 
and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it 
sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience.   If you ever want 
some funny stories about adjusting to being a first-time mom, just let me 
know.  I would be glad to share my experience with you.  --Sally
