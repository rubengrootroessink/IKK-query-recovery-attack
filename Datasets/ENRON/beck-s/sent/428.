I got the memo from Naomi that you sent.  First, who is Doug Imrie?  Does he 
have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to 
coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able 
to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump 
start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort 
should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing 
people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and 
effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading 
operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be 
the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in 
operations on a daily basis.  

Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in 
with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York 
offices.  From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is 
assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.  

Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that 
includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been 
involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily 
operational experience?  I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as 
well.
