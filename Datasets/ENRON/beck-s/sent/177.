I always compile a contact list for Energy Operations during the holidays 
(Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years).  Just let me know who appropriate 
contacts will be, especially for the DPR and MPR, during the dates that you 
are out.  Sounds as if you should see a white Christmas!  --Sally

Dear Sally,

I'd like to take vacation from December 15 - 26 to goto Canada.  Please let 
me know if this doesn't fit for some reason.

Best regards,

Shona
