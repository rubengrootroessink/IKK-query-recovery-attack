I will be in London the week of January 15th.  I understand from Beth that 
you and Frank will be in Spain on Monday night.  Beth and I plan to have 
dinner that night.  Will you be back in town later in the week?  I have 
business plans for dinner on Tuesday and Thursday.  Could you make dinner on 
Wednesday night (the 17th)?  There is an Enron happy hour for Beth that I 
will stop by at 6:30 that night, but I expect to be free after that.  

I have a belated Christmas gift for you.  Hope we can get together!  --Sally 

PS  Am staying at 47 Park.
