Subject: Don't send a dad...


From the Don't Send a Dad to do a Mom's Job Department....

Brigeda just went to her 2nd ortho appointment.  I had a deadline so did not
attend--Richard did.  Apparently Brigeda's treatment plan has changed.  So I
asked Richard what had changed--he didn't know and didn't ask....

Grrr....
