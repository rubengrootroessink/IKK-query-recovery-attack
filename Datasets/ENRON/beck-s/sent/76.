I am glad that the information that I sent was useful to you.  I had 
originally planned to be at Wellesley for the interviews on campus.  I now 
have business commitments in Houston that will keep me from making the trip.  
But I am certainly glad that you are included in the interviews.  Please feel 
free to call me if you have any questions either before or after the 
interview process.  --Sally

Dear Ms. Beck:

I am writing to thank you for sending additional information on Enron. I
have just received the package and I definitely appreciate learning more
about background of the company.

I am in the process of preparing for upcoming interview. I value your
input and assistance in helping me get a clear sense of direction. I am
excited to have been selected for the first round of interviews and look
forward to seeing you in November.

Sincerely,


Sona Khanova
