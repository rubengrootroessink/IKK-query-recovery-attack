I am meeting with Shona tomorrow to review the scheduling of doorstep reviews 
for the first quarter.  As long as the New York review isn't the week of 
January 15th, then I think I will still target that week for a London trip.  
Don't feel as if you have to clear the whole week for me  - I know that you 
are very busy, so I expect that we will work in time together around critical 
things that you need to handle.  I will try to send you a list of topics that 
I would like to cover by the end of the day tomorrow to give us a starting 
point.  You may have some suggestions on others that I should meet with while 
I am there.  Thanks.  --Sally

Hope you had a good week - mine was enjoyable despite illness in the family 
and a houseful of guests. I am also grateful for the opportunity to get back 
to work!!

As to your visit

I will try to clear the week - the only potential curveball is my desire to 
be in NY when we do the NY doorstep( timing is uncertain ). I want to hammer 
home the need for absolute clarity re the remote office control structure and 
to review the SAP implementation work - both should be in place .

I will put together a list of issues/subjects that I would like to update you 
on over the next day or so  - we should be able to use that as a working 
agenda and a start point for scheduling time.

If there is anything else you would like to review specifically, I will get 
the necessary preparation done.

Cheers and Happy New Year

Mike

Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally
