Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The 
dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.  
But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and 
a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around 
the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a 
more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their 
being chosen.  --Sally
