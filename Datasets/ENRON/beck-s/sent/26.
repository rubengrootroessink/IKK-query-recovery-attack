Shona,

I printed 12/4 consolidated report for Sally.  It is again very small.  Any 
possibility that you can change format to enlarge (very large margins).  I 
can go in every time & reformat, but it seems a waste of time to do every 
time when you can just change your template once.

Subject: global standards needs assessment

Here is the draft of the needs assessment for global standards.  Please give 
me your input.  Kelly is devoting 100% of her time to putting together an 
access database to report these standards.

Also, here is a consolidated view of A01 for 12 /04.

Thanks

Shona
