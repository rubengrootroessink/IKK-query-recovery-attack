Thanks for the note.  I certainly know by responses that I am getting tonight 
who is in the office late!  I was told that the memo would come out today - 
you just had to be here at dinner time to see it!  I am really pleased about 
how we have been able to improve the perception of what our group does and 
its importance to the organization.  And yes, we need more female names on 
these lists!  --Sally

Congratulations on your promotion!  What a great statement to how far you 
have brought Energy Operations.   I'm sure your team will be excited to see 
your efforts recognized.  Also, it is very encouraging to see a female name 
on the list.  Best of luck!
