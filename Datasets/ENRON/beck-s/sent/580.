Peggy Hedstrom will be out of the office from March 1 - 11 for vacation. Our 
spring break week is March 13, so I have sent Peggy a note asking about 
sometime the week of March 20 or 27.  I will let you know her reply and then 
I would love to do a joint trip!

What a good idea.  I am in Canada today because of some changing of the guard 
that needed to take place.  Could be persuaded to come with you when you 
return.
