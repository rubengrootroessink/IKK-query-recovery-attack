Enron Europe Ltd. has played a vital role over the last few years in the=20
global expansion of  Enron=01,s  business.  Now, EEL is taking a strategic =
role=20
in setting the standards for global operational performance.  Accordingly,=
=20
EEL will work closely with Global Risk Management Operations to assess our=
=20
operational policies, procedures and internal controls.  This will be a=20
collaborative effort to establish and implement standards and measurements =

performance, in insuring that trading operations services are delivered=20
consistently across all commodities and all locations. =20

We are very pleased to announce that effective April 10, 2000, Brent Price,=

Brent will have the responsibility to assist and guide us through the proce=

insure that we are fully aligned in  the delivery of global consistency=20
throughout all of our operations.  He will work actively with the operation=
s=20

(FERNLEY =01) This would be a good spot to perhaps make a reference to the=
