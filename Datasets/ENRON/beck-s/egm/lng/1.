We have delivered a copy of 2 LNG contracts to Scott Earnest's office 
tonight. One is between Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company Limited & Dabhol 
Power Company and the other is between Dabhol Power Company and Oman LNG 
L.L.C.   I understand the EGEP Legal group (Steve Watson) is currently 
working on a third contract but it is not executed at this time. He has 
advised that he will forward a copy when it is completed.

Bridgette -

By copy of this message, I have asked Sandeep Katwala (acting general counsel 
for Enron India) to help locate these contracts for you.  Let me know if you 
need anything else.  Thanks.

Gentlemen,

I was told that both of you worked on the Dabhol project, so I am hoping that 
you can assist me.  As the message below states, I am trying to find 
contracts that are related to this project.  Please see below for details.  
If it was a mistake to send this message to you, please forward to the 
correct individual.

Thank you,
Bridgette

Sally and Scott Earnest called this afternoon.  We will be setting up a new 
risk book to manage LNG positions on a worldwide basis.  Supposedly, there 
are several contracts from the old E.I. entity related to India for LNG.  
They may reference Dabhol Power project, fuel management, fuel oil, heating 
oil....

Scott desperately needs to get copies of these contracts.  Can you ask around 
with some of the contacts you made on your India trip to see if you can find 
these and get copies ?
