Slight interest; could see as a fit in Risk or Strucuturing.  EGM has no 
immediate openings in either but I am always open to the possibility of going 
long people in those areas.  He was supposed to get back to me if he had 
interest in EGM - have not heard from him yet.

Just a word of thanks for setting up the interviews last week.  I was 
thoroughly impressed with the groups and saw several areas which I would like 
to explore further.  I will be following up with Beth Apollo, Brenda Herod 
and Brent Price to explore opportunities in their areas.  Again, thanks for 
your kind gesture and even more so, thanks for meeting me at the suggestion 
of Liz Taylor.

Regards,
