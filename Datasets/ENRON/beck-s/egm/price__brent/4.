Sally - The following people will be the core of the EGM due diligence team:  
Scott Earnest, Michelle Bruce, Sheila Glover, Kevin Sweeney and Michelle 
Thomason.  Of course, we will utilize others as needed depending on the 
demands of the transaction being reviewed.  Michelle and/or myself will

and team for all of wholesale.
