FYI...according to Jeff, by the end of today the only position that will 
require manual adjustment is an IM Canada position (60 K's) that will be 
fixed next Monday when Kam Keiser goes back to Calgary.  Everything else is 
now automatically feeding to the GRMS system (and VAR calculations) without 
human intervention.

Steve - Mike asked  me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the 
top-level adjustments on the Benchmark.  Here are the things which we 
discussed earlier.

Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.

We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.  
We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.

1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS.  
2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S. 
office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly.
3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books 
into the system.  
4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in 
more than one book per region.

Issues remaining:

Intra-Month Canada
Chicago
Storage and Intra-East

Intra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to 
Canada on Monday to fix their problems.
Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the 
wrong portfolio code.
Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide 
books need to be set up.

Thanks

JG
