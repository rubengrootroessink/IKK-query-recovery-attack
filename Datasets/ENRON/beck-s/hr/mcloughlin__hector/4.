I would like to have my directors and senior directors take this course.  There is just one course date noted in the attachment in May.  Will there be other dates during the year?  I can't have everyone go at the same time.  I would like to get the list of dates in 2001 and then send a memo to directors and senior directors requiring them to attend one of the sessions.  Can you also get me a list of the director and senior directors that I have in EIM, EGM and EA?  Will this course also be offered in London for directors?  --Sally

Sally, 
We can offer the Director Level "Impact and Influence"  course to all of your Directors as part of a pilot program.    I wanted to know if you want me to forward this offer to them.   Please let me know.
