Per Dave's note below - sounds like he want to insure the managers are 
staying on top of this and wants proof.  Please keep working with the 
managers and push this through.  Any that you have now, please forward to me 
so I can update the status report and forward to Dave.

Thanks

Sheila

Shelia, to ensure we are all on the same page, I am looking for a copy of the 
review plus a written plan to rectify performance or counsel out from each 
supervisor.

Regards
Delainey
