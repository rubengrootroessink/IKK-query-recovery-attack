Sally, 

It was nice meeting with you this morning.  Here are my mid-year and year-end 
lists of accomplishments for your records. You may already have my mid-year 
document from the June PRC process, and the year-end document is the same 
document I left with you today.  Robb Justice has both documents as well.  
Robb is also somewhat familiar with my Asia-Pacific work as he assisted our 
Japan, Singapore, and S. Korea efforts several times throughout the year.  I 
let him know today that you would be contacting him.

Thanks you,
Nicole
