I apologize for the late notice, but Sally has just been notified that a 
cross-functional PRC meeting w/ Rick Causey has been set for this Friday, 
December 1.  She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by 
Thursday.  If you have directors reporting to you, please request that they 
also have data in to Sally by Thursday.

Thanks for your help,
Patti x39106
