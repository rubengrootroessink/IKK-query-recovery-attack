Sally,

I had talked to Ted and he mentioned the cookout you were planning for the OU 
group this summer.  Please let me help with any of the logistics, 
set-up, and clean up.  I know these things require a great deal of effort, 
especially when you welcome people to your personal residence.  I want to,
and insist on helping in whatever way I can.  I am really grateful for what 
you have done for the University of Oklahoma and I am also aware of
the great sacrifices you make for Enron.  If possible, we might schedule a 
lunch to discuss the specifics.  I would also be grateful if we could discuss
my most recent opportunity at Enron,  Texas Risk.  I realize the there is a 
great deal I can gain from this move and I would appreciate any insight on how
to obtain the most from this experience.

Thanks
Jody
