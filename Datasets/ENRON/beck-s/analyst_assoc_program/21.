I have asked Shelly Jones to send me a complete list of the analysts from OU 
that will start in July.  I'll will contact her again
today if she doesn't get back with me.  

I think  it would be a great idea to invite Ted.  His e-mail is 
tjacobs@ou.edu.  It might also be a good idea to invite George Hope. 
 I will also ask Shelly if they have assigned a recruiter to OU yet.  This 
would be a great opportunity for the individual to
meet with the potential recruiting team.  

P.S. If I am thinking too much, and the list is growing larger than what you 
had anticipated, let me know
