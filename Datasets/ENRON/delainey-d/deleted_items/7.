No bid for the barges:)
 
Better technology in the market regardless of price - these puppies are going to be tough to move.

I will track down more details this week.  
 
Janet,
 
I read about our west coast C&I/retail power positions today in Chronicle.  Are we keeping these or selling them?  As I mentioned last week, if we keep them, we need to talk about the infrastruture that will be needed to serve these and our other west coast wholesale positions.
 
I will be around all this week

Was quite familiar with these barges last year. Plan was to sell them and Sean Long was negotiating final doc's. Don't know why we wouldn't want to sell them. Brian Redmond was very involved here, so Don you may want to use him to help here.
