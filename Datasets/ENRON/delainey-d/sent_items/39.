Dan, are you managing or do we need to discuss?

We have presented the following customer counts to buyers, which are compared below against Beth and Shelly's numbers:

		Count presented		Total Available (from Beth)		Shortfall
Texas			14,696			17,100				14%
New York		7,658			8,500				10%
Massach.		4,944			5,700				13%

The count presented to buyers came by utilizing the data in the sequel server database (maintained by Chris McCaig and Mary John) and the information in the RPS system (the booking batch files).  We are working with deal capture to determine the sources of discrepancies.

After receiving bids today, we will 1. determine to what extent we want to book and process remaininig deals, 2. develop a plan for developing the definitive mass market customer list.

Just a quick update from Shelly and I on where we stand with processing all of the Mass Market contracts.  We will need more resources to process the remaining 6,000 contracts.  We estimate that it would take 12 people 1 week.  

  Texas  ---
 
We are aware of  approximately 18,000 contracts signed to date  -- of those approximately 900 were rejected for Credit and Data Issues - net contracts 17,100
               

                          6,000   completely processed and on hold at CSC
                          7,700   processed but not submitted to CSC
                          3,400   NEED TO BE Booked and processed  
                         ---------
                         17,100  Total available TX contracts

In order to process them  -- they need to be booked to the risk books (Deb  -- assume you can have someone work on this)  and then Shelly's team can validate and pull the extra data that is needed  -- ESID's and 4 digit zip code extensions.  They will also validate credit approval etc like usual.  May need additional people to find missing data like Mary John's team used to do.

The goal would be to have all of the data ready to tranfer to a buyer  -- so that they can quickly enroll these customers, and have a very clean list of contracts with corresponding values.

New York

We are aware of 9,200 contracts signed to date  -- of these 700 were rejected for a net remaining contrac number of 8,500.

                        5,600 completely processed and sent to CSC   (  x are already live and  y are on hold for enrollment) -- we are getting this breakdown now
                        1,400  processed but not submitted
                        1,500 NEED TO BE Booked and processed
                        -------
                         8,500   total available NY contracts

Similar processing   -- these deals need to be accounted for  -- by booking them



Mass.

We are aware of 6,500 contracts signed to date  -- of those 800 were rejected leaving 5,700 contracts to be processed

                          4,500 completely processed and sent to CSC (x are already live and y are on hold for enrollment )  (we are getting this breakdown now)
                             200 more processed but not submitted
                          1,000  NEED TO BE Booked and processed
                          ---------
                          5,700   total available Mass.  contracts
Similar processing   -- these deals need to be accounted for  -- by booking them

We will need to either hire contractors or borrow staff from other business units to complete this processing.  We estimate that with 6 extra staff this effort would take 2 weeks.  We could cut that time in half with double the staff.  This does not include an estimate of time to book each transaction into RPS thru the batch process.
