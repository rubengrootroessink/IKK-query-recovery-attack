Dave

This is the best I can get today - it includes all that are not EES - but I'm guessing that you have a fairly good feel for them.

Another health warning - this shows individuals who are still on the payroll - some of who I know have left the company ( eg. Jeff Shankman and Mike McConnell) 

I should be able to get you the EES information on Monday

Let me know if you need anything else.

Neil, per your request below, please see attached file.  As I mentioned, in our phone conversation, EES employees are not included in the report because I do not have access to them via Business Objects.  Please validate the report for accuracy.  Thanks.
