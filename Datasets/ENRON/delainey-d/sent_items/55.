I will leave each of you a voice mail regarding this as well, but due to a scheduling conflict for Shael Dolman,  we are proposing to reschedule the ServiceCo Board Meeting from  Thursday at 1:00 p.m. cst to Friday at 12:00 cst (10:00 a.m. pst).  Please let me or David Roland know your availability as soon as possible.  We have confirmed availability at this time for both Brad Jones and Shael Dolman.

Thanks,
Jimmie
