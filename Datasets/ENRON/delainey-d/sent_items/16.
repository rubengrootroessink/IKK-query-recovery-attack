Guys, it would be great to be able to go off-site in two different locations for these guys but given the fact I had to personally buy the paper for copying the termination packages, I don't think there any funds to spend.  Perhaps there are empty offices in 3 Allen.  Please look into.  Either way we need to ensure that these guys are fairly well seperated.  I am waiting for a confidentiality from Calpine and AEP this AM.

Regards
Delainey
