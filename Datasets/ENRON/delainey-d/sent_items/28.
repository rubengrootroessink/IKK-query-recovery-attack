Peter, I do not have a contact at RWE but if you need a reference let me know.  You can continue to contact me at my Enron phone over the next several weeks.

Best of luck
Dave

Dave, I only stopped by to see if you have any strong contacts within RWE.  I may have an opportunity there and would appreciate your help.  Please let me know if you do, advise the name and I'll take it from there.

Thanks much for your support and confidence over the past few months.  It's done a lot for the Lilly relationship. Your organizational skills and gift for plain talk have inspired confidence. It's been fun.

Sincerely,

Peter
