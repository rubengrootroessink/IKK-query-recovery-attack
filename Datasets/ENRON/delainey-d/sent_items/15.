Subject: Ability to Perform

Based on confirmation by Tony Valenzuela that the Enron - Dynergy merger will
not occur as suggested in your memo of November 20, 2001, I am concerned about
your company's ability to perform under our Commodity Management Agreement
(CMA) dated January 6, 2001.

Accordingly, please:

1. prove to me that the utility accounts for which your company provides bill
payment services are current and utility invoices for the October month
business have been paid and there are no amounts in arrears,

2. prove to me that natural gas deliveries were properly made for November,
2001  into the citygates of the local distribution companies which service the
natural gas accounts listed in the CMA,

3. Prove to me that natural gas deliveries will be properly made for December,
2001  into the citygates of the local distribution companies which service the
natural gas accounts listed in the CMA.

Please provide this information by the end of this week so that we are
comfortable that our agreement is in proper working order for the month of
December, 2001.

Thank you.
