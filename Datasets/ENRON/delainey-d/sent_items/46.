Section 3.4.2 B allows EES to present a third party offer to REXAM, in lieu of our own supply, in order to preserve our performance under the contract while maintaining the price charged to the Customer (Rexam).  By allowing the Customer to acquire their own gas supply EES may be defaulting on its performance to supply gas.  Please let me know if we need to take any action in this case.

I received a call today from Jack Bender with Rexam aka American Can(GNO customer) that they are going to secure supply from another supplier for the Peoples and ONG LDC's. We lost all our supply on ONG 12/1 and are now out of storage on Peoples. They were notified by Peoples today that we were not serving them.They indicated they will forward me a copy of their contract with the new supplier as a FYI.

Jeff-Please confirm that our storage is now gone for December for Rexam's pool.
