Wade, you need to give George and Ray more texture ie) we lose $30M in value - in active sale mode that looks promising and we buy Enron ten days with New York ISO.

Below in blue are the amounts related to each transfer. We also have a $680,000 payment to the NY ISO that has to go tonight as well if we don't we can't deliver to our NY customers, they return to utility service and we lose $30MM of value.  That wire request is on its.
