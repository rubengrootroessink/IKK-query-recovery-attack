Mr. Lay,
     My name is Kevin Cobb, and I represent an elite sales force out of
Massachusetts. This team was responsible for over 2000 contracts for Enron
Direct.
Which were sold between September, October and November of this year. The
purpose of this email is to see if you have any interest to contract us (LAW
CONTRACT SALES) to continue to represent Enron Direct.
      As of Wednesday, November 28 th, Talent Tree has terminated our
contract with them. And commissions due may not be paid.
      We realize the enormous challenges you have with your corporation,
however, I'am sure you can see the impact we could make with your company.

       Please contact us at your earliest convenience .


Enthusiastically Yours,

Kevin J.Cobb
                                                                       Senior
Vice-President
