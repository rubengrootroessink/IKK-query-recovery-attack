Could you let me know the status of Alan's payment?
 
I called him and left a message indicating that we are looking into this and should be able to give him an answer by the end of today.
 
Thanks

Kimberly, I was laid off on Monday and have not had my latest expense report electronically deposited into the credit union.  I was assured by management that I would be paid.  The amount is 642.10.  I would think that this is the least enron could do for me since I have only worked for EES for 2 months.  
 
Please ensure that my funds are deposited as soon as possible due to my current financial crisis.
 
Thank You,
 
Alan Timme
