Dave,
	Just a heads-up -  it sounds like the Tammy structure may get
highlighted to the Creditors Committee soon because of the expected sale
of the Indian E&P assets.
	I believe this will bring focus on the value of assets held in
Tammy.  To the extent that there are any assets within Tammy that you
believe may be candidates for the Newco you are considering, it would be
good to identify them early - before everyone starts focusing on how
much they might bring in liquidation.
	In addition to the Indian E&P assets, I am aware of the
following assets within the two Tammy structures:
			*	Option to acquire EREC (This option will
probably be rejected)
			*	A portion of the East Coast Power
investment (may be a note)
			*	Stock of EOG Resources (subject to a FAS
125 Transaction- no economic interest)
			*	Stock of LNG Power (Atlantic) Ltd. that
I am told includes Ecoelectrica
			*	Option to acquire Portland General Stock
	Other assets may be included.  Please contact me if you have any
questions.  I plan to be out this week, but will be checking voicemail
(858-704-3302).				

						Happy Holidays,

						Joel
