Rob, does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase?   If it 
is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable 
display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community 
and it should continue to sponsor the flame.  On the accounting front, 
expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and 
budgeted next.

Let discuss

Regards
Delainey

Rob, further to our conversation. I have had attached a couple of the notes 
recently sent to the PR group.  Historically, the expense for this 
advertising has been paid by the Houston. The overall expense item was not 
that large and Corp was paying because generally they were not supporting any 
other expense in Calgary and deemed this request reasonable.  If possible I 
would ask that you secure approval from Delainey with regards to the renewal 
of this item.



Needless to say, this Flame has been a flagship for Enron in the Hockey 
community and our association with the Flames ownership committee does not go 
unnoticed !

Please let me know if you need anything but our basic request is corporate 
approval to reimburse canada for the next 3 years @ approx. $ 50,000.00 
US/year. 

Thanks in advance, Barry

Barry -- While PR can approve the look and feel of the sign, the cost would 
have to be approved by ENA Chairman's office.  Generally, it has been my 
understanding that each commercial group pays for such marketing expenses 
from its own budget.  As I am no longer working in the PR group, it would be 
best if you contact the Chairman's office directly to present the business 
case and request expense approval.

Kal,  further to my previous e-mail. This note is to advise as to the final 
costs that will be associated with the renewal of the Enron sponsorship.

We have negotiated a 3 year deal with the Calgary Flames.  Can you please 
verify via e-mail that ECC will be reimbursed by ENA for this annual 
advertising expense.  Upon receipt of the invoice, we will process payment 
and coordinate this on your behalf. 

Nov 2000 - Nov 2001        $68,000 + 7 % Tax = $72,760. / $ 1.47 ( Currency 
).  Approx. $ 50,000.00 US/Year advertising expense. 

Invoicing for this up coming season will be in the next couple of months.  I 
will also coordinate the execution of all documents regarding legal 
liability, renewal rights etc.  

Thanks in advance. Barry
