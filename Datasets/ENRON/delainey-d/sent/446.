Dave, Move on and I hope we don't pay more than Book when this is liquidated 
from the JEDI fund this fall.  Let me know when the asset is sold to a third 
party for a value greater than book.

Jeff, my team believes that there should be a premium to book in the range we 
quoted to you; however, I appreciate your interest.  I would agree that we 
have spent enough time on this and it is time to move on.  

Regards
Delainey

Dave,  I met with my team today and based on the data and information 
supplied by Steve, it is doubtful that the assets and on-going organization 
would command a current market value equivalent to book.  I am still willing 
to move the assets onto our balance sheet at book for the benefit of Enron, 
although if this was a third party bid, I would be surprised if we could pay 
this price.  Furthermore, due to your desire to maintain this discussion 
among the Houston teams only, I am assuming the PDP reserves are solid, no 
major enviornmental issues exit, legal problems are minimal and contracts are 
standard.  Let me know what you want to do. I think we have all spent enough 
time on this effort. 

On a side issue, are you aware that this is a JEDI I property?  My 
understanding is that Jedi I owns 100% of C-GAS and the Jedi I fund WILL be 
liquidated before the end of the year.  At what price will your unit pay to 
liquidate the fund?

Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation 
of approximately $39 M.  Please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of 
value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your 
continued management.

Let me know where you end up.

Regards
Delainey
