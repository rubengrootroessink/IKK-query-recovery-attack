Guys, as part of the new A&A program being rolled out by the ENE Office of 
the Chair, a new Associate and Analyst PRC is being set up.  I have nominated 
you as the six people from ENA to be on this PRC.  You will represent ENA's 
A&A's and participate in the evaluation and ranking across the entire 
company.  This is a very important function - please represent us well.

Regards
Delainey
