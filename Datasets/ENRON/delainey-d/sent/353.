Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I 
expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday 
is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of 
service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost 
and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other 
business lines.  If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy. 

I make money you make money.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Regards
Delainey

FYI, I got this from Dick.  Just want to confirm that it's consistent with 
your recollection.

Best regards - Max
