Jim, I am not sure that this will attract the people we want to hear the 
message; however, I will hold back judgement until we discuss the strategy in 
more detail.

Regards
Delainey

Dave --

Alstom ESCA is holding "Summit 2000" in Las Vegas Oct 16 - Oct 17.  The 
purpose of the meeting is to bring together people from throughout the 
industry to discuss key issues.  

Alstom ESCA is a French company that builds EMS systems in the US.  They 
developed the EMS for Enron's control areas.  We are working with them on 
Project e-trans (the RTO software).

The first panel in the am on Monday involves Re-regulation and Competition.  
They would like someone from Enron to present and participate.  Right now, 
they have  Pacificorp and are trying to get someone from government in PA and 
CA.  The presentation / speech is 10 - 15 minutes followed by 30 minutes of 
Q&A for the panel.

Do you have any interest in presenting?  This could be a good opportunity to 
deliver our message throughout the industry.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim
