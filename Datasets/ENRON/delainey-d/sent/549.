Greg, it is really up to you - if you have other things to do don't worry 
about it.

Fran was the one asking me to go to the ENA Final VP PRC on the 7th since I 
had a few months of data on Rodney, Edward, Ajello and Burnett.  Also, Rodney 
and Edward were hoping I could attend ( I guess they think my attendance 
would help them not hurt them!).  I can attend if you want and give my Q1 
observations.  However, if you think you have it handled, that is OK for me 
as well.  I am not emotional about it either way and am only concerned about 
helping if you need it or want it.  That is why Kay asked you about it today.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.

GP
