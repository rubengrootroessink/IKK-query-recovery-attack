Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both 
himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which 
should help leverage your product into this sector. Scott and John have 
agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets 
with no delay.  From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team 
will go speak to them about the opportunities.  I would expect that we will 
be in front of these folks ASAP.  Lets see how the product is embraced by 
these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal 
alignment of the groups.  As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are 
working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.

Regards
Delainey

Attached is a preliminary list of customers that we would like to contact.  
This list will change as we receive more information from the market.  We are 
available to meet with John and Scott.  This needs to be an ENA team effort.
