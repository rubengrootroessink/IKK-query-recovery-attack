Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have 
had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a 
better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and 
manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very 
solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then 
ultimately in origination.

I hope this helps.

Regards
Delainey

Dave-

You mentioned in enside that some of the skills needed to succeed at Enron 
are solid structuring skills as well as a grasp of the the accounting, legal, 
commercial and credit implications of a deal.  What is the best way to obtain 
these skills?  Do you believe it is necessary or worthwhile to work a trading 
desk to truly understand how ENA functions?

Thanks,

Joe Short
