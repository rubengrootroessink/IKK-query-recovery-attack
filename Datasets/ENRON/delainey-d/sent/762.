Janet, the CALME organization does not exist so it might be difficult to 
negotiate a transfer price - we need to just do the right thing for Enron - 
if you think you are getting stuffed economically then I would work a deal 
out with Lavo or Whalley.

Delainey

I do not think ENA should cover the IDC's prior to us taking this turbine. It 
would be appropriate for us to pick up IDC's going forward. Your thoughts?

Janet:

Did you happen to talk to Dave about whether his agreement on the 501D5A 
included taking the IDCs? FYI, they total about $2.5 million. As I mentioned, 
CALME wants to move the turbine off their books as soon as possible. Based on 
our conversation on Friday, I have told Jody that we will not accept the $1.2 
million they paid in error to Siemens Westinghouse, and that I was checking 
on our position on the IDCs. Please let me know what your and Dave's position 
is on this.

Regards,


Ben
