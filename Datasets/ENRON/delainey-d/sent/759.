FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.  I believe that 
discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his 
staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.  In 
the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in 
their RFP with our suggested language or documents.  It would be helpful for 
the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their 
advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a 
transaction.

 The proposal includes:
  a) traded power products of various sizes and terms;
  b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) 
for term;
  c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide 
gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts;
  and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.

I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.

Regards
Delainey
