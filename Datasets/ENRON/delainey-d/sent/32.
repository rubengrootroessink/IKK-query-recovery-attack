Subject: Gas group new hires

I am no longer coordinating the "next-year" activities for new hires in the 
gas group so I thought I'd just let you know that the Midwest gas team is 
interviewing new hires for coverage/origination roles. I believe Laura is 
wanting to hire some of these folks to be based in Chicago and I would think 
you would want them to be located in Houston. Just fyi.
