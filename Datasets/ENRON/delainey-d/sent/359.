Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you 
a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.  The West historically has been far 
better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market 
deals/services.  I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.  I 
would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow, 
resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting.

Regards
Delainey
