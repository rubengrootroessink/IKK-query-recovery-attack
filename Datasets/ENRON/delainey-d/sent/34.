Dave - Attached are (2) documents relating to the Calpine acquisition of
PSM. The draft stock purchase agreement and the Enron termination document.
I plan on closing Friday the 8th and would appreciate the warrant
termination agreement to be executed by tomorrow to avoid delays in closing.
I will fax a copy of the warrant agreement on PSM letterhead later this
morning. I appreciate all of your support and look forward to our further
successes with Amp's. I will be in my office later this morning. Please keep
information concerning our transaction Highly confidential.

Best Regards,

Tom Churbuck
