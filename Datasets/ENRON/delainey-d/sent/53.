Guys, there is quite a number of us dealing with this problem - what are our 
solutions?

Could we have a corporate jet available for folks stuck in the A&A PRC? Other?

Regards

Sorry that my arrangements with Jana G. in the Associates Program to change 
the date of the Associates PRC were over-ruled by Charlene.  I had agreed 
with Jana that swapping the dates of the Analysts and Associates PRC meetings 
was a great solution.  Despite the fact that the program had not checked with 
us as PRC reps to see if December 13 was a convenient date, Charlene 
developed an interesting concern over potentially inconveniencing the 
directors who are PRC reps for the Analyst PRC.  And I see that you were 
drafted into facilitating the whole meeting!  

I am scheduled on the 5:35 flight from IAH to Las Vegas on the afternoon of 
the 13th.  I would have to leave downtown by 4:15 to make that flight.  I 
have been asked to confirm those flight arrangements so that a ticket can be 
issued.  Since you will be in charge, will this flight time work?  --Sally
