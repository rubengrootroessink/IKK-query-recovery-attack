Subject: Mid-year 2000 Performance Review Process

As we move into the Spring/Summer of 2000, it is time to turn our attention=
=20
to the performance review process.  Mid-year is always busy and we have a=
=20
number of important tasks and projects in process.  While recognizing this,=
=20
it remains extremely important to take time over the next few weeks to gath=
er=20
necessary information to provide quality and meaningful feedback for our=20
employees, as well as utilize this information during the year end review=
=20
process.

In the spirit of One Enron, the Performance Review Process (PRC) will be=20
global for Mid-year 2000.  Vice Presidents and above across all operating=
=20
companies will be reviewed and discussed in a consistent manner with=20
identical criteria.   ENA will review all professional level and above=20
employees.  The timeline and training for the midyear process are outlined =
at=20
the end of this memo.  Your HR Business Consultant is also available to=20
answer questions.

With regards to the Global Functions, review sessions will be led by the=20
Global and/or Corporate Functional heads, and will be designed to calibrate=
=20
personnel within these areas of expertise.  The Global Functional Review=20
Areas include:

_ NetWorks/Technology
_ Accounting
_ RAC

ENA Mid-Year Process:

ENA has received favorable feedback on the review process used for Mid-year=
=20
and Year-end 1999, and as such, will follow the same general guidelines and=
=20
process for Mid-year 2000.  The following are key features of the Mid-year=
=20
2000 process:

o The focus of the feedback will continue to be on the qualitative aspects,=
=20
as opposed to quantitative.  Toward this end, communication of the employee=
=01,s=20
explicit ranking will be left to the discretion of the business unit manage=
r.
o Initial discussions with employees regarding their accomplishments, are=
=20
highly encouraged, prior to the Business Review Meetings.
o Mid-year performance results will be used as baseline performance=20
information for Year-end 2000.
o Creation of 3 standard feedback forms for all peer groups. =20
o Standardization of criteria for all peer groups.
o   Utilization of a consistent 6 gradation rating scale. =20
o All exempt employees will be discussed at Business Review Meetings and=20
placed into one of six categories by peer group.  ENA VP's will be pre-rank=
ed=20
by the ENA Office of the Chairman and Managing Directors prior to the Enron=
=20
PRC.  Non-exempt (overtime eligible) employees will be evaluated by their=
=20
supervisors and placed into one of the 6 categories.  The results of the=20
Business Review Meetings will be the final rankings for exempt employees=20
below VP, subject to ENA Office of the Chairman.
o A minimum of two representatives from other functional areas will be=20
required at the Business Review Meetings.  The meetings should otherwise be=
=20
rescheduled to allow this very important representation to take place.  The=
=20
nominated individuals are illustrated below.
o The top 5 HR priorities/challenges for 2000 should also be agreed to at t=
he=20
Business Review Meetings.
o Analysts and Associates will be pre-reviewed in a Business Review Meeting=
s=20
based on their current rotation, then cross-calibrated at the Enron Global=
=20
Analyst and Associate Business Review Meeting.

 Commercial
 Commercial Support

Performance Criteria (for all peer groups):

=20
reports, internal customers, external customers), as is a self-evaluation
o Employees should recommend 5-10 reviewers to Supervisor and Supervisor=20
should select at least three of the employee=01,s recommendations
o All feedback must be entered via the Performance Management System locate=
d=20
on the intranet
o Supervisor should consolidate the feedback, prepare a draft of the=20
Performance Review form and meet with the employee prior to the Business=20
Review meeting
