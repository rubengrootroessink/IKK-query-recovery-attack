Marty, no agenda on this one at all.  Given, the change in Enron Industrial 
Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on 
the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal 
we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I 
believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other 
priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.  Ultimately, the 
value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than 
ENA.

Regards
Delainey

Dave,
On a more private note, what was the motivation for this note, especially 
copying Frevert and Pai?  
Are we (EES) being uncooerative and your purpose was to raise visibility?  
Can you help me with what your thinking is what you would view as a desirable 
outcome?
