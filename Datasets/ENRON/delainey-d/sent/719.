Mike, please let Brian know if there is a problem and let him rectify.  It is 
difficult for me to be responsive otherwise.

Thanks

It turns out that Delainey agreed to allow Brett Wiggs to be the Enron 
spokesperson.   I guess we'll give the current process another week or so.   
I'm personally not in love with the Mitsubishi turbines anyway given the NOx 
uncertainty.
