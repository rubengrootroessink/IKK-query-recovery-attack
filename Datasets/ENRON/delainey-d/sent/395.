Larry, go get 'em.  Whatever you can get you can keep and reduce the fee.  
You could make this easy for both of us.

Subject: SIEMENS/WESTINGHOUSE DISPUTES

Currently, Enron has several contractual disputes with Siemens/Westinghouse.  
These include:  $5-10MM lingering from Marmara; about $4-5MM on Puerto Rico; 
and maybe $1-3MM on the Gleason and Indiana Peakers.

In my meeting with Randy Zwirn yesterday, Randy suggested that I meet with 
him in an attempt to come to a global settlement on all the Enron disputes.  

I propose to do this.  I understand the strength of the contractual issues on 
each of these projects and I think I can close out the issues by optimizing 
the Enron leverage in one global settlement.  The process will take from 
30-60 days as both sides collect all contractual arguments.

I'll keep ENA informed.

Let me know if either of you object to this global type approach.
