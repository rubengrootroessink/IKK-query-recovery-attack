Lou, are there concerns that I am not aware?  From an economic point of view, 
it is clearly not in our interest to aggregate residential or small customers 
who have retail choice; however, standard office service (like the UI deal) 
is clearly a customized, wholesale/all -requirements sale of significant size 
negotiated with the utility and the puc.

Regards
Delainey
