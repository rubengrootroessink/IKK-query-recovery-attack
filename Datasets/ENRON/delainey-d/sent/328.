Subject: TVA Issued RFP for peaking power

Folks:

The attached RFP for peaking power may be of interest. I believe the RFP is 
restricted to those parties having control of generation assets in TVA or 
Southern. Our consultant, Gary Hasty (former TVA), can gather additional if 
you like. 

Regards,

Ben
