Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 
2001 IT budget.  Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our 
approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the 
nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and 
the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will 
be managed.

Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.

Regards
Delainey
