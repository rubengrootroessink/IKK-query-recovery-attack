Dave, I am going to send Shawn your way - he has extensive development, asset 
and project finance experience.  I would like him under your supervision to 
manage our coal power development strategy - like we discussed it could be a 
very robust strategy with multiple exit points.  I strongly believe that coal 
needs to come back into the stack and that the existing development teams 
(Parquet & Jacoby) are already buried under mid-stream gas development 
opportunities.

This would incorporate acquisitions, development, technology,  asset sales, 
emissions credits & technology, fuel supply and power sales.

Please update your 2001 budget to incorporate this new iniative.

Regards
Delainey

Dave:

Thanks for your time and patience today.

For now, I'll park the theoretical and focus on the practical.  (we can pick 
up the other topics later over beers sometime)

I completely agree that the US coal-genco business can offer a huge near-term 
win for those that move swiftly.

Thanks for offering me the shot to capitalize on it.

Shawn
