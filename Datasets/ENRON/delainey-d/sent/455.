Dave,

Since you're on the list do you need we to get something scheduled with Kay?

Folks,
Attached is a list of 37 executives, not yet enrolled on the "exective impact 
and influence" programme administered by Dick Amabile.
The OTC clearly set the goal at the beginning of the year, and repeated again 
at Mid year, that all VPs and MDs need to have attended this programme by end 
of year 2000. Their attendance does form part of the discussions on the VPs 
and MDs at the executive PRC.

Despite repeated comms from the OTC, these 37 names have not yet enrolled (or 
cancelled off a programme and have not re-enrolled). 

HR has committed to making sure that these people are enrolled, so the 
suggestion is that the named HR rep in the attachment takes 5 minutes to meet 
with the individuals, explain that they need to do this, show them the list 
of dates, and get them to choose which programme they want to enrol on. 
Please do not leave that meeting without a date! A word of caution, it is 
remotely possible that some of these individuals may have enrolled in the 
very recent past, or have attended and this data not yet reached Dick's 
spreadsheet, so do double check that they haven't yet enrolled before 
twisting their arms..

The dates for the remaining programmes are also on the spreadsheet.

To enrol a VP or MD,  get their dates, give it to their assistants and tell 
them to directly contact Debbie Nowak on 33304.

Tim
