Kevin, I would like more detail on these issues of which I was not aware -

Dave,

To the extent you feel it is truly in ENA's best interest, Ed and I are 
prepared to honor your wishes with respect to Tom Swank joining the 
mid-market group.   However, it should be noted that we (as a group) have 
significant reservations about Tom disrupting the chemistry in our group.  
The input from all of my my key guys (including Rogers who worked with Swank 
at Dynegy for a number of years) was negative regarding Tom as a member of 
our team.

We are concerned about his longevity in the group and his work ethic in 
general.  Again, I am prepared to respect your decision (particularly since 
you control my paycheck) and give Tom the benefit of the doubt, but I wanted 
to express my reservations.

Please let me know your thoughts
