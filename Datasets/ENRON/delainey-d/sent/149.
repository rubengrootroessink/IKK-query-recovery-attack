Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a 
reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the 
Hyatt.  John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large 
visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg 
for mid market and yourself for origination.

I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you 
do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.

Lets discuss.
Regards
Delainey
