We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce 
knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to 
better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the 
results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem 
appropriate for our activities.

The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial 
depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The 
advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult 
to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different 
states of development and application of business strategies.

The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is 
obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of 
evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that 
the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK 
market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these 
similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent 
of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business 
experience and corresponding strategy.

I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and 
foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our 
business.  

MFG
