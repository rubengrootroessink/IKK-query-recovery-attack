Janet, any thoughts - do we have excess development staff - this would be a 
good opportunity for the brave at heart.

Kevin,

How are things going?  Don't imagine you are too upset not having to deal 
with California or the wildfires out west?  Things are going well for us 
here, but as we expected it is like the US in 94/95 (things just starting) 
and Europe (96/97).  The Japanese utilities are not being too original in 
their approach... same playbook.  Regardless of all of this, looking at sites 
and potential development of physical trading assets is starting to look 
quite promising.  Jpnese cutting back on nuclear and significantly increasing 
LNG and many old oil-fired plants out there are just a few of the 
characteristics.

You mentioned in your last email that you had significantly reduced your 
efforts at adding capacity in the East.  Along these lines would you know of 
anyone that might be interested in a Japan tour to get all of this going?  
Ideally it would be someone at the Director level.  Let me know.

Joe
