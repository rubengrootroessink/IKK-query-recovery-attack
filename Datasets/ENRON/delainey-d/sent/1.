Guys, here are the details on the ESA MEH turbines - please forward to me 
your project details, economics and strategy ASAP.  We will allocate these 
turbines to the project with the best strategic/economic rationale once 
confirming that they are worth more in ENA versus ESA.  If you need more 
detailed information on these turbines please let me know.

Rob, please give me call on this one.

Regards
Delainey
