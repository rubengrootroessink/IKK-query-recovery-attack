Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group. I think 
this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.  We need to bring 
more people "in" which should increase their accountability for ENA results 
overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to 
evaluate future leaders.

I would like to send out a note this week to communicate whatever we come up 
with in order to have the right folks available on Friday.

Look forward to your comments.
