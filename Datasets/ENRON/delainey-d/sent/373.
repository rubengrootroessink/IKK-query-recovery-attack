Guys, my suggestion would be that RAC should manage the overall monitoring 
responsibility for ENA;however, I assume that Janet and Chris will continue 
to be responsible for the ENA turbine book.  They should be actively managing 
and monitoring ENA's piece.

Thanks for the note Mat.  Look fwd to supporting your effort as needed!   

Just to insure that ENA and RAC aren't duplicating efforts...., we have been 
told by Rick Buy that he wanted RAC to keep the Enron Turbine "book" (with 
input from other business units), and have just concluded multiple sessions 
w/ RAC to xfer that function to them (I think we invited your team to those 
sessions).  Rick Carson/RAC is working on a format that can be used by 
multiple parties, including board presentations.  The idea was that different 
business units (ENA,, EECC, etc) could provide input, and....., RAC's 
involvement would enhance the list.   

If ENA is going to keep "the turbine book" - maybe RAC doesn't need to (none 
of our business, but...., doesn't seem like RAC needs to be doing the same 
thing you are doing).    

Who from ENA could discuss this w/ Dave Gorte (Rick's on vacation)?  

Also - do you have a rep that can attend the bi-weekly turbine lunches where 
we go through the list - coordinating turbine efforts across all business 
units?  

Thanks - F.Kelly

Subject: Master Turbine Listing

Tammy Shepperd and myself have been asked to maintain the status of Enron's 
turbine position.  This list includes the 24 LM6000s, all other ENA turbines 
and all Enron turbines to the extent information is available.  The file 
includes 3 worksheets:

Turbine Inventory:  lists the turbine, delivery, ownership, project 
commitment and other related items.
LM6000 Status:  includes delivery, configuration, project commitment and 
other related items.
LM6000 Assign:  less detailed schedule with the delivery, project commitment 
and current availability.

In the future, to maintain the integrity of this information, the file will 
NOT be emailed, but will accessible from the following location in a Read 
Only format:

O:\NAES\Master Turbine Listing.xls

It is our view that requiring users to access the actual directory will be 
the most efficient method of assuring the user is receiving up-to-date 
information.  As project needs arise or change, please email or contact Tammy 
Shepperd at (713) 853-6589 or myself at (713) 853-3526.  In addition, if 
there is other information that would be useful, let us know.

Thanks,
Mathew Gimble
