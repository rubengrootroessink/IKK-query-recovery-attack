Hey Crystal hope things are well ....

Dawna is fine. We have two girls six (Kassandra) and four (Samantha).  We 
have been in Houston now three and half years.  It has been a good move from 
a career point of view.  Obviously, you had heard my move from Pres./CEO of 
Enron North America to Chair/CEO of EES.

I hope life has been as kind to you.  Best of luck in the future.

Regards
Delainey

Hi Dave,

I have just returned back to work and noticed your name in one of the Enron 
org change announcements.  Congratulations!  Is it fun ruling the universe??  
Does this mean that you don't plan on becoming a professor in the near 
future?!?  Life in Calgary must seem very far away...  

I hope that you and Donna are doing well in Houston.  How many children do 
you have now?  Is Donna working, or enjoying life at home?

I am doing well.  I am located in Oxford, and work part time at Enron 
Direct.  I have a 17 month old daughter who keeps me busy when I'm not at 
work.  Life is good in England.  Hard to believe that 5 years has flown by 
since I left Calgary.

I hope that all is well with you.

Crystal
