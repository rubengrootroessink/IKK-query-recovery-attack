Dave,

Coyote:  BPAmoco flaked so Avista is trying to move forward to take the whole 
deal (some public embarrassment if they dont close since they announced it 
last week).  At the same time, DLJ is bringing in some of the industry 
players that originally expressed interest.  One of those parties that called 
Jake is Orion, so Jake let Don Miller know this.  We will have a handle on 
preliminary feedback from these parties on Friday.  

Pastoria and LVCogen:  Deal books should have arrived.  Do you want to meet 
on these?  who would you like to meet with?  Parquet for Pastoria and 
Gilbert/Clark for LVCogen?  

Pastoria DASH is being finalized along with the Catalytica DASH.  Pastoria 
costs will be higher given the unwind of the Xonon swap and the fact that 
turbine costs were padded by $9MM for GE's catalytica development costs 
(argument for a value-grab!)

FYI I called Patrick Stevens of Triumph Energy three times...the number I 
called appeared to be an office shared with other companies.  The general 
number's voicemail was full so I have not reached him.

Scott Healy changed his decision and is going to work for Duran.  I dont 
understand his decision but Scott said that the "organization" thought it 
would be a better opportunity in Houston.



Chris
