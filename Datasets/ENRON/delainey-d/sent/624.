Good job - Randy.


Live to fight another day - I don't know if you know but I settled with Fort 
James - we ripped up all three contracts for no money that netted us 
approximately $15M in value through the elimination of the two power 
contracts in the NW.  Wertz was on the other side.  Thought you might want to 
know.

Thanks
Delainey
