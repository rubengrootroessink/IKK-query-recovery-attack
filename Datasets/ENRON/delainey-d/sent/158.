Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.

Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.



Regards
Dave and John
