Rob, if you and Dave think this is your best branding opportunity in the 
short run as we gear up I am supportive.  I assume this will be covered in 
Canada's budget.  Send me a towel.

Dave, Pope has been working with the Stampeder organization for the last six 
months on creating a sponsorship package for our Retail business. Our first 
goal was to attempt to get the naming rights to McMahon Stadium (not unlike 
the Canadian Airlines Saddledome, Enron Field, etc.). At this point the 
naming rights are off the table. However, we have the opportunity to grab the 
naming rights to the Labour Day Classic as well as some other season-long 
involvement. Terms of the deal at this point are as follows:

1. "Enron Labor day Classsic" and 100 thirty-second radio spots promoting the 
Enron Labor day Classic + Newspaper Ads
 40,000 Enron logo cheering towels to be distributed pre-game
 Exclusive sponsorship on the cover of the game day program
 Enron logo on the player's jerseys

2. Season long involvement 
 End-Zone advertising
 1 full-page color ad in the Stamp's 2001 yearbook
 12 season tickets
 12 red & white club memberships

Cost would be approx $100K Cdn (still be negotiated). 

In terms of our overall strategy for branding, this is likely the only 
initiative that we would pursue in 2001 as we like that it has good 
penetration for the entire province of Alberta as well as national exposure. 
The Labour day game draws the biggest crowd each season, has been sold out 
eight out the past nine seasons, and is the largest single day sporting event 
in Calgary each year. Last year the "battle of Alberta" attracted over 
750,000 viewers on CBC. The timing is also very good as we will be fully 
functional by September. 

Let me know what you think.

Regards
Milnthorp
