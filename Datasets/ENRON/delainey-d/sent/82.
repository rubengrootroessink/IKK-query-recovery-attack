Christy, can we send these documents in word format - I'm not sure if this is 
a problem for everyone but I can never open these attachments from 
Braeswell.  Can you please send a hard copy.

Regards
Delainey

Dave -- Kevin has asked that we do a full-blown protest of HQ's continuation 
of market based rates due to market manipulating behavior that Tom May has 
seen.  Due 11/30.  Let us know if we should not proceed with the OASIS 
review, etc. and drafting of protest.  Thanks.
