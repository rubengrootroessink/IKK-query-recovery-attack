Subject: Calme EE Transition List

David:

As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme 
employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel.

We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people.

Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list.

The enclosed list indicates the current proposed "New Roles" for each of the 
Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees 
among:  

Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to 
complete)
Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals
LNG/Middle East to go to EGM
Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses)
EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain 
technical/operations people)

The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to 
ensure that no individual falls through the cracks.

The column "Calme" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and 
you may wish to ignore it.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Shawn
