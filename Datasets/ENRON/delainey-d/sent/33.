Don:

I do think DealBench was extremely valuable - and I'll say we - ENA - but 
what I really mean is you could not have gotten there nearly as quickly 
without it.  I think you agree.  By the same token, if they said 'free' up 
front, we don't have to pay.  I think this is really a negotiation between 
Dave and Greg if we want to move income to DealBench.

Don

Congrats on your deals. JinSung had apprised me that things went well and in 
San Antonio I ran into Dave Delainey and he was very happy with the whole 
thing.

With the current NetWorks structure, and considering the benefits you have 
derived, we want to charge you a nominal amount for each of these data 
rooms.  We want to bill you 25k for each data room for a total of 175k.

I know that at the beginning of the deal you had asked me this question and 
my answer was 'we aint charging you' but the business model for us has 
changed and we need to show revenues and income to external customers and 
external partners we are trying to get to.  Hence we want to bill internal 
customers whatever is the reasonable price of the service offered.

I will call you later to discuss ( I did mention to Dave in San Antonio I was 
going to have to do this, considering my business situation)



Harry
