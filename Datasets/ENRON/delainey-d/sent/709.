David, I'm not sure there is any value to this for EES North America. There 
are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid, back 
and risk offices of the company.  We are working quickly to rectify  - 
servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down.  On the European 
side, I would like your perspective on their controls and business.

Regards
Delainehy

No doubt you will have heard of this initiative - a program of "surprise" 
quick controls reviews at various business units. 
There are two such reviews coming up in March in relation to EES (London and 
Houston), where I suspect the element of surprise would be outweighed by 
having some good early input to the scope.

Let me know your thoughts.
