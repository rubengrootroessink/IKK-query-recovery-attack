Dave...a brief update re Toronto. We have moved from 3 employees Jan 1, 2000 
to 13 employees. Recent hires are as follows:

1. Scott Gilbert (expat)   Manager  Volume Management
2. Chris Gaffney (from ENA)  Sr Counsel  Legal
3. Garrett Tripp (expat)   Manager  Power Trading
4. Jeff Borg (outside hire)  Director   Origination 
5. Steven Leung (from ENA)  Analyst   Origination
6. Dave Ellis (outside hire)  Manager  Volume Management
7. Dan Dorland (UofC grad)  Analyst   Origination
8. Lindsey Huculiak (outside hire) Admin Asst  General
9.Jahnet Theberge (oustside hire) Sr Admin Asst  General
10. Neil Stuchbury (outside hire)  Sr Specialist  Volume Management

As discussed, we have attempted to obtain a good mix of  "Enron DNA" and 
outside hires. We are currently in the process of hiring a marketer from Duke 
who covers eastern industrials on the gas side (John Guerriero, an engineer,  
background is UnionGas) and would like to target a couple of associates from 
Houston.  

Our national advertising campaign has finished its run and we received in 
excess of 350 resumes. We are currently reviewing the resumes and have 
scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday for June 24th in Toronto (Davies, Le 
Dain, Kitagawa, Devries, Dadson, McKay and myself will conduct the 
interviews).

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.

Regards,
Milnthorp
