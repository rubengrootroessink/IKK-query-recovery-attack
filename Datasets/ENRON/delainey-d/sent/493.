David:

I met with you last December/January in connection with working for Enron.
At that time Enron made me an offer to work in your group.  I made the
decision to not accept the offer.  The main reason was that I could not
digest the concept of leaving BP Amoco less than six months after I had
joined them.

I am still with BP Amoco and they continue to treat me real well.  At the
same time, I now realize that I made  a stupid mistake in turning down the
Enron offer.  If you are willing to reconsider, I would love to talk to you.
Considering what I put you through the last time, if you do not want to
reconsider, I can understand.

David, I would appreciate it I can meet with you in person to discuss this
further with you.  If you are okay with it, can I buy you lunch and talk
about this.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
