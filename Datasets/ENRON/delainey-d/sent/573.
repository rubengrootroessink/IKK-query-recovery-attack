Jeff, lets try to get consensus in how the east desk might work and then 
discuss next steps at that point.

thanks

Dave,

I know you want to have a meeting about the east desk as a follow up to last 
weeks meeting.  Do you think it would be helpful for me to have this 
replicated for all desks for one meeting?  Or do you want just 1 
presentation, and I will manage the rest of the rollout to the other desks? 

Thanks.  Jeff
