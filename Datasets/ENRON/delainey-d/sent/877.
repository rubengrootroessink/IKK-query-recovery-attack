Angela, 

Is Dave supposed to be involved in this ?????  

I just happened to be in Dave's email looking for something for him........I 
saw your name and thought maybe I'd better see if this was something I needed 
to put on his calendar.....As a rule, I do not go into Dave's  email unless I 
am told or looking for something that someone has requested me to print and 
give to him.....so, if you need something to be put on his calendar, please 
copy me on it or chances are I may or may not find out about it...

Thanks,

Kay
