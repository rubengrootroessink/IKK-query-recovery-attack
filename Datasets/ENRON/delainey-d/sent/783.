John, what do you want to do with this?  We had discussed but I wanted to 
follow up.

Dave --

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Dorie has been out after surgery and I 
wanted to talk with her first.  Attendance is an issue that can be addressed 
via a few initiatives, including:

1) better up-front communication from the Office of the Chair through the 
direct supervisors (like we did for United Way last year)
2) entertainment/big-name draw added to the line-up
3) IP-TV as a back-up for those who cannot attend
4) select a better time than last year's meeting (i.e., morning meetings have 
been better attended in the past vs. last year's afternoon meeting)

There are no doubt other small changes we can make to enhance attendance, but 
this should get us headed in the right direction.  Dorie and I would be happy 
to sit down and discuss this with you.

Regardless of what we do to increase attendance, if we wish to do such a 
meeting, we need to pick a date and get on the Hyatt calendar soon.  Their 
calendar is filling up quickly.  Thanks.

Eric

Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should 
have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any 
thoughts on this Eric/Dorie?

Dave and John --

In the past, ENA has held an all-employee business meeting over at the Hyatt 
in April or May.  Do you plan to hold such a meeting?  If so, we need to get 
started on planning the event.  Dorie Hitchcock has typically handled the 
arrangements.  Please advise.

Eric
