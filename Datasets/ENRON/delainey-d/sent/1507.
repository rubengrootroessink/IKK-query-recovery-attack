Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the 
company we would be a $100 stock.

On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the 
current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager 
promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process 
mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.

I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination 
of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key 
points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible 
key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where 
necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the 
program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet 
commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.

The goals of any restructuring are:
 a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the 
business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the 
program;
 b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;
 c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling 
and interviewing;
 d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly 
grounds the associate in the "Enron technology" which include skills in 
market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;
 e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding 
talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them 
up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the 
program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;
 f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, 
retention and performance tool;
 g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, 
non-traditional sources of talent and
 h) increase cost effectiveness.

The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, 
people and teams, business tracks, etc.

I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the 
key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the 
least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.

I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with 
a strawman.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards
Delainey

FYI.  I think this is inappropriate and will speak to Jeff.  Just thought you 
should know.

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH
