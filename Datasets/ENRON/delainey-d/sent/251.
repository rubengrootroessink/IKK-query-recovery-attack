David,

Congratulations on the Fuel Cell venture.  I have been trying to get Enron 
interested in this technology for many years.  I am glad someone found the 
right formula.  I would like to discuss applications of Fuel Cell technology 
and where Enron intends to take this product with someone in your 
organization.  The press release did not disclose who the lead promoter in 
your organization is.  Can you direct me to the right person?

Best regards,

Marion Cole
