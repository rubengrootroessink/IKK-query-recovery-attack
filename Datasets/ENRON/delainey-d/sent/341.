Dave,
FYI, 
On Tuesday, I pulled the trigger on the VPP for Crescendo.  The total was 
just in excess of $8,000,000.  I have executed ISDA for the financial swaps 
and am awaiting final doc's for the Enfolio Master Agreement for execution.  
I have passed this on to Lavorato.  The transaction proceeded fairly 
smoothly.  I have met with John Arnold on the best means of working with his 
group.  He suggested that we continue to work through Fred.  Fred, John 
Prevatt, and Arnold were very helpful in enabling me to pull the trigger at 
the peak of the curve on Tuesday.  I am no longer "spec - ing" gas.  It was 
fun while it lasted.
I will keep you posted.
Scott
