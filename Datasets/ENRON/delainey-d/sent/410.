Craig is coming by today to pitch a few ideas.  I'll let you know what he 
comes up with (or if you'd like to be present when he does, let me know and 
I'll get it on your calendar).  Do you have any preliminary ideas?

On another note, last night was a great idea, and I think it went a long 
way.  Thanks for the intro to the group.

Thanks
Jeff

Jeff, we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and I need 
to know if you want Breslau.  I would like him in a singular role and 
accountability so I need to plan to incorporate him or not depending on if 
you want him.

Regards
Delainey
