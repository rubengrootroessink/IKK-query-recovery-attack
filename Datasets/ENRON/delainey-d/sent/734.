As a shareholder I am extremely happy that you are heading over to EES.  
There is a business there.  They just need some help with the execution and 
implementation.  

I'm sorry to see you leave ENA.  The management style that you and John have 
brought to this organization is the best I've seen.  The attention to details 
and teamwork are really impressive.  Personally, I want to say thanks for all 
of the support that you have provided to me and the West Power Team over the 
last year.  Everything from acknowledging our suceessful business model to 
helping us to refine it through improved metrics in the middle market to 
supporting me and my guys through the PRC process has been greatly 
appreciated!

With EES' large position in the west I'm sure we will be working together in 
the future.  Let me know if there is anything that I can do to help.  Good 
luck.

Regards,
Tim
