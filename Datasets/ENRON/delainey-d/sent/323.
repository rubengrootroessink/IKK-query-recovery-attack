Patience my friend - before a meaningful change can occur in the A/A program 
some of the changes in the EI groups need to be resolved.  That process is 
underway - I envision taking a comprehensive solution to Jeff towards the end 
of this quarter with Charlene on side.  I will discuss with you when I have 
more details.

Regards
Delainey

In as much as I have been one of the bigger supporters of the staff in the 
A/A program and the program itselt, I'm about at my ropes end with them.  How 
do we get control of the thing?  

Jeff
