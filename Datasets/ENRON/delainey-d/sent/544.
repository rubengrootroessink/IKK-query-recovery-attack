Subject: Nella Cappelletto - Resignation


It is with great regret that I announce that Nella has resigned from Enron 
Canada effective July 14th.  Nella has been with Enron Canada for 61/2 years, 
including many of the formative years.  

Nella has been an extraordinarily valuable asset to Enron Canada and she will 
be greatly missed.  Frankly, for all Nella has done for Enron Canada, and the 
dedication, commitment and sincerity with which she has done it, she cannot 
be replaced.  Nella has been instrumental in the development and ongoing 
maintenance and administration of our contracting forms, precedent systems, 
confirmation letters, contracting files, contract diarization and data base 
systems,  and has had significant input on the development and/or 
implementation of key corporate and managerial policies and controls.  

More importantly, Nella always appreciated that, because of the nature of our 
business, our core assets are our contractual rights, and with much personal 
commitment, and often at much personal expense, Nella always endeavored to 
ensure that things not only got done, but that they got done properly and 
punctually.  I know that Linda, Greg, Mark and I (and many of you) will 
discover aspects of our jobs which we did not know existed because they were 
so capably and quietly looked after by Nella.

Most importantly, Nella had great personal commitment to do all she could 
within the limits of available resources to help us achieve our personal 
objectives at Enron Canada, whether or not realistic.  Many of us, in many 
cases without even knowing it, could not have achieved many of our own 
individual accomplishments at Enron Canada without Nella's commitment and 
dedication.

Nella will be missed, and I ask you to bear with us as we continue to try 
meet your requests until we are able to hire a suitable replacement.

Regards, Peter.
