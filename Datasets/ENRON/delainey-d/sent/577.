Guys, I will forward the info as it becomes available.  There appears to be 
one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the 
development road.  If interested in these projects, which have to meet a 
December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we 
purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the 
asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA.  
They are Ok with that strategy.  This is an opportuntity that needs to 
fleshed out fairly quickly - Ben and Dave can you lead this analysis with 
close contact with Doug and Tim on the desk.  We can get together to discuss 
if you like.

Regards
Delainey
