Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board 
meetings and PRC's.

Lets set up this discussion with the following points:
 a) we are not exiting Argentina;
 b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business 
opportunity;
 c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate 
intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater 
productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision 
making and greater communication;
 d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer 
coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and
 e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao 
Paulo.

Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and 
origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources 
based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs 
wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong 
presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural 
issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that 
you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina 
- its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business 
model we are trying to move forward.

Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these 
ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and 
Orlando as part of this process.

Regards
Delainey
