Subject: CONGRATULATIONS!

Congratulations to the entire deal team on the final execution of the AGL-VNG 
contracts! You guys did a great job at identifying the opportunity, managing 
and negotiating with the customer, managing the regulatory and legal 
concerns, and valuing and structuring the deal in a win-win manner! This was 
a very focused effort and managed and executed very well. 

Well done!
