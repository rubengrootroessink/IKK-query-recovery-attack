Larry and Joe, 

Is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on Westinghouse to get 
the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the Gleason 501FD issues  
and the vibration issues at Wheatland?  The phone call by Larry to GE has 
made a world of difference.

Regards
Delainey

Mark,

We have been working diligently with Westinghouse to get a schedule for the 
removal and modification of the blade rings at Gleason.  I requested 
Westinghouse begin to prepare for this work on Sunday after you confirmed 
that we could no longer tolerate the operating restriction being added to the 
unit.  Based on discussions with Westinghouse on Sunday, we estimated that 
the work could be completed in 14 days.  The site began disassembly of unit 
#2 on Monday.  Unit #1 disassembly began on Tuesday because we had to wait 
for the unit to cool down.  

The first verbal schedule from Westinghouse was received Monday night.  It 
showed the blade rings being machined in series at a single shop and resulted 
in the lasy unit being delayed about 4 days.  I told Westinghouse this would 
not be acceptable and that the blade rings needed to be machined in 
parallel.  Westinghouse agreed and has made a second shop available.  Another 
schedule was published yesterday afternoon that required an additional step 
in the disassembly that I felt was not required and added a day to the 
duration.  Westinghouse suggested that we remove the compressor blades from 
the rotor before we remove the blade rings.  I have since concluded that 
removing the rotor blades first is in fact the correct procedure. 

As we discussed at the meeting this morning, this schedule for the blade 
rings, which has been at the site since last night,  will be distributed to 
everyone today.  In addition, the site will incorporate the remaining startup 
activities and issue an integrated schedule tonight.

As we discussed at the meeting this morning, it is very unlikely that Gleason 
#1 and #2 can be available by June 1.  Our optimistic estimate from the 
meeting this morning was June 4-7.

Gavin

Subject: Gleason Blade Ring Schedule

John/Gavin -

We have made progress over the last week in getting GE attention focused on 
the emissions problems at Lincoln.  After 6 days of daily conferences on the 
subject, GE has arrived in force at Lincoln, with the personnel and resources 
required to address the problem.  We are not out of the woods yet, but I 
believe everything is now being done that can be done to get as many machines 
available as possible by June 1.

Enron needs the same focus from Westinghouse, on  issues currently plagueing 
Wheatland and Gleason.  Unlike Lincoln, where the machines are capable of 
producing MW's, these two sites have units that cannot operate.  Namely, 
vibration issues on units 1 and 2 at Wheatland and compressor blade ring 
issues on units 1 and 2 at Gleason.

ENA has been requesting since Monday this week, a definitve and complete 
schedule from EECC, showing the disassembly, shipping, machining, reassembly 
and testing of units 1 and 2 blade rings at Gleason.  We still do not have 
this schedule.  Furthermore, it would appear that after this morning's 
meeting, there is some confusion on what work actually needs to be performed 
in order to accomplish this task and what impact that may have on the 14-day 
schedule committed to ENA by Gavin Gaul on 5/15.  I am not sure whether the 
communication breakdown is between business units at Westinghouse or between 
Enron and Westinghouse, but a schedule and plan is the first step towards 
getting the work done and we are two days into the work.  I am expecting this 
plan to be circulated today.

Lastly, although we have been verbally assured by Westinghouse that there 
will be no operating restrictions, other than routine borescope inspections 
during off-peak periods, OEC would be more comfortable getting this in 
writing.  We are requesting a formal notice from Westinghouse, identifying 
any operational restrictions (post-blade ring repair) on these units.

If there is any assistance you require, please do not hesitate to request 
it.  We collectively have 14 days to declare all 15 units ready for 
commercial operation.
