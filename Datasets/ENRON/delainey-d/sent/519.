David:  

I am the designated PRC Representative for Heather Alon, and I would like to 
schedule a meeting with you to discuss Heather's performance.  I would also 
like to meet Heather personally, either together with you or separately as 
best suits yourselves..

My schedule the week of July 10th is quite open, would you please use the 
Lotus Notes calendar to set up an appointment with me at your convenience 
during the week.

I look forward to meeting you both.

Thanks and regards,

Chip Gehle
