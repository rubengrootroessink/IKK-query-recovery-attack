Dave, we are in the process of making offers to two individuals in Toronto 
for the purposes of covering gas marketing reporting to Eric Le Dain. Lavo 
and I discussed mid-year last year that we needed someone to cover the 
utilities and someone to cover industrials. It has been a difficult hiring 
process, but we are now there.  I would envision both of these marketers 
working closely with Storey on mid-market transactions with Eric's 
involvement on structured/originated transactions.

Regards
Milnthorp

Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada 
and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their 
transactions in Michigan et al.  Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central 
desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to 
Houston? How are the structured deals managed?  Is this still the right split 
for the business?

As we continue to define goals/objectives and coverage staffing in alignment 
with the corresponding trading group, I assumed that Eastern Canada 
origination would fall within the central region.  Specifically opportunities 
with Enbridge, Consumers and Union due to mid-market/trading coverage 
previously being at the central desk.  I understand there is history to this 
division and I have no desire to start any new issues or create larger 
organizational issues.   In the gas re-organization, how did you 
strategically divide Eastern Canada?

I would appreciate your direction or decision.

Thanx,
Laura
