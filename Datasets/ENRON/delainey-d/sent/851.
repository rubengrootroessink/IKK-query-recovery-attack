To Everyone in the Calgary and Toronto offices (from Peter Keohane):

As you know from the numerous press stories and my earlier e-mail messages, 
the Competition Bureau conducted an investigation into the activities of 
Enron Canada Corp. and British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation regarding 
transactions in the Alberta Power Pool.  As you know, we were co-operating to 
the fullest extent possible with the investigating authorities, and we were 
confident that there was no substance to the allegations.  Accordingly, it is 
with great pleasure that I inform all of you that the Competition Bureau has 
announced in a press release, that the alleged offences under the Competition 
Act were unsubstantiated and that the Competition Bureau has closed the 
inquiry.  To quote the Competition Bureau, "The evidence suggests that the 
companies were employing independent business strategies and were not 
colluding on bids."  I want to thank everyone for their co-operation in 
dealing with this disruptive matter.

Regards,
Peter
