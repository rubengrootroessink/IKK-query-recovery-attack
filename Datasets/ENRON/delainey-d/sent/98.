My idea would be to confirm that appropriate due diligence has been done. Has 
the mid-year performance evaluation been reviewed? Has his two direct 
supervisors been contacted (Ozzie Pagan and Gil Muhl) for specific input into 
this? Once all this has been confirmed and everyone has agreed, you should 
make a decision to either re-deploy him to another area or offer him a 
severence package. 

My recommendation would be to have him in a coverage role in Southeast gas.
