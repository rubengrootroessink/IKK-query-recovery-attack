Subject: An Associate who loves EA so much

Dear Mr Delainey:

We met in the Associate Orientation last summer when you asked me if I would 
like to join ENA for my first rotation. But since our first rotation was
assigned instead of chosen by ourselves, I was in no position to accept your 
kindly invitation. Now that I am two months away from finishing my
first rotation, I remembered our conversation during the Orientation and was 
more than eager to send you this  email hoping that your invitation is
still open.

I would love to join ENA (EA).  I believe by doing so, I will be given the 
opportunity to work with the smartest people in this industry.
I also believe I am prepared to join the trading unit in ENA.  I have five 
years' experience in Metals trading - both physical and financial. At
business school at UT Austin, I chose Energy Finance as my concentration and 
enjoyed tremendously these courses:

Risk management: Swap, Options, Delta and Vega hedge,...
Financial Strategy for Energy Companies: Financial decisions on investment 
and long-term hedge, ...
Financial Engineering: Case studies on financial products invented by 
Investment banks
Real Option Valuation: Decision making process considering the optionality in 
the future
Energy Law: Regulation and Environment issues in Energy Industry.

All this above and my passion for this industry and Enron  give me confidence 
to explore the opportunity to work in ENA. Only if you could
give me five minutes of your precious time to allow me to prove my 
qualifications, I will greatly appreciate it.

Have another  great year!
