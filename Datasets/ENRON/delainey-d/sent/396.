Margaret, what is involved with this Permanent Residency application?  How 
does it change my status as a non-immigrant resident?

Regards
Delainey

Dave:  Further to our conversation today, I checked with our immigration 
attorneys, and they confirm that the maximum extension for an L1 visa is two 
years at a time.

However, they did suggest that you might like to consider a Permanent 
Residency application for a Multi-national Executive.  If you would like to 
pursue this avenue, please let me know and we can proceed.

If you have any further questions, please call me at x55083.
