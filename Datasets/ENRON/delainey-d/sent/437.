Rick, I hope you take the time to speak to Rodney Malcolm or Ray Bowen on how 
your technical and commercial exprience could help move the outsourcing 
product (in all its forms) forward in the industrial market.  

Otherwise, your welcome ...

Regards
Delainey

David -

Thank you for meeting with me yesterday, and discussing the Construction 
Exchange product concept.  I'm glad to hear that the Industrials Group  is 
already pursuing this type of project with their customers.  I look forward 
to their success, and believe this should bring significant value to Enron 
North America.

Thanks again for your time.

Rick
