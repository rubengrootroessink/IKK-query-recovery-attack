Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation 
of approximately $39 M.  Please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of 
value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your 
continued management.

Let me know where you end up.

Regards
Delainey
