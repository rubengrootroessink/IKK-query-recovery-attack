David, Greg told me that you were going to create a master list of 
reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the Wholesale OOC's catches 
all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.  I would suggest that we 
follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all 
reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at 
mid-year.  I would shoot for 100% participation target.  How are we making 
out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?

Regards
Delainey
