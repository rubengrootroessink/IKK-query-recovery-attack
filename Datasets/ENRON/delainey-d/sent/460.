Don, go ahead and set it up - what have been discussing with them on the gas 
side?

Did CSFB tell them about the $400 Kw capital cost plus the three year 
transistion agreement for $4.00 kw/m?

Tell Beverly or Kay to make time for next week if Mr Forster can make it.

Regards

Dave,

CSFB spoke with DPL today.  Pete Forster (chairman) said he wants to meet 
with you to discuss peakers and other opportunities on the trading and 
marketing side.  Besides 3200 MWs of Ohio regulated assets, DPL has a peaking 
strategy in ECAR and today has 400-500 MWs in development (interesting to 
have peaking strategy with no T&M).  They would like to look at our peakers 
to supplement strategy.  Forster didn't flinch when they said $400 kW is the 
ballpark number.  More interestingly, Forster went into his desire to talk 
with you about other ideas relating to T&M.  

Forster suggested 27th or 28th of July for the meeting.  You are more open on 
the 28th.  It appears Forster may be open to coming down here.  He wants CSFB 
and us to co-ordinate meeting schedule.  CSFB is DPL's main advisor, and the 
guys that negotiated the KKR deal a while back.

Apparently we are talking with these guys on the gas side.

Regards,

Don
