Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not 
dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product 
offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large 
industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority 
shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I 
already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business 
initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.

Regards
Delainey

My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next 
WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan 
to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001.  
Key points for discussion will be:

-brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America
-brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report 
through wholesale
-discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value 
proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the 
retail business a success:
 -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., 
 -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake


Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in 
Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will 
try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those 
involved present on the call/meeting.
