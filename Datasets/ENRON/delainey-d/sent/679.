Sounds good - I think you have a great opportunity in this market - I would 
suggest staffing aggressively in order to take the first mover advantage.  I 
note the associate needs.

Dave, I missed one point regarding the Toronto trader. Lavorato and Belden 
have identified an associate and he's interested in coming to Toronto. He is 
in Toronto today meeting with DeVries. As a sidebar, our new office space in 
Toronto is extremely impressive (cost was Cdn $500K) and is a great selling 
feature. Hopefully this puts the trading associate "over the top". 

Regards,
Milnthorp

Dave, thanks for the note. Regarding an update for Toronto, we made an offer 
to a senior industrial marketer yesterday  (Jeff Borg - 10 years experience) 
while I was in Toronto. I believe that he will accept. In addition, Paul is 
interviewing for one more deal maker (targeting John Guerro at Duke - an 
industrial gas marketer) and a manager for ENERconnect   (has interviewed a 
couple - meeting with Doug Jones from TD Bank next week). 

Scott Gilbert who is running our volume management is out recruiting for 
backoffice staff (needs 5 specialists). No success here as of yet.

Mark Haedicke, Peter Keohane and myself are working on transferring Chris 
Gaffney (Canadian Lawyer) to work in Toronto. Chris is interested and both 
Mark and myself think it would be a good fit/career move.

Dawn, Paul and myself are devising a more aggressive recruiting strategy for 
Toronto for both Paul's and Scott's groups as our presence in Toronto is 
limited. This may include full page ads in the Globe, use of head hunters 
and/or Super Saturdays. With 2 million people in Toronto, we should be having 
more success in recruiting high quality individuals.

It is my understanding that 94 new analysts are starting this August in 
Houston. I need a minimum of 5 (2 for Toronto, 3 for Calgary). I have asked 
Dawn to make this happen, but if there is any way that you can exercise your 
influence to assist in making this happen, that would be much appreciated. 

Regards
Milnthorp
