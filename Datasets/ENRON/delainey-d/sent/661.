Mike, I forwarded your interest to Whalley, McConnel and McMahon.  Any=20
technology effort really should be lead by NetWorks.  This is consistent wi=
th=20
Skillings strategy and what has been communicated to the analysts.  You=20
should receive a call from one of these gentlemen.

Regards
Delainey

David, =20

I hope all is well.  I had another good week at pulp and paper.  As you kno=
w=20
I have an affinity for technology trading.  I thought you would enjoy the=
=20
fine words below as you start a new week. =20

Time is your most precious possession-and the hands of time move swiftly=20
onward.  Fasten this warning deep into your mind, not for sorrow=01,s sake,=
 but=20
to remind yourself that today may be all you have.  Now is the time for you=
=20
to move forward. Now is the time for you to stand and be counted.  The grou=
nd=20
is now ready for you to plant the seeds of a new vision, one that will bear=
=20
only the finest fruit.  It is time to focus on what you want, to turn dream=
s=20
into realities so that you are able to spend your life in the manner in whi=
ch=20
you desire.  It is later than you think.    Too many of us waste our years=
=20
waiting for better times in the future or reflecting upon better times in t=
he=20
past, instead of working for better times in the present.  --------------- =
If=20
only we had better schooling, better opportunities, or better resources.=20
If,if,if!  Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow! =20
-------------------------------------

Today is always here; yesterday is gone; and tomorrow never comes.  Time=20
offers opportunity but demands a sense of urgency.  Now is the time.  This =
is=20
the place.  You are the one!

Those who leave a legacy of achievement master the art of living in the now=
-=20
the ability to make each moment count.  Here are their tips.

? First, they accept each moment as a gift to be received with joy.
? Second, they use each moment to maximum advantage.
? Third, they are bent on making a contribution to humanity.
? Fourth, they learn from their mistakes.
? Fifth, they concentrate on the task at hand.
? Sixth, they plan for the future rather than fretting over the past.
? Seventh, they simply refuse to allow the weight of an unpleasant=20
circumstance to encumber their thoughts or objectives.

                                                                           =

I think technology is made up of a number of tradable commodities.  These=
=20
commodities are volatile and trading them will add value to ENA.  I would=
=20
like the opportunity to create this group.

Best wishes,
