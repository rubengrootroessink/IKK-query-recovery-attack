David, your message was probably intended for Susan R. Lewis (who I believe 
has left the company).  Just an FYI for you to take her off your distribution 
list (and me too)!!

Subject: Dinner with ENA Associates & Analysts

Please plan to attend a  reception and dinner for those Analysts and 
Associates due to rotate in the near future who have made significant 
contributions to  Enron North America.  The function will be hosted  by the 
Office of the Chairman at Morton's Steak House located at 5000 Westheimer on 
July 27, 2000.  The reception will start at 7:00pm with dinner to follow at 
7:45pm.  Please RSVP to Ted Bland at ext. 3-5275 no later than close of 
business Monday, July 24.  This will be an informal gathering to discuss the 
progress of ENA and an open forum to interact with the management team on a 
one on one basis.  See you on Thursday. 

 Mark, Dave and John
