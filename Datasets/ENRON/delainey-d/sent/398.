Janet, get rid of these LM's - too many cooks!

As I mentioned to you earlier, there is much interest/concern about managing 
the ENE portfolio of turbines, both from a balance sheet and a deal 
perspective, as a result I've had numerous data requests in the last few 
weeks including one today from RAC.

I thought you might be interested in the comment I have highlighted below, in 
blue, regarding the LM6000's.

Thanks Mike - the effort underway (by RAC and EECC) is an overall Enron 
turbine effort, to which the LM6000's are a subset.  Rick Buy must report to 
Skilling and the board on the "long" turbine position....... thus the current 
effort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be 
keeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with 
input from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we 
don't have redundant list efforts going.  

Matt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I 
think some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  
I will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  

Additionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using 
to track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are 
intended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  

Finally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the 
LM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure 
that Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were 
not listed).  

In summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so 
we can remove unneccessary work.  

Thanks for the note!  F.Kelly

To avoid confusion, we should not have everyone generating separate turbine 
lists.  Matt Gimble at ENA/Houston is sheperding a comprehensive list and is 
setting it up at a site that everyone can access.  The current issue is 
attached.  When Matt has the site location set up, I will notify you.

Thanks!

Mike,

The Master Turbine Listing contains the schedules that Tammy Shepperd and I 
gathered together.
It includes an overal Turbine Inventory, Brian Hulse's LM6000 schedules and 
an LM6000 Timing page.
The LM6000 Configuration is Ben Jacoby's schedule.

As soon as Tammy and I set up the protection on the Master Turbine Schedule, 
I will send you its
location.

Thanks for all of your help and feedback,
Mathew
