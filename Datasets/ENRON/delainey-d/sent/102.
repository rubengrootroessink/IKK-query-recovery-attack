Paul, thanks for the note.  Please clarify the following for me:  break out 
2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the 
ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al.

Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams 
2001 plans.

Regards
Delainey
