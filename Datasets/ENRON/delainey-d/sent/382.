Guys, I would like to schedule a quarterly meeting to review our technical 
risk as a part of this reporting procedure.  Wayne can you set up a meeting 
for the four of us over the next few weeks.  

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Technical Risk Reports

Attached are first drafts of reports for Dave Delainey that detail assets 
that may or may not pose a technical risk for ENA. The current draft was 
developed with input from Wayne Mays, Mark Dobler and Andrea Reed.

I would be most appreciative if each of you would review these reports at 
your earliest convenience and respond back with your comments/updates.  
Please note:   In the Technical book dated 8/03 there are 2 tabs - Risk and 
No risk.

Dave has asked for this report to be updated monthly for inclusion in a 
reporting package for ENA's Office of the Chair.  After we are satisfied that 
this is the proper format and is all inclusive I will communicate a process 
for monthly updates.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.
