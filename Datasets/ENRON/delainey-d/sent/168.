D'Arcy, sorry I missed you last week. I am going to be down in Rio mid 
November for some meetings with the S American team. Maybe we can have a 
discussion then?

I would very much like to get your opinion.

Regards
Delainey

David, I am in Houston for meetings on Thursday afternoon and Friday, Oct 
26-27.   

Do you have 30 minutes for me for some discussion on commercial opportunities 
in regards to electricity in Brazil, regional natural gas and crude oil and 
products - including some perspective on our present execution capability and 
competitive profile.

I would like to introduce myself for consideration to working within your 
respective groups, but also including some commercial ideas relative to the 
South American region and elsewhere.  

I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not, 
and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.   

I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need, 
including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron.


Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.
