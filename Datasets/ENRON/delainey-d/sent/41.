Dave,

Here is the list of folks involved in Cuiaba.

Laine Powell and his team - Project execution team for Cuiaba, located in 
Cuiaba
Jose Anson - Develpment -  Engineering/Permitting
Joan Carlos Albuquerque - FURNAS/Eletrobra relationship
Valeria Lima - ANP relationship
Daine Duarte - Local in Cuiaba.  Sounds like formally part of Lammers' team, 
but practically part of Laine's team
Jose Lucio dos Reis Neto - Agencies involved in electric system operation.  
Recovery oil fuel oil costs (complicated story/very important task)
Jose Bestard - Project continuity.  Original PPA negotiations
John Novak - Lawyer...key to financing
Rob Gay - Financing lead...key to financing
Rick Lammers - Commercial project lead

I sent this on top of Pete Weidler's e-mail and summarized a good part of it 
above.  Only Lammers and Gay were not mentioned in Pete's e-mail.

Another thought...pull people in from EE&CC as part of the "new team".  No 
basis in fact here, but I suspect there are too many contractor/owner games 
going on.  Probably need the EE&CC key people list as well.  Do you want me 
to shake it loose, do you want to work it with Leff, or bad idea?

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,

KIsh

Joe - this is the list I asked Laine to put together. - I asked him not to 
list all the folks under Laine - as I assume they stay with the project no 
matter where it goes.


Jose Anson - he is the coordinator of permitting at IBAMA and ANP for the 
pipeline.  He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of 
his efforts on the IBAMA license.  Key person.

Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he 
is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.  Not only does he know 
folks but he also gets things done within the system.

Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.

Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the 
year after which she has been dialed out.  Have asked Rick several times 
about her future with his group.  She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to 
relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that 
are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.

Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.  He 
has been a key to our success on the CCC account.  He is a must to making the 
project successful.  Knows the contacts and basically understands the project 
from the regulatory and CCC account point-of-view.

Two other people that are not involved in "our side" of fence on a daily 
basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.  Jose knows the 
history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project.


Pete

Pete,

But you (or does anyone) have a definitive team list for Cuiaba?  Need this 
for transition planning purposes.  I agree with your sentiment that some 
folks may be pulling double duty while we button up Cuiaba.   Just need to 
know "how many" and "who".

Thanks,

Kish

Subject: Cuiaba Review

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Pete
