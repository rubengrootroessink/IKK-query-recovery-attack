Jim, lets get together in the next week or so to discuss progress.  In the 
meantime, what are we doing with regard to FERC 637 to ensure that we have 
favourable rules in the trading of natural gas transportation capacity?  Do 
we have a master summary of the RTO proposals submitted last week?

Regards
Delainey
