Kay, I forwarded a message to you from Sheri Sierra from a gentleman looking

Please follow up with Joe.

Joe, I will forward his voice mail to you.  EES has enough challenges in NA 
and Europe before tackling retail products and services in a market with no 
wholesale market.

Please follow up.

Thanks
Delainey

Thanks for the quick response, Joe.  Peter did call me earlier this 
afternoon, and I transferred him to Dave Delainey.  Unfortunately, I failed 
to get his phone number before transferring him, but I understand from Dave's 
assistant that he left Dave a voicemail.  I'm sure he left his number there.  
I did, however, gleen from him that he and his investors already own the 50 
buildings (not in the process of buying them as I originally thought) and 
have +/- 100 additional properties they manage.

I'm stepping out of the middle of this one now unless there is anything 
further you need me to do.  Good luck - I hope it's a real deal - I've never 
had origination next to my name before!  SRS

Sherri,

We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently 
working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract 
terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to 
EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some 
real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide 
power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of 
other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off 
balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case 
we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence.

Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a 
particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our 
biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us.

Gentlemen,

You will receive a phone call from Peter Wachtell sometime over the next 
week.  I spoke to his father last night at a dinner party; Peter is putting 
together a deal in Tokyo right now to purchase 50 office buildings and manage 
another 100.  He is interested in talking to Enron about energy outsourcing.

I'm assured that this a legitimate deal, but that will be for you to decide!  
Just wanted to give you a heads up in the hopes you will take a few minutes 
to talk to him.

SRS
