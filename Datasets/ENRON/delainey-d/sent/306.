Hey guys, just a few housekeeping notes:

1.)  Employee Expenses:  We really need to try and trim the expenses where 
and whenever possible. Get your Assistants to make all reservations for 
air/hotel/car so that they can ensure the best rates for your needs. ENA (and 
our groups) spends an incredible amount of money on travel expenses and we 
really need to attempt to trim this back where we can. Efficiencies in 
booking can probably help a lot. That means use Vitol or TAP or whoever else 
if they're cheaper and give you good service. Letting your Assistants handle 
your travel arrangements will not only ensure the best rates, it should allow 
you to spend more time on more productive endeavors! 

2.)  Customer trips/expenses: Any customer expense greater than $2000 must be 
approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman in advance of the expenditure.  
Your Assistants have the forms and once you've filled them out, I need to 
approve/sign them before going upstairs for approval.

3.)  All employee reviews should be completed by now for 
Directors/Managers/Associates/Analysts/ Assistants. All reviews should be 
written, signed by both the supervisor and employee, and given to Fran Mayes 
for filing.  Fran- If you have not received all written reviews by this 
Friday, please advise. This should include the 5 East Midstream groups and 
both the Gas and Power Structuring groups. We have just completed the VP PRC 
as of yesterday and I will be sitting down with each of the VP's for feedback 
over the next week.

4.) We are entering the homestretch for most of our deals this year and it is 
extremely important that we stay completely focused on doing everything 
possible to bring these deals to closure. Top priorities as I see them are as 
follows:

Ozzie Pagan:  TexMex, Alamac/Cogentrix, Green Jacket, Brazos/Tenaska
Jeff Ader:          NSTAR, CRRA,  Silver Oak, ConEd, NYSEG
Bruce Sukaly:  AES-NY, Assets (Cinergy/Wilton Plant/ Pontiac/Plano, 
EPNG/Wheatland, etc), AEC
Gil Muhl:            PSEG, NJN
Laura Luce:      Manlove Storage Monetization, HUB deals
Ben Jacoby:   Florida Merchant Plant, Continue building optionality on Site 
Bank, Coal Plant development
Ed and Bernie: Continue to drive the commodity deals to closure

We're definitely set up to execute on our 2000 business plan and strategy. 
The above deals are our #1 priority for the rest of the year. Let's stay very 
well coordinated on these deals and do everything we can to drive them to 
closure. Elevate any internal hurdles earlier rather than later and  I'll 
personally handle them.
There are many other deals I'd like to also see closed ( Tangerine and Ft. 
Pierce - George McCormick, Vepco/NC - Heather Kroll, ANP-Mark Bernstein, 
VNG/AGL- Ed McMichael, TXU- Jim Ducote, Energen/Haywood - Healy/Jacoby) and 
many others I'd like to continue to see get teed up for next year.  

5.)  Please forward any information above to your groups if appropriate.

Thanks!
