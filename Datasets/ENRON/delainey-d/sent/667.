Guys, I appreciate the updates. Please ensure 1) that you, as ENA, are 
integrated 2) deliver a very clear expectation with EE&CC with a credible 
plan and 3) that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed.  You 
will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we 
get over the goal line.

Keep me in the loop daily so that I can keep the pressure on at a senior 
level.

Regards
Delainey
