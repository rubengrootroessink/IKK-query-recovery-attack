Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should 
have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any 
thoughts on this Eric/Dorie?

Dave and John --

In the past, ENA has held an all-employee business meeting over at the Hyatt 
in April or May.  Do you plan to hold such a meeting?  If so, we need to get 
started on planning the event.  Dorie Hitchcock has typically handled the 
arrangements.  Please advise.

Eric
