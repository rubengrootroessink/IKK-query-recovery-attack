Stuart, only New Albany and Doyle would be left.  As you have indicated, 
Doyle is 100% committed to Ogelthorpe.

Dave,

I am sorry to bother you with this, but I need the benefit of your global 
information base.  Please take a look at the attached email that I sent 
yesterday (the critical issue is in bold faced type).  It is really important 
that we provide a prompt response so that Cinergy can complete their FERC 
filings in a timely manner.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

Stuart

I believe the correct answer is only New Albany since we do not control the 
MW's for Doyle.  New Albany is a nominal 380MW facility.

Subject: Answer required in connection with FERC filings for Cinergy

Sam Behrends of LLGM needs to have an answer to the following question no 
later than the end of business today.  Please provide any information that 
you might have.

"Following the sale of the 2000 peakers to Allegheny and the two 99 peakers 
to Cinergy, how much generation will Enron still own within two wheels of 
TVA?"

I think that the answer is New Albany and Doyle (except that we only own 50% 
of Doyle and Doyle does not have any merchant capacity to sell (i.e. the 
facility is fully dedicated to Oglethorpe)).  I am not certain, however, that 
I have thought of everything and don't know the capacities for these two 
facilities.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Stuart
