Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope 
and function of Redmond's group.

Thanks

Dave,

Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more 
important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas 
organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and 
resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications 
(if any) it might be worth discussing.

Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron 
Americas org for which I might be qualified, I'd certainly be interested in 
any new opportunities that come about.

Thanks!

Mike
