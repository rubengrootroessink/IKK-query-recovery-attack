Dave, I am seeking your approval to take my group on an offsite to Las Vegas 
sometime in late 3rd/early 4th quarter. Cost is approx Cdn $1000/person for 
flight and accomodation (thursday - sunday). As you know, we have done this 
for a number of years but I'm not sure what approvals were obtained in the 
past as it was either your group or Lavorato's group at the time. This would 
involve Origination only as Trading is doing an offsite in conjunction with 
the rest of Shankman's group. It should be noted also that we decided not to 
attend the Masters this year as we didnt think it generated enough business 
following last years trip -  this cut our expenses substantially. Please let 
me know your thoughts on this. 

Regards
Milnthorp
