Rick, I need your view on which of these deals need to go through the board:

 - Tex Mex (ERCOT to Mexico transmission line with term PPA with Desarco)
 - Ahlstrom (QF Purchase)
 - CRRA/Fuel Cell Energy (fuel cell deal with Conn. regulators)
 - sale of Pastoria and LV Cogen (assume not)
 - sale of ECP (assume not)
 - sale of HPL (assume not).

Regards
Delainey
