Subject: meeting w/Enron Wind

I am contacting you to confirm our meeting with you and some of your 
colleagues next Wed. June 14th, 3-4PM.  Attending on Enron Wind's behalf will 
be Kurt Huneke and Adam Umanoff (MD, Commercial Americas)

In the last two months Enron completed the acquisition of the minority shares 
(~20%) in Enron Wind Corp.   As a result of this decision, Enron has also 
made a variety of changes in Enron Wind as a first step to maximizing our 
return in this industry.

One of the very next steps we are taking is an effort to reacquaint the 
various operating subsidiaries with Enron Wind.  As the regulatory 
environment evolves in North America a number of new opportunities are 
evolving which should benefit ENA as a result of Enron's market position.

We thought it might be useful if John Lavorato, Janet Dietrich and Kevin 
Presto were available to join us as well.  Please feel free to invite anyone 
else you feel would be appropriate.  As you may know, we have begun to 
discuss some of these opportunities with EPMI and we are encouraged by the 
way we see the market developing.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this meeting.

Thank you,
Michael Payne
