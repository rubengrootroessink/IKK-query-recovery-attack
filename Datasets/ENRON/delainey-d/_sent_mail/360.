Mike, lets discuss just after Wayne and I get together to discuss the 
technical book or in conjunction.

Subject: Planning for Technical Support Requirements

Dave and Dave,

Wayne Mays and I are trying to assess technical support requirements for the 
next 12-24 months.  We would like to talk with each of you to get you input 
on the direction the company is going, and what type and level of support is 
likely to be required as we go forward.

If possible, we'd like to schedule a brief (30 minute) conference call, 
preferably within the next week, with each of you to discuss these issues.  
If you have a time that would be convenient, please let me and/or Wayne know 
so that we can get it scheduled.

Thanks!

Mike Coleman
