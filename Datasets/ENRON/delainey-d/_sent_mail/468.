David, I wouldn't do the Brown Bag (too often- too hard to keep doing); I 
wouldn't do the Social Gathering (too country clubish); I like the Monthly 
Dinner/Cocktail Hour/Ballgame, etc with the OTC and parts of the management  
team as a forum to identify talent, give A&A's exposure to the management 
team and to "sell" ENA. I would suggest that we make it every two months 
rather than monthly. However, I would have the first one very quickly for the 
top rated A&A in ENA that are due to rotate soon in order to try and pitch 
them on staying in ENA - maybe dinner and ballgame. 

For the resource management and coaching part of the program, lets wait until 
we see where we end up on any possible changes to the program first.  I 
assume that you are working on a couple strawmen on possible alternatives. 
Once we have a few ideas, I would like to pitch Whalley, Sherriff and Mark 
when I get back.

Lets go ahead and implement above ASAP.

Regards
Delainey
