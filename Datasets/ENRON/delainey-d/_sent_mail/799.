Mike, as a policy offsites and retreats, especially more exotic and 
expensive, are being discouraged.  I would prefer the Galveston offsite and I 
don't see a need for more than one per year.  Please manage through PR - 
Dorie Hitchcock - she will  require an agenda as part of the approval 
process.  I would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of 
the offsite.  

If you have some concerns lets discuss.  

Regards
Delainey

Dave,

As part of my ongoing effort to maintain a high level of morale within the 
group, I would like to undertake a couple of outings during the first half of 
the year.  Given the fact that I now report to you directly and these outings 
will involve spending some money, I don't want to commit to anything before 
reaching agreement with you on the following:

Weekend offsite in Galveston (at Hotel Galvez) in April.  Group dinner on 
Friday, Golf at Galveston Country Club on Saturday morning, meetings and 
beach time during afternoon/evening on Saturday, group deep sea fishing 
outing on Sunday.  Given that the capacity of the boat exceeds the number of 
people in my group, I intend to invite one or more other groups from ENA as a 
way of fostering better communications.  Total cost of the entire weekend 
should not exceed $15,000.00.

Team building exercise on Mt. Hood (Oregon) in July.  Despite my present 
residence in Houston, I previously lived for many years in Europe, including 
4+ years in Switzerland.  During this time, I became an avid mountain 
climber.  I would like to take as many member of my group as are willing to 
climb Mt. Hood (which I have climbed several times - not a huge challenge).  
Given Mt. Hood's proximity to Portland, I would of course combine this with 
half a day spent with Chris Calger and his group (and may even invite them to 
accompany us).  Total cost would be around $450 per person plus 
transportation. 

I would like to go ahead and finalize arrangements for the above unless you 
have strenuous objections.  Please let me know.
