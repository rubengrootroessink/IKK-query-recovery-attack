Jeff, can you speak briefly with Kevin on this one - intriguing idea if the 
execution was probable.

By the way, what is our plan with Sithe?

Put a bid into SOCO's shareholders for the transmission assets only.  Since 
the market is valuing Genco assets at a much higher multiple, a bid at book 
value for the transco would be very intriguing to the existing shareholder 
base.

Given a high probability of supply shortage in Florida over the next 2-4 
years, the transmission gateway to Florida is extremely valuable, 
particularly if expansions are done off the existing system.

In addition, it would give Enron tremendous regulatory leverage with the 
pending Entergy/FPL (SOCO connects systems), and the entire SE market, 
including TVA.

I know it's a longshot, but we will have to do something radical to bust open 
the SE market into a free functioning commodity market.  The SE is 
essentially untapped from a power trading standpoint right now, and the 
market is nearly 200,000 MW if you include Florida.
