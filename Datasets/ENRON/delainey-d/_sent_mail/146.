Janet and Bruce,

On behalf of the Analyst and Associate Program, I want to take this 
opportunity to let you know what a wonderful job Michelle Parks did while 
recruiting at Cornell.  I don't know whether you are aware but we had an 
interviewer not show up.  He also had not called to cancel.  Michelle was in 
the lobby waiting to leave and became aware of the situation.  Although she 
had pressing business in Houston, she made arrangements to stay so that we 
did not have to cancel the schedule.  
Cornell is one of our core schools and it would have been quite embarrassing 
to cancel a full schedule.

We truly appreciate Michelle selflessness and believe she more than exhibits 
Enron's vision and values.  She should be commended.  

Thanks

Charlene Jackson
