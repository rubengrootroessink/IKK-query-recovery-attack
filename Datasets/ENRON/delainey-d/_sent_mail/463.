Losing this 175 MW unit will cost us approx. $2.0 million in lost margin 
(higher if the South blows out).

Verified that one blade broke off from the 7th stage of blades in the 
compressor.  The shrapnel caused unreparable damage to 3 additional blades.  
From the pictures, it appears that one of the damaged blades was close to 
breaking off, and likely would have caused much more significant damage to 
the compressor AND turbine.

We've begun the process of removing the damaged blades.  Westinghouse has the 
repair lead, and so far, is giving it the right level of attention.  My plant 
manager's driving the effort on the ground, but I have a compressor engineer 
that will be at the site tomorrow to serve as my eyes and ears so Pete can 
concentrate on keeping the other two units running.

Barring as-yet undiscovered damage (doubtful), my best guess is that we lose 
next week, but get the unit back for the week of 24 July.  This hinges on 
Westinghouse securing four replacement blades which they are scrambling to 
do.  All costs should fall on Westinghouse warranty.

I'm collecting the information we might need in order to file a business 
process interruption insurance claim, but based on my best-guess schedule, I 
don't expect to file the claim.

Mitch
