Dave:
I know we just completed a deal with Cinergy, but I have another idea for us 
to kick around with these guys.  They are building 1,000 MWs, very efficient, 
coal facility along the Ohio river.  Talking with Ben Jacoby and Fred Mitro I 
found out that we are looking at either building a coal facility or investing 
in one, which would create a great hedge against gas.  I am beginning to go 
through the information that Ben and Fred have put together and I wanted to 
sign up a CA with Cinergy regarding this issue.  I was planning on running 
with this, but wanted to make sure this was the type of investment that we 
might be interested in.  I think a partnership in coal with Cinergy could be 
a great partnership for us.  I hope this idea is what you had in mind.  
Thanks in advance for your time.
Regards,
Ben
