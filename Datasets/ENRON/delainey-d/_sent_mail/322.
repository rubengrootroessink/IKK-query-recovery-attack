Guys, ENA will take responsibility for the two 7EA's.  We do not currently 
have any projects for the Westinghouse 501D5A's.  However, I do not know what 
Bowen's view might be for EIM or Haug's for CALME.

Regards
Delainey

Karen - let me know if it would be beneficial to brief Rick or Jeff.  I'll 
stop whatever I'm doing if necessary.  I think on this particular turbine 
purchase...... there is great interest from ENA, Calme, and EECC third pty.  
I agree that in general - we can't take our eye off the ball with respect to 
the long turbines.  F.Kelly
