Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price 
contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from 
such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget.  
My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like 
#1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests 
appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already 
given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end 
of the scale and early.

Drop me a note on where you end up.

Regards
Delainey

Dave:

Do you have any general guidance on how you would like for me to approach the 
EPC contract with NEPCO Houston?  The three options that we currently have on 
the table are:

Fixed engineering/internal costs with pass-through on external costs with fee.
Same structure with cap.
Fixed price contract.

Our last conversation was very focused on a fixed price contract.  My 
conversations with Dan Leff were moving in the direction of one or two.  My 
concern on a fixed price number is the timing and my negotiating position, 
but I understand your issues.  Any general thoughts would be helpful.

Thanks,
Brett
