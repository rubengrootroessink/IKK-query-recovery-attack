Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I 
understand your position.  In the interest of facilitating continuing 
dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions, I 
will send you our document.  I would suggest that we try to set up a follow 
up meeting in early October once you have completed your work.

Regards
Dave Delainey

Dave

Thanks for your September 25 email.  TVA is currently developing the numbers
we agreed to share in our meeting last week, but given the importance of
this effort, TVA is going to need additional time.  Trying to complete the
task by this afternoon did not prove feasible.  We can, however, have this
information ready by October 13.

I will give you a call to discuss a mutually satisfactory method for
exchanging the information.

Regards
Ike Zeringue
