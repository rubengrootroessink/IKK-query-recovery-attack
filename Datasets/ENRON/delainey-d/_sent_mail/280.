Dave,

Thanks for following through with the contact.  As we discussed, the 
discussions we had with Calpine were at a local level and very preliminary, 
with Bridgeline indicating to Calpine that we are always open to looking at 
ways that will enhance shareholder value.  I agree with you that at this time 
it has a low probability of evolving into anything.  

On a separate note, I would like to take you up on your offer of your time 
and resources.  I know that Bridgeline is a very small component of the 
things that are on your radar screen, but if it is not too much of an 
imposition, I would like to have a one on one discussion with you concerning 
a few of the issues we discussed at the management committee mtg.

I want to make sure that I am crystal clear on the perspectives and desires 
of both parents.  Coming from Texaco, I feel like I have a good feel for 
Texaco's short and long term expectations for the partnership, however I 
would like to dig a little deeper with you on a few of the issues we 
discussed at the management committee mtg, and a couple of your points in 
your follow up email to me.

The afternoon or evening would work best for me, and I would be happy to pick 
up the tab for dinner one night if that fits with your schedule.  The balance 
of this week is kind of tight, however, the week of September 2nd and 9th are 
fairly open with the exception of Tuesday night the 3rd.

Thanks for your help, look forward to talking to you soon. 


Randy

Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential 
interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real 
knowledge of the potential deal.  Likely this originates at the local level 
and is probably a long put.  Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more 
detail over the next week.

Regards
