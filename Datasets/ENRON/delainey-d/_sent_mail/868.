Kay, can you set up some time - perhaps in the new year for a lunch - my 
office should be fine.

Regards

Dear Dave,

Very nice meeting and talking to you last Saturday at the party!  This is Li 
Sun, hopefully you still remember me as I said:" I know you and you don't 
know me, that is always the case."  Actually I talked to you at the other 
party in Kevin Hannon's house for summer associates last year, the 
conversation was quite enjoyable and I was greatly impressed by your 
experience with Enron.  

Just want to say hello and please accept my best wishes in this holiday 
season! And I wonder whether you would be kind enough to have time for lunch 
or coffee sometime.

All the best!

Li
