Hello everyone!

Joe Sutton would like to have a meeting to discuss the above subject on 
Monday, September 18 at 10:00 am - Houston time.  If you plan to be in 
Houston at this time, please meet in Jeff's office.  A telecon number will be 
arranged and we will furnish this number to you tomorrow.

Due to Jeff's very busy September calendar - this is the only slot we could 
get.

Thanks for your support!
