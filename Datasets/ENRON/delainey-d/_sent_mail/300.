Chas - suggest you talk with Dave Delianey - Pres. of Enron North America in 
Houston.  ENA is responsible for all of our North American trading, 
origination and development activities.  I will send Dave a copy of our 
correspondence.  Thanks.

George

George,

Thanks for the note and the message. I will try to call you later today, but
will send this note just in case I miss you.

While I am interested in following up with Tim about our project in the NW,
there are two other more pressing reasons for talking with the right guys at
Enron. First, we have just secured the rights to a 1600 MW plant in Texas -
permitting complete and just about ready for financing. We are also close to
securing the rights to a 800 MW project in Oklahoma. So we would like to
talk about tolling, etc. for both of those plants.

Also, word on the street is that Enron is not only selling existing
generating stations, but also its projects under development. I think I saw
a report that your CEO denied this. But, if there is any truth in the
statement, we would like to follow up, especially concerning the development
sites. It may be possible for us to take over development and have a tie
back to Enron for the marketing (and perhaps the operations) of the project.

Hope you are enjoying London,

Cheers,

Chuck

Chas - I left a message on your voice mail regarding Tim Belden, who heads
up our west power desk.  Tim can be reached at 503-464-3820 (Portland).

Tim - Chuck Brown is a principal in Newport Generation (Irvine), and is
developing a gas- fired merchant generating station in the Pacific
Northwest.  He would like to talk with you about a PPA / marketing
agreement for the output of the station.  His number is 949-475-9570.
Please contact Chuck to discuss the details.  Thanks.

I am in London this week and can be reached at 44-20-7783-4160 if either of
you would like any additional information.  Otherwise I leave it in your
capable hands to get together.

Cheers,

George
