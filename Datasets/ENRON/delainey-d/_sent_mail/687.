In order for the Enron Performance Review process to work effectively, it is 
essential that employees receive written performance evaluations. The 
attached list indicates Associates and Analysts in your business unit for 
whom we have not received written YE2000 performance evaluations.  Thank you 
for your attention to this matter.  If you need any additional information 
please do not hesitate to contact me.
