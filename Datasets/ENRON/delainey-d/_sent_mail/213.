Guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100M in 
nominal value):
  a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M
  b) 2 ABB 11N1 - Rob- $35M
  c) 1 501D5A - Janet/Chris - $25M
  d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20M

All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects.  
Could you please provide me your plan with these units.  I would like to 
flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all 
our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002.

Regards
Delainey
