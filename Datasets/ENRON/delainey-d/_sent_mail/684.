Subject: FULL TIME ANALYST NEEDS

The Analyst Program had a successful recruiting season.  As a result, we are 
expecting  94  analysts beginning this August and would like to discuss your 
staffing needs for a full-time Analyst(s).  To implement this process, please 
provide me with your departmental needs and what skill sets are necessary.  

Please include the following in your response:
 * head count (number of analysts needed)
 * skill sets required
 * overview of job description.
 
Once I have received your response, resumes will be forwarded to you for 
review.  We have a pool of great talent coming in and the placements will be 
on a first-come first-serve basis. 

Thank you
Shelly Jones
