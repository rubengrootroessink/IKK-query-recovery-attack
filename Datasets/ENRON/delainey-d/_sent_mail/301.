Dear Mr. Bibi,

After giving more thought to our initial conversation, I have attached a
short document comparing Blacklight's (BLP) technology to fuel cell
technology.  BLP is developing a technology for the distributed electric
market.  We have prototypes under development, and the costs for our
technology compare favorably to the existing market.  The brochure will
elaborate on the advantages of our technology.

As we discussed, BLP is an R&D firm contacting companies that might have
complementary assets which would expedite the commercialization of our
technology.  As a result of our first discussion, I understand that Enron
might not be interested in new generation technology.  I wanted to provide
you with additional information on BLP.  If Enron's strategies change,
please contact me.  If you know other companies interested in investing or
joint developing a new generation technology, please let me know.  Thank you
for taking the time to review our materials.

Best Regards,

William Good
