Hi Mr. Delainey,

Our records indicate that we are missing social security numbers for
Dawna Jean, Samantha Jean, and Kassandra Dawn.  Would you please respond
with this info. as it is necessary for them to be your covered
dependents and/or beneficiaries.

Thank you,
Becky Elmore
Enron Corp. Benefits
