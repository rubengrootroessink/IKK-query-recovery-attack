Chris, I would get Mark or Louise involved at this point - if it is mission 
critical let me know.

Dave,

A DASH will be circulating later today for approximately $16MM for $10MM of 
progress payments on a 7FA and certain development costs for our Longview 
Project.  Chip Schneider and I have agreed that this approach allows us to 
get to NTP on the project (up until August 20), or determine a higher-valued 
use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for 
some reason.  Given the strength of the PNW market, this project is in the 
money using Enron mid curves for gas and power.  

Mike Miller has appropriately backed away - my team is engaged directly with 
GE on the contract negotiation and a term sheet is expected to be signed 
tomorrow.
I am highly confident that this will result in a 2001 gain of $15MM-$20MM.   

I was planning to talk with Louise about this at our call this morning.  Are 
you or she the appropriate signor for EA?  I will also contact Mark Frevert 
early this afternoon to discuss.   

Regards,

Chris
