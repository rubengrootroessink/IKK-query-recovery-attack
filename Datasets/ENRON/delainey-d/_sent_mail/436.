Dave --

Chris McGill  of AGA  called Margaret Carson and asked her  to speak to the 
gas distribution members of the  AGA  at their monthly meeting on  September  
19th.    If you don't know her, Margaret works under me and provides research 
for Govt Affairs and business units throughout Enron.
 
The  topic of the presentation is --  
What  current  prices for natural gas mean for gas distributors and their 
strategies for asset management?  
Who, if anyone, would you like us to pass this along to?   Give me a call if 
you need more information.

Thanks,

Jim
