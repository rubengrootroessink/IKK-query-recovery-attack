Dave:

Attached is a draft of the responsibility and timing for all the assets in 
the portfolio.  I was in meetings today and was not able to sit down with 
Dick but will do so on Tuesday to move the majority, all except Heartland, 
from '01 to '00.

Expect a revised version no later than Wednesday.



Jeff
