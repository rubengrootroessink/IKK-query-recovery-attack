Guys, I am getting the impression that we are having quality control issues - 
it just sounds sloppy?  Am I wrong?  Do we need more focused resources?

Regards
Delainey

Unit 1 tripped today while running.  There is some kind of foreign object 
loose in the unit.  It is unclear if the foreign object is in the compressor 
section of the hot gas path section.  We will not know the cause or extent of 
damage until the unit is boroscoped tomorrow.  

Units 2 & 3:  Will be back in commercial operation tomorrow.  The team is 
currently working on solutions to the demister.  No solution yet, but Unit 3 
will return to commercial operation tomorrow.

Unit 4:  Emissions tuning continues.  The latest numbers are NOx 6 ppm, CO 50 
ppm.

Unit 5:  To fire tomorrow and begin tuning.

Clay
