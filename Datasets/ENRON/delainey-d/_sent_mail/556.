Dave, I didnt get a chance to talk to you during your meeting but thought I 
should make you aware of the following. Unfortunately, we have experienced a 
bit of a set-back re Ontario market opening. As you know, the market was 
scheduled to open November 1,2000. We had anticipated somewhat of a delay and 
had forecasted a Feb 1, 2001 start. This week the Minister of Energy 
announced that market opening would be delayed "about 6 months". This of 
course is very dissppointing to us and Aleck Dadson is working hard with the 
Ministry and other interested parties in shoring up a date with a tighter 
time frame.

The reason for the delay is primarily due to the lack of readiness on behalf 
of the IMO. This is a frustrating situation for the minister and as such he 
has moved to appoint myself to the IMO Board. It should be noted that the 
Minister did not accept the IMO's board recommendation but unilaterally went 
with me. He was intent on appointing someone who had goal alignment re 
opening this market asap. This goes a long way in illustrating the great job 
our regulatory group (Aleck Dadson) has done/is doing  in 
positioning/developing credibility with the Ministry of Energy.   

I know that you had concerns re time commitment but I believe strongly that 
Enron needs a voice at the IMO Board as this is a critical point in time to 
shape this marketplace.

Regards
Milnthorp
