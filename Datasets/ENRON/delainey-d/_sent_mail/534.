Folks, you are the remaining officers of ENA that have not yet enrolled in 
this mandated training program.  It is ENA's goal to have all its officers 
through the program before the end of calendar year 2000.  The course has 
received very high marks for effectiveness.  Please take time now to enroll 
in the program. Speak to your HR representative if you need help getting 
signed up.

Regards
Delainey
