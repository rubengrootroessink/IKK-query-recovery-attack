Jeff, what exactly do you want Craig going to be doing?  Please forward a job 
scope for Jen and Craig.  Then I will speak with Max if appropriate. I 
apologize but we have spoken about a lot of different scopes - it would be 
helpful to start from a scope on a piece of paper that we both agree upon.  
Just e-mail.  Thanks Jeff.

Regards
Delainey

One thing I forgot to mention is that if we do give Mexico mid market to 
Craig, we need to set up the organization out of Houston, (I think).  Max has 
been interviewing candidates for mid market positions there, and I would like 
those guys to report to Craig.  Is Max with us?  Jeff
