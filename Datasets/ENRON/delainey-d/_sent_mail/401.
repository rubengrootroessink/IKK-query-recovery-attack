Bill, Dave delainey is only recieving mail through 
david.w.delainey@enron.com. I checked in the address book and it appears as 
though he should be able to recieve email from david.delainey@enron.com. This 
is happening fom external accounts. I have checked his settings and 
everything seems to be fine. Could you please take a look at his mail file. 
If he can not recieve email through david.delainey@enron.com, can we make it 
to where he can. Please reply this back to Kay Chapman and myself.

Thanks,
Joe Brewer
