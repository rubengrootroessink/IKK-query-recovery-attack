Jeff, you are killing me - we targeted that group specifically to build the 
risk business in gas and east power in the short run.  This was well planned 
effort.

Dave and John, I spoke to Jeff Shenkman and he has indicated that the 
following new associates are to support him in his role in Global Markets:

Dustin Collins
Vikas Dwivedi
Li Sun

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are 
identified in our system.

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact 
with Jeff regarding these associates supporting him.

Dave, can we discuss this matter?  I can be reached at 713/853-7351.  My 
pager # is 1-800-980-1665.  Thanks.
