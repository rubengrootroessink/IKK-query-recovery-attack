Subject: NSTAR 6-month Transaction


I would like to personally thank and congratulate everyone involved in 
helping ENA bring closure to the NSTAR wholesale power transaction.  Any 
transaction of this nature requires support from many people and I appreciate 
everyone's hard work in making this transaction a reality.  In addition, I 
believe ENA is well positioned for a longer term transaction with NSTAR.   I 
would encourage John Llodra and Jeff Ader to work closely together to create 
the best value proposition for Enron on the long term deal.
Strict Confidentiality language is embedded in the 6-month NSTAR transaction, 
and it is extremely important that everyone involved honors the zero 
tolerance nature of this Confidentiality provision.  The bottom line is that 
we cannot disclose anything about this deal to any third partiies, including 
the mere existence of the deal.   If we do not respect this provision fully, 
we will jeapordize our goodwill with the customer and thus our ability to 
move forward with a longer term transaction.  In addtion, there could be 
negative legal ramnifications.

Thanks again for a job well done.  If I missed anyone who was involved in the 
transaction, please forward this e-mail to those individuals.
