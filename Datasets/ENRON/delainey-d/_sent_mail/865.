Brett, under the assumption that we are not over-paying for the land and that 
the site has option value beyond the Petrobras deal, I am ok with the 
purchase.

Dave:

Some time ago, I had received approval to purchase the primary block of land 
for the Rio project site from Jim.  One year ago, we had acquired the rights 
to purchase the land under an option agreement.  This agreement is about to 
expire and we are currently closing the transaction to purchase the land.  
The total purchase price of the block is $1.7 million.  This closing is to 
take place tomorrow.  Given the changes, I thought I should run this by you 
to make sure you would be in agreement.  I had hoped that this would be a 
moot point with the Petrobras agreement closed.  However, I think we may be a 
couple more days on that.  I am very concerned with waiting on the landowner 
given that our option agreement will be expiring.  Please let me know if it 
is ok to move forward with the land purchase.

Thanks,
Brett
