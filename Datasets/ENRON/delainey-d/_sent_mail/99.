Hey guys. I'm hearing through the grapevine that we now have a new ENA 
Analyst trading program. Allegedly, phone calls are getting ready to go out 
from HR to offer these individuals a spot in the program and possibly a 
different compensation program along with it. Allegedly there are a couple 
"targeted" Analysts within Origination. 

What's up with this? If there is any truth to this we need to discuss. If 
not, please confirm so I can appropriately manage.
