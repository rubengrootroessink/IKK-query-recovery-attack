Janet, what is the status of this turbine - would we be able to turn it back 
in exchange for foregoing on the ld's?  Or do we want this turbine?

Regards
Delainey

You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how 
the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us.

Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF.  
We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within 
two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be 
forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA 
negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is 
signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.

We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, 
and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed 
with or without this specific turbine.  

Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.  
However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a 
bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.

If Delaney has a firm "bird in the hand" he should take the turbine.  
Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want 
to take the turbine.

My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.

Rick
