Dave,

I spoke with Frank Gardner, the acting President of the mine.  The mine has 
shut down due to high power prices and they are evaluating reopening it later 
this year.  John Malowney in our mid-market group has covered these guys very 
well (Frank acknowledged that).  EPMI has served this load in the past and 
made numerous proposals to them during the past year.  Montana rejected 
these, including the attached proposal that offered to fix prices well below 
the current forward market price.  John has also proposed various 
cross-commodity (copper) deals with our MG affiliate.  John will discuss 
their situation with Frank and I will follow up from time to time.  I do not 
think there is an attractive generation opportunity as Montana is net long 
and the industrials' credit is marginal.  We will keep you posted if anything 
materializes. 

Regards,

Chris

Chris, I called MRI but Frank was too busy to take the call so I left my name 
and number and said if nothing else I'd see him on the 5th of October.  Just 
so you'll know, attached is a sample Term Sheet that I have previously showed 
MRI.  Note the prices that were "too high" at the time.    John
