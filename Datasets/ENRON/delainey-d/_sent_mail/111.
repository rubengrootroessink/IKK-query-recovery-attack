Jim, can you send me hard copies - I am having trouble opening these reports.

Any summaries on the RTO filings?

Regards
Delainey

Subject: FERC Staff Report on Eastern Power Markets

Attached is a summary and the original reports from FERC Staff on Power 
Markets (Midwest, Southeast).  

Overall, these are good reports, but we are not sure where FERC will go now 
(especially with the outstanding Presidential election).  I'll keep you 
posted if anything begins to move.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Jim
