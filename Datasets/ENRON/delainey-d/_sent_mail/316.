efforts

Attached is a spreadsheet summarising the current volunteers from our 
operating companies for this coming season of campus recruiting efforts for 
Analysts and Associates. This information comes from the program and I am 
told is accurate as of last week.



In speaking with many of you over the last few months, I believe it is fair 
to say we have agreed that it is critical for the senior management team to 
show their support for the program and be intimately involved in the 
recruiting process for new Analysts and Associates. In particular, many of 
you have remarked that we are generally short of these resources, as well as 
being short of specific skills which we need either in trading, finance, 
origination or assets to grow our businesses.

In this regard, having reviewed the attached I would suggest that those of 
you that have not currently volunteered to join one of the school recruiting 
teams as well as many of our VP's who have not done so, are encouraged to 
step up immediately. In the spirit of cutting to the chase, here is my 
suggested additional participation, which with your support I will forward to 
Charlene's team and ask them to contact and make themselves available for the 
scheduled school presentation:

Under Grad
 Florida  Colwell
Vanderbilt Ader, Beyer
Penn  Beirbach, Pagan 
Michigan Burnett, Bradley
Baylor  Cocavessis
Morehouse Gomez
Uof H  Detmering
MIT  Hermans
Berkeley McDonald
NYU  Kinneman
Minnesota Ducote
Carnegie Miller


Grad Schools
UCLA  Swerzbin
Rice  Muhl, Duran
Darden  Pruett 
Columbia Reck, Sharp
Georgetown Shedd
Harvard Luce, Josey
Michigan Frevert, Parquet
MIT  Tricoli, Milnthorp
Wharton Kitagawa, Malcolm 
Vanderbilt McClellan, Oxley


Let me know if you think any of these are inappropriate. I will update this 
based on any feedback and contact the individuals directly early next week to 
let them know we would appreciate their help in these efforts.

David
