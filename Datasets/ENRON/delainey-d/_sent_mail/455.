Dave --

Update on activity related to California price caps.  Key issue is that we 
continue to believe a new vote will take place on Aug 1.  We continue to try 
and find additional "no" votes.

Thanks,

Jim

Enron will take the initiative and help IEP jump-start the PR effort by the 
end of the week.  I spoke with Smutney this evening.  He likes the idea of 
Enron taking the lead with McNally/Temple.  I've emailed him the one-pager we 
worked up today.--Palmer, Steffes, Dasovich,Parquet
The urgency for a solution is growing and a vaccuum has formed, with many 
trying to fill the void.  The Cal. Manufacturers Ass. has called a meeting 
with IEP and the utilities.  Dave Parquet and Doug Condon will attend.
I spoke with the VP of Strategic Planning at the ISO today who said there is 
a "98% chance" that price caps will be on the agenda at the August ISO Board 
meeting.
Dave Parquet continues to check with SDG&E to determine when SDG&E plans to 
make an announcement about what it intends to do with the offers it received 
last week.
Dave Parquet is working with Andy Kellerman and J. Steffes to try and get the 
investment community energized on this issue.
The issue is now apparently affecting California legislative races.  Staffers 
are drafting a bill that an "at risk" Democrat Senator from San Diego will 
carry, with the hope of using the bill to get the bump necessary to win the 
election.  Mona will meet with the staffer on Thursday to find out what he 
has in mind for the bill and to communicate our views.
Dasovich will meet with Commissioner Bilas Wednesday to see if the Republican 
block of the California PUC is hanging tough.

That's it from our end.

Best,
Jeff
