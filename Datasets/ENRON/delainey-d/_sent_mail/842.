Bill, I think you are confusing me with John Lavorato my COO.  I am a 
University of Saskatchewan grad.  Regardless, if I can help lets discuss in 
the new year.

Dave,

I understand that you are also a former UWO grad (please correct me if this 
is incorrect).

Are you involved in the decisions to recruit or provide sponsorship at Ivey?

The reason I ask is that the LEADER Project at Ivey is in need of a new lead 
sponsor and given the new developments in Ontario and Alberta with dereg, 
this may be a great opportunity to get Enron's name out in the business 
community.

I was very involved with the LEADER Project when I was at Ivey as one of the 
Executive Directors and oversaw general operations as well as the Western 
Region (i.e. Ukraine and Belarus).  While Enron may not have specific 
interests to promote in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, or Kazakstan, LEADER is a 
very large and well respected project within the school and amongst the 
alumni.   I have already made a $250 personal donation to the project and 
would love to see a greater presence of Enron (Houston) on campus.

I know that this is a busy time of year but perhaps you can consider the idea 
and we can discuss its potential in the new year.

Thanks in advance,
