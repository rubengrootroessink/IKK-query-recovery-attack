Northland Power (a power plant operator) from Toronto has joined hand with 
Nepco to build a large cogen plant in BC with possible power off-take 
agreement for US Pacific NW (Washington/Oregon). Northland power asked me if 
Enron would be interested to quote indicative prices for this project. Would 
you please advise me with who is responsible for this kind of projects? 
Thanks for your help.
