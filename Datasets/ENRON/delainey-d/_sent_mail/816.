Dave:

Just prior to the Holidays, I wrote an e-mail to Paul Devries (I copied you) 
that outlined how my experience could help the Toronto office expand 
business. As I indicated in my e-mail, my career interest, and my view of the 
needs of the Toronto office, is for a role that would look more like cash 
trading/services transaction management rather than pure coverage.  Paul and 
I agree that there is not enough happening in the cash trading/services area 
right now to warrant my move to Toronto.  We are hopeful that at some point 
within the next year, this will not be the case and Garrett Tripp will find 
himself too busy to effectively manage what needs to be done.  This probably 
will occur soon after market opening, rather than before.  At that time, I 
could be ready to go quickly.  If market conditions change so that my skills 
are not a real good fit, than we would not make the move.  I am confident I 
can stay abreast of Ontario market issues from Portland to limit any learning 
curve once a move happens.

I think Paul is comfortable with this plan.  He was going to run it by Rob.   
Please let me know if you are OK with this plan as well.

Thanks again for the consideration.

Chris
