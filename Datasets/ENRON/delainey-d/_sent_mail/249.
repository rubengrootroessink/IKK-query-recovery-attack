Rob, no hi or goodbye - you are losing your Canadian politeness :)

On a serious note, you are doing the right thing for the company and for 
Barry's career.  This will be a good opportuntity for him to get to the next 
level if he makes it happen.

As you are aware, I will aggressively support you and the Toronto iniative.  
Let me know.

Regards
Delainey
