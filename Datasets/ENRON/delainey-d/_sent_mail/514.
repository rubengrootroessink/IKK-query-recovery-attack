Dave --

Attached is the memo we discussed regarding the ENA Events (both customer and 
employee) and the Approval Form.  Please review and provide any comments at 
your earliest convenience.  Once you have approved it, I will have it 
delivered to all ENA employees via e-mail as a memo from the Office of the 
Chairman.  

If you have any questions, call me at ext. 3-9053.  Thanks.

Eric
