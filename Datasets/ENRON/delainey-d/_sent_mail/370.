I recently read articles about Enron Corporation in Fortune magazine  and=
=20
Business Week, and was encouraged by your success in building a  flexible a=
nd=20
innovative workforce. I admire this type of approach from a leader  of a=20
large, multi-national company.=20

Based on Enron=01,s initiatives to market and sell wholesale electricity, a=
nd =20
the recent power shortages across various regions of the country, I was =20
motivated to develop a business opportunity utilizing my experience and =20
knowledge of the on-site power generation market. I realized that an=20
unregulated  utility company could take advantage of existing, unused=20
stand-by generator  capacity.

My plan sells the excess capacity of these generators in the spot energy =
=20
market, when the on-site generators are commanded to power customer base=20
loads,  thereby freeing up an equivalent amount of energy. My plan requires=
=20
minimal  capital investment, produces a sales volume of $2.0M, and a net=20
profit of  $400,000.00 in year one. The attached business plan and three-ye=
ar=20
pro forma P  & L statement provide further details.

I strongly believe this idea can and will provide a solid return on =20
investment. My goal is to heighten your interest enough to warrant further =
=20
discussion on the possibility of Enron integrating this business plan into=
=20
its  existing network of marketing, trading and selling electricity.

I chose to market this plan to Enron due to its leadership in the=20
deregulated  electricity market, and its corporate culture of innovation an=
d=20
swift action.  Enron also has the name recognition, resources and national=
=20
presence required to  make this plan successful.

I look forward to hearing from you on the merit of my business plan, and th=
e =20
feasibility of integrating it into your company.

Thank you for your time.
