Congratulations ( I think?) on your new assignment.

If you get a chance in the next few days, drive by this building I have.  It 
is at 5205 Spruce (2 blocks north of Bellaire Blvd and 2 blocks west of Rice) 
in Bellaire.  It  is a great building for what you need for your cars.  It 
will lease for about $12-$15/sf annually (about 5000 sf including the garage 
space) and I have about $750,000 in the building.  If you have 1/3 of the 
building (+-$250,000) it will cost you about $1,600/mo in interest.  This is 
about what it would cost to put your 3 cars in a climate controlled storage 
space (probably less) at a USTOREIT.  Let me know if you're interested in 
looking at a deal structure.

Ken
