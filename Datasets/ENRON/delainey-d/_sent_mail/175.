Tim, that will be fine.  This is a discussion topic that I want your input on 
for next year.

Regards
Delainey

Could you shed some light on this for me?  What are you looking for?  I'm 
afraid I might lose something as it gets translated from you to Wes to Paula 
to me back to Paula to Wes to you.  Perhaps we can discuss while you are here.

Tim,

Dave Delainey is looking for a target customer list, coverage metrics and 
goal and objectives for each of your teams:

 West Power Trading
 West Power Mid-Market/Services
 West Power Fundamentals/Structuring

Obviously his proposed breakout of your teams (noted above) is different from 
the way we planned them.  For expense purposes, do you want me to add Volume 
Management, Real-Time, Pre-Scheduling and Admins to West Power Trading?  

Unfortunately, we have a tight deadline because Delainey is looking for this 
information by the end of the week.  Do you think you can provide this 
information to me by Thursday?  Also, if you could let me know today about 
the expense breakout, I can start working on that now.

Thanks, Paula.
