Jeff, have you finalized how Jenn and Craig will split out the industrial 
segments? They should also come up with their business plans and a reporting 
matrix similar to what you are doing with the desks.  How are you making out 
at the desk level in implementing our previous discussions with Scott and the 
remainder of the desks?

Regards
Delainey

Dave,

I wanted to let you know that I really appreciate you taking the time out of 
your very busy shedule to meet with me.  It means a lot to me that you showed 
the level of interest that you did.  I went over the attached documents with 
Jeff and Fred last Wednesday and thought that I should send you a copy to 
update you on where the industrial middle marketing group stands at mid-year. 
I am wrapping up the business plan and strategy that you asked me to 
prepare.  I would still like to meet with you (as well as whomever else you 
decide) at your convenience to review.  I will check with Kay on your 
availability.  

Best Regards,
Craig
