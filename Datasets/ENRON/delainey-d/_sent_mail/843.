Guys, can you put together the folllowing Portfolio/Charter Review for 
Principal Investing and Energy Capital Resources:
 a) detail existing portfolio - winners/losers; additions/deletions and 
overall performance;
 b) detail market conditions in your markets and any strategy changes 
following;
 c) anticipated major transactions in 2001; and
 d) review charter and detail any proposed changes.

I would anticipate that we sit down with Rick and Jeff at the end of January 
- please have package available for my review by mid January.

Regards
Delainey
