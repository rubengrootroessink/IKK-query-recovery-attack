Dave,

I would like to have a mid-year offsite with my group in late July.  I would 
like to include the associates and west CTG folks since they are a 
significant part of our team and we have a tremendous amount of work to do 
for the balance of the year.  We will keep costs reasonable by going to a 
resort that is driving distance from Portland.  Total cost is estimated at 
$23M.  We will have 1.5 days in conference and .5 days of activity (golf, 
etc.).  My assistant will send details to Kay.  Are you OK with this?

Regards,

Chris
