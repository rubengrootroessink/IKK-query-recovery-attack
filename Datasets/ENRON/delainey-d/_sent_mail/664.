Guys, have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 501FD's at 
Gleason?  Will they be machining the equipment on site - it appears to me 
that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible.  Do we have 
a credible site rep from Westinghouse for both Wheatland and Gleason?  

Please advise.

Thanks
Delainey

Guys, I understand that none of the facilities were available today - I 
thought we were targeting 750 MW.  What is the updated availability schedule 
for each unit?  We are only a couple of weeks from June 1.  Please advise.

Regards
Delainey
