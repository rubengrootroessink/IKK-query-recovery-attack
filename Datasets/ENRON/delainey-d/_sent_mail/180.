Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week.

I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to 
manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal 
or external?) to complement.  I would start thinking about how to get that 
done.  I would call Oxley for help if needed.

Regards
Delainey

Bench strength is limited....  I have no one ( so far ).  Phillip would like 
to keep Steve South in trading.  I am plotting a move from the central 
desk.... 

How did your conversations go with the Denver Office  ?
