I am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.  I just 
think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with 
families.  The drive to Galveston and back - the overnight babysitter - the 
potential trouble that may result in close quarters and hours of drinking et 
al.  I prefer the original idea at Enron Field.
