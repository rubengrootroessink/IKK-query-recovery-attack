It looks like we have agreement on the change below but before we send this 
out can you please review and comment:

In order to streamline all of our commercial credit trading activities 
globally, Jeff Kinneman's Debt Trading team has been merged with 
EnronCredit.com.  All global credit trading and EnronCredit.com activities 
will co-headed by Jeff Kinneman in Houston and Bryan Seyfried in Europe and 
the group will report to John Sherriff - CEO of  Enron Europe.

We wish both Jeff and Bryan well in their expanded roles.
