John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks 
into his central Technical Services group.  These folks would continue to 
work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the 
centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors 
including NEPCO and OEC.  It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican 
business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development 
risk.  Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.

Regards
Delainey
