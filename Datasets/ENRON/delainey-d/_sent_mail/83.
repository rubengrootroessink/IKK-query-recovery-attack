Rob, we are planning to file the following protest of HQ's behaviour in the 
NE power markets through their market based rates case with the FERC, do you 
have any issues with this approach?

Regards
Delainey

Dave -- Kevin has asked that we do a full-blown protest of HQ's continuation 
of market based rates due to market manipulating behavior that Tom May has 
seen.  Due 11/30.  Let us know if we should not proceed with the OASIS 
review, etc. and drafting of protest.  Thanks.
