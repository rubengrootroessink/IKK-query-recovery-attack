Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I 
think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going 
concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses 
that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the 
cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than 
the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often 
clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly 
effectively.

Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of 
time on this.

Regards
Delainey
