Dave,

I have taken the "communicate your ideas to the right person" to heart.  One 
of the main reasons I came to Enron was to help expand it marketing efforts.  
I have taken a few minutes to write my idea, because verbal ideas can get 
lost in the shuffle.  I feel strongly about this opportunity and this notion 
is what attracted me back to the Big E.  I believe all the pieces of this 
idea are present at Enron, but we can maximize our resources.
