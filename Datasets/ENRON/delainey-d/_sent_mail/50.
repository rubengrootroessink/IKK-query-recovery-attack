Dave,

I'd love to get together with Dave to get to know him.

Let me know when I should contact him after you've briefed him.

Shawn, if you are in - I would like you to work with Dave Duran on this 
item.  He currently manages the ENA IPP group and the QF Restructuring Group. 
I would like to manage this under Dave and your leadership.  He has created a 
lot of businesses and value in ENA over the years and can help.

Let me know

Regards
Delainey

Dave:

Thanks for your time and patience today.

For now, I'll park the theoretical and focus on the practical.  (we can pick 
up the other topics later over beers sometime)

I completely agree that the US coal-genco business can offer a huge near-term 
win for those that move swiftly.

Thanks for offering me the shot to capitalize on it.

Shawn
