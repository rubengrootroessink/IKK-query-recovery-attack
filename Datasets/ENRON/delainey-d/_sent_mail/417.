David, I want to enforce this to nth degree given his understanding of our 
industrial offering and that fact he mis-represented his reasons for leaving.

Seems Jim Derrick got a call last night from Chief Legal Counsel at Reliant 
saying that Jim would be joining them to develop something similar to an EES 
business for them and wanted to discuss our no-compete.

I have told Michele that we will want to apply the full force of the 
no-compete which should keep him out of the market thru Feb 3, 2001.

I'll keep you updated.

David
