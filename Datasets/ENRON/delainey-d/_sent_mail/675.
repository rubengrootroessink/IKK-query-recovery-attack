Sounds good - lets see if we can start marketing the product and the 
capability.

Further to Dave's note (below), I indicated to you at the offsite our team 
had screened the No. American names which we felt were appropriate for the 
energy services/outsourcing product (ENA NAIC industry codes, large energy 
spend, multi-sites, consume/produce commodities in which we make a market, 
limited credit capacity, etc).  Naturally, the list includes numerous Mexican 
and Canadian firms which fell out of the screen.  These firms are as follows:

Canada

                                               Penoles

Agrium
Dofasco
Sherritt (Helms Burton Act issue)

As you are undoubtedly more familiar with these firms, you may, or may not, 
think these companies work for the product (we have not tested the 
assumption) but can offer some joint marketing support.  Many of these firms 
have sites accross the continent and it is important to portfolio effect 
their assets to make the transaction work.  We have done  dozens of 
presentations and would propose we put our heads together to determine if 
there is a business opportunity in your market.  

Let me know what you think of the list and which approach makes most sense 
for you.  Jim

PS, via separate e-mail I will forward examples of the presentations we have 
used.

Where is Canada and Mexico on the industrial strategy given our last 
discussion?

Rob, give me a heads up on the Toronto strategy from time to time - I expect 
that we are going to build this out pretty aggressively.  Let me know if you 
are not getting the support you need.  Did you get the Toronto trader?

At the recent "off-site" you requested that I provide a list of the non-pulp 
& paper deals in progress as well as a sense of  the marketing penetration we 
have achieved thus far.  These materials are enclosed for your use.  



Let's discuss after you have had a chance to review.

Jim
