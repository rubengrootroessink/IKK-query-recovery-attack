Don, couple of points:
 a) would take a page to describe the Bridgeline structure (ie) we have done 
this before;
 b) haven't we done more that 150,000 transactions?
 c) we are getting paid a fee for providing the back-office services?

Let me see what you come up with after discussing with Presto et al.

Regards
Delainey
