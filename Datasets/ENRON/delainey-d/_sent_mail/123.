Dan, any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the 
Florida market at this point.

Hey Dick, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I did want to reiterate 
out need for  the GE 7FA's  for our Florida projects. Although I understood 
from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't 
yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We 
are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition 
to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. 
Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to 
execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the 
que position) by then. 

I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with 
earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you 
app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC 
contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has 
significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and 
anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings.

Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two 
projects. Thanks Dick.
