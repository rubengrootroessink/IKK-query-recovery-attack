Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Regards
Delainey
