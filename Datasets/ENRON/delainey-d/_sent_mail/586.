Where did he rank against other folks at the super saturday?

I would argue that if he was in the top 30%, we should accomodate his need.

Subject: ENA Associate Candidate Question

Rich Cassano, an ENA Associate candidate with an outstanding offer, has asked 
if Enron would pay for he and his wife to visit Houston for prior to his 
making a decision to joining Enron. This candidate is from New York and has 
only been to Houston for the Super Saturday weekend. He feels that he can't 
make an informed decision on relocating without spending additional time in 
Houston.

The Associate Program does not cover this expense. Please let me know if you 
are willing to cover travel expenses for this candidate and for other 
candidates with a similar requests.

Cindy
