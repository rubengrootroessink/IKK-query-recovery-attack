Guys, as per our discussion, I am assuming that the upstream group will 
provide gross margin (not including trading) of $30.7M net of the HPL 
compressor writedown of $3.0M.

Wes,

Please clarify -  I think you were a few million off on the Upstream Plan 
#.   Per the weekly earnings estimate my gross margin plan numbers are as 
follows:

    Q2 Plan  
Upstream Origination  $18.423  
HPL (non Texas Trading) $10.746
LRC    $   1.690
    $30.859

Texas Trading   $   7.570 
    
Total Upstream Plan Q2: $38.429
