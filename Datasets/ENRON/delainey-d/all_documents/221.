Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible 
to get this out of either the trading or origination group.  As a significant 
contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room.  
Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely 
linked to specific legislation or policy.  This may not be the answer you 
want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds.

Regards
Delainey

On September 29th I sent you an email regarding requests for personal 
political contributions to Tennessee lawmakers.  If you or any others intend 
to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible.   The 
election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final 
decisions on media spending.  Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying 
firm in Nashville.

The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law 
prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action 
committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. 
supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office 
materials, etc...).  Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a 
stringent campaign finance law. 

The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up 
to the business units with interests in Tennessee. 

If you need further information or would like to discuss this, you can reach 
me at 614-760-7472 or 614-306-4359 (cell).

Barbara, we are getting tremendous pressure for contributions in these last 
days before the election.  As I have mentioned to you, Enron has been 
referred to specifically by one of the most powerful Senators.  Also, Lt. 
Gov. Wilder's campaign chairman called me in the latter part of last week, 
hoping for significant financial help for end-of-campaign TV buys.  Gif 
Thornton, Robert Gowan, and I are participating heavily; I cannot 
overemphasize the importance of Enron's participation.  The state "money 
crunch" which existed this past year likely will be worse when the General 
Assembly reconvenes (tax collections are coming in below estimates), and all 
existing tax exemptions will be at significant risk.  Please do what you can 
to get some Enron assistance for the candidates which we have discussed now.  
Thanks.  Bill
