Hi, Bianca!

Francisco Pinto Leite has asked me to give him a list of all outstanding 
ISDAs and Deemed ISDAs with Mexican counterparties.  Can you send me a list 
of the Deemed ISDAs that are still outstanding (either comments received or 
counterparty has not returned signed copy).

Thanks!

Marie
