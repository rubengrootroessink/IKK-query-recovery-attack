Sara and Marie,

Can you fax the ENA agreement to Bob Georgio, head of Customer Accounts, 212-325-1987, Fax 917-326-8030?
I told him we got the ECT Investments back but have not seen the ENA since 7/6/01, when sent to CSFB, and have not gotten a response from CSFB on inqueries.

He wants to take a look at it.  The other contact I got was Marcel McNeal, 212-538-4415, Prime Broker accounts but we will try Bob Georgio first.

Sheila
