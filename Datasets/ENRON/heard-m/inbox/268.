Frank and Marie,

I have received and reviewed Enron's faxed Authorizations for the ISDA
Master Agreement between Amerada Hess Corporation and Enron North America
Corp. and they are acceptable.  I look forward to receiving the original
Authorizations shortly.

I am also in receipt of the original ISDA Master Agreement, partially
executed by Enron.  I am in the process of attaching Amerada Hess
Corporation's signature. As soon as the original Agreement is fully
executed, I will overnight you a fully executed original ISDA Master
Agreement.

Thank you for your cooperation throughout the entire drafting process.
