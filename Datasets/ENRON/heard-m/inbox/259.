Leslie, please ensure that these entities' and the affiliates' of these entities (which will be provided to you by Marie Heard when she receives the names from Credit) receivables are deleted from the list of receivables to be transferred into Swee'P in connection with the "Swee'P Gas Receivables Facility.  Please advise as to the next date when this can be done....also if these entities' receivables are not currently on the most recent "receivables Transfer list", please advise me of that with a copy to the other recipients of this communication.  If you have any questions, please call.....36832.
