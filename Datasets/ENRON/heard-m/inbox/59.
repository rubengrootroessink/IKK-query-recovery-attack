Sandy,

Can you check with Robbi or Marie and compare this to an older version of our standard MSA.  It looks identical to what we used to use prior to Cynthia coming up with the U.S./Europe version.  It incoporates the concepts of contract value and replacement value.

Thanks,

JANE, attached please find the redlined comparison you requested of the Kevin Paley document (CW MSA V4.5(2).doc) compared to the standard MSA.  Hope this comparison is helpful and shows you all the changes made.

Call me please at Ext. 53879 if you need me to do anything else to assist you in comparing the documents.

Thanks,
Sandy (Ext. 53879)

Can we get this marked against our standard?  It looks like our old version.
 
Thanks,
 
Jane

All,
 
Doesn't look like he's too interested in our Master.  Can we take another look at theirs to see if they made any changes at all that we wanted?  I haven't yet had a chance to take a look at it.
 
Thanks, Jay.

Jay, 

Attached is our Final Version of our MSA.  We have looked at your new one, 
but have decided that it will take us too much time to adjust for it.  We 
have approved your guarantee.  I hope you choose to go forward with this 
MSA.
