Jay, when you get a second could you please give me a call about Western Resources.  I talked to their attorney and he said that we have a power master and an ISDA master with them and are currently trying to finalize a Coal Master.  He is anxious to get a MNA in place asap.  Thanks, Anne

Jay:

Kevin Freeman (785/575-8128) at Western Resources left me a voice mail stating that they want to finalize the master netting agreement ASAP.  Mary Cook is assigning this to Anne Koehler to work on.  Will you send me a list of counterparties involved and agreements you show are in place?

Thanks!

Marie
