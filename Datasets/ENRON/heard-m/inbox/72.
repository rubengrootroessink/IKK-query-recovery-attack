Enclosed is a worksheet for Kerr-McGee Energy Services Corporation.  This worksheet reflects terms to be amended to the current ISDA with the customer.  The credit terms for Enron will remain exactly the same.  Please forward our drafted amendment to M.E. Booker at Kerr-McGee with a copy to me.  

Thanks,

Max
