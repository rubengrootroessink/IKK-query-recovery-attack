Marie,
	To recap our conversation, all Morgan needs to move Convertible book from ENA to ECT Investments is the Dupe Doc Letter document (attached) and the Assignment and Assumption letter.  The Journalletter2001 doc is not needed.  The Assignment and Assuption letter can be used instead.

Thanks,
Theresa

Joe:

Attached is the dupe letter and journal letter for the Enron accounts.
If they need help filling out the journal letter, I can prepare one
otherwise, they can do themselves.
