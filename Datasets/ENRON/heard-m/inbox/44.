Marie - 
I am an attorney with Troutman Sanders LLP in Washington, DC; in conjunction with Michael Sweeney (TS-DC) and John Varholy (TS-London) I am assisting Tom Spencer and Cathy Barron at AES Eastern in reviewing applicable ISDA documentation they are currently negotiating with Enron.  Attached for your review, please find AES Eastern's mark-up of the ISDA master schedule and ISDA CSA paragraph 13 as originally proposed by Enron.  If you have any questions or concerns, please direct those to Tom Spencer.
Best Regards, 
Eric
