Good Afternoon,
	Enclosed is a worksheet for BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, LP.  This document should be the same as BP Capital Energy Fund LP and BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, LP, which are industrial masters.  Please forward executable documents to Mike Larson at BP Capital.  
	Stephanie is currently putting together an omnibus confirm for existing trades done last week, but these will roll up to the master once it is executed.  Give me a call with any questions.  

Thanks,
Max
