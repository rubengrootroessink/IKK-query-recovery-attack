We need everything, although I would have thought the ISDAs, confirmations and guarantees were everything.  Send it all, overnight, to Liisa, Transaction Support Department, at Enron House in London.

Thanks,

Mary Cook has asked me to try to locate the documentation for the two prepays.  Which of the documents do you specifically need--all or just the ISDAs, swap confirmations and guarantees.  If you only need the ISDAs, etc., it may be quite a lot of pages to fax.  Would you prefer I overnight them and, if so, where should I send them?

Thanks!

Marie
