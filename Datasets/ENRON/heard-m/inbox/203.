a few notes:  can we indicate that Reliant and Dynegy are executed. As is the Conagra master crude.Carolina Power & Light is really Progress Energy (netting among the subs of Progress Energy - CP&L, Florida Power Corp, and North Carolina Natural Gas).  Can we note that Southern is not an MNA but just power netting per Leslie's e-mail. Thanks!!
