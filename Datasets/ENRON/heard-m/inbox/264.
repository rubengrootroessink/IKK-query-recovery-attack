Hi, Una:

Can you send me some other copies?  I need a representative copy of a confirmation for the following:

Financial trading with ECTRIC and Louis Dreyfus Energy Services L.P.
Financial trading with ECTRIC and Louis Dreyfus Corporation

If you will fax them to (713) 646-3490 I would certainly appreciate it.

Thanks!

Marie
