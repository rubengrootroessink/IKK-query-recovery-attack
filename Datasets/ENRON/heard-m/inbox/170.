Make it a good one!

>THE UNITED STATES ONE DOLLAR BILL
>
>
>Take out a one dollar bill, and look at it. The one dollar bill
>you're looking at first came off the presses in 1957 in its present
>design.
>This so-called paper money is in fact a cotton and linen blend, with red
>and blue minute silk fibers running through it.  It is actually material.
>
>We've all washed it without it falling apart. A special blend of ink is
>used, the contents we will never know. It is overprinted with symbols and
>
>then it is starched to make it water resistant and pressed to give it
>that
>nice crisp look.
>
>If you look on the front of the bill, you will see the United States
>Treasury Seal. On the top you will see the scales for a balanced budget.
>In
>the center you have a carpenter's square, a tool used for an even cut.
>Underneath is the Key to the United States Treasury. That's all pretty
>easy
>to figure out, but what is on the back of that dollar bill is something
>we
>should all know.
>
>If you turn the bill over, you will see two circles. Both circles,
>together, comprise the Great Seal of the United States.  The First
>Continental Congress requested that Benjamin Franklin and a group of men
>come up with a Seal. It took them four years to accomplish this task and
>another two years to get it approved.
>
>If you look at the left-hand circle, you will see a Pyramid. Notice the
>face is lighted, and the western side is dark.  This country was just
>beginning. We had not begun to explore the West or decided what we could
>do
>for Western Civilization.  The Pyramid is uncapped, again signifying that
>
>we were not even close to being finished.  Inside the capstone you have
>the
>all-seeing eye, an ancient symbol for divinity.  It was Franklin's belief
>
>that one man couldn't do it alone, but a group of men, with the help of
>God, could do anything.
>
>"IN GOD WE TRUST" is on this currency. The Latin above the pyramid,
>ANNUIT
>COEPTIS, means, "God has favored our undertaking."  The Latin below the
>pyramid, NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, means, "a new order has begun." At the base
>
>of the pyramid is the Roman Numeral for 1776.
>
>If you look at the right-hand circle, and check it carefully, you will
>learn that it is on every National Cemetery in the United States.  It is
>also on the Parade of Flags Walkway at the Bushnell, Florida National
>Cemetery, and is the centerpiece of most hero's monuments.  Slightly
>modified, it is the seal of the President of the United States, and it is
>
>always visible whenever he speaks, yet very few people know what the
>symbols mean.
>
>The Bald Eagle was selected as a symbol for victory for two reasons:
>First,
>he is not afraid of a storm; he is strong, and he is smart enough to soar
>
>above it.  Secondly, he wears no material crown.  We had just broken from
>
>the King of England.  Also, notice the shield is unsupported.  This
>country
>can now stand on its own.  At the top of that shield you have a white bar
>
>signifying congress, a unifying factor.  We were coming together as one
>nation.  In the Eagle's beak you will read, "E PLURIBUS UNUM", meaning,
>"one nation from many people".
>
>Above the Eagle, you have thirteen stars, representing the thirteen
>original colonies, and any clouds of misunderstanding rolling away.
>Again,
>we were coming together as one. Notice what the Eagle holds in his
>talons.
>He holds an olive branch and arrows. This country wants peace, but we
>will
>never be afraid to fight to preserve peace. The Eagle always wants to
>face
>the olive branch, but in time of war, his gaze turns toward the arrows.
>
>It is said that the number 13 is an unlucky number. This is almost a
>worldwide belief. You will usually never see a room numbered 13, or any
>hotels or motels with a 13th floor.
>But think about this:
>13 original colonies,
>13 signers of the Declaration of Independence,
>13 stripes on our flag,
>13 steps on the Pyramid,
>13 letters in the Latin above,
>13 letters in "E Pluribus Unum",
>13 stars above the Eagle,
>13 bars on that shield,
>13 leaves on the olive branch,
>13 fruits, and if you look closely,
>13 arrows. And, for minorities: the 13th Amendment.
>
>I always ask people, "Why don't you know this?"  Your children don't know
>
>this, and their history teachers don't know this.  Too many veterans have
>
>given up too much to ever let the meaning fade.  Many veterans remember
>coming home to an America that didn't care. Too many veterans never came
>home at all.
>
>Share this page with everyone, so they can learn what is on the back of
>the
>UNITED STATES ONE DOLLAR BILL, and what it stands for... Otherwise, they
>will probably never know...
