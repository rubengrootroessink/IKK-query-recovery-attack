Spoke with Jeff Gollomp who is trying to obtain internal approval for financial trading with one of the operating utilities (as opposed to using the agent).  He anticipates a corporate restructuring which may delay matters. He understands our allocation concerns.  He inquired about AEP as a comparable type of counterparty but we did not attempt to discuss (and were not at liberty to discuss).  Jeff asked that I wait to hear from him.  By copy of this entry, I am advising Ed Sacks of the status.
