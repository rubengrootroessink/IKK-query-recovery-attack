Marie,
	Per my contact at Morgan, It looks as though they cannot give me the new account #'s for Convertible until movement of Convertible from ENA to ECT Investments is complete.  I've reviewed the original Assignment and Assumption Agreement moving Convertible to ENA and it does not reference the new accounts in the agreement.  It does mention the old accounts (the assignor).  

Thanks,
Theresa

Hi, You would not be able to use the old account # for the Convertible acct.  I cannot retrieve a new acct # until the movement of the Convert book back under ECT is complete.
Thx,
Joe
