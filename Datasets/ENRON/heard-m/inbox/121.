Here is what I sent in August.  I am not sure what happened at the Board meeting, but Rex would probably know.  What normally happens is that he and JVD approve the final form after the meeting to make sure the resolutions conform to what the Board did or wanted.

Whether or not any resolutions should be given to Goldman is another matter: just because they want them would not be enough--there has to be a good reason to give them any final version.  

If you have any further questions, please let me know.

[Armogida, Jim]  attached is a redraft of the proposed resolutions which makes some cosmetic changes and updates somewhat the older form of these types of resolutions to make them more readable.  A marked copy showing revisions is also attached.  

I am sure these are in final form, but if in rearranging the resolutions I forgot something or left something out, please let me know.   Thanks.
