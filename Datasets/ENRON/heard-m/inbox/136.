We have been working on ISDA's with you for several of our subsidiaries
(Georgia Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Gulf Power Company and
Savannah Electric and Power Company).  Up to this point, we have wanted to
execute an ISDA for each of these companies.  Due to the way in which we
operate our generation assets as a single system, we have decided that we
need to change the way in which we enter these ISDA's.  We would like to
execute a single ISDA with you that includes six of our subsidiaries.  This
is how we have entered some of our physical trading contracts.  In this
arrangement, the counterparty on Southern's side would be listed as,

"Southern Company Services, Inc. as agent for Alabama Power Company, Georgia
Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Savannah
Electric and Power Company, and Southern Power Company"

By using this approach, we have more flexibility in entering trades and it
provides even stronger credit protection for you since all six of these
companies are on the hook.  Probably the best way to proceed is for you to
forward your comments back to me from the last draft I sent to you.  I will
then make the changes to reflect this approach described above and send back
to you.  I look forward to receiving your comments back.  Please give me a
call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Todd A. Perkins
