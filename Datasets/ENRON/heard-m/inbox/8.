Dear Ms. Heard,

	On behalf of my colleague Michael Mask, I attach a draft ISDA
Schedule and a draft Credit Support Annex for your review.  The terms are
subject to CSFB's review of the draft Enron Guarantee that I believe Lissa
Rosenthal has discussed with you.  Please forward this Guarantee, along with
any comments you may have to the attached, to Michael (212-538-2313) or me.
(Although Michael is negotiating this transaction, he will be out of the
office for the next week and I will be the contact in the interim.)

Thank you,

Reid Gray
212-538-2327
