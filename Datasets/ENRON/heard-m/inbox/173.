Hi - forgot to check with you in the last email - could you send your home
email address to us, it did not get transfered to this email address and we
can't seem to find it anywhere - thanks  PS if you just got an email that
was blank, disregard it, I must have checked "Send" by mistake.  bye for
now, thanks, Maureen
