Yes - and Mary Nell asked to come back to Houston and was told no (according to my source).  Things are very bleak!  Carol and Lance are on some emergency project.  Lance worked all night.  I think we are in big trouble!  Do you hear any scoop?

Well, I guess that's why they get to have such nice, pretty stores.  What's Eric doing up here meeting with the attorneys?  Also, Jane said that Mary Nell and Peter were given packages?  Is this true?

Kravet will COD me and Schumacher will be charged to my credit card.  Once I place the orders I'll know the exact amount, including freight.  So I'll let you know.

Isn't it a big scam that these stores have!  The mark up is always between 40 and 50%, depending on the manufacturer.

Yes, please.  Also, please add taxes.  We certainly don't want to do anything that will mess his records up since you all are so kind to do this.  Do you want us to pay in advance?  That won't be a problem either.

Thanks!

Marie

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!
