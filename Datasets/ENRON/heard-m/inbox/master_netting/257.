Marie, attached is the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Encal dated August 1, 1996:

 
I will fax the signed execution page to you, together with the Interruptible Gas P/S Agreement dated November 20, 1997.  I will also be faxing to you the Assignment and Novation Agreements respecting both agreements in favour of Calpine Canada Resources Ltd.

Stephanie Panus should have a copy of the ISDA Master Agreement with this counterparty.  We have requested from Calpine an Assignment and Novation Agreement respecting the ISDA, but we have not received same.
