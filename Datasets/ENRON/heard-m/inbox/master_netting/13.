11/1/94 - Enron Marketing Services, Inc. changed its name to Engas, Inc. and it was dissolved 6/25/97.

Enron Oil Trading & Transportation Company is a former name of EOTT Energy Corp., a Delaware entity that merged 3/24/94 out of existence.  Chain of events rather complex:

3/24/94 - 8:00 a.m.  Merger of EOTT Energy Corp. (Del. inc.) with and into EOTT Energy Texas, Inc.  Name change of EOTT Energy Texas, Inc. to EOTT Energy Corp.

3/24/94 - 5:10 p.m.  Merger of EOTT Energy Corp. (Tex. inc.) into JMRM Energy Corp. (Del.inc.).
