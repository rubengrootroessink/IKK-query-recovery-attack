I have been assigned FPL Energy Trading.  I drafted a MNA and sent it ot Jay Williams on Wednesday, October 31, 2001.  I have called several time for an FPL Energy contact and have been told that no further action will be necessary until a Netting Agreement (not an MNA) is finalized with FPL Energy's utility affiliate: Florida Power and Light. Jeff Hodge is working with Jay on that matter; thus, I am at this time awaiting instructions from Jay Williams.
