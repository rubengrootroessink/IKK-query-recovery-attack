Here is the breakdown of where doing business, etc.		

Engage Energy America, LLC
	financial business with ENA under an ISDA
	physical power business with EPMI under master
	physical gas business with ENA - no master

Engage Energy Canada LP
	financial business with ECC under ISDA
	physical business with ECC under Master Firm
	physical business with ENA - no master

Gtys
	bilateral 100MM gty executed just recently (Mary Cook worked on)

Credit Terms to come

Should we try to submit Master Firms for above "no master" trading at the same time????

Thanks,
Tanya
