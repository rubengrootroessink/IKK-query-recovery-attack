Hi Marie -- I had come around to touch base with you on this but had missed you.  When this revised template is available, will you be able to help by installing the references to the various master contracts between Enron afilarttes and AEP which would be referenced?  Ed Sacks is our credit contact.  I will touch base with you on this -- I am hoping to get copies of those underlying masters also (I already have the wholesale power masters, and can provide you a copy of each, if you need them). Thanks. --David

I am currently working on a form for the master netting without the CSA.  It is somewhat complicated--so if you have such a request, please await the new form.  Do not try to do it yourself.  Thank you.

Cordially,
