I will review your  comments.  Do you have a list of the entities/agreements that need to be  covered?  I should be getting our list this morning and I wanted to  compare notes with you.

Andy - in  between watching this amazing Game 7 of the Series, have  finished
off my review of the Collateral Annex.  Carol  deserves all the credit in the
world - great job on this  document.  My comments are minimal and a lot of
them rest  with decisions that need to be made by the credit  department.
Look forward to talking to you in the  am.
