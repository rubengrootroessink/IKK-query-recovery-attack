Marie,

FYI.  Yesterday we received a netting agreement from Valero and delivered it to Jay Wiliams for further handling.  Please add the list of negotiations and assign it to John Viverito.

Thanks.
Nony

Jay,

We received a fax copy of a Net Settlement Agreement for crude products (ERAC) from Valero.  We're delivering a copy to you this afternoon for further handling.  Please let us know if we can help in any way.

Regards,

Nony Flores
