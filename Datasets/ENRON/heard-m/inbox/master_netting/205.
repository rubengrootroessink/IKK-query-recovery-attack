Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see
attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced
AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to
masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading
affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the
AEP Operating Companies ("AEP") and AEP Energy Services, Inc.
("AEPESI").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling
agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas,
physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit
group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical
synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  Please
contact me with any questions. -- David
