Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the AEP Operating Companies ("AEP") and AEP Energy Services, Inc. ("AEPESI").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas, physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.
