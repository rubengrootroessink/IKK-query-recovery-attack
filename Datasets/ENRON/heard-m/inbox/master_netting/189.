Randy:
I will review your comments.  Do you have a list of the entities/agreements that need to be covered?  I should be getting our list this morning and I wanted to compare notes with you.

Andy - in between watching this amazing Game 7 of the Series, have finished
off my review of the Collateral Annex.  Carol deserves all the credit in the
world - great job on this document.  My comments are minimal and a lot of
them rest with decisions that need to be made by the credit department.
Look forward to talking to you in the am.
