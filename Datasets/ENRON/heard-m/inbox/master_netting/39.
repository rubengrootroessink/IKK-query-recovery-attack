Jason -- Please note that (1) there is a 1/1/98 GISB in effect between AEP =
Services, Inc and ENA following assignment of such GISB by Columbia Energy =
Marketing to ENA under a Nov. 22, 1999 Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Such G=
ISB is referenced in the current draft Netting Agreement currently under AE=
P's review.  (2) The wholesale power trading masters identified and referen=
ced in the current draft Netting Agreement are a Power Sales Agreement date=
d as of September 29, 1997  providing for sales of wholesale electric power=
 by EPMI to AEP, and a Service Agreement dated as of March 30, 1998 under t=
he AEP Companies' Wholesale Market Tariff, providing for sales of wholesale=
 electric power by AEP to EPMI.  (3) You indicated below that ENA trades (u=
sing GTCs) physical coal and physical synfuel with American Electric Power =
Service Corporation.  These relationships would be pulled in by the Master =
Netting Agreement's catch-all Recital defining "Other Agreements"  unless C=
redit determines with AEP that these trading relationships are to be exclud=
ed, and language is added to that effect. -  David  =20
