I have asked Jay last week and today to find out who has the credit contact at El Paso so we can put pressure on them to look at the draft document.  I have forwarded to Jay my spreadsheet outlining the various contracts and GTC's that may be included in the Master Netting Agreement at his request.  In the meantime I am working on a second draft to more accurately describe the contracts and include the recent updates to the documents.  We will need to amend many of the contracts and GTC's as well to specifically modify the "one way", "automatic early termination" and "cherrypicking" provisions.
