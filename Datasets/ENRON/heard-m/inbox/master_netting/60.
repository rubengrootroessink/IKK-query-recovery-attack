Nidia, 
Attached is net settlement agreement I sent to Frank in March.  Please let me know if OK to get executed, or if you have any comments.  I understand we are exchanging 2200 BPD in November.  We can make effective date November 1.
Thanks.

Frank, 
Back in March, I believe you requested that we get a net settlement agreement in place.  I sent you a draft copy.  To date, I have not received a reply.  We would appreciate you review and get back to me if OK to have executed.  I understand we are exchanging 1100 BPD.
Thanks for your assistance. 
Scott
