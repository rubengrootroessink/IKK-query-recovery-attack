Andrew:
Ed will be calling to you on this.  Given Enron's situation, we are only focusing on Master Netting Agreements that our counterparties are requiring from us in order to trade with us.  I thought that this was one, but according to Ed, it is not.

Andrew:
Who are the "commercial guys"?  Also, our position generally is that we do not include EES contracts in Master Netting Agreements.  		


Ed and Tanya:
How do you want to handle this?

Carol,

Andrew wanted you to know that his commercial guys want to respond to Constellation's comments on the Master Netting Agreement -- TODAY.

I have mentioned this to Ed Sacks as well.

Andy - very few changes to the Master Netting Agreement - I don't have
Carol's email address, can you forward this to her??  I am reviewing
Collateral Annex next and I will call her in the am to discuss further.  I
have highlighted the Security Interest section to discuss further.  My
commercial folks are currently reviewing a revised 2.3 which I should have
to you by 11 am tomorrow if all goes well.
