Carol, do I need to be doing anything from ECC's perspective on any of this?  Peter asked me to deal with this stuff while he is out of the office for a few days, but I understand I am simply, when required, confirming underlying agreements regarding ECC and providing copies of such agreements where requested.

Thanks
Greg
