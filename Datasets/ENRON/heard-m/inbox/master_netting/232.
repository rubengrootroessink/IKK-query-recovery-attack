We are organizing the data regarding debtor names, jurisdictions of
incorporation, etc., for the various Master Netting Agreements that we have
received over the past few days.

I note that some, but not all, jurisdictions require inclusion of the
debtor's "organizational identification number" on the UCC filing.  We
should be able to obtain this number, where necessary, in most cases
through an on-line search.  If not, we can either ask you to track it down
(or give us a contact person in this regard) or, for a cost of $12 per
debtor, obtain the information from a search firm.

In any event, we will be back to you in a day or two with an update and,
perhaps, requests for additional information.  Once we have all requisite
information, the filings can be made in another day or two.  In the
meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you.
