Carol and Marie:

Attached for your review is the North American Master Netting Agreement with
the revisions we discussed this morning.

Please note I made one additional change in Section 8.

If Enron agrees this is the final form, please call me to confirm this is in
final form for signature purposes.

Very truly yours,

BILLY
