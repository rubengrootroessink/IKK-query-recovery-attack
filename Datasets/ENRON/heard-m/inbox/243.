Can you please send this to the MN Group?


Master Netting Group:

I just want to personally thank all of you for all of your hard work the past few weeks in addressing our counterparties' requests for Master Netting Agreements.  We have been able to sign up a number of them as a result of your efforts and have managed to keep certain counterparties from cutting us off in trading.  	Thanks again for your efforts and for putting up with one fore drill after another!  Hopefully we all learned alot in the process.
