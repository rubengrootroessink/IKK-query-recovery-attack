Ed:

This is a follow up to our conversation we had on Monday regarding the cross
commodity, cross affiliate netting agreement. 
As of today, Thursday Nov. 15, we have not received anything.  In order to
expedite things, I think it would be helpful for our legal councils to
directly contact each other regarding this matter. Therefore, I am sending
you the phone number and email address of my legal council (Name: Thomasine
Pantazis; Phone Number (713) 350-1663; email - tpantazis@tractebelusa.com)
I would appreciate it if you could provide the same information on Ms.
Sager.  Thanks,

Lora
