Dear Marie,

I note from your email of 27 August that you were going to get back to
us with your further comments once Sara Shackelton returned from
vacation in September.

I wonder if you have now had a chance to discuss this issue with Sara
and if you have any feed back for me.

Thanks very much for your ongoing assistance in this matter.

Kind regards
Katryna
