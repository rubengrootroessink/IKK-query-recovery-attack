Subject:	Meeting regarding Master Netting Agreements

Mary Cook has requested that you attend a meeting tomorrow morning (Tuesday, October 30) from 10:00 to 11:00 in EB38C2  to discuss master netting agreements.  The directive Mary has presently been given is that we will be preparing various master netting agreements and she would like to solicit as much additional help as she can.  If the directive changes before the meeting tomorrow, we will advise everyone.

Please review the below attachments prior to the meeting if your schedule allows.

Thanks!

Marie
