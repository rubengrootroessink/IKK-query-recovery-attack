I'm working on a netting agreement with Southern Company Services, agent for the Southern Companies.  However, it is not a master netting agreement.  It's merely a closeout set-off and payment netting agreement to cover physical power transactions alone.  I've discussed the matter with Ed Sacks in credit, and we're treating this one as a straight power contract negotiation, not as a master netting agreement.  

Please let me know if you still want daily updates regarding the status.  Otherwise, I won't bore you!
