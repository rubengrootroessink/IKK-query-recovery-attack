I also noticed on Inland Paperboard and Packaging, Inc./ENA, CP #66189, we are still waiting for the executed agreement since July 10th.  Is it normal for a company to take this long to return the executed agreement?  We have set up a global contract number (96063822) to allow them to do on-line trading.
