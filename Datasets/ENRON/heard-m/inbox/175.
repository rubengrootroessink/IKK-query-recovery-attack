Justin & Paul,

We are seeking your sign-off and assistance in connection with a swap termi=
nation transaction that is part of an equity sale transaction that is prese=
ntly set to close this Thursday.  The good news is that the documentation h=
as been substantially negotiated by a number of internal and external lawye=
rs (in connection with the equity sale deal) and the swap termination deal =
terms have been discussed and blessed by Gary Hickerson's team in Houston.

The background and basics of the deal are as follows:

In March 1999 Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. ("ECTRI")=
 entered into a long-term interest rate swap with Greenfield Shipping Compa=
ny Limited ("GSCL") in connection with GSCL's project financing of a 135,00=
0 cbm LNG tanker.  The swap was documented by way of an ISDA Master Agreeme=
nt (Multicurrency--Cross Border) and related Confirmation (Deal No. M148198=
), both dated 18 March 1999 (the "Swap Transaction"), and ECTRI's obligatio=
ns under the swap were guaranteed by Enron Corp.  Enron, through its wholly=
-owned subsidiary Atlantic Commercial Finance Inc. ("ACFI"), owns a 20% int=
erest in Greenfield Holding Company Limited ("GHCL"), which in turn owns GS=
CL.  The LNG tanker was intended to be fully-employed in the transportation=
 of LNG to Enron's Dabhol, India facilities.

Due to an alleged default in GSCL's financing caused by the Dabhol project =
situation, GSCL's lenders' threats to accelerate the loan and foreclose upo=
n the vessel, and Enron's lack of desire to maintain an equity interest in =
the vessel, Enron (ACFI) now desires to sell its interest in GHCL to Mitsui=
 OSK Lines Ltd. ("MOL") [for US$5 million] and have the Swap Transaction te=
rminated and the Enron Corp. Guarantee released.  ACFI and MOL entered into=
 a conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement on  23 October 2001 which provid=
es for the described equity sale, swap termination and guarantee release.  =
An electronic copy of the signed Sale & Purchase Agreement is attached for =
your reference. =20

The key terms of the deal that relate to the Swap Transaction are as follow=
s: (a) the Swap Transaction is to be terminated (and GSCL's Banks are to pr=
ovide their consent thereto) on 15/11/01; (b) the assumed swap termination =
cost at 23/10/01 was US$20 million which was used as a basis for the Loan N=
ote calculation; (c) ECTRI is to receive US$4 million out of the sale proce=
eds as a down payment against the agreed swap breakage cost, with GSCL exec=
uting a Loan Note in favor of ECTRI for 80% of the balance of the agreed sw=
ap breakage cost (note that ECTRI has 20% of the upside/downside exposure i=
n the event the actual breakage cost varies from US$20 million [US$1 millio=
n for every US$5 million in actual break cost movement]), (d) the Loan Note=
 is to be guaranteed by MOL (Enron Houston Credit Dept. has signed off on M=
OL as an acceptable credit risk) and is to be fully repaid on the earlier t=
o occur of vessel refinancing or 30 April 2002; and (e) Enron Corp. is to b=
e released from its Guarantee obligations in respect of the original Swap T=
ransaction.  The swap is scheduled to be terminated at 9:30 am New York tim=
e on Thursday, Nov. 15.  The amount of the total breagage cost, as well as =
the Loan Note amount may then be calculated and inserted into documents (1)=
 and (2) referenced below.=20

John LaMaster and Mathew Kidwell of Vinson & Elkins represented ACFI, Ian A=
ndrews and Sabien Vermeulen of Linklaters represented GHCL/GSCL in connecti=
on with financing issues and Dan Bradshaw of Johnson, Stokes & Master (Hong=
 Kong) represented MOL.  GSCL's lenders are represented by a team led by Ha=
rry Theochari of Norton Rose.  Peter Anderson, Jordan Mintz and I worked on=
 the equity sale and swap break transaction and have cleared the terms of t=
he swap break transaction with Gary Hickerson and his team in Houston.  Jim=
 Hughes has also signed off on the terms of the equity sale and has agreed =
with Gary Hickerson as to how to internally handle any termination proceeds=
 shortfall.

I attach electronic copies of the following documents, for which we seek yo=
ur sign-off in connection with the equity sale transaction that is presentl=
y set for closing on this Thursday:

1.=09Swap Termination Letter Agreement between ECTRI and GSCL;
2.=09Loan Note 2002 made by GSCL in favor of ECTRI;
3.=09Deed of Guarantee made by MOL in favor of ECTRI;=20
4.=09Deed of Release made by GSCL in favor of Enron Corp.; and
5.=09Certificate of Assistant Secretary of ECTRI [required by GSCL's lender=
s].

Your assistance in signing-off on these documents, as well as helping to ob=
tain any necessary signatures of personnel based in London (I'm assuming th=
at  ECTRI's agent, Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited, must sign in Lon=
don) would be most appreciated.  Of course, I'm happy to respond to any que=
stions or comments you may have, but I'll be in transit to Tokyo for the cl=
osing on Tuesday.  Any of the listed lawyers at V&E and Linklaters would al=
so be happy to respond in my absence.  Sarah Bruck and Peter Anderson are c=
oordinating Enron's efforts from Houston and may also be reached in the eve=
nt you have any questions or need anything further.  Many thanks in advance=
 for the assistance and apologies for the short notice (until today we were=
 incorrectly assuming that this could be coordinated from Houston).
