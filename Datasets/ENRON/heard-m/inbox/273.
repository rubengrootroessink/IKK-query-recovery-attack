Hello Marie -

Yes, I got both of your e-mails.  Thanks very much.  I will call Eric again
and tell him to trace those documents because neither of us has them.  I
really don't know what the problem is, because he used to be so prompt and
efficient.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime I will send the other
documents to you today or at the latest tomorrow.

I am so sorry about what is happening with Enron.  Yes, it is a total shock
- and we are thinking, if it can happen to Enron, it can happen to any
company.  I will keep my fingers crossed for you - in hopes that your
services will be retained.  I cannot imagine what it will be like to have so
many ex Enron employees (and possibly some ex Dynegy employees) flood the
market - and with less and less companies to work for.  Like Conoco and
Phillips - that are now going to be one company also.

I am now sitting in a trade room that used to have 20 people - and was so
busy and loud.  Now I am all by myself, most transferred out and some were
laid off.  Torch is trying to find work for me to do as well - but you know
too how that can work out, I think I am working it week by week.  I am
keeping my ears to the ground..... especially after the New Year.

Good luck to you Marie - and Happy Thanksgiving as well.  This year has not
gone well for many people - so surely the new year will be different.  I
hope so - I expect so.
