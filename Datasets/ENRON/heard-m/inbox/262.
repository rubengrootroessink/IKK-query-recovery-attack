Thanks Marie... I thought you might have ... I might have missed it.

Thanks for faxing them again.

Have a good weekend, if I don't speak to you beforehand.

		   Hi Marie,

		   As I referenced in my earlier e mail, I am in the process
of reviewing
		   the
		   AHC-Enron originals.  However, I noticed that I have not
yet received a
		   faxed set of Authorizations from Enron for this ISDA.  As
referenced in
		   your
		   cover letter, could you fax these to me at your earliest
convenience?
		   If
		   acceptable, you can than forward a set through the mail.

		   Thanks so much,
