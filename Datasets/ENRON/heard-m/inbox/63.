Marie, the counterparty just called and they are interested in closing their old bank accounts, but are concerned that we will continue to send it the the old bank account being that we have not moved the Pacifica Papers deals to Norske Skog.

Please let me know if you have heard from anyone.

Thanks,
Gordon

I never received a response to my 9/17 e-mail to you re this amalgamation.  Are there any credit issues with respect to this amalgamation?

Thanks!

Marie

It is my understanding that the companies mentioned above have been amalgamated, with Norske Skog Canada Limited retaining the name.  Are you aware that this occurred?  Norske Skog is wanting me to bill Pacifica Paper's swaps under Norske Skog's name going forward.

Please let me know!

Thanks,
Gordon
