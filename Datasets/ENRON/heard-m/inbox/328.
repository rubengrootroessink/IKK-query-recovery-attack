Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have attached a clean version of the Master Netting, Setoff and Security
Agreement , a cumulative redline against the draft distributed by Harlan
last night, and an incremental redline again my earlier distribution
reflecting BNP Paribas' additional comments as well as our 11:30 call.

Yours truly,

David Rosen
