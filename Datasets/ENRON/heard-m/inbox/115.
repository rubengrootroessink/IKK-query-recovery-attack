Afternoon,
	Enclosed is an amended worksheet for Ineos Acrylics Inc.  We sent a draft under a different name a couple of months ago.  This entity will be guaranteed by the ultimate parent as described in the worksheet.  Please prepare this draft and forward to Eric and Graham at Ineos, with a copy to me.  
	Give me a call with any questions.

Thanks,

Max
