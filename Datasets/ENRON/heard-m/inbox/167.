Marie,
	Goldman needs an updated QIB letter from ECT Investments.  We normally update every year.  They need this doc before transferring the convert book.  I left a message with Sara since I've worked with her in the past on processing this type of documentation.  Please give her a call if you have any questions regarding the QIB (qualified investor buyer) form.

Thanks,
Theresa

Theresa,
our legal area was able to track down the QIB "form letter" you were looking
for.
Let me know if you have any questions

Joe
