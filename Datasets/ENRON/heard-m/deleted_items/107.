This guy was lonely, and decided life would be more fun if he had a pet. So
he went to the pet store and told the owner that he wanted to buy an unusual
pet. After some discussion, he finally bought a centipede, which came in a
little white box to use for its  house. He took the box back home, found a
good location for the box, and decided he would start off by taking his new
pet to the bar to have a drink.

He asked the centipede in the box, "Would you like to go to Frank's with me
and have a beer?" But there was no answer from his new pet.  This bothered
him a bit, but he waited a few minutes and then asked him again, "How about
going to the bar and having a drink with me?" But again, there was no answer
from his new friend and pet. So he waited a few minutes more, thinking about
the situation. He decided to ask him one more time; this time putting his
face up against the centipede's house and shouting, "Hey, in there! Would
you like to go to Frank's place and have a drink with me?"
     > >
A little voice came out of the box: "I heard you the first time! I'm putting
on my shoes".
