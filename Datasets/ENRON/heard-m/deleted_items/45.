Good Afternoon Marie,

Here is a list of inner company counterparties that require ISDA Master Agreements. I checked the Financial Trading Agreements listing in Lotus Notes to make sure an ISDA Master Agreement didn't already exist. Please double check your version in the event a counterparty was deleted as a result of the historical problem that we previously discussed regarding missing counterparty ISDA Master references.
