What do you call a polar bear wearing ear muffs? 
Anything you want.  He can't hear you!  

Just before Christmas, an honest politician, a generous 
lawyer and  Santa Claus were riding in the elevator of 
a very posh hotel. Just before  the doors opened they all 
noticed a $20 bill lying on the floor. Which one  picked it up? 
Santa of course, because the other two don't exist!  

What happened when Santa's cat swallowed a ball of yarn? 
She had  mittens. 
   
What do you call it when your Christmas tree explodes? 
A tannen-bomb.  (tannenbaum)  

Why did Frosty go to live in the middle of the ocean? 
Because snow man  is an island.
