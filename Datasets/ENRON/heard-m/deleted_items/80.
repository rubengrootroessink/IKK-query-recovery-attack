Subject: THE ANSWER TO NUMBER ELEVEN  
I don't know who David is, but his response is hilarious!!! Ya  know.......some people look for things like this...and it amazes me. At first I  rolled my eyes....then I read Dave's response and I couldn't have said it better  if I had all day to do it.  
Original Letter:  
The date of the attack: 9/11 - 9 + 1 + 1 = 11  
September 11th is the 254th day of the year: 2 + 5 + 4 = 11  
After September 11th there are 111 days left to the end of the year.  
119 is the area code to Iraq/Iran. 1 + 1 + 9 = 11  
Twin Towers - standing side by side, looks like the number 11  
The first plane to hit the towers was Flight 11 I Have More.......  State of New York - The 11th State added to the Union  
New York City - 11 Letters  
Afghanistan - 11 Letters  
The Pentagon - 11 Letters  
Ramzi Yousef - 11 Letters (convicted or orchestrating the attack at  the WTC in 1993)  
Flight 11 - 92 on board - 9 + 2 = 11  
Flight 77 - 65 on board - 6 + 5 = 11  
Dave's response: Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11  letters in the name"David Pawson!" I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a few  weeks. Wait a sec ... just realized "YOU CAN'T HIDE" also has 11 letters! What  am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after me! ME! I can't believe it!  Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could hide! But no  ..."PLANET EARTH" has 11 letters, too! Maybe Nostradamus can help me. But dare I  trust  
him? There are 11 letters in "NOSTRADAMUS." I know, the Red Cross can  help. No they can't...11 letters in "THE RED CROSS," can't trust them. I would  rely on self defense, but "SELF DEFENSE" has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone  help? Anyone? If so, send me email. No, don't... "SEND ME EMAIL" has 11  letters.... Will this never end? I'm going insane! "GOING INSANE???" Eleven  letters!! Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though "I'LL DIE  ALONE" has 11 letters..... Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed!  Our Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4=11!  
~Dave  
PS. "IT'S BULLSHIT" has 11 letters also.
