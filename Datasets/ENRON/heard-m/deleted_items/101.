Donna,

Per our earlier conversation, the following list is the name of the
active
Exchange Brokers we received from Accounting.  As we only received a
hard-copy of this information, I listed the names below.  Additionally,
I
have indicated in bold the broker names were also on the list you
provided
to us from legal.

As part of our testing, we have selected 5 Brokerage Agreements from the
list you provided and 2 Exchange Brokers from the Accounting List that
we
would like to review for proper approval.  The requested agreements are
listed below.
