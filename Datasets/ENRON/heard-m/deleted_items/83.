Part 6(h).  Because we deal in many markets where there may be little liquidity Part 6(h) was added to ensure that our counterparties recognize that some OTC commodity derivative transactions occur in markets where there is little liquidity.  Because of the lack of liquidity (i) it may be difficult to get quotes from someone other than the dealer with whom the deal was done, (ii) the prices quoted for entering into, modifying or terminating a transaction may be different than if the transaction were traded in a liquid market, and (iii) any valuations given by the dealer may not reflect its bookkeeping or theoretical model-based valuations because of other factors such as the creditworthiness of the counterparty, costs of carry, use of capital and profit.
