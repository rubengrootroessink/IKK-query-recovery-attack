This deal ticket was done as a master but I confirmed with Tanya that it can be done as a deemed ISDA without the CSA portion.  Please prepare this morning if at all possible. 
Thanks,
Brent

Rebecca may have already sent you the attached term sheet that we are working with ABN Amro. 

Would you please confirm with Rebecca what we need to do to go forward with this transactions. They are discussing the Enron's credit.
