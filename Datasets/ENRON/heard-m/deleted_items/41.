I have attached a new credit worksheet.  The new ISDA should be sent to Eric Shaw.  I'd like to move forward with negotiations even as we are waiting for the order from the court on the hedging. We can always wait to execute until you are comfortable.  We need to expedite this process; Rob Cooper and Craig Breslau want to trade ASAP and we must have the document in place.  I am going to mirror the terms in the Master Firm that I will send to Hodge so please coordinate with him. Please call with any questions regarding the terms.

Thanks,
Tanya
