Hello All,

I have received information from credit that we have an existing omnibus agreement with Linpac Inc., and was hoping you could confirm this for me.
I am working on two new swaps with this counterparty (Y93720 and Y93758).

Much appreciated,
Becca
Rebecca Bell

Rebecca,

The last two transactions were confirmed under an omnibus agreement I believe. Could you please confirm with Legal if that actually is the case , then you could confirm these under the same Omnibus. Thanks.

Aparna

Aparna,

I have two new swaps with LINPAC Inc. (Y93720 and Y93758).  We do not yet have a master financial agreement with this counterparty.  Is there going to be any credit?

Thank you,
Becca
