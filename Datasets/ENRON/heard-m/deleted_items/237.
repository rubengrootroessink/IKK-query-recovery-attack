Hi Marie,

Just give me a call when you get a chance.

I want to discuss what you need as far as Authorizations before I begin
drafting.

Thanks,

		Hi, Dana:

		We have received the original copy of the ISDA Master
Agreement.  In
		looking through the supporting documents, we noted two
outstanding
		items:

		1.	We did not receive an original signed IRS Tax Form
W-9 as
		required pursuant to Part 3(a); and

		2.	The Certificate of Incumbency we received was not an
original
		and was dated November 14, 2000.  We would like to receive
an original
		certificate dated a current date.

		If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact
either
		Frank or me.  We look forward to receiving this
documentation.

		Marie
