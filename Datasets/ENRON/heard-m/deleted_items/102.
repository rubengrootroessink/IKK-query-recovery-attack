Marie,

  It's been slow - but I think its going to pick up.  Send me a list of what you want to purchase and from where - as well as the address where you want it shipped.  I will then firnd out pricing for you.  It may take a little longer with the Robert Allen stuff since I have to open an account there.  I do not anticipate any problems getting the account open.  Maybe we can have lunch early next week.  Let me know what day is good for you,

Hi, Robbi!

How are things going?  Any more news?

We have finally decided on our fabric and the amount of yardage.  What's the next step?

Thanks!

Marie
