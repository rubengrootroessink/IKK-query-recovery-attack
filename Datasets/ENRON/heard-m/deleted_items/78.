Nidia has changed her mind there is no credit on this deal.  They will need a deemed ISDA though.  Can you follow up with Nidia to see who is drafting the confirm so we can send them the appropriate deemed ISDA.
Thanks,
Brent

Brent,

Please draft a language for the Credit provision section of USFC confirmation saying the following:

Vivendi Universal, S.A. needs to provide a $10 million parent gty. to ENA covering United States Filter Corporation for financial obligations.  This gty. needs to be received by Oct. 24, 2001.  Failure to provide this gty. will make United States Filter Corporation on default.

Attached is the gty. format.

Thanks for your help,

Nidia A. Mendoza
