Dan:

Attached are clean and blackline drafts of the ISDA Master Agreement noting your changes to Parts 5(b)(g)-"Eligibility" and 5(p)-"Additional Definitions".  If the attached revisions are acceptable, we should be in a position to finalize execution documents.

Did your lawyer have any comments to the guaranty forms?

Thanks!

Marie

Marie,

I think it's OK to just refer to the LLC Agreement. But you will see there
really aren't any restrictions in Quark's case.  The investment guidelines
are outlined in the LLC Agreement (Section 1.2 "Purposes").

Let me know what you think is best.

Dan

I spoke with Frank about your proposed changes and he was okay with your
first change, however,  the definition of "Investment Policy" does appear
in Section 5(c)(i).  What documentation sets forth your investment
objectives, restrictions, etc.?

Also, do you have any comments to the forms of guaranty agreements attached
to the ISDA?

Finally, we are awaiting copies of Quark's documents, those of its Manager
and those of any other relevant entities so that we can review them and
verify that there are no issues that would require delivery of a legal
opinion.

Thank you for your assistance.

   Marie,

   Thank you very much for the drafts. I believe we are almost there.
   Please chack with Frank and see if the following changes are acceptable:

   1. Part 5(b)(g)Eligibility.  Remove the second rep. for eligible
   commercial
   entity.

   2. Part 5(p) Additional Definitions.  Quark does not have a prospectus.
   In
   any
   case I don't think we need this definition.

   I think that may be it.

   Dan
