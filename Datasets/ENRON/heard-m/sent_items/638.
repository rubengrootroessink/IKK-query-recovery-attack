Mr. Spencer:

I asked Cheryl Nelson, the attorney working with me on this file to give you an update as to the status of the ISDA, and I am not sure if she responded or not.  Cheryl is out of the office for the next week and the attorney who will be covering for her is out of the office today.  I will check with him Monday as to the status and let you know.  Sorry for the delay in responding.
