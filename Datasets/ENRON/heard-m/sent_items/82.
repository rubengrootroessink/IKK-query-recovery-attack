> The Binch hated U.S!  the whole U.S. way!

> But,  Whatever the reason, his heart or his turban,

>  "They're doing their business," he snarled from his perch. 
> "They're raising their families! They're going to church!  
> They're leading the world, and their empire is  thriving, 
> I MUST keep the S's and U's from  surviving!"

> Tomorrow,  he knew, all the U's and the S's, 
> Would put on  their pants and their shirts and their dresses, 
>  They'd go to their offices, playgrounds and schools, 
> And abide by their U and S values and rules,

> And then they'd do something he liked  least of all, 
> Every U down in Uville, the tall and  the small, 
> Would stand all united, each U and each  S, 
> And they'd sing Uville's anthem, "God bless us!  God bless!" 
> All around their Twin Towers of Uville,  they'd stand, 
> and their voices would drown every  sound in the land. 
> 
> "I  must stop that singing," Binch said with a smirk, 
>  And he had an idea--an idea that might work! 
> The  Binch stole some U airplanes in U morning hours, 
>  And crashed them right into the Uville Twin Towers. 
>  "They'll wake to disaster!" he snickered, so sour, 
>  "And how can they sing when they can't find a tower?" 
> 
> The Binch cocked his ear as they woke  from their sleeping, 
> All set to enjoy their  U-wailing and weeping, 
> Instead he heard something  that started quite low, 
> And it built up quite slow,  but it started to grow-- 
> And the Binch heard the  most unpredictable thing... 
> And he couldn't believe  it--they started to sing! 
> 
> He stared down at Uville, not trusting his eyes, 
> What he saw was a shocking, disgusting surprise! 
> Every U down in Uville, the tall and the small, 
> Was singing! Without any towers at all! 
>  He HADN'T stopped Uville from singing! It sung! 
> For  down deep in the hearts of the old and the young, 
>  Those Twin Towers were standing, called Hope and called Pride, 
> And you can't smash the towers we hold deep inside. 
> 
> So we circle the sites where our heroes  did fall, 
> With a hand in each hand of the tall and  the small, 
> And we mourn for our losses while  knowing we'll cope, 
> For we still have inside that  U-Pride and U-Hope.

>  For America means a bit more than tall towers, 
> It  means more than wealth or political powers, 
> It's  more than our enemies ever could guess,
