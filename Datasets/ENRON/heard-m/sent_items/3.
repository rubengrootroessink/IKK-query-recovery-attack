I'm scared to go up near your desk.  I'll wear protective gear.  Thanks for your understanding.  I will not tell you my temp number either for I fear much!

Well, I'll be on the legal floor tomorrow.  Do you want me to just drop by your office then?  Or do you need it now?

Boy, I'm REALLY mad at you!  Just kidding!  I thought you were just going to initial the signature pages and then we would get Kevin to sign it here.  Since you're in town, I can run the originals down to you (if you'll tell me where you are) so that you can initial and then I can ask Kevin to sign.

Thanks!

Marie

Marie,

Don't be mad.  I have not gotten it signed.  When I was ready to do so, Belden was unreachable.  Then I suddenly forgot prior to rushing down to H-town.  What do you want me to do now?  Get Kevin this week?  or Get Tim on Tues. after Labor Day?  Are you really mad?  I'm sorry.  Please advise on how I can try and do damage control.

Tracy

Hi, Tracy!

I have never received the signature pages for the Allegheny ISDA.  Have you sent them?
