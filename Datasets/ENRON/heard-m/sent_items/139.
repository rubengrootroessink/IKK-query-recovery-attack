Hi Marie,

The fee letter looks good - and I have all of the paperwork here, except of
course the Termination letter for ENA Deal #0619, which you indicated the
Confirmation Desk was workin on.  So things look good to go.

I have the paperwork back from both Dynegy and Sempra, but United Oil's
letters is being reviewed by its lawyer today.  He was away for the past two
days.  As soon as I have everything together I will courier the complete
package to you - one detail that I forgot to mention - right now I have fax
copies only, and I hope it will suffice until I can get original signatures.
If it does not, then we are in real trouble!!  So say it is okay - and I
will work on the originals after the deal is completed.

Thanks for all your help, Marie.

Roeline
