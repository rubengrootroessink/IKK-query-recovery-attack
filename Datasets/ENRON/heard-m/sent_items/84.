(713) 896-1673.  It doesn't matter to me if we eat before or go for coffee after.  The only places I know to eat near the Wortham are at Bayou Place.  I know there's Hard Rock Cafe, a barbecue place and I don't know what else is there.  Let me know what you want to do. If we don't eat before, I guess we can meet at the bottom of the escalators at the theatre.
