Hi, Lech!

My understanding is that you all will be handling the filings.  It's been so long since I've done UCC filings that I'm not sure I would even remember what to do.

Thanks!

Marie

We have ordered the searches, but not prepared filings.  Are you handling
the latter, or would you like us to do that, too?
