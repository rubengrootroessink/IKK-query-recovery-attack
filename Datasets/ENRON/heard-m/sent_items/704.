Marie:

Can you please forward the following paragraph to the confirm desk and ask them to revise confirmationYH2566.1, YH2564.1 and YH2567.1 by replacing the first full paragraph on page 2 of each of the three confirmations (replacing the paragraph that begins "Each of the parties to this Agreement recognizes and acknowledges that the parties are acting and agreeing to perform their obligations hereunder in reliance upon . . . ") with the paragraph that follows.  When they have completed the revision, please ask them to reissue the confirmations to Bank of Montreal and Reliant, respectively.  Please ask the confirm desk to send a copy of the Bank of Montreal confirm to Diane Bruning in the legal department IN ADDITION TO Bank of Montreal's confirmation group.  Diane's fax number is 646-366-1724.
