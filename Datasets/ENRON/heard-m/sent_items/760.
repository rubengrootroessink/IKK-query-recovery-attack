Hi, Edmund!

Can you help me obtain copies of some of your executed documents with BNP?  I need copies of the following:

1.	ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA

2.	Enron Credit Limited/BNPP ISDA

3.	ECTD /BNPP physical UK gas confirm (representative sample)

I hope you know who ECTD is cause I sure don't.  I am only assuming that because it's UK gas, it's a UK company.

My fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!

Marie
