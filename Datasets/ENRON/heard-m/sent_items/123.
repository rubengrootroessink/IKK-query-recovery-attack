Correct.  I just left you a voice mail re the termination.

So, is it true that the underlying new deals do not become effective until the assignments are signed?

Diane:

We just sent drafts to Torch as they needed to send them to UOM, Dynegy and Sempra for review.  When we get them signed, I'll distribute copies.

Hey Marie,

Got the Torch assignments you sent down.  Thanks.  Question for you:  Did someone from ENA sign all the Assignment and Assumption Agreements before you sent them to Torch? (the copies I have aren't signed) Or do we sign them when they come back executed by Torch?  

Thanks,
Diane
