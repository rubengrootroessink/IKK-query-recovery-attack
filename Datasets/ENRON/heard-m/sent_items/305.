Hi, Cindy!

Attached is a memo requesting the referenced Enron Corp. guaranty.  Also attached are forms of certificates to be signed by Kate Cole.  Please note that one of the certificates requires the inclusion of articles of incorporation and bylaws.

Please call me when the documents are ready and I'll have someone pick them up.

Thanks for your help!

Marie
