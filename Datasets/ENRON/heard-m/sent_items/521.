We can look at your documents, however, we are unable to open the one you 
have sent previously.  Will you resend them? 
Thanks!

   Hi Marie, 
   Our attorney has been on vacation most of this month, and unfortunately, 
   we have not had the chance to review of your proposed ISDA documents. 
   Would it be possible for you to review our docs?  It will certainly help 
   us out since we currently have a back log of unsigned ISDA contracts. 
   Please advise. 
   Thanks, Angie
