Attached is the latest list of master netting agreement counterparties.  The only addition is Western Resources (in bold).  Also, I have added The New Power Company and Entergy-Koch Trading, L.P. which, along with PG&E, were previously executed.  In addition, I have noted those master netting agreements that have been executed.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
