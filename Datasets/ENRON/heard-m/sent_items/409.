CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!  We've been asking everyday if anyone had heard if the "Babies Elliott" had arrived.  Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size, and that Mom is doing well.  Look forward to seeing pictures of the little ones.  I know you all are going to have so much fun with them.  Hope you've been storing up sleep, cause it looks like you won't be getting much for a while.

Again, congratulations.  These three little ones don't realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad, but I'm sure they'll find out soon.

Take care

Marie

Ladies and gentlemen,

This is just to let you know that Emma gave birth at week 34 on Friday, 6th July, to our triplets:

Benjamin James - at 12.45 pm - 3 lbs 4 ozs

Toby William - 12.46 pm - 4 lbs

Hannah May - 12.48 pm - 3 lbs 15 ozs.

Although small, they are all "fully functioning" and very well - they are in the lowest level of special care (and they will probably be in there for another two to four weeks) until they can feed properly and maintain their weights.  Emma is fine, too - very well!!

All the best and kind regards

Mark
