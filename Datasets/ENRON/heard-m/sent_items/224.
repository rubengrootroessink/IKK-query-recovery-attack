Hi, Roeline!

Eric faxed me a copy of the assignment and new confirmation signed by Sempra but I have not seen the originals.

Hi Marie -

I now have executed assignments from UOM and Dynegy.  I called Eric Twombly
at Sempra and he said that they may have sent it directly to Enron (you??).
I want to call Eric again today, but wanted to make sure first that he
indeed had not send the originals directly back to you - which is not what I
requested.

Please let me know - and thanks,
Roeline
