I did locate our comments to Nestle's form of schedule originally drafted for Nestle Holdings, Inc., which they revised to reflect Nestle USA, Inc.  These comments were delivered to Ed Quinn on 5/21/99 to deliver to Nestle.  To our knowledge, nothing has happened since.

Jarrod:

I have checked our database and here is what I found:

Clorox - nothing has happened since you contacted them in May and they said they would send it in a few weeks.

Nestle - nothing since we sent them a revised draft in July, 1998.

Let us know if you want us to follow up with them.

Marie

We sent an ISDA to Clorox and Nestle USA and I was wondering if we have received anything from them.

Thanks,
