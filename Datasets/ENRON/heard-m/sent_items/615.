Kate and Teresa:

We are working on a time sensitive project and ask that you assist us in determining the names of various Enron entities by doing an historical analysis or whatever means you use.

The entities I need info on are:

Enron Gas Processing Company
[Cole, Kate] 3/31/97 - Divested to KN Processing, Inc., subsidiary of KN Energy, Inc. 

Enron Gas Marketing Canada
[Cole, Kate]  5/3/94 - Enron Gas Liquids Canada, Ltd. and Canadian Gas Marketing Inc. amalgamated with Enron Gas Marketing Canada Inc. to form Enron Gas Services Canada Corp.

Enron Oil Canada Ltd
[Cole, Kate]  Divested:
08/16/99 - Spun off to EOG Resources and changed its name to EOG Resources Canada Inc.
.
Enron Oil Corporation
[Cole, Kate]  10/19/95 - Dissolved.

Are these prior names of current Enron entities, are they existing entities, etc.?

Please call me if you need any additional info or if my request is confusing.

Thanks for your help!
