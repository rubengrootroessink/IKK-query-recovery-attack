Hi, Roeline:

No, I haven't received any original documents from Sempra.  If he sent them here I would surely have them by now.  Thanks for sending your copies--now I can get a big pile off my desk too.

We are trying to hold our own over here, hoping to miss the first round of layoffs.  It is still so incredibly unbelievable that this is happening.  It seems like a bad dream and any minute we will awaken.  It's supposed to be "business as usual" but it's pretty hard to get into the swing of things.  Hopefully everything will work out.

Have a Happy Thanksgiving!

Marie

Hi Marie -

I have been trying to get the paperwork back from Sempra, however, Eric
Twombly keeps saying he thinks all assignment documents were returned to
Enron, including my copy.  I cannot get a confirmation that this is so
though.

So I thought I'd better check with you - please let me know whether you have
the Sempra assignment documents.  Also I wanted to send you the documents
signed by us, UOM and Dynegy - so as to get it off my desk.

Hope all is well with you - especially with what has happened in the past
two weeks.  Things sure do change in a hurry, don't they?

Regards,
Roeline
