Marie, we processed a transaction today in this new ECT Europe Finance Inc.
acct.  I was wondering if you have any forms that you could fax us.
Thanks,
MK Lemont

Ms. Lemont:

It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the
referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign
the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc.
signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such
agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.
Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of
ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.  Will Bear
Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the
corporate documentation?
