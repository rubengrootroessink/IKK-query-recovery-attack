Kristina:

Pursuant to our conversation, attached is the form of Consent and Assignment for execution by Enron North America Corp. in connection with the natural gas and basis swaps to be assigned to Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.

As I stated, our credit department is verifying the transactions being assigned so once I receive information from them, we will contact you with any questions or comments.

Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions.

Thanks!
