Jim:

In connection with the upcoming Enron Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared, and attach for your review, resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of Enron Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, the interest rate and currency desk typically goes to Andy Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers.  Andy's title has changed and he has also asked that Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.

The attached resolutions are substantially like the ones ENA has adopted in connection with the opening of brokerage accounts.  ENA also requires two officers to sign documents to open brokerage accounts, but allows only one officer to sign subsequent documentation and to give instructions to the brokers.

Would you please review the attached resolutions and advise if they are acceptable so that we can submit them to Rebecca Carter  by tomorrow, August 1.

Thanks for your assistance and, please let us know if you have any questions.
