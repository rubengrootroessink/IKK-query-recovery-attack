Clement!

Attached is the Amendment to the Enron Corp. guaranty delivered to Dynegy last week.  The only change we made is to include a reference to the inclusion of master netting agreements in the second paragraph.

If the attached is acceptable, please have signed and call me when it's ready and I'll pickup.

Thanks for your help!
