I can't help this time.  The only Enron Corp. guaranty we have was issued in connection with financial transactions only.

Sorry.

Do we know a counterparty name or do I have to look at all our files?

MH-

I am trying to lay my hands on an Enron Corp. multi-commodity gty dated May 1, 1996 and amended on May 12, 1997, September 22, 1997 and again on July 20, 1999.  Would you have a copy???  (I hope!!!).

Thanks,
GF
