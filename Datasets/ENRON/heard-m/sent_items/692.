Hi, Edmund!

Can you assist me in obtaining copies of some confirmations?  I just need a copy of one representative confirmation for the following:

Conoco (UK) Limited and Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited
Conoco International Inc. and ECTRIC
Conoco Limited and ECTRIC
Societe Europeenne de Carburants N.C. and ECTRIC.

You can either fax them to me at (713) 646-3490 or e-mail.

THANKS!!!!!!!!

Marie
