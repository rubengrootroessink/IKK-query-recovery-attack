Tanya:

Can someone in your shop get us copies of the guaranties?  I pulled the one in our ISDA file and the amounts don't match, so I don't know if there have been any amendments or not.

If you can't find someone to pull these, let me know and I'll come down and get them.

Also, Livelink doesn't show a power master with Coral Power LLC, but I have someone checking on this.

Thanks!

Marie
