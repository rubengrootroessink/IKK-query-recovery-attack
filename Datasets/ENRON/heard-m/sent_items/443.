Hi, Joe:

Tana said I should forward this e-mail to you and that you guys would prepare the assignment and send to us for review.  Let me know if this is not the case.  Please note that all of the deals, with the exception of the first one, are EOL deals.

Thanks for your help.

Marie

Legal Team,

Per the recent change in Company structure for Sequent Energy Management, LLC there are a number of financial deals that must be assigned over to the correct entity--Sequent Energy Management, LP.  Please prepare trade assignment documentation for the following deals (please note that all of these deals, except for the first one, were executed on EOL):

VT2401.1
VM7262.1
VM7369.1
VM7677.1
VM8690.1
VM8778.1
VN2395.1
VN3448.1
VN4598.1

VP3529.1
VP3704.1

Also, ENA does not have an ISDA in place with the counterparty--all deals were confirmed under GTC's.  Please give me a call if you need any other info.

Thanks again,

Veronica Espinoza
