Attached is the proposed form of guaranty that Enron Corp. will provide.  ECT Investments would only collateralize above the threshold, since you would have a guaranty for the rest.  We look forward to receiving your form of schedule.

Marie,

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  Providing financials for CSFB
Europe Ltd and CSFBi will not be a problem.  If we could get a copy of the
guarantee Enron Corp. will provide, my credit dept. will send out the ISDA
schedule.

One remaining question is will ECT collateralize their trades?  Thanks in
advance for your help.

Ms. Rosenthal:

Sara Shackleton just left for vacation until after Labor Day, but asked
me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed ISDA
schedule.  Our Credit Department has said that Enron Corp. will provide
a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like
for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated
entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).
Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp.
guaranty.

You can send your ISDA Schedule to my attention and we will proceed with
reviewing same.

Thank you.
