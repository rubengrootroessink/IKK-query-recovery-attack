Credit has been instructed that either Rick Buy or Bill can sign the CA's.  Since these were strictly for financials (and signed by Enron Corp.), we weren't going to enter them into our database, but Kay Young is going to keep a copy in her files.  Do you have any suggestions or comments otherwise?

Does credit know a VP must sign?  I guess none of these are recorded in legal's C.A. database, right?

Subject:	Credit Confidentiality Agreement Forms and Procedures

In connection with Tana Jones' e-mail of July 12, 2001, I am attaching revised forms of the Credit Confidentiality Agreements for use in requesting financial statements from a counterparty.  Please begin using the attached forms when preparing confidentiality agreements and please refer to Tana's e-mail regarding procedures for preparing and signing the agreements.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at x33907.
