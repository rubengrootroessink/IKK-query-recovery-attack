Everyone signed but ENA Upstream and Canada.  Reliant signed yesterday and brought them back to me this morning so that I can get the other signatures.  I am having the document taken to Brian Redmond to sign for ENA Upstream and then Peter Keohane will sign for ECC.  Barbara signed off on the receivables.

Just checking on the status of the Reliant MNA -- did it get executed?  Did Joel sign off on it?
