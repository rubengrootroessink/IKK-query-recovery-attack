Thank you for all your hard work.  This is something that has needed to be done, but no one would take the initiative.  Let's just hope all your hard work makes it to the datasheet.

Thanks!

Marie

Thank you both for the hard work and quick turnaround with regard to cleaning up the Powers of Attorney for Enron North America Corp.  This was a large project for us all.

I hoping to get the documents initialed today revoking the old and appointing the new.

Once executed and the data entry is complete, the database will accurately reflect reality for the first time that anyone can remember.

Sincerely,

Mx
