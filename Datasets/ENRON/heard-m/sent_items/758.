Transactions to be included:

ENA/ BNPP ISDA
ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA
ECL/BNPP ISDA
ECTD/BNPP physical UK gas business

Bill does not want to include any of the brokerage agreeements.  Also, I beleive we have kept Metals out of everyhting thus far and should continue to do so.  One point of note in the document is section 2 BNPP appears to have modified the language such that the Non Defaulting party can cherry pick which agreements it wants to terminate - this is unacceptable. To be honest, I am going to need your help walking me through this document as they have changed so much I am unclear in many instances  what their changes accomplish.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Tanya

Dear Lech:

I have attached a version of the proposed Master Netting,  Setoff, and
Security Agreement between Enron Group and BNP Paribas Group,  subject to
BNP Paribas' review, along with a redline against Enron's form.   I have
also faxed the same to you at 212 945-2911.  We  would like to discuss the
draft with you tomorrow morning with a view to its  execution by tomorrow
afternoon.  Seth may be reached at 212 572-5317, and  I may be reached at
212 572-5398.

Yours truly,



David Rosen
