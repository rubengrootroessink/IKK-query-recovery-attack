Look in the closing binder (the BMC binders) were on your file cabinets.  The side letter should be in there.

HI Marie

Can you help me out for a minute?  

I found the BMC executed MSA but the "sideletter" that she is talking about I don't have that in the file -- do you remember this at all?

thanks for any help you can give me!

Jane/Tanya/Tracy,

I found out last night that I have to be in LA on Monday and Tuesday.  I have left Tracy a voice mail asking her to fax me the executed BMC doc., together with the BMC sideletter, so that we can at least get the 2nd master agreement to BMC.  Maybe we could schedule the Master Netting Agreement meeting for Wednesday with a view to getting that document out Wednesday or Thursday.  Does that work for you???  Let me know.

Cynthia
