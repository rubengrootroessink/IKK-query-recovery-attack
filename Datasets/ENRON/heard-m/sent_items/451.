Samantha:

Here is an e-mail from Chris Croom forwarding a counterparty's form of Confidentiality Agreement.  He is leaving town this afternoon to go meet with them, so he needs the CA ASAP.

I think I would first check with Kay Young to see if we have a CA with them, and if so, is it still active.  Maybe we can just work off that form since the counterparty has signed it before.

Let me know if you have questions or need help.

Thanks!

Marie
