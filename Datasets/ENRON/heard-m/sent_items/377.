Cindy:

Attached are the certificates to be issued in connection with the Enron Corp. Guaranties in favor of Inland Paperboard and Packaging and Quark Power LLC.  Both of these guaranties were signed by Mary Perkins on July 13, 2001.  Please process the attached certificates as soon as possible, as we have already forwarded our documentation to the counterparties and the only remaining items to be delivered are the attached certificates.

Thanks!

Marie
