Robbi:

I left you a voice mail on Friday.  I looked at the UEComm Master and had some comments--such as our name is wrong, the cross default threshold for us should be US $ and not AUD, and there were a few other questions I had.

Marie

Hi,

Attached are Uecomm's final comments to the Master Agreement.  John Suttle has OK'd Anthony's latest request w/r.t. the CSA.

Could you please send an executable version of the contract to Fred, David, John and me tomorrow?

If they're OK with it, we'd like to execute it as soon as possible unless there are any objections.

Thanks

Pat

Pat,

Please find attached the Enron Master Agreement. I have inserted the company
details of Uecomm as requested.

I have also amended the timeframes in the Credit Support Annex to 10 days
instead of 2 days. (Clauses 2 & 3). I have tracked all changes for ease of
reference.

If these amendmnets are agreeable to you can you please print and arrange
for execution.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call.

Regards,

Anthony Sill
