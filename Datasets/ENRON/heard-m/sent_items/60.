Tanya and Paul:

Linda Anderson in Financial Settlements faxed me a copy of a Certificate of Amalgamation evidencing the merger of Norske Skog Canada Limited and Pacifica Papers Inc. with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.  You both worked on these files--Tanya, Pacifica Papers and Paul, Norske Skog.

Are you all okay with this merger from the credit side?

Thanks!

Marie
