Hi, Robbi!

Hope you are enjoying your time off.  I know I certainly enjoyed Friday and Tuesday and hated to come back today.

Anne and I went to the Decorative Center yesterday, and tried to check out some samples at Beacon Hill (Robert Allen Fabrics) and they couldn't find your account.  Do you have an account there, or was I mistaken?

Anyway, I thought I'd e-mail you since I don't have your home number in case you were going to the Decorative Center later this week to see if you could check out some samples for us if you had time.

At Beacon Hill  (Robert Allen):

Pattern:  Bearnson
Color:  Aged Gold

Pattern:  Scholtes
Color:  Cinnabar

Pattern:  McGeary
Color:  Citron

At Brunschwig & Fils (Gaston y Daniela):

Pattern No.:  82315-198
Name:  Chevron Woven Texture
Color:  Teja

Pattern No.:  82315 - 401
Name:  Chevron Woven Texture
Color:  Verde Agua

At Schumacher & Co. (Greeff)

Pattern No.:  3185017
Name:  Ephemera
Color:  Grass

Pattern No.:  3185046
Name:  Ephemera
Color:  Bittersweet

Pattern No.:  3112096
Name:  Alpine

If you don't go back to DC or have already gone, we can maybe find the Robert Allen samples at Expo. They sell his fabrics there.

Thanks!  We really appreciate your help.

Marie
