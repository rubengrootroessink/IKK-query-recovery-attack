Hi, Anna!

I apologize for not calling you today, but things got pretty hectic and I misplaced your message. Besides the termination of the Enron Corp. guaranty guaranteeing obligations of Enron North America Corp., please provide me with a list of the corporate certificates you need.  This will help me in having everything signed that you need.

Thanks!

Marie
