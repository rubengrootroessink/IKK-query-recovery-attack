Hi, Maribel:

I don't know if you were copied on Tana Jones's e-mail, but Legal is preparing all confidentiality agreements once again, so instead of you having to prepare the agreement, if you will just provide us with the counterparty info (name, address, contact, etc.) we will prepare the CA, have initialled and forward to you for signature.

Thanks!

Marie
