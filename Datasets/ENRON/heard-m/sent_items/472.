The old priest asked the new priest to sit in on his sessions. The new
priest hears a couple
confessions,
then the old priest asks him to step out of the confessional for a few
suggestions.
The old priest suggests, "Cross you arms over your chest and rub your
chin with one hand." The new priest tries this. The old priest suggests,
"Try saying things like, 'I see', 'yes', 'go on', 'I understand', and 'how
did
you feel about that?'"
The new priest says those things, trying them out.
The old priest says, "Now, don't you think that's a little better than
slapping your knee and saying 'No shit! What happened next?'"
