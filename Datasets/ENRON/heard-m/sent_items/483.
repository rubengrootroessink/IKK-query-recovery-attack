Matt:

Here is the proposed language re appointing agents and attorneys-in-fact to sign confirmations.  We may need to run these by Mark Taylor for approval, as he approves the trading resolutions.  We need to make the appointments effective as of 5/1/01.  Also, Bryan Burnett, Edward Ondarza and Stewart Seeligson are with EBS, so I don't know if they are still officers of ENA.  Didn't Max Yzaguirre leave Enron altogether?

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Thanks!

Marie
