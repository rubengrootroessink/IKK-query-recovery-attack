Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.  Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.
