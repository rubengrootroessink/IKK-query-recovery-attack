Aneela:

The ADM/Carr Futures Give-Up has been signed by fax and the ADM/Goldman Sachs & Co. Give-Up has also been signed by fax.  The ADM/Goldman Sachs International Give-Up won't be signed until the GSI agreement that Sara is working on has been signed.

Sara is unexpected out of the office, probably the rest of the week due to a family emergency.  If you need info, can Marie Heard assist you?
