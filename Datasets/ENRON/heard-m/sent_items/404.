Have a great weekend!  Does this mean you won't be sending us anymore worksheets today?

Ladies,
	Enclosed is a worksheet for Ineos Acrylics.  Ineos is an English company which has a majority of its operations in the US.  Note that the credit thresholds are in US$, but the MACS are designated in British Pounds.  Please send the draft to Troy Black and he will forward to the CP.  Please deliver a copy to me as well.  

Have a great weekend.  

Max
