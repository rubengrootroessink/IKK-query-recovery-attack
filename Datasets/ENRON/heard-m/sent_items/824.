Thank you for the drafts.  We are working on comments and hope to get you a redraft this week.   
Question - Can we incorporate Enron Capital $ Trade International (and LD's UK subsidiary) with the U.S. group or should we leave it as U.S. only? 
Please give me a call at 203-761-8497 if you have questions.
