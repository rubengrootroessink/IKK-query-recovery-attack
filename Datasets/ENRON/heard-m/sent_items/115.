guys,

I know that Nick is working on something like this.

Please, could you provide your view on whether we are expected to provide sign offs for the methodology.

many thanks,

Slava

Coralie/Slava

We had a meeting with Matt Kernot on Friday, about SMBP, SMSP, RCRC curves for UK power.
These are due to go live in the near term (if they haven't already)

The team is using various scalars to create HH curve if needed.

I was wondering if anyone in Risk or Research had looked at the validity of the curves and scalars and if Risk/Research is expected to sign off on these?
