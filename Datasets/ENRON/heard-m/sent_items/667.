I have been forwarding these messages at Rick's request.  Going forward,

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry
picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express
language.

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis
of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading
forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition
of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day
limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be
included in any physical contract that will be included in a master
netting agreement, especially because of the current international
situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 <<MASTER NETTING & SECURITY AGMNT 10 H V1 RED.DOC>>
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms
with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate
document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 <<Master Netting User Notes.doc>>

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use
without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1
(to use with collateral annex).
