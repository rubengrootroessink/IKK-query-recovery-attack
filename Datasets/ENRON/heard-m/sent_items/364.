Hi Marie

Hope all is well.  I'm sure you've heard of all the changes going on down here.  Looks like you made a good decision moving to where you are.  

I have a question about EOL -- Cynthia said you had corresponded with someone named Bob (she thought this was his name) and were able to get up to date product descriptions with respect to EOL from this person.  Does any of this sound familiar?  I need to get Bob's name -- if this is the right person.

Let me know.


thanks

Tracy
