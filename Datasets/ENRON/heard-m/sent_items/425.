Tracy:

Can you send the latest long haul SLAs to Pat since I don't have access to them.  If you're not sure which ones to send, check with Robbi.

Thanks!

Marie

Hi Marie,

Do you think you could forward me our most recent SLA's for Long Haul capacity?  David and I will work on modifying the Optus SLA's to fit into our Confirm.

Thanks

Pat
