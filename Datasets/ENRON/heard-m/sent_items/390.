Jay:

Here is the e-mail I received from SoCal.  I haven't looked at their form, as I don't think we want to play the forms game with them.  If you want me to, I'll touch base with her to see how she is coming with commenting on our form.

Let me know.

Marie

Hi Marie, 
Per your e-mail to Brent Mishler, we will be reviewing Enron's draft Schedules.  For your review, I have attached SoCalGas' proposed Schedule
to the ISDA Master Agreement and proposed Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex along with our form parental guaranty.   I look forward to working with you to finalize these documents.  If you have any questions, please call me.
