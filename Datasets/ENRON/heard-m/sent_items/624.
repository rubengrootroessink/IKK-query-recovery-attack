Please check on the following Enron entities to determine if they also need
to be added to the netting agreement:

Enron Marketing Services Inc.
Enron Oil Trading & Transportation

Our Canada business unit has deals with the above.

Many Thanks.

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.
