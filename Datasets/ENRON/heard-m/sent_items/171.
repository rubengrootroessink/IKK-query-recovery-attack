We don't have to wait until the board meeting.  We do a unanimous written consent and circulate among the directors for signature.

Do we have to wait for Board resolutions (December BOD mtg) to have Rick start signing, or can they be retroactive ie. ratifying what he's signed if he starts immediately.  I'd think we could do the latter, as that's what you had to do for me.  

Cassandra.

I think so.  It makes sense for Rick to sign on these accounts.  I will be talking to Tom Doukas in the next day to get him focused on his accounts that need to be updated for Enron Credit Inc.  Thanks .Donna

Donna:

I checked the corporate database and Rick is a Vice President of RAC.  Do we want to prepare new board resolutions authorizing him as a second signatory on the brokerage agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and Enron Credit Inc.?
