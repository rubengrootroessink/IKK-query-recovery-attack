Hi, Liz:

Pursuant to Craig Breslau's request, I am attaching the draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex between Enron North America Corp. and Pursue Energy Corporation.  Please let me know if you would like for me to send you a hard copy with the pre-printed forms attached.  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.  We look forward to hearing your comments.

Thanks!

Marie
