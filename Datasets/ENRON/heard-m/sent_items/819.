Hi, Matt:
 
I have faxed the J.Aron, et al/ENA, et al Master Close-Out Agreement to you at fax number 7783-8667.  The other fax number you gave me wouldn't work.  I have added EEFT under ECTRIC's name and have also added a signature line for ECT Resources Limited.  Carol St. Clair has initialled.  I am also attaching the document should you need to change any signature lines.  The attached document cannot be edited but you can print and manually type in changes.  Once the agreement has been approved, please have an officer of both ECTRIC (EEFT) and ECT Resources Limited sign and return to us by fax.  Please fax a copy to the following fax numbers:
 
(713) 853-9576, attention Bill Bradford
(713) 646-3490, attention Carol St. Clair/Marie Heard
 
If Ted has any questions, Bill's phone number is (713) 853-3831 and Carol's number is (713) 853-3989. 
 
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving here in the States, so if Bill or Carol aren't in, just leave a voice mail as I'm sure they will be checking their messages.
 
Thanks so much for your help!
 
Marie

Tanya:
 
Goldman is pushing agressively toward execution of the Master Close-Out Agreement. So much so, that they have forwarded to me an executed counterpart signed by their three affiliates. I left you (and Carol) a voice mail a little while ago, please give me some guidance on this.
