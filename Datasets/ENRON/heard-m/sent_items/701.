Uh, oh!  It was sent to Peter in the interoffice pouch.  My assistant said she put it to go on Friday.  I sure hope you find it, cause it has original signatures.

Please let me know what you find out?

Thanks!

Marie

Huh?  I don't mean to sound so stupid, but I haven't received anything from you in the internal mail or by Fed Ex (or at least I don't remember).  With all the excitement around here the last few days, I could very well have forgotten I received them.  When did you send them?  I'll check my area just in case its beneath other stuff and let you know if I find anything.

Hi, Sharon!

Have you received my package with the original BP Amoco master netting agreements and, if so, have they been signed?

Thanks!

Marie
