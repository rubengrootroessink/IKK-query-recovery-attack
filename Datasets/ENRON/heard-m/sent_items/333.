Hi, Tanya!

Jay said that he has passed AK Steel along to you to look at.  I told him that I thought things were passed down the chain, not up and he said that when you are as good as he his, they are passed up the chain.  You may have something different to say about this.

Anyway, Chris Motley at AK is calling checking on the status of the ISDA.  We originally were going to have it signed, but when Samantha called Jay about initialling, he said Credit wanted to revisit the credit, so can you let me know the status so that I can tell Chris?

Thanks!

Marie
