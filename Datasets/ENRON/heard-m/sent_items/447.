Hi, David:

As you can see, I have forwarded the master agreement to Mr. Sill for execution.  When you receive the executed copies, please complete the notice information on the Schedule.  I'm sure Pat can assist in the technical contacts if you aren't familiar with them.  In addition, please initial both copies and have John Suttle initial both copies before they are signed by EBS Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd.  Upon execution, please forward one fully signed copy to Mr. Sill and forward the other original copy to me in Houston.

I am processing the original Enron Corp. guaranty and will forward it to Uecomm when I receive it back from Enron Corp. and receive confirmation from you that you have the master agreement as signed by Uecomm.

Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Marie
