OK, thanks, Marie.  Please let me know who I should contact in London for
that information.  I will add the other parties to the list.

Hi, Athena:

The Williams counterparties are:  Williams Energy Marketing & Trading
Company and Williams Refining & Marketing, L.L.C.  I don't know about
British Energy as that is being handled out of our London office.

The following entities have been added to our master netting agreement list
today:

Forest Oil:
Forest Oil Corporation
Producers Marketing Ltd.

Noble:
Noble Gas Marketing Inc.
Samedan Oil Corporation

Tractebel Energy Marketing, Inc.

My phone number is (713) 853-3907.

Thanks!

Marie

   Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks
   on
   two counterparties, we need to know exactly which Williams and British
   Energy Power and Energy Trading Limited entities/subsidiaries will be
   involved in the Master Netting Agreements.  Please let me know.  Also,
   going forward, we will need this type of information for any new
   counterparties added to the current list.  Thanks and please call with
   any
   questions.

   Best Regards,
   Athena

   P.S.  Please send me your telephone number.  Thanks!
