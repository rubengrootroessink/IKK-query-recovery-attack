Hi, Roeline:

We would prefer to sign the fee letter at the same time we sign the assignments.  Yes, we will sign enough originals of all documents so that all parties can have an original.

Hopefully we can get this wrapped up tomorrow, as I will be out of the office Friday.

Marie

Marie -

One more question - I received some of these in duplicate, and some of them
were original only.  Like the Termination Agreement that you just couriered
over to me - I only got one original from you, and there are two signatures.
We would like to have an original signature as well - so are we going to do
this after the fact?  That would be okay by me, because I want to have them
all signed and off my desk - so just let me know how you think we should do
this.

Thanks, Marie -
Roeline
