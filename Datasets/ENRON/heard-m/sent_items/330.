Tony:

Attached are forms of resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage agreements, together with a form of authorized traders list.  I don't know if Sara told you or not, but we typically require two signatories to open brokerage accounts.  Presently, our resolutions reflect Cassandra Schultz, Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control Group, a Division of Enron Corp. as being authorized, however, we have just learned that she hasn't been officially elected to this office, so in the interim, we will have Rick Buy be our second signature.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
