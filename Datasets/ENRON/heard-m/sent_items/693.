Hi, Marie.  I'm just faxing them to you now (65 pages), so keep an eye out for them!

Hi, Sharon!

I have a rush project.  Can you check on your end and send me any masters between ECC and Conoco Canada Limited and Gulf Canada Resources Limited?

We have to respond to Conoco by 2:00 p.m. (Houston time) today.

THANKS!!!!!

Marie
