Hi, Georgi!
 
In light of the NYMEX being closed last week, the 5 paralegals are involved in a project right now that is taking up our extra time, so we don't know when we would be able to get to this project.  Perhaps someone in your group could come to our area and copy these files.  Just let us know who and when they will be coming and we will help them locate the documents.
 
Thanks!
 
Marie

Importance: High


I have completed an audit comparing the financial agreements that are established in the Global Contract System against the executed agreements that are scanned in Livelink.  
 
I have identified the following counterparties as NOT having any agreements in Livelink.  Please check your files for any executed agreement on these counterparties and forward them to me for immediate processing.  Also, let me know if you are unable to locate any of these documents.
 
Your urgency in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks, Georgi
