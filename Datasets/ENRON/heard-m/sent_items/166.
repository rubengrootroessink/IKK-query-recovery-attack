Oh, please!  The exhibits should have been organized and conformed prior to execution.

So what was her beef if the copies were for our people?

I had my first know down drag out with our friend CLH.  We closed a Qwest deal last week (Monday 7:00 am, of course she was here all weekend working on it).  Anyway, everyone was needing copies of the closing documents and they were all over me for them.  So on Wednesday mid morning I went into her office and had Tim make copies.  She came back from a meeting and as she was passing by I mentioned it to her and she lost it - Big Time! Everyone wanted to hide, I motioned for her to go into her office because she was making a scene and I shut the door.  She kept going on and on and said that I should have went and got her out of her meeting (yeah right) instead of taking them off of her desk and to never ever take anything off of her desk again. What a piece of work!
