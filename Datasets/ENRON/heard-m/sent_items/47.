Hi, Max!

Francisco Pinto-Leite asked me to forward this draft to you to review the additional credit terms.  Please review the definition of "Independent Amount" on page 2 of Annex A and the definitions of "Base Volume" and "Incremental Volume" on pages 6 and 7 of Annex A and let us know if this is what you want, or please revise as you would like.

Thanks!

Marie
