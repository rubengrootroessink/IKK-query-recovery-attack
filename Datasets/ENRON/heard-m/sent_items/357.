Hi, Gennaro!

I'm trying to pull all these documents together so that we can have them re-executed and I noticed that the Euroclear single Pledgor Pledge Agreement attached is not the same version we signed.  The version we signed in RG500b(Pledgee's Representative version - 1998 Edition).  Do you have this version that you can send to me?

Thanks!
