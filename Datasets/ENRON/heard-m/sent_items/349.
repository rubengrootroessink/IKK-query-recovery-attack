Mr. Yaish:

At Sara Shackleton's request, I am attaching a blacklined draft of the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex, which reflect changes made to the 3/30/01 draft.  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.
