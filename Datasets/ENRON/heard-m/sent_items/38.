Marie,

Good afternoon.  I am trying to locate a copy of our current ISDA agreement
with Enron.  Could you please fax me a copy of this document.  It would be
styled as either Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, LP
or simply Cornerstone Propane, LP.  Thanks so much for assistance.
