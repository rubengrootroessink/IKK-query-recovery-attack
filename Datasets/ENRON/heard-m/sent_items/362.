We prepared resolutions regarding the opening of brokerage agreements (the ones dated 11/30/2000), which authorized Cassandra to be a second signatory, however, the problem arose when we tried to get Kate Cole in the Corporate Secretary's office to certify a certificate of incumbency for Cassandra.  Cassandra has never officially been elected to the office of Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control, a division of Enron Corp., so as far as the corporate records are concerned, she is not officially a Vice President.  This will be resolved at the Enron Corp. Board Meeting in August and her appointment will be retroactive to November 1, 2000.  Until such time as this has occurred, she cannot be a second signature on our brokerage documents.

Marie,
Just for clarification...
Last week you had said that Cassandra did not have authority to sign executing broker agreements.  Per the corporate datasheet, this authority was granted 11/30/2000.
thanks. sheila
 
11/30/2000 - Cassandra R. Schultz, VP of Risk Assessment and Control Group, a divsion of Enron Corp., appointed as authorized signatory for opening of
 brokerage accounts.
