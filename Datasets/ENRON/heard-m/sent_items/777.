Hi, Athena:

The Williams counterparties are:  Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company and Williams Refining & Marketing, L.L.C.  I don't know about British Energy as that is being handled out of our London office.

The following entities have been added to our master netting agreement list today:

Forest Oil:
Forest Oil Corporation
Producers Marketing Ltd.

Noble:
Noble Gas Marketing Inc.
Samedan Oil Corporation

Tractebel Energy Marketing, Inc.

My phone number is (713) 853-3907.

Thanks!

Marie

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need to know exactly which Williams and British
Energy Power and Energy Trading Limited entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements.  Please let me know.  Also,
going forward, we will need this type of information for any new
counterparties added to the current list.  Thanks and please call with any
questions.

Best Regards,
Athena

P.S.  Please send me your telephone number.  Thanks!
