Anthony:

Attached for your review are clean and blacklined copies of your form of assignment, which note our comments.  Please let me know if the attached changes are acceptable.

The only outstanding issue on our executing the new OSLA in favor of Morgan Stanley Securities Limited is our review of the Borrower's warranties which were not a part of the OSLA we executed with Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited.

Thanks!

Marie
