Ladies:
Hear is the final form of Schedules for Inland.  Please coordinate with Jack Falconi to have this executed (214)360-4892.  I have asked him if we can do it by fax since the traders have already done some replacement trades effective July 10, 2001.  Please keep me posted so I can let Tiffany Williams and others know when this and the Guarantees have been executed.  I will leave clement Abrams a voice mail message about the Enron Guaranty.
