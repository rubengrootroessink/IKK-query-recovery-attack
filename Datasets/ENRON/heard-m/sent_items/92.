Gordon:

Have you received a W8BEN tax form and/or a legal opinion from Nemak?  They are supposed to deliver these to us in connection with the signed ISDA Master Agreement, but I haven't seen them and before I contact them, I thought I'd check just to make sure you didn't receive them.

Thanks!

Marie
