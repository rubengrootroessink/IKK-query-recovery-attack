Susan:

Sara received this e-mail from First Union regarding the ISDA with Enron Corp.  Per Lotus Notes, you are working with Sara on this.  Is this something you can handle, or should it wait until Sara returns?

Thanks!

Marie

Sara,

Yes.  I explained your view on the CSA to our Credit department.  They're
still eager to put a bilateral CSA in place.  We believe it is mutually
beneficial as the credit lines would not be exhausted too soon if we could
set up a mark-to-market collateral arrangement between the parties.

Could you please reconsider.  Have you considered the removal of the
arbitration provision?

Vijay

	You were going to check with your credit group.  Do you have a
response
	(re: CSA)?  Sara
