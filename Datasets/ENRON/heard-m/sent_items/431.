Hi, Ken!

I just received a call from Chris Croom who wants to send an updated ISDA draft to Avery Dennison Corp.  Can we use the same credit, or do you want to revise it?  He said he was going to meet with the counterparty on Tuesday, so I'm sure he either wants them to get the draft before then or he will take it with him.

Thanks!

Marie
