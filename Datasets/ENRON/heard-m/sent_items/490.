Jay:

I responded to Adam and told him that our Credit Department was reviewing the comments and that I would check on the status.

Marie,

Just wondering if you could give me an update regarding the status of our
comments to the ISDA?  We have no place to get insistent, given the amount of
time it took us to compile our remarks.  Still, I'm sure everyone is eager to
get the issues resolved and the documents in place.

Thanks.

Adam Auten
