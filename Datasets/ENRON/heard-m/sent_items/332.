I hope to have the signed guaranty today.  All the Enron Corp. officers authorized to sign guaranties were out the latter part of last week, so the Legal Department was going to have to find someone today to sign the guaranties.  As soon as I receive it, I will fax it to you and send the original, together with the other documents to you by overnight courier.

Marie

Marie,

Can you give me an update? Let me know if the Guaranty was executed and if
on the way.
