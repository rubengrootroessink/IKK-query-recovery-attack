Here are the guidelines for an ECP.  Hope this helps.  If not, let me know.  Is there supposed to be bad news coming?

Marie,

   What is the threshold for an eligible contract participant for an entity?  Is it $5MM?  I have a New Zealand counterparty who would like to delete the eligible contract participant rep. 

  All here is pretty spooky - we are just waiting for the hammer to drop!
