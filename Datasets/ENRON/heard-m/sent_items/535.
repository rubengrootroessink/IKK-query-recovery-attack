Hi, Una:

Per my voice mail, we need a copy of a representative sample of whatever documentation BNP Paribas and Enron Metals Limited transact under (ISDA, general terms and conditions, etc.).  We are trying to finalize and sign a master netting agreement with them this morning and need to see this documentation as soon as possible.

My phone number is (713) 853-3907 and my fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!!!!!!!!!

Marie
