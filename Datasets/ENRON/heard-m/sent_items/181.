Jeff:

I have the documents ready to be signed in connection with opening the referenced account.  Can you assist me in getting them signed?  The officers who can sign are:

Any one of:

Mark Frevert
Ben Glisan
John Sherriff

together with any one of:

Rick Buy
Rick Carson

Since we don't know the ins and outs as to why we are opening this account for this entity, Sara suggested that you or someone in your shop contact one of the officers from each group to explain the account and ask them to sign the documents.

Once you have determined who will sign, let me know and I'll take care of routing them for signature and getting them to Bear Stearns.

Thanks for your help!

Marie
