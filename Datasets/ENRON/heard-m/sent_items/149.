Hi, Dianne:

Thanks for responding so quickly.  It seems that we will be scheduling the meeting for next week.  Are you available then?

Marie

Marie,

I am available anytime tomorrow afternoon or Friday afternoon.  If morning works best for everyone in Houston, just give me a call (6762) and I will try to rearrange my schedule.

Legal has been asked to review and approve all confirmation templates currently being used.  We would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the materials we will need for this review.

Will you advise me of your availability in the next few days so that we can schedule a meeting?  (Diane, I realize we will have to work around the one hour time difference between Houston and Calgary.)

Thanks!

Marie
