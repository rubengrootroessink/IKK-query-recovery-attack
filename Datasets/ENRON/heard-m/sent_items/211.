Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I am working on finalizing our comments to send back to AA today.

According to credit, the AA ISDA worksheet was sent back to legal last week. Have you seen it or are they throwing me off?
