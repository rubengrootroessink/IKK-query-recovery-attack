Importance:	High

Frank,

I was under the impression that this ISDA was done and ready to be signed
over a month ago.  The NAV information hads been discussed and provided
before ( I have outlined it again below).  Are there any other issues that
Enron believes are open or is this it?  Please let me know immediately if
there are any other issues, if not please forward the final version for
signatures.


	NAV:		Beginning Capital balance
	plus		Additions
	minus		Withdrawls
	plus/minus	net income
	equals	Ending Capital balance
	divided by 	number os shares owned
	equals	Unit Net Asset Value

Regards,

Jim

Jim, what we really need (which we have discussed before) is a
description of how you calculate Net Asset Value.  Thanks.  Frank
