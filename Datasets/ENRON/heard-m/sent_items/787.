Hi, Una:

Thanks for sending me those two ISDAs.  Hopefully, Edmund Cooper will be able to help us find the other document.

Again, thanks for your help.

Marie

Hi Marie,

I have found the 1st two but can't locate anything on the 3rd one.  Will need more detail to assist.

Hi, Una!

I don't know if you can help me or not, but I need the below agreements ASAP.  We have to finalize a master netting agreement and the lawyer over here needs to see the agreements.  If you are not the right person, will you forward my e-mail on?

Thanks!

Marie

Hi, Edmund!

Can you help me obtain copies of some of your executed documents with BNP?  I need copies of the following:

1.	ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA

2.	Enron Credit Limited/BNPP ISDA

3.	ECTD /BNPP physical UK gas confirm (representative sample)

I hope you know who ECTD is cause I sure don't.  I am only assuming that because it's UK gas, it's a UK company.

My fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!

Marie
