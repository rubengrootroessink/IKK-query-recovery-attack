Dear Dog Loving Friends,

We hope this letter finds its way to you - and to your hearts. Like the rest
of the nation, we've watched the events unfolding in NYC and Washington, DC
with disbelief, with horror, with sorrow.

Unfortunately, so often during a crisis, our loved pets can be forgotten or
unintentionally left to fend for themselves. Can you help us help them?

We are getting supplies of food, treats and dog boots for the rescue dogs
who need nourishment and protection for their paws while they work. The
rubble and steel can destroy and infect the pads of a dog's paw, rendering
them useless in their rescue work. The search dogs are working so hard to
locate and save human lives that they are wearing through their boots at a
rapid pace. We want to be sure they are protected.

Supplies of food and treats will also be donated to displaced dogs and other
pets whose owners cannot be there to care for them.

Please help. Mail your checks to:

The Gracie Foundation
1627 Main St., 7th Fl.
Kansas City, MO 64108

Or donate by credit card by calling 1-888-535-DOGS (3647) or 1-800-4-TREATS
(487-3287) Monday thru Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. CST.

Thank you in advance for any help whatsoever. No gift is too small. God
bless you and God bless our great country.

Dan and Mark
Founders of Three Dog Bakery
