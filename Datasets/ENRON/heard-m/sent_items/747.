Anne:

This is an e-mail I forwarded to Kevin Freeman on Monday sending the form of master netting agreement.  He left me a voice mail this morning and said that they wanted to get a mna in place ASAP.  Mary has assigned this counterparty to you.  Kevin's phone number is (785) 575-8128.  Will you call him to discuss?

Thanks!

Marie
