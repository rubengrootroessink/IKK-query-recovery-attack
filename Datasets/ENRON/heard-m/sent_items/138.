Texon Energy Corporation located in Stamford, CT appears to have no relation to Texon Corporation and/or its successor Texon L.P. which are both located here in Houston.  We have traded liquids in the past with Texon Corporation and Texon L.P. ; primarily crude oil.

Regards,
tm

Texon, L.P. looks like a liquids customer.  we do have a file. Marie, what type of "documents" are we supposed to be providing? Corp legal needs to be more specific or they can send someone down to copy our file. I do not show that we have a file for Lonestar.

Diane, Tanya and Jay:

We have been requested in connection with an SEC subpoena to produce documents related to the referenced counterparties (including their parents, successors, subsidiaries, related corporations, partnerships or professional associations, affiliates, principals, officers, directors, general or limited partners, associates, employees, agents, and independent contractors).  We have checked our Lotus Notes database and don't have a record for either of these entities.

Will you let me know if your groups have had any dealings with these two entities or know of a business person who has done business with either of these entities?  We MUST respond to Enron Corp. Legal by noon Thursday (10/4).

Thanks!

Marie
