Tom:

We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.

Apparently CSFB neglected to ask us to complete the attached corporate resolution when we executed the broker agreement.  If we could fill out and forward on that would be great.
