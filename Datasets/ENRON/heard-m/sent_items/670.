Mr. Giordano:

We have received the executed copies of the ISDA Master Agreements for the referenced counterparties, however, we still need to receive the supporting documentation set forth in my letters transmitting the execution copies to you.

For Catequil Partners, L.P., we need to receive items 1-5 set forth in my transmittal letter of 10/11/01 (copy attached).


		 

For Catequil Overseas Partners Ltd., we need to receive items 1-5 set forth in my transmittal letter of 10/11/01 (copy attached).

			 

We look forward to receiving these documents as soon as possible, so that we can close our files.  Thank you for your assistance and, should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Marie
