Thanks for the info.  I'll send it overnight to her and will copy you on my correspondence (with a copy of our comments).

Richard:

As you can see below, I just replied to Mark instead of forwarding to you.  Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I have turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I have completed finalizing the comments, but since AA sent their agreement in pdf (which cannot be edited), I have had to turn around a hard copy of our comments.  Can you give me a physical address where I can overnight our comments?

Thanks!

Marie

According to credit, the AA ISDA worksheet was sent back to legal last week. Have you seen it or are they throwing me off?
