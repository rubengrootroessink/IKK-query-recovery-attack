Jarrod:

I have checked our database and here is what I found:

Clorox - nothing has happened since you contacted them in May and they said they would send it in a few weeks.

Nestle - nothing since we sent them a revised draft in July, 1998.

Let us know if you want us to follow up with them.

We sent an ISDA to Clorox and Nestle USA and I was wondering if we have received anything from them.

Thanks,
