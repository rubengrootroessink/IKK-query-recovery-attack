Hi, Georgi:
 
We have an entry in our database that states that Energy West Incorporated did not change its name to Mercator Energy Incorporated.  There are two companies with the same name and this one is not the one that changed its name.  Our Energy West Incorporated is a Montana corporation.  The one that changed its name is a Colorado corporation.
 
Let me know if this is confusing.
 
Marie

Please check your records and let me know if you have any kind of documentation evidencing a merger indicating that Mercator Energy Incorporated merged with and into Energy West Incorporated?
 
I am unable to find anything to substantiate this information.
 
Thanks for your help.
