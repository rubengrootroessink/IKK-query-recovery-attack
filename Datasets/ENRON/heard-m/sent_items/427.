I don't blame you.  Obviously she's not dependable and her heart isn't in it, not to mention the fact that she doesn't know what she's doing and I don't think she wants to learn.  That was pretty obvious when I was training her--she never seemed to be interested in the job, otherwise she would have tried to learn all she could and would have at least taken some pride in her work.

Tracy made it in today - by 9:00.  What a surprise.  To tell you the truth, Marie, I'm not sure I want her doing any more of my stuff!

Attached for your further handling is the revised Master Agreement deleting the "eligible contract participant" rep.

Attached for your further handling are a clean and blacklined draft of the Master Agreement between Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd. and Uecomm Operations Pty Limited.  I blacklined my draft against the draft that David prepared since I didn't have a clean copy of Uecomm's comments.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Marie
