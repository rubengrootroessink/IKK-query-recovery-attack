Attached is the revised Annex B for the omnibus confirmation.

We have addressed the counterparty's concerns as follows:

1.	Annual vs. monthly financial statements - the annex provides for delivery of annual audited financial statements and quarterly unaudited financial statements.  It does not require delivery of monthly financial statements.

2.	We have revised Annex B to be 2- way, meaning that the provisions apply to both the counterparty and ENA.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Marie
