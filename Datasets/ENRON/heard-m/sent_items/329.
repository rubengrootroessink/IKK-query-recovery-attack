Joe:

Attached is the Annex B for each of Wexford Spectrum Investors LLC and Solitair Corp.  As I stated in my voicemail, please do not send these out until you get the okay from either Frank Sayre or me.  We are waiting to receive the underlying documentation from Caroline Abramo re eligibility, etc.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Marie
