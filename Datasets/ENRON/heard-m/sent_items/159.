  Marie,

  I have your fruit - we probably need to meet somewhere to do the transfer.  There are too many boxes to carry.  I gave Jane her fruit last Friday and we met in the parking lot on Dallas - across from the Allen Center Met Parking Garage.  I'll send you an invoice.

  I am not sure if the decorative center is open today - if so, do you want to go?
