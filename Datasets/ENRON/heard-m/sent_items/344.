Per our conversation, attached is the draft First Amendment to Master Agreement.  If these changes are acceptable to the counterparty, they can either sign two originals and send to us for signature or, we can sign first and then forward to them.  If they have any questions, they can call either Frank Sayre (x57894) or me (x33907).

Thanks!

Marie
