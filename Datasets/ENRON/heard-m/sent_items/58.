I still have not received any comments/feedback on the ISDA Schedule draft
forwarded to you on 7/27/01.  The last time we spoke, you said that you were
still waiting on some comments from your credit group.  I would very much
like to get the process moving again.  If there is something I can do to
expedite the process please let me know.  Also, please let me know if you
have tried to send something to me that hasn't gone through.  My email
address and phone number are below.
