Thanks!  If anyone should apologize for not responding in a timely fashion it should be me.  I'll work on preparing these documents and should have something to you soon.

	Dear Marie:

	I apologies for not responding in a timely fashion- I was out out of
the office for a few days last week

	I attach a sample form of corporate resolutions which Bear Stearns
typically requires in connection with accepting a guarantee of an account.
You may also want to talk to Clement Abrams of your office who provided
similar documentation in connection with an original guarantee.  I would
appreciate it if you could draft a notice of termination of the original
guarantee and I will get it signed for you.


 	Thanks and regards,

      Anna Meytina
