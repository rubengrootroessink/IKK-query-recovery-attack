Thanks -

Thanks Marie,

I'll have John email you as soon as he gets in, but Optus is rated A- and is about to be taken over by SingTel, which is AAA.

Is John Suttle okay with our providing this guaranty and in this amount?  Also, are you signing a master agreement or a short form confirmation?  I don't know if we can get this guaranty on such short notice, but we'll try.

marie, I suspect that would it probably cause problems to put a provision to review the value of the guaranty in the actual guaranty document. It would be fine to stick with the standard guaranty wording. We will sort something out with them here regarding a process to review of the value of the guaranty.

Marie,

We're down to the last item on signing a contract with Optus which would allow us to buy capacity from them in order to fill the circuit we sold to Uecomm (associated w/ the MSA).  They've requested a US$5 million parent guarantee from Enron Corp.  I don't know if this is standard, but they would like us to include some language that says we could review the amount in the future if needed.  But don't worry about this if it would slow things down.

Could you please arrange for a guarantee from Enron Corp?  How long does it take?  would it be possible to do it today (Wednesday)?  If we can get the guarantee and the contract executed by Thursday, Optus will have the circuit ready on Friday -- which is when our Customer needs it.

If you need any clarification, please feel free to call David Minns or me at any time.  My home number is 011-61-2-9360-1920.

Thanks

Pat
