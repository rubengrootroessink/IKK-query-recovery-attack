Who is responsible for paper/pulp issues?  Paper desk needs a draft confirmation to go out to the above counterparty.  It's an international deal...so we need it to be on a Deemed ISDA, however, we've always done our paper/pulp deals on an omnibus.  Can I get a Deemed ISDA template from one of you? Thanks.
