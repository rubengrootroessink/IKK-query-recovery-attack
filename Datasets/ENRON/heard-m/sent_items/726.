I will have the lawyer call John Sherriff.  Is Michael Brown around to sign if Sherriff won't?

Thanks!

Marie

John Sherriff will not sign off on this without a DASH or CACS.  Please have the responsible attorney call Sherriff to discuss. Thanks, Edmund

Paul:

Pursuant to my voice mail, Harlan Murphy is finalizing a Master Netting Agreement with Dynegy that is to be signed by ECTRIC and ECT Resources Limited.  It appears that John Sherriff is an officer of both entities.  Will you assist us in getting this document signed by initialling, if appropriate, and obtaining signatures and faxing a signed copy back to us at (713) 646-3490?

If you have any questions, please call eitherHarlan Murphy at (713) 345-2679 or Mary Cook at (713) 345-7732.

Thanks for your help!
