Charlie:

Attached for your further handling are drafts of the First Amendment to Master Agreement, together with a First Amendment to Guaranty in connection with the ENA/3TEC master agreement.  Please note that in addition to amending certain credit provisions, we are also amending the current setoff provision and also adding a provision regarding "severability".  If the attached drafts are acceptable, please let me know  and I'll process for execution.
