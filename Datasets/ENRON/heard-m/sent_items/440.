We are reviewing ISDA opinions to verify if a Hong Kong entity can enter into derivative transactions.  Once we confirm that they can, we will send the form Deemed ISDA to you.

I'm assuming at this point no...they just want to see a draft.

Who is responsible for paper/pulp issues?  Paper desk needs a draft confirmation to go out to the above counterparty.  It's an international deal...so we need it to be on a Deemed ISDA, however, we've always done our paper/pulp deals on an omnibus.  Can I get a Deemed ISDA template from one of you? Thanks.
