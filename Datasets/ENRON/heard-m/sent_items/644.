Yes, we do want to exchange originals.  My originals are in our Calgary office getting original signatures.  I will send one copy to you when I receive them back.  Should probably be tomorrow or Wednesday.

Thanks!

Marie

Carol and Marie:

I am assuming that Enron wants to exchange one set of originals on the NA
Master Agreement?  If so, please indicate by reply and I will mail a set to
Marie Heard.

Very truly yours,
