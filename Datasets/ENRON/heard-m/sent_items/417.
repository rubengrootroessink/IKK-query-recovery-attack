Yolanda:

In connection with the execution of the ISDA Master Agreement with GAF Refining LLC, Section 3 requires that they provide the following documentation:

1.	IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number)

2.	Certificate of Incumbency certifying (i) a true and correct copy of the certificate of organization or formation and operating agreement and (ii) the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of the sole member/manager of GAF Refining.

3.	Certificate of the Secretary/Assistant Secretary of GAF Refining certifying resolutions authorizing (i) the execution of the ISDA Master Agreement and (ii) the execution of energy price swap and option transactions.

I am attaching forms of the certificates listed as items 2 and 3 above.  If GAF needs the IRS W-9, they can go to their website at www.irs.gov and download a copy.

ENA will be providing a Certificate of Incumbency, certifying its articles of incorporation and bylaws and the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of ENA, together with a Certificate certifying resolutions as to its authority to enter into financial transactions and an IRS W-9.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
