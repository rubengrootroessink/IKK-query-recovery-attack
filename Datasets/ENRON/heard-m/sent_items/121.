Marie, - I would appreciate you sending me a copy of the Master ISDA
Agreement and associated Credit Support Annex between Enron and TXU.  The
Agreement is dated October 19, 1995 between Enron and Enserch.  TXU
acquired Enserch approximately 1-2 yrs. ago.  If you have any questions,
please call me at 214-875-9603.

If you could fax me a copy of it at 214-875-9063 I would appreciate it.


Thanks again for your assistance.
