I just spoke to Anne and we decided that we would suffer and go eat supper with you and Mama tomorrow night, so we guess we'll just see y'all at Mass and then decide where to go.

Good morning!  Maw and I are taking Poupee to PetSmart
tomorrow afternoon (2:00) to be groomed and will go to
Mama's half-price bookstore out on Frye Road, and
we'll be going to Mass at St. Cecilia's.  Will y'all
be there, too, and we can go eat supper after and
visit for a while?  Let me know if you can and if so,
we'll see y'all manana.      Me
