Certainly.  Do you mean that you want to see it before it goes out, or just to cc: you a copy?  It's all ready to go on my side,
I'm just waiting for them to book the annuity payment in the system.

Hi, Diane!

I just sent Gordon this e-mail asking him to send us a copy of the termination when sent to Grupo MINSA and received his "out of office" reply.  Will you or whoever prepares the termination send a copy to me?

Thanks!

Marie

A deal was closed yesterday, 7/17/01 with Grupo MINSA (deal #VG5833.3).  Please prepare a termination agreement (to replace the Deemed ISDA usually sent out as the confirm).

Thanks again--Veronica
