Hi, Nidia!

Per my voice mail, attached is the revised form of guaranty to add "Process Agent" section.  Please send this revised form to the counterparty asking that they use this form rather than the form of guaranty you sent them on Friday.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Marie
