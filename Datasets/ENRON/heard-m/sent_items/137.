She was going to revise the termination and bring it to me, but I haven't gotten it yet.

Hey Marie,

Did you ever get a revised confirm from Diane, Derek and I talked to her yesterday after I talked to you.  She said she would revise the confirm.

Thanks,
Russell

Hi, Roeline!

Attached for your review is a draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the assignments and terminations.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

Our Confirmation Desk is in the process of revising the termination of ENA Deal No. NL0619.1 to delete the fee reference, and I will forward it to you when ready.

Please let me know when you have signoff on the other documents and I will finalize and have executed by ENA and forward to you.

Thanks!

Marie
