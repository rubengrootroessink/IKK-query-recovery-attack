Barbara and Anne:

Below is an e-mail I sent to schedule a meeting with the confirm desks to discuss the materials we will need in order to start the review of the confirm templates.  Do you want to attend?  If so, I will notify you once I hear from everyone else as to their availability so that we can schedule a meeting that we all can attend.

Thanks!

Marie

Legal has been asked to review and approve all confirmation templates currently being used.  We would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the materials we will need for this review.

Will you advise me of your availability in the next few days so that we can schedule a meeting?  (Diane, I realize we will have to work around the one hour time difference between Houston and Calgary.)

Thanks!
