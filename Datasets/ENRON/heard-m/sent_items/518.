Cindy:

Has this guaranty been processed?  We've received the original signed master agreement from the counterparty and need to deliver the original Enron Corp. Guaranty.

Thanks!

Marie

Hi, Cindy:

I'm assisting EBS in some of their trading work for awhile, so this is why I am sending you the attached memo requesting an Enron Corp. Guaranty.

Please let me know when the guaranty is ready and I'll arrange for pick-up.

Thanks!

Marie
