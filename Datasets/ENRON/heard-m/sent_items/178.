Good Afternoon Marie,

Here is a list of inner company counterparties that require ISDA Master Agreements. I checked the Financial Trading Agreements listing in Lotus Notes to make sure an ISDA Master Agreement didn't already exist. Please double check your version in the event a counterparty was deleted as a result of the historical problem that we previously discussed regarding missing counterparty ISDA Master references.

Counterparty Name				Original Trade Date
Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona Ltee		04/04/01
ECT Europe Accounting				03/29/01
ECTRIC Crude					06/15/01

Enron Metals Commody Ltd.			03/20/01
Enron Metals Recycling GmbH & Co. KG		02/19/01 (Financial Trading Agreements states "Sent for execution")
