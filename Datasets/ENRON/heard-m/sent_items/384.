Ms. Bolton:

Pursuant to Derek Davies' request, I am attaching a draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  A full copy of the ISDA Master Agreement (preprinted forms and the below attachments) was sent by Federal Express to Ms. Marla Van Gelder on July 27.  Please let me know if you would like me to forward the preprinted forms to you or if you will be able to obtain the copy sent to Ms. Van Gelder.

Thank you for your assistance and, please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.  We look forward to hearing your comments.
