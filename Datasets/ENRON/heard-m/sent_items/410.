Rebecca:

I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts.  I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer.  Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp. likes their resolutions drafted than we are.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
