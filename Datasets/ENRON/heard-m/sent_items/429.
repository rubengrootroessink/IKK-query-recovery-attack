Marie,

I think  you were working on this ISDA, right?  Got a call from the marketer today and wanted to know the status. I informed him that legal was working on it but I can't remember where we left off.  I even looked in the Lotus Notes Database but couldn't find it listed.  Sorry to bug you with this!
