Hi, Kim:

Can you send me a representative copy of a confirm (with gtcs) for each of the following?

Physical gas with ENA Upstream Company LLC and Samedan Oil Corporation
Physical gas with ENA Upstream Company LLC and Forest Oil Corporation
Financial with ENA and Forest Oil Corporation

If you want to send them to "Justice" to print that will work for me.

Thanks!

Marie
