I only asked my assisant over here because she is so sweet and she would like a 10 lb. bag.  I guess we want to get some?  I don't remember what we've gotten in the past--20 lbs.?  Whatever you want to get is okay with me.\

Thanks!

Oops!  Just remember, maybe I'll check with Robbi if that's okay.

Yes folks, after a hiatus of 5 years I again have  pecans for sale.  They are ready for  immediate pickup. I am selling them in ten pound bags at only $1.80/pound.  They are inshell(not  cracked).
Compare prices  --Wal-Mart $2.88/pound and Kroger's $2.49/pound.  Quality guaranteed.
 
Remember they make  great gifts especially at Thanksgiving.  You can have them cracked at the  Farmers Market for about .25/pound.  Tell your friends but hurry  supplies are limited. I will keep a supply until December 1 and then I will  take what I have left to the wholesaler.
 
Help the poor  downtrodden farmer.  We have taken it on the chin the last couple of  years with the severe drought and heat that we have  experienced.
 
E-mail your orders  are call me at 254.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Farmer  Brown(alias)
