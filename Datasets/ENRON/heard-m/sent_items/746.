Jay:

Kevin Freeman (785/575-8128) at Western Resources left me a voice mail stating that they want to finalize the master netting agreement ASAP.  Mary Cook is assigning this to Anne Koehler to work on.  Will you send me a list of counterparties involved and agreements you show are in place?

Thanks!

Marie
