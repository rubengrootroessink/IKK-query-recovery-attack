Sounds great!  Sorry we won't be able to help move, unpack, babysit (or should I say "queensit") but unfortunately we'll be celebrating Anne's birthday (no, not her 34th!) the same day!  Hopefully we'll make it up your way next year to visit and most importantly, meet "The Queen".

Love,

Marie

Hi gang!
Hope all is well with you all.  Just thought I'd give you all an update on
our new home, that is if all the inspections go smoothly.  It's in Browns
Pt., 4602 41st St. to be exact, it's described as a super clean rambler, new
carpet, vaulted ceilings with fireplace in living room, kitchen has
nook,island, family rm, big fenced backyard which seems well landscaped to
my standards anyway.  It has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2 car garage w/ opener!
We'll be closer to family, friends,Steve's work & hopefully have a better
sense of community for Queen Isabel.  We're excited to say that we're just
outside Tuscany, which is where a beautiful community lies with $300k & up
homes.  Can't wait to have you all over to unpack, clean, paint, babysit &
mow the lawn, so mark your calendars for Nov. 30th! This is also Steve's
34th birthday, hmmmm I think I'll buy him a house, don't ruin the surprise.
Take care,
Jennifer
