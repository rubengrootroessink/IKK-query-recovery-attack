Shelia,

Gary Hickerson has given me approval to request that an equity trading relationship be established with Keefe, Bruyette and Woods for the financial services portfolio.  Keefe is a boutique investment bank that specializes in the financial services sector.  

The Keefe contact is noted below.  

Thanks for offering to coordinate this process.

Mike
