Subject:	ISI (International Strategy & Investement Group) Executing Broker Agreement

We are requesting an Executing Broker Agreement be put in place with ISI.  We are using for regional research coverage and order flow.  

ISI utilizes Bear Stearns for clearing services.  We are requesting for ECT Investments Inc. and will name GS, MSDW and BS as our clearing brokers.

Regards, Sheila
