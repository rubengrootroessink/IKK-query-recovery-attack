Marie - Veronica is on vacation this week, but we can still provide you with the current list.  AC, please call her and get her our most current list.

FYI, Donna Lowry's just recently out on maternity leave, but is still dedicated enough to be working out a transition of the maintenance of the authorized trader list to her group while she's out.  It's just tough this week due to her unexpected early delivery and Veronica's vacation. Please bear with us.

Veronica:

Have you had a chance to update the authorized trader list for ENA?  It is getting critical that we update it as we are getting requests from some of the brokerage firms for an updated list. 

Please either send me the changes to the list I sent you last week or just let me know the status.

Thanks!

Marie
