Subject:	Confirmed Worm Attack


The alert that we sent out yesterday was only half of what has now been confirmed as a "worm" attack. For those not familiar with the term, a worm is an attack program that automatically launches a new attack from each machine that it breaks into. This particular worm is attacking both Microsoft IIS servers (which we knew) and Sun Solaris systems.

The CERT advisory discussing the worm is attached below. The Solaris vulnerability is a bug that was discovered two years ago, and the patch has been available. Hopefully, very few of our systems will have this vulnerability, but two EBS servers that we are aware of have already been compromised.

Compromised Sun systems are used to launch further attacks and may be seen by others as Enron systems launching attacks. Please check immediately to ensure that all of your Internet facing servers have either had the patches installed or are not running the affected software.

We have contacted  the FBI to report these attacks. If you do discover any other compromised servers please make backups of all logs and files that may have been uploaded to the server. Please contact me if you have any questions at 713-853-9373.

Thanks,

CERT Advisory CA-2001-11 sadmind/IIS Worm

   Original release date: May 08, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history is at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Systems running unpatched versions of Microsoft IIS
     * Systems running unpatched versions of Solaris up to, and
       including, Solaris 7

Overview

   The CERT/CC has received reports of a new piece of self-propagating
   malicious code (referred to here as the sadmind/IIS worm). The worm
   uses two well-known vulnerabilities to compromise systems and deface
   web pages.

I. Description

   Based on preliminary analysis, the sadmind/IIS worm exploits a
   vulnerability in Solaris systems and subsequently installs software to
   attack Microsoft IIS web servers. In addition, it includes a component
   to propagate itself automatically to other vulnerable Solaris systems.
   It will add "+ +" to the .rhosts file in the root user's home
   directory. Finally, it will modify the index.html on the host Solaris
   system after compromising 2,000 IIS systems.

   To compromise the Solaris systems, the worm takes advantage of a
   two-year-old buffer overflow vulnerability in the Solstice sadmind
   program. For more information on this vulnerability, see

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/28934
          http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1999-16.html

   After successfully compromising the Solaris systems, it uses a
   seven-month-old vulnerability to compromise the IIS systems. For
   additional information about this vulnerability, see

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/111677

   Solaris systems that are successfully compromised via the worm exhibit
   the following characteristics:

     *

     * /dev/cub contains logs of compromised machines
     * /dev/cuc contains tools that the worm uses to operate and
       propagate

     Running processes of the scripts associated with the worm, such as
   the following:
     * /bin/sh /dev/cuc/sadmin.sh
     * /dev/cuc/grabbb -t 3 -a .yyy.yyy -b .xxx.xxx 111
     * /dev/cuc/grabbb -t 3 -a .yyy.yyy -b .xxx.xxx 80
     * /bin/sh /dev/cuc/uniattack.sh
     * /bin/sh /dev/cuc/time.sh
     * /usr/sbin/inetd -s /tmp/.f
     * /bin/sleep 300

   Microsoft IIS servers that are successfully compromised exhibit the
   following characteristics:

     * Modified web pages that read as follows:
                            fuck USA Government

II. Impact

   Solaris systems compromised by this worm are being used to scan and
   compromise other Solaris and IIS systems. IIS systems compromised by
   this worm can suffer modified web content.

   Intruders can use the vulnerabilities exploited by this worm to
   execute arbitrary code with root privileges on vulnerable Solaris
   systems, and arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
   IUSR_machinename account on vulnerable Windows systems.

   We are receiving reports of other activity, including one report of
   files being destroyed on the compromised Windows machine, rendering
   them unbootable. It is unclear at this time if this activity is
   directly related to this worm.

III. Solutions

Apply a patch from your vendor
