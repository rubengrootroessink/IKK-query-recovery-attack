Hi Stephanie,

I believe you helped me set up my EOL trading account (ADM26984) to trade the alberta hourly market and 
I was hoping you could enable me to have read only access to West Power, U.S. Gas, and Canadian
Gas products.  I can't seem to set up myQuotes for these under my ADM account and I can't run my old
readonly account and my ADM account at the same time.  

Thanks.

Cooper
