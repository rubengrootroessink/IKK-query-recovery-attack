Great.  Thanks for the info.  I'm happy to see you working on some analysis!  

We're working on a project for email alerts/notifications etc. which should be sweet when it's done - I think
this would be a good place for collaboration, although we're designing something fairly complex.  

also, a possibly very good solution to load/resource balance performance would be to use an OLAP backend.  
you should definitely consider this when you're working on things.  If you go to albertapower and select the 
Data Summaries (tabular) link you can go to some pivot tables we have on line which should give you some
idea of the speed gain from olap (it's a pain in the ass, but you have to add "http://albertapower" and "http://albertapower.enron.com"
to your "trusted sites" in the Tools->Internet Options->Security section.  you may also have to futz with the 
various settings under the "trusted sites" category.  if you take a look, but can't get past the errors, give me a call
and i'll walk you through it.

Hi Cooper,
I forgot to tell you, I did some FTR analysis back at the beginning of the year which was really interesting.  I also did some hydro flows analysis to forecast when the runoff would start picking up.  I did this by looking at previous years unregulated flows and average temperatures for Spokane and Kalispell and discovered that the flows increase dramatically approximately two months after the average temps reach above freezing on a continuous daily basis.  In addition to the Cal ISO OASIS conversion, I'm currently working on a webpage that will allow individuals to sign up for various e-mail alerts/notifications.  I'm also studying the load/resource balance and tweaking it to make it faster (i.e. through indexes, rewriting SQL code to promote optimization, etc.), more robust, and fully automated (through Perl and S-Plus).

Hi Maria,

can you give me a call when you have a chance?  I'm reviewing you and I wanted to 
make sure I had a comprehensive list of the projects you've been working on.  Not 
sure I have your right phone number.
