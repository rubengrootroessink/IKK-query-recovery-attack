i always urine the air

hey!  wow, now i'm really in debt - a *real* letter followed by an email!  I planned to 
write you back in vivo (rather than in silico), but you've shamed me into it.

i just talked to omar on sunday for awhile - haven't spoken to him in a long time and
it made me want to come to new york.  he was also pressuring me to come to the 
reunion, which i can't imagine doing, but are you going?  it would be fun to go back
- just a logistical pain in the ass.  

thanks for thinking of me.

it's turning into summer here now too, which is exciting, as much because the summer
is glorious as the winter is brutal.  i like canada alot.  very good people and i think i'm 
probably living in the least cool big city.  work is going well, but i don't enjoy the office
culture as much as portland, which is severly disappointing, considering that i spend
alot of time here.  still, it's not bad, just more normal/corporate.  

have you read any good books?  i sold my tv and now often find myself with the choice
of staring blankly at the wall or reading something.  more into page turners than great
works.  speaking of, i just read _kitchen confidential_, which deals with new york and also
served to make me want to visit.  you should be an actress for awhile and then write a book
about the wild and crazy life backstage.  

i heard you were in a play!  howz that?

coo-per

ok, first you made an appearance in my dream.
then i talked to KT last night (for the first time in, oh, four
months...), and she was telling me about daniella's wedding, and
hanging out with the likes of you.
so i was compelled to say hello.
she says you work hard, and play not enough.
which sounds not as much fun, but more practical, than playing hard and
not working enough.

i neither play hard NOR work hard.  what a disaster.

how are you?
i hope you're doing well.  i hope you're enjoying Calgary (!!).
new york is good.  now that it's warm, i feel sane.  able to walk
places and play frisbee.  the great thing about the east coast, as you
may recall, is that spring and summer feel like a reward for a job
well-done.  or done anyway.

that's it, that's all i've got.
but i was thinking of you, and wanted to say hi.
