Colin,

I left you a message at your hotel, but will try here as well.

give me a call when you get a chance

work 	403 974 6946
cell	403 512 3312

basically, the olap server is unresponsive (hangs IE when a cube is brought up)  and Chris
can't get a pulse using the OLAP manager.  We're contemplating rebooting the dev box, but
are afraid this will trigger the cube deletions we saw before.  any other tactics you can think 
of?

Cooper
