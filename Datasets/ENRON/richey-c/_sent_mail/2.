Hello Cooper,

I just granted CRichey, BGreeni & JZuffer access to Day Ahead Hourly Position.
Currently, Nikolay will enhance this program for SWAP & OPTION. We will notify you
as soon as it finished.

Thanks,
dluu

Duong,

just a reminder to enable CRichey and BGreeni to any apps (like day ahead hourly schedule)

also, if you can add swaps to the set of deals that day ahead hourly schedule summarizes, that
would make it useful here.  

Cooper
