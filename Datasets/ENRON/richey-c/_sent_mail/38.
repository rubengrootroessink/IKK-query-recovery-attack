Shelley, 

Please quote the following: 

Compaq Proliant DL360 in th following configuration: 
1 x Intel Pentium III 933 Mhz 
512 mb RAM (2x 256mb memory Sticks) 
2 x 9.1 GB Pluggable Universal Ultra2 SCSI Hard Drive 7200rpm 1" 


Apparently, these can be purchased from Compaq in Three packs.  You might want to quote that sku as well.  Please provide price and availability information.
