Tim,

I'll be in portland on Friday (18th) and the first half of Monday (21st).  Jeff asked me
to come down and help him with some California data issues and it seemed like a
visit was long overdue.   I hope to be able to sit down with you and show some of 
the work I've been doing up here.  The only specific issue I have is to get your feedback
on the hydro project we're working on, which is slowly coming together, but I'd like to give
you a general tour and talk about future direction.  Hopefully you're around and can squeeze 
me into your schedule.  

It's hard to believe I've been up here for 5 months!  

	Cooper
