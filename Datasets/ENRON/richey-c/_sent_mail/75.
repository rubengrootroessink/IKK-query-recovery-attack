Hi Kathy,

I was wondering if I could order an Enron Fleece through you.  They don't have them up here in Calgary
and I was hoping to pick one up when I was down in Portland last week, but it seems like you were mostly
stocked up for summer gear (no fleece).

Would it be possible to do this?

thanks,
Cooper
