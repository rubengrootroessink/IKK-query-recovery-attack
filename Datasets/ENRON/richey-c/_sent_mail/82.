Subject:	Missing 'Metered Volumes' data??

Hi Cooper,

Hope you had a good weekend. We were hoping to upload some metered volumes (from the Power Pool) today in to PETE. We appear to missing data (appears as '0' in PETE) for the following days:

May 10 , 11, 12, 14 and 22. 

Could you please re-scrape this data and give me call at ext. 6777 or fire back an e-mail when this data has been re-scraped.

Thanks alot,

Rob
