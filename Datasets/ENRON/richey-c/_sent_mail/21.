Bob,

we had the meeting today called your desk at 1pm PDX time with no answer.   not sure what went on there
because we also didn't get your voicemail.  

we'll have to catch up next week.

Didn't receive a call today.... you guys are probably just really busy.

Should we do it on Monday, or just wait until next Thursday?

Bob (and all),

let's postpone until tomorrow (or next week if you're not available) - no need to force the meeting.

can you do it tomorrow at the normal time?

Cooper

Calgary Gang -

I have a doctor's appointment this afternoon, and will be leaving a little early. Can we do this at 12:00 Portland time?
