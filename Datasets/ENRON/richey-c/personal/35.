cooper? is that you?

remember me? jules....you know, the housemate who used to tease you about
asking out the flowerstand gal?

i saw elliott mainzer a couple of days ago at a fundraiser for league of
conservation voters and was very happy to hear news of you. he told me you
moved to canada, that you've become a "super-analyst," and that you do a lot
of yoga. sounds pretty good, especially the yoga part. i started up again a
few months ago and feel so grateful for every class i take. i absolutely
love it. even jake is starting to go once in a while, when he can fit it in,
in between trying to finish up his dissertation and training for the
canadian ironman.

speaking of canada, which city are you in? anywhere near vancouver?

if this gets to you, let me know and i'll write more.

i hope all's well with you.

cheers,

jules


p.s. happy summer solstice. i hope you get the chance to get outside and
enjoy the long evening. i plan to celebrate by mountain-biking up and around
mt.tam.
