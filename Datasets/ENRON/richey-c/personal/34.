yeah! it IS you.

and alaska in july with rodney yee! i'm jealous. i haven't taken a class
with him, but many months ago i checked out some of his videos from the
public library. i don't use the videos anymore, given that i like going to
actual classes so much more, but it was a good way to ease back into
practicing. i would love to take a class with him. whenever i check the
schedule for piedmont yoga though, he's off in some far-flung place. maybe
i'll just have to do one of the workshops with him someday...when exactly is
the one in alaska?

here, i usually go to the mill valley yoga studio, which is close to my
house. there are 2 teachers there who i really like. they're very different,
which is part of what i like. one sounds like your portland teacher. the
other is more gentle. there's also another one who is such a lively spirit
that her classes are fun and invigorating, even if less focused or rigorous.

it sounds like you've gotten quite serious about yoga. do you practice every
day?

my brother scott (who i think you met once) also does a lot of yoga. now
that he's moved back here from new mexico, after a sad divorce, i'm always
trying to get him to talk with some of the cute, sexy women in the yoga
classes, but, like you, he's very  shy....

speaking of which, being "a fool" is a good thing in my book, if by that you
mean romantic and dreamy. but just remember, bold fools have more fun. do
you remember that borges poem i had on my desk? the one that started (in
translation): "if i had my life to live over again, i'd make more
mistakes..." and then there's goethe, who wrote the oft-quoted:  "whatever
you dream you can do, begin it. boldness has genuis, power and magic in it.
begin it now."

anyway...i'm babbling, as i'm prone to do. i'll write again soon and promise
to answer more of your questions (i.e. about my work, jake's activities,
etc.). in the meantime, i need to get back to work.

i will definitely stay in touch. we miss seeing you too. wouldn't it be
great to have dinner again at that old picnic table outside, overlooking a
garden in its prime? (to answer one more question, i do have a garden now, a
small one, but it's in shade much of the day, so it's full of flowers rather
than veggies. it's also got a large redwood and an inviting hammock
underneath. and this time, instead of lily the dog as frequent visitor, we
get oscar the cat).

keep watering those plants.

=)

love,

jules

Jules!

it's great to hear from you.  i sometimes wonder what you and jake are up
to - i'm happy you got in touch.

ahhhh, the flowergirl - she still brings a smile to my face.  (heh heh.
i'm still a fool, if you're wondering.)

I'm in Calgary - unfortunately not close to Vancouver. it is near banff
though, if you're coming up and have some time to spend.  is the ironman in
vancouver?  when?  sounds tough.

what are you up to?  What is WRHambrecht? financial?  are you still
editing? or writing?

Is Jake still working on New Mexico public land etc. for his dissertation?
wish i could have you guys over for dinner and catch up.  i make it down to
the bay area every once in awhile and will have to look you up next time.

yoga has been good!  i've been doing almost entirely ashtanga lately,
mostly because i haven't found a good teacher up here - i find ashtanga
very tolerant of mediocre teaching.  I found a great teacher in Portland -
I think you would have dug her as she reminds me of you, come to think of
it.  Not like any yoga I've taken in the past.  very hard.  she was a rock
climber and distilled classes into really difficult and subtlely spiritual
journeys.  we would try some really hard poses - like scorpion.  and
handstands with pushups while you're vertical.  lots of pranayama.  she was
one of these yogis who is 50 and looks like 30.  where are you taking yoga
down there?

remember rodney yee?  i'm going up to homer, alaska for a weekend retreat
in july with him.  i'm stoked.  probably spend a week up there, not sure
what i'm going to do.

i miss california.  it's a special place. i really miss the cheese board.
i learned alot from you and jake and wish i still saw you.

i like calgary.  it's sort of a man's town - like most midwestern towns. i
don't think i fit in particularly well, but...
not sure i would settle down here, but it's a pleasant place to spend some
time.  the winters are brutal and the summers are glorious.  unfortunately,
we had a really shitty ski season last year.  i had my hopes set on
learning to telemark, but it didn't work out.  canadians are great.  they
like to dis americans, but then who doesn't?

working at Enron has been good so far.  it's odd to look back at working at
the lab - i miss that time.  it would be especially fun to work there now
with all the focus on energy, although GW in the white house would make it
difficult.  like calgary, i'm not sure i'm comfortable settling down with
Enron, but it's been worthwhile so far - not at all what i expected.  when
i started, no one knew what pknow what is going on and what exactly these
corporations are up to.  i usedower trading was about and now that it's in
the news, even my mom wants to  to spend alot of time analyzing the
california power market and it was like watching a trainwreck in slow
motion.  i spend alot of time now staring at numbers.  kind of a weird
existence.  can't attach alot of meaning to it, but it's challenging and
satisfying.

well, it's great to hear from you after all this time.  do you have a
garden now?  i've never had a garden like the one we had up on maybeck.
i'm trying to grow some plants now, but it's tough in the middle of the
city.

keep in touch!  and say hi to jake for me.

cooper

   cooper? is that you?

   remember me? jules....you know, the housemate who used to tease you
   about
   asking out the flowerstand gal?

   i saw elliott mainzer a couple of days ago at a fundraiser for league of
   conservation voters and was very happy to hear news of you. he told me
   you
   moved to canada, that you've become a "super-analyst," and that you do a
   lot
   of yoga. sounds pretty good, especially the yoga part. i started up
   again a
   few months ago and feel so grateful for every class i take. i absolutely
   love it. even jake is starting to go once in a while, when he can fit it
   in,
   in between trying to finish up his dissertation and training for the
   canadian ironman.

   speaking of canada, which city are you in? anywhere near vancouver?

   if this gets to you, let me know and i'll write more.

   i hope all's well with you.

   cheers,

   jules


   p.s. happy summer solstice. i hope you get the chance to get outside and
   enjoy the long evening. i plan to celebrate by mountain-biking up and
   around
   mt.tam.
