Bottom line,

I do like you.  I enjoy the time we spend together but I do not get a good
feeling from you.  I do not get any vibe from you and that bothers me.  I am
not looking for someone to spend the night with and then not talk to after.
I need more than that.  I really do.  For me being intimate is not just a
passing thing.  I do not like how things have been since the night I stayed
at your place and I really thought that you would have wanted to be around a
little more.
Cooper I am not trying to make your decisions for you and I am not trying to
put words in your mouth and I apologize if it came across that way during
our conversation.  I want more than what we have right now and I am sorry if
I made you believe otherwise.  I wanted to see you tonight because it has
been a long time since last we were together but I am not going to play
second fiddle.  You knew we had plans, you have known for more than a week
and you could have declined your drink invitation or rescheduled for another
time.  I am not the type of person who likes to be squeezed into a schedule,
it does not work for me.
You can either write back to this email or give me a call sometime after
1:00 till then I will be in meetings.
