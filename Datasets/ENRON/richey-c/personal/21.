Hello Cooper,

Just a note to let you know that Cathy Simpson will be joining you and Tony
tomorrow morning.

Also Cooper, I forgot you yesterday, but would you please give me an idea of
the compensation level you are at now.

And if you have the names of the power schedulers I'd really appreciate you
letting me know who they are.

Regards,

Lindy Arnold
