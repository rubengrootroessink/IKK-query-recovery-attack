Hi
Just wanted to let you all know that Mike mailed some pictures of
Cameron to you guys yesterday.  Cooper--- I think you're mom told me
that you moved recently within your building.  I realized this this
morning and it probably went to your first apartment so you might be on
the lookout for yours.  Christie -- i think i only sent one wallet for
you, just let me know if you want another one for Mike, as I have plenty
left.   Anyway, i hope you all enjoy the additional pictures for your
"Cameron shrine" :)

take care,
Camille

PS--- Mike & I went to the driving range yesterday and I actually
enjoyed it!  Gripping a golf club is a strange sensation (to say the
least).  I actually hit the ball more times than I missed.  My left hand
was a little sore this morning.  My next email to everyone will be from
the LPGA tour (haha)
