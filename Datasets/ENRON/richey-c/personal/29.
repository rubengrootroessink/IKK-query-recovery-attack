place,

hallo.
i forgot to ask you about stalking margo.
details please.
i have vacation this week, so i shall pester you
frequently.  hard to believe we were once able to hang
out daily. :(  hard to believe how much time i wasted
with she who is named after a season. :( :(
a goo goo goo goo goo.
went biking again today.  my ass is on fire, as i
stand to write this email.
i was bunny hopping like mad.
only went through 3 back wheels.
a goo goo.
i am glad that you decided to move to massachusetts if
the job does not work out.  excellent choice.  i have
a list of yoga instructors for you.  zach colburn was
highly recommended if you are willing to start the
sessions with a little ahab, and then twist yourself
into the flat-break.  unconventional? yes.  results.
mmm... no.  GT is another option, so long as you allow
him to beat your unprotected arm with his stick while
you meditate.  "stay out of the crease"- WHACK! "stay
out of the crease"- WHACK! "stay out of the crease"-
WHACK!  mark fink is still another consideration, so
long as you have enough clothes to provide him and all
his friends.
anyway, have a good day my friend.
