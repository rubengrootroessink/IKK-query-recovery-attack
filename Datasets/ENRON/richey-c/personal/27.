Yay!  So glad you're still kicking up  there. Our number is 510-848-1919.
Life is pretty weird right now, but pretty good all things considered. No
big news yet in terms of moving, jobs, babies, etc. but I am working in a
brand new office, which I love, but I've lost some business because I'm not
working in North Berkeley anymore, and plus people are freaking out, and
plus they're hoarding their money, or whatever. But I love this new place so
much I just trust all will be well. All is well, really, even now. I'll save
the rest for later. Oh, I just spent the evening at Osento with Beth Maloney
and Rebecca Hill. Rebecca's getting married next week. I feel like I've
starting a trend... anyway, I'll save the rest for when we actually talk.
Love, Kate
