The gears are beginning to turn for  the 2002 Richey Cousin Reunion. Judith, Kathy & I have started planning  and at this point about the only thing we can confirm are dates in case any  of you need to put it on your work schedule. So the dates  are:
 
    Erie's Reunion is the 15th of July  through the 20th. 
Rodeo Nights July 16th  & 17th
    Bean  Night July 19th
 
The Richey Cousin Reunion will  cover July 18th through Sunday, July 21st. 
 
Linda Richey Graves has  graciously set aside Saturday evening, July 20th, for us to visit Cedar Crest.  Perhaps a block of rooms could be secured somewhere in Topeka for those that  would be flying out on Sunday and those wanting rooms could enjoy breakfast  together before departure. We will see what the response is for that  suggestion. So if any of you want to make flight reservation, perhaps this  information will help. Just keep this for future  reference.
 
Saturday, July 20th,  will be the busy day. If any of you have ideas for a family parade float, please  share them with us.  We have access to trailers if we know what we want to  do. Maybe The Richey's can win the Family Float  Prize. 
 
So please place these  dates on your calendar and make whatever plans that need to be done. We look  forward to seeing as many of you that can be here.
 
FYI: My email address is:  psrichey@terraworld.net  for easier  and faster communications. 
 
For the three of us, this  is
