   What up, man!

   Things have been extremely busy during the past 90 days or so.  We are
   preparing to deploy on 7 Jan.  I will be home with Tina from the 20th to
   the
   27th.  I guess Jimi is having an engagement party on the 21st.  I would
   love
   it if you could make it to that.  You will need to talk to Jim for
   details.

   Yes, I am engaged.  Crazy, huh?  It feels good though.  Tina and I are
   happy.  More to follow whence I see ya.

   I have to run, but just wanted to let you know I was hanging in there
   and
   doing well.

   Peace, Howie

   hey dude-

   i hear you're engaged!  congratulations.  what's going on?  i haven't
   been in touch with anyone in the last year or so...  things have been
   going well in canada, but my company is melting down, so not sure what
   i'm going to be doing and probably won't know for awhile.  i'm going to
   be home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you going to be around?  looking forward to
   catching up ...

   coop
