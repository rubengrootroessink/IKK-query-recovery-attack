Well I am in but not in.  I am going to Kelowna tonight and tomorrow but
will be in town Sunday to Tuesday but I will be out again till Friday.  I
know I am in next weekend.  From there on I am not too sure what is
happening but let me know if any of that works for you.
How was your holidays.  How are things at work or are you working right now
I heard a lot of people go laid off and others are still not steady.  I see
your address is still Enron.  Well let me know.

Always,
Corinna
