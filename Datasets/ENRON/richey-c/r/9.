Hi,

you have to use tapply().  A small example:

> region <- c("Atl", "Mount", "Atl")
> state <- c("NY", "AR", "WAS")
> pop <- c(1000, 100, 1000)
> d <- data.frame(region,state,pop)
	# note that region and state are coerced to factors by data.frame()
> tapply(d$pop, d$region, sum)
  Atl Mount
 2000   100

A very similar example was in ,,An introduction to R'' for version 1.1, I
think it is in the current version too.


best wishes,

Ott Toomet
