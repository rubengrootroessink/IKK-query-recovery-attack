Hi

I'm using some large datasets and I found the ROracle package to be of
great help.

If you have the chance to create a database in Oracle or MySQL with one
single table for your dataset, you can then use the ROracle package to
access the dataset. I found several advantages on that.

I don't import the data into my environment. I use a small function (see
below) to access the dataset and because the result is a data.frame you
can use it as usually.

Your environment will not be to large and you'll have the ram memory
less full.

It's easier to select subsets with SQL than S/R language.

Hope it helps

Regards

EJ

ora.fun <- function(){

        library(ROracle)
        m <- dbManager("Oracle")
        con <- dbConnect(m,user="user",password="password")
        dat <- quickSQL(con,"select ...")
        close(con)
        unload(m)
        dat

}
