Finally one I can answer!  (Thanks to those pointing out to me the
various docs in the "user contributed" section.  I'm on my way to
knowing how to use R & maybe even learning the statistics that didn't
quite soak in during my two stats classes).

Anyway, the short answer: "?Devices"

Choose a device, turn it on with a call like "png()", issue your
graphics commands & be sure to issue the dev.off() command when you're
done.  If you don't, your graphics file won't be complete (or might be
empty).

I hope this helps.
