You need match().
  match(New.df$component1,Nameandconc.df$name)
gives the row numbers in Nameandconc.df corresponding to the names of
component 1.

So
 Nameandconc.df$conc[match(New.df$component1,Nameandconc.df$name)]
gives the concentrations

and to do them all at once

apply(New.df, 2, function(this.component)
       Nameandconc.df$conc[match(this.component, Nameandconc.df$name)])
