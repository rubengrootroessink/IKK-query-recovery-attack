Hi Petr,
probably I don't understand correctly your question. However
you can write any function with several arguments (input variables) and
after use tapply. That is:

fn<-function(arg1, arg2, arg3, ....){....}
tapply(arg1, factor, fn, arg2, arg3,....)

Furthermore you can you the three dots "..." to pass any argument in the
functions in your fn()

Hope this helps you!
vito
