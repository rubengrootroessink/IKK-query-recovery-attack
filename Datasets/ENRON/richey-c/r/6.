Windows binaries for 1.4.1 are available at

http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin

and will mirror across CRAN over the next couple of days.

SetupR.exe in this release contains the grid and lattice packages.

These have been built on the same system as the second release of rw1040
and R-patched so I do not anticipate any problems but have only been able
to test them on Windows 2000.

This is a patch release, and the only Windows-specific change is to use
try() when updating HTML indices, e.g. from help.start() which also has a
new `update' argument to turn off updating if required.
