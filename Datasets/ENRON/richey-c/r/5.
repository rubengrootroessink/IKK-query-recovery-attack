Because of a lapsus on my side and then a problematic server
re-boot at just the wrong time,  the daily digest versions of the R mailing
lists (see the lower part of http://www.r-project.org/mail.html)
haven't been delivered in time, unfortunately.
I'm sending this message just *before* starting the digest
manually for today. I hope this won't happen anymore.

Apropos, I'd like to `advertize' the digest lists to all
R-help readers who feel they can't cope with the daily amount
of traffic anymore (should you rather use more than one mail
		    inbox, e.g. using procmail and/or emacs+Gnus?) :

To keep the volume low, I'd recommend subscribing to both
R-announce and R-help-digest.
