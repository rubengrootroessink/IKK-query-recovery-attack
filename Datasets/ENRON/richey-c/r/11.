We have removed from CRAN the seemingly faulty version of R 1.4.0 for
Windows and replaced it by the one I built on Dec 20 that is known to work
with grid and lattice.

I've built a SetupR-patched.exe today from the current R-patched sources
and with the latest versions of the recommended packages.  You might
prefer to change to that if you want to re-install: otherwise wait for
R 1.4.1 in a week or so.  As this is a snapshot, it is only minimally
tested.

These will propogate around CRAN in due course, but are available at
