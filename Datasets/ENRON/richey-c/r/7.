JSS, which is at http://www.jstatsoft.org, publishes statistical software
with manuals, as well as papers describing, comparing, and evaluating
statistical
software. Abstracts of all contributions accepted in JSS are published in
printed form in JCGS.

Although we publish software written in any language, we especially
welcome software written in R. The general idea is that packages written
in R can be documented in both "R News" and in JSS, but that generally
the
description in JSS will be more extensive and more seriously
peer-reviewed.
Everybody in the R community is encouraged to submit their R products
to JSS, we even welcome "code snippet" type of contributions (which will
go into a separate section of the journal).

Volume 7, 2002, consists so far of the following three issues

issue 1:
S. Weisberg
Dimension reduction regression in R.

issue 2:
A. Zeileis, F. Leisch, and K. Hornik
strucchange: an R package for testing for structural change
in linear regression models

issue 3:
G. Marsaglia and W.W. Tsang
Some difficult-to-pass tests of randomness.
