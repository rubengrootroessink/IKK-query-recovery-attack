See the "R for Windows FAQ", section 2.4, or ?Memory:

"(On Windows the --max-mem-size option sets the maximum memory
allocation: it has a minimum allowed value of 10M. This is intended to
catch attempts to allocate excessive amounts of memory which may cause
other processes to run out of resources. The default is the smaller of
the amount of physical RAM in the machine and 256Mb. See also
memory.limit.)"
