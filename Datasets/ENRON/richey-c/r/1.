You don't want the tree() command. You want the rpart() command in the
rpart package (which should be part of your R distribution).

For more background information there is a Mayo Clinic technical report
(#61) by the authors of rpart, available from
  http://www.mayo.edu/hsr/techrpt.html

It's also described in Venables & Ripley MASS, like most things.
