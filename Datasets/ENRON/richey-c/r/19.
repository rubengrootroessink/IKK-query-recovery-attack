[Last updated on: Sep 26 22:02 2000]

* public list for getting help on "R" (statistics environment ~ "GNU S") *

The purposes of the mailing list  "R-help"  include

- - Announcement about the development of R; availability of new code, etc.
- - Questions and Answers about problems and solutions using R.
- - Enhancements and patches to the source code and documentation of R.
- - Comparison with S / S-plus, compatibility.
- - Posting of nice examples, benchmarks, .....

The list has had
	516  (Jan  1, 2000)
	315  (Jan  1, 1999)
	205  (Jan 26, 1998)
	116  (Apr  1, 1997)
	 77  (Nov 14, 1996)
entries [persons or sub-lists] from all continents.

There are 3 mailing lists dedicated to "R" :

1) R-announce	: Only announcement of new versions / important patches
2) R-help	: Questions / Answers about ("released versions of") R
3) R-devel	: The list of pre-testers and "developers" of R.

where "R-announce" is gatewayed to "R-help",
i.e., if you are only interested in announcements on R,
you could rather subscribe to  R-announce  instead of  R-help.
