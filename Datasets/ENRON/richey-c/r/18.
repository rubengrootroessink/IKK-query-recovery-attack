 in case you don't already have it:

[Last updated on: Sep 26 22:02 2000]

* public list for ANNOUNCEments on "R" (statistics environment ~ "GNU S") *

The purpose of this mailing list "R-announce" is

		       Distribution of announcements
			about the development of R,
		      availability of new code, etc.

Therefore, "R-announce" should have less than one message per day,
typically rather only a few messages per month.

There are 3 mailing lists dedicated to "R" :

1) R-announce	: Only announcement of new versions / important patches
2) R-help	: Questions / Answers about ("released versions of") R
3) R-devel	: The list of pre-testers and "developers" of R.

where "R-announce" is gatewayed to "R-help",
i.e., if you are only interested in announcements on R,
you could rather subscribe to  R-announce  instead of  R-help.
