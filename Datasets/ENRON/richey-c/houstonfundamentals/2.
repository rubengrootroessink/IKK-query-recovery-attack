Firstly, your access to the Gas Message Board has been granted. 

Secondly, what charting tool are you using for your graphs, ie Annual Demand Growth etc?

Thanks
Colin

Just to let you guys know that we officially released Commodity Fundamentals to the Gas Trade floor. This site presents the Gas Traders with a single point of entry to ENA Gas, EGM, EIM and Research fundamentals information.

Please take a look, I would appreciate any comments/feedback. I understand that some of your traders are using the site to access Gas information.
