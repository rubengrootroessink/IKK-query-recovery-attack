Just to let you guys know that we officially released Commodity Fundamentals to the Gas Trade floor. This site presents the Gas Traders with a single point of entry to ENA Gas, EGM, EIM and Research fundamentals information.

Please take a look, I would appreciate any comments/feedback. I understand that some of your traders are using the site to access Gas information.
