Cooper,

So tell me how was you squash game?  Good I hope I have been so busy lately
but I did get a game in yesterday but late and I had to go to the police gym
with a friend cause I could not get a time at the Y but tonight I am playing
there and have a court already so that really works for me.  Well I hope you
are well and still able to meet up sometime.
Take care,
