Cooper-- I have been looking at the chassis for the  model we need to develop. it looks like we can expand (piggy back) the model AE  uses for the Snow & water supply forecasts. They only have reports for March  thru to August i.e. the period of the bulk of the runoff from snow and rain. We  would have to add the remainder of the year as well as the power plants. Will  fax ou a sketch of my proposed basic layout.
I have done some checking of the data in the May  2001 report e.g. reservoir volumes and average flows. They use the same data  base as TAU it appears. There are still a number of items in their model we have  to understand. But I think if we have an uninteruppted afternoon with you and  your trusty computer we can at least identify the areas we need to discuss with  John Taggart the AE mastermind of the program.
Will check to see if you have or can get the  necessary access that would be required in the next day or so. Could you devote  a free afternoon next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Stan
Please advise.
