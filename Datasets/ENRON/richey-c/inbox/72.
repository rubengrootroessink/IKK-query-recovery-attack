Barbara,

Attached for your convenience in forwarding material to Jon Koomey at LBNL
are two summary documents describing Optimal and its electric power
solutions, the Final Report on CEC-LBNL-Cal ISO Aempfast Technology
Evaluation Project, and two press releases.

I recommend you also encourage Jon to visit the Optimal web site at
www.otii.com, and to look at materials posted there (e.g., the speech to the
Commonwealth Club.

Thanks!

Cheers,

Rich
