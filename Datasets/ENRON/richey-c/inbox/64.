hi everone!
I'm trying to get a feel for who may be interested in a south lake tahoe ski
shindig. I looked into the place we rented 2 (?) years ago (when cooper flew
down from portland via reno on the snowiest day of the year) and it is
available as soon as March 8. Yeah, not that soon (maybe this will give the
sky a chance to bear snow). Between 12 people, 2 nights, a hottub,
fireplace, heavenly company, etc. it would cost about $40/person for the
weekend. Let me know what weekends on/after March 8 would work for you and
how many people including yourself may like to come.

let it snow let it snow let it snow!
