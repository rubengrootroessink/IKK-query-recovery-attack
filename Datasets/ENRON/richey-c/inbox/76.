Dear Enron Assignee,

As Enron Global Employee Services has previously indicated, arrangements
have been made with PricewaterhouseCoopers to continue expat/inpat tax
services for the 2000 and 2001 tax years.

As contact information may be changing over the next few months, please be
sure to provide the updated information to PwC.  We will be distributing
2001 tax data organizers via email and will require an active email
address.

Please send you updated contact information to
enron.houston.ias@us.pwcglobal.com

Kind Regards,

The PwC Enron Team
