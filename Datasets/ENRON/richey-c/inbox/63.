Hi Cooper!

Greetings from NYC, where instead of exploring this
fabulous city, I sit and write cover letters in my mad
dash to get some kind of work...you may be, if not now
soon, in the same position, no?  It is hard to tell
from all the news reports what is like for Enron
employees who have NOT been let go.  I squandered my
savings/reasonable vacation time visiting and helping
my sister with her new baby girl Lindsey in November.
Never before has such an exquisite, vivacious and
clever child lived!

I had no idea that you lived in Calgary. It is such a
beautiful area, as I remember from the one trip there
I took with my family when I was in high school. I
remember especially canoing on a torquoise (sp?) lake
in Banff ( our safety orange life jackets made a
splendid contrast to the water)  and clambering over
dazzling glaciers, later to learn that such activity
is not so safe. I have a friend who live in SF now but
is Quebequois, and wishes to know if you are looking
for friends/ girlfriend. If so, I imagine she has a
long list of buddies in your neck of the woods.

Make Ben respectable? That's quite a project. We are
in fact engaged to marry, and have been since April,
but can't seem to get motivated to plan the actual
event. I'm not much of a girl it seems when it comes
to bridal finery and preparations.

In an odd chance assembly of swatties a few weeks ago
I saw both Jeff Sugg and Nate Reed.  They both seem
not a day changed. Jeff was properly tired from his
theater job, and proceded to get baked and Nate was
enthusiastic to the point of being a bit frenetic.
Shades of Fell Street.

I'm off to yoga class now, the only thing that keeps
me from regressing into a fetal position when looking
for a job.
hope you are healthy and happy.
love elissa
