Hello from Utah! 
We just launched a new website for EPI -- check it out!  www.ecologyproject.org  
I have also (finally) settled into a home for the winter, just outside of Moab, Utah, in a town called Castle Valley.  The Colorado, Green, Dolores, and San Juan rivers are all close by so please come and spend some river time with us while we're here! 
My new contact info is below. 
Take care, and let me know how you're doing! 
Julie
