Jen, 
my flight gets into Oakland at 11 p.m. on Thursday night; we could meet up for drinks... somewhere. in the city or EBay, depending upon who else wants to join in the festivities, I guess. i gotta rise and shine early on Friday morn', tho. 
Tues. morning is also an option -- just prob. more difficult, unless you wanna play hookey from work, and we could meet at Abir's for coffee. 
any other takers for drinks on Feb. 14th ? come on, there must be some lonely hearts out thar'  :-)

hi everone! 
I'm trying to get a feel for who may be interested in a south lake 
tahoe 
ski 
shindig. I looked into the place we rented 2 (?) years ago (when cooper 
flew 
down from portland via reno on the snowiest day of the year) and it is 
available as soon as March 8. Yeah, not that soon (maybe this will give 
the 
sky a chance to bear snow). Between 12 people, 2 nights, a hottub, 
fireplace, heavenly company, etc. it would cost about $40/person for 
the 
weekend. Let me know what weekends on/after March 8 would work for you 
and 
how many people including yourself may like to come.  
let it snow let it snow let it snow!
