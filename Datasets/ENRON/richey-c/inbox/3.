Hey Cooper, 
What a great idea! Eze sounds much better than Emily.  I hope it's not to late to change my business cards.  "Eze the auditor" has a nice ring to it. 
Sounds like moving was a good time.  The worst part about moving is having to deal with the stuff still in boxes that you haven't unpacked from your previous move.  Most people throw it away,  but not me.  I, for some reason,  feel like I might need it someday,  yet I have no idea what I have in these mystery boxes.  I'm sure your movers loved the obstacle course to get to your place.  They probably thought it was some kind of joke.  Thanks for the moving stories,  they were entertaining.  I have a visual of your building manager...pure comedy!  So when are you guys having the big house warming/  hot tub party?  It would be a good chance to cash in on some more scooby doo paraphenelia and house warming gifts.  Speaking of Scooby doo,  I'm sure Jai is loving the scooby phone.  I can see him not answering it until after a couple rings just so he can get the whole show. 
How is the whole work out regime coming along??  It sounds like you have a balance in your life.  Work is going well,  because you get to trade again, and your working out.  How does it feel?  I am all about balance in life.  Although it might not seem like it from the little free time I have,  I have a balance. I'm going for runs at all hours of the late night/ early morning....just to keep things intersting!
I'm going to look into wine fest,  and I'll let you know.  Jill and I are trying to get some people together to paint pottery in the evening next week.  We thought it would be a good alternative to going for drinks.  That way we can grab coffee (preferably, from Starbucks) and chill while we creat masterpieces. Anyone who wants to come is welcome.  Doesn't that sound like fun?  I'm already looking foward to it!  I was thinking Tuesday?  You and Jai could make something for your new place!
I leave you with that.....and before I forget,  guess who's buying baby blue pants from banana this week?  We'll be super fly cool cats!!!

PS - where's my clip art you promised??  Jill isn't at work this week,  so I'm not getting any interesting e-mails from her.

I put in a call to the deloitte systems admin to have your email name 
changed to "Purtzki, Eze".  I hope you don't mind. 
I'm tired from moving.  Enron's moved me in the past and I'm used to just 
pointing and saying "that will go over there", etc.  and i spent all sunday 
night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good. 
i don't think you've ever seen my loft, but to get to it, you have to take 
the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another 
building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk 
across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this, 
I think they almost quit!  it was bad, but they did a great job.  I told 
one of them, "the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to 
this one" and he laughed and said "of course, you have the worst apartment 
i've ever moved".  poor guy.  that's the most entertaining tidbit i could 
come up with. 
you should meet the building manager in our new building.  he's a freak, 
but in a professional way.  he's already yelled at jai and i.  he sounds 
russian and says in a thick accent "if you vant to leeve here, you haf to 
obey da rrrulesss".  i hope you read that with a russian accent in your 
head.  he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen!  his wife is 
a piece of work as well. 
count me in for the wine fest.  if you pick up some tix, grab me one, or 
let me know where the website is, etc. 
i can't believe you've moved on from tubulars.  while tubulars does seem 
like the next big thing, oil and gas seems like a promising area to study.
