Cooper,  
 
Here is what we have planned so far. 
 
 
NACAL-POWERFS1
NACAL-SQWS001P
NACAL-SQWS001D
 
These servers are in use now and will stay with UBS
 
The three pixxa boxes will become Estate production servers. 
 
 
Thanks
 
Greg

Greg/Dan, 

now that things are firming up, can you give me a summary of what is happening to all of the servers purchased for trading decision support (i.e., fundamentals).  the ones i had to get zufferli to sign off on purchasing were power-fs1, nacal-sqws001p, nacal-sqws001d and the 3 pizza boxes.  i know there is some shuffling around now, but i'd like to know what the plan is for these in the short term and long term (either estate/ubs share, estate only, or ubs only). 

thanks, 
cooper
