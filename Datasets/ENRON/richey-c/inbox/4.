Do you have a strong interest in the applied statistics aspects of your field of specialty? Do you want to learn the following:
(1) The key concepts and model fitting methods of modern robust statistics,
(2) Automatic outlier detection ("data mining for outliers") with robust statistics,
(3) Selected hands-on computing exercises using the new S-PLUS Robust Library for robust statistical modeling and outlier detection.

If you answered yes to any of the above questions then this course is for you:


Dates:	March 18-19, 2002
City:	New York, NY
Course:	Robust Statistics and Data Mining for Outliers presented by Doug Martin
(full description: http://www.insightful.com/services/course.asp?CID=23)

This course will give you the ability to routinely carry out robust statistical model fitting and analysis based on basic robustness theory, and quickly compare the results with classical methods using highly informative visual displays.  The robust model fits will reveal the presence of outliers that have substantial distorting influence on the classical model fits, and whose existence are often not at all revealed by the classical fit.
