Dear Cooper Richey,

Thank you for your question:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
i have a number of scripts which produce images which i
automatically batch out.  over time, something happens and the background
of all graphs is turned into a crimson red.  i've been able to fix this by
reinstalling splus, but over time the problem reoccurs.  i know its
strange.  is there a way i can specifically define the background color to
solve this problem.  i use the same call to generate the graphsheet.


trellis.device(graphsheet,
			width = 8.0 ,
			height = 6.0 ,
			color.table =
"0,0,0|200,210,255|255,255,255|255,255,255|204,204,153|255,32,32|255,192,9
6|200,48,48|88,128,176|152,48,104|150,150,150|255,150,96|208,96,96|125,125
,125|255,136,88|125,125,125")

strip.background <- trellis.par.get("strip.background")
strip.background$col <- c(5,5,5,5,5,5,5)
trellis.par.set("strip.background",strip.background)
strip.shingle <- trellis.par.get("strip.shingle")
strip.shingle$col <-  c(5,5,5,5,5,5,5)
trellis.par.set("strip.shingle",strip.shingle)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When you get the red background, you could try running this code to fix the problem:

if ( guiGetPropertyValue("CompositeObject","",PropName="FillColor") ==
"Red")
{
	guiModifyDefaults("CompositeObject",FillColor="Transparent")
	guiModifyDefaults( "GraphSheet",
	TopOffset = "0.2",
	BottomOffset = "0.2",
	LeftOffset = "0.2",
	RightOffset = "0.2",
	HorizSpacing = "0.2",
	VerticalSpacing = "0.2")

}

If this does not work, deleting your _prefs directory will fix the problem and you will not need to reinstall Splus.  The _prefs directory stores your
user preferences, such as graph colors, default options, menu option specifications, etc.  In order to try and resolve this problem please try the following:  close S-Plus and open the Windows Explorer. Navigate to the directory containing your _prefs  directory.  It should be located in a path similar to:

        C:\Program Files\sp2000\users\<login name>\_prefs

Delete the _prefs directory. When you delete this directory, any user-defined menus and modified defaults will be deleted.  When you restart S-Plus, the defaults will be restored in this directory.  When restarting S-Plus you will receive a message that _data and/or _prefs cannot be found.  Click "OK" and the default _prefs will be created for you.

I hope this information helps!  Feel free to email support@insightful.com
should you have any future questions.

Regards,
Susan Rasch
