Hi Cooper,
How's it going up in Calgary?  How's the atmosphere in the office?  Sorry for the delayed reply, I was out on vacation time, gearing up for Thanksgiving :)  The login for Earthsat is still enron, but the password has been changed to vortmax.  I've attached an excel file with the hydro data that you requested.  Let me know if it's what you're looking for.  
Hope all is well with you,
- Maria
