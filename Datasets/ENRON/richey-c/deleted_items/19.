Oh, there appears to be a slight misunderstanding.  Produce Row is the
social meeting and the technical meeting will be at ONSITE! offices, half a

Someone asked me how to count to 10 in Perl:
push @A, $_ for reverse q.e...q.n.;for(@A){$_=unpack(q|c|,$_);@a=split//;
shift @a;shift @a if $a[$[]eq$[;$_=join q||,@a};print $_,$/for reverse @A
