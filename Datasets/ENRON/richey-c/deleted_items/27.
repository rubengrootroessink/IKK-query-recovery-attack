  I should probably have been able to figure this out, but ...

  I have a package with some C code in it that I've been cross-building on
my Linux machine to run under Windows.  I had it working under 1.3.1, but
it seems to have stopped with 1.4.1.  Building with a version of
i386-mingw32msv-gcc recently downloaded from Brian Ripley's Rtools page
(--version 2.95.2), under 1.4.1 on Linux, it works under 1.3.1 but fails
under 1.4.1. (The new version of i386-gcc I just downloaded dates back to
3 Sep 2000 according to the Page Info.  The previous version I was using
(which dated to 27 Apr 2000) and the new version give the same --version
information.)  The "Version"  tab on the DLL does correctly indicate it
was built for 1.4.1.

  Am I missing something stupid?  The Rtools page says the most current
version of mingw is based on gcc 2.95.3; does the cross-compiler need to
be updated?  (I'm not eager to, but I could try to assemble the
pieces and compile from source if I had to ...)

  I did find some information on cross-compiling at the bottom of the
MinGW FAQ list, I may pursue this if no-one has any brilliant ideas ...
(how many people are actually doing Linux/Windows cross-compiling?)

  thanks,
    Ben Bolker
