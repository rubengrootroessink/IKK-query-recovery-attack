You have to save your plots/figures in EPS format. EPS is basically the
same as PS (postscript), but it is a one-page document with a
"BoundingBox".

Example

In [R]:

Alternative 1: Generate the plot *first* and then the eps file
  ...
  plot(sin(1:10), pch="+")
  dev.print(device=postscript, "myFigure.eps",
            onefile=FALSE, horizontal=FALSE)
  ...

Alternative 2: Generate the eps file directly *without* opening a window.

  ...
  postscript(file="myFigure.eps", onefile=FALSE, horizontal=FALSE)
  plot(sin(1:10), pch="+")
  dev.off()
  ...


Note that the arguments 'onefile=FALSE, horizontal=FALSE' are important!
In the help for 'postscript' it also says that you "probably want to set
... paper = "special", but I never used this option and it has worked fine
for me without it (actually I don't know what it does).

In LaTeX:

  ...
  Bla bla see Figure~\ref{figMyFigure}.

  \begin{figure}[hbtp]
    \begin{center}
      % Scale the figure to have the height 80mm keeping
      % the width/height ratio.
      \resizebox{!}{80mm}{\includegraphics{myFigure.eps}}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The data used...}
    \label{figMyFigure} % <-- NOTE: After \caption!
  \end{figure}
  ...

This requires that you use "\usepackage{graphics}" or
"\usepackage{graphicx}" at the top your LaTeX document.

[This answer is a correction of my own answer in the "Re: [R] Latex
Question" thread from Dec 7, 2001:

  http://www.r-project.org/nocvs/mail/r-help/2001/6836.html

where I forgot the argument 'horizontal=FALSE'.]

Good luck!
