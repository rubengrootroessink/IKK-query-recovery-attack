Greetings.

I'm trying to replicate an analysis I did a few years ago, then in SPSS,
using the SPSS GLM command:

GLM
  n_diffpt  WITH age_i inc_i join_i work_i educ_i  give_i cs_i
  eff_i age_a inc_a join_a work_a educ_a give_a cs_a eff_a
  /METHOD = SSTYPE(3)
  /INTERCEPT = INCLUDE
  /PRINT  = PARAMETER ETASQ RSSCP GEF
  /CRITERIA = ALPHA(.05)
  /DESIGN =
        age_i*age_a inc_i*inc_a join_i*join_a work_i*work_a
          educ_i*educ_a give_i*give_a cs_i*cs_a eff_i*eff_a
        age_i inc_i join_i work_i educ_i give_i cs_i eff_i
        age_a inc_a join_a work_a educ_a give_a cs_a eff_a .

The results are consistent when run in SPSS; however, I tried the simple
version of recoding it in R (after using read.spss to bring in the data),
and got entirely different results. I'm assuming there are significant
differences in what I'm doing, but I can't find enough documentation of
the SPSS GLM procedure to figure out what. Can anyone offer insights?

The code I tried under R was:

glm.mean <- glm(N.DIFFPT ~ AGE.I + INC.I + JOIN.I + WORK.I + EDUC.I +
GIVE.I +
        CS.I + EFF.I + AGE.A + INC.A + JOIN.A + WORK.A + EDUC.A + GIVE.A +
        CS.A + EFF.A + AGE.I*AGE.A + INC.I*INC.A + JOIN.I*JOIN.A +
        WORK.I*WORK.A + EDUC.I*EDUC.A + GIVE.I*GIVE.A + CS.I*CS.A +
	EFF.I*EFF.A,
        data=acps.df)

Thanks in advance.
