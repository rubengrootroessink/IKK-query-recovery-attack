The answer is
 summary(g)$coef[,3:4]


The way to find out things like this is to use names() or str() to look at
the glm and summary.glm objects.
   summ<-summary(g)
   names(summ)
# I see a coefficients item. I wonder what it looks like
   summ$coefficients
# That looks familiar, it's the table of coefficients, std erros,
#p-values. I want the last two columns
   summ$coefficients[,3:4]
#Success

Or alternatively, read print.summary.glm() to see where it gets them from.
