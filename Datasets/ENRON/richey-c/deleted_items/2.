Dear Robert,

You can easily include R-generated pictures in Latex.
One easy way is to use the postscript() command and including
the picures in Latex using \usepackage{graphics} .

It?s as easy as \includegraphics{mygraphicsfile.ps} and you can even do
size customizing in Latex using some commands in this package. (Good
documentation included.)

Hope this helps,
detlef
