Generate .eps directly by using dev.copy2eps or from the menu on the
graphics window or by following the instructions in ?postscript.
No conversion should be needed.

That driver does work but is minimally-featured.  Not recommended.

It really is a simple task.  Use dev.copy2eps and then the graphicx
package in latex.  You give us no clue as to your problems, so it is
difficult to give any advice.
