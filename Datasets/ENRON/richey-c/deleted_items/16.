I'm going to pretend you didn't insult me by saying pico and you can pretend that I don't use vi.
Fair enough?

[time passes]

There, I updated the page.  Are you happy?  Did you enjoy nagging me?  Did adding to my life's
pressures bring you intense enjoyment?  If I didn't know better, I'd think you were my ex-wife.

Someone asked me how to count to 10 in Perl:
push@A,$_ for reverse q.e...q.n.;for(@A){$_=unpack(q|c|,$_);@a=split//;
shift@a;shift@a if $a[$[]eq$[;$_=join q||,@a};print $_,$/for reverse @A
