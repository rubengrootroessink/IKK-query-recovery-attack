evaluation licenses, or to purchase, see:
www.ActiveState.com/PDK

Registered users of previous versions can upgrade to Perl Dev Kit 4.0 for only
$79.95. To upgrade, see:
http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Download/Get.plex?id=PerlDevKit&upgrade=1

Perl Dev Kit 4.0 is also included with membership to ASPN Perl, the complete

** Important installation information **

Please note that you *must* uninstall any previous versions of Perl Dev Kit
before installing Perl Dev Kit 4.0. If older versions are present the
installation will not replace certain key files, despite appearing to complete
successfully.


** Patch available for PerlCtrl **

Earlier versions of the Perl Dev Kit contained a bug in the PerlCtrl component
that may result in deletion of the file system. This bug is not present in the
Perl Dev Kit 4.0 release.

Registered users of Perl Dev Kit 2.0 build 206 and up who do not wish to upgrade
at this time may obtain a free patch here:
http://downloads.ActiveState.com/Perl_Dev_Kit/patch/PerlCtrl.bin

The patch is a single file "perlctrl.bin" that replaces the file of the same
name in the \perl\bin directory.


Enjoy!
