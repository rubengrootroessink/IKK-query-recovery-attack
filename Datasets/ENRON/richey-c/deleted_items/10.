I'm running polr() and getting warning messages from glm.fit().  It seems
reasonable to use glm.control() to turn on the trace and follow what
glm.fit() does when called by polr(); or is it?

glm.control(maxit=10, trace=TRUE)
polr(act~., data=mm)

The glm.control() sets the trace TRUE, but there's no change in the output
from polr().

Many thanks in advance for any help/pointers.
