As some of you may already know, all Enron Canada Corp and Enron Direct employees will soon be migrated to Microsoft Outlook. The migration is set to take place during the week of June 4 - June 8. A schedule will be sent out as soon as we know the order / dates in which specific groups will be rolled to Outlook. This project will involve some preparation on our part as individuals, so please read the following information as soon as possible in order to be prepared for this event:

MAILBOX SIZE	

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - Users are automatically sent a warning from the System Administrator explaining that they are near their Mailbox limit.
Prohibit Send at 100 MB - Users are prevented from sending email, yet they can still receive internal and external messages. Users must reduce the size of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, etc. before they can send mail again.

INBOUND / OUTBOUND MAIL SIZE LIMITS

Inbound and outbound email messages will be limited to a size of 10 MB

DELETED ITEM RETENTION

Users will be able to recover deleted items from their mailbox as old as 8 days. Deleted items include email messages, folders, contacts, calendar entries, task, notes, journal entries and meeting notices.

ARCHIVING

Archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000

MIGRATION PREPARATION

*Clean your mailbox - Due to new space limitations on your mailbox, it is advisable to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages before migration. If you are at the 100 MB limit on the day of migration, you will not be able to send messages once you are on Outlook.

*Limits on Items Migrated - From the day of your migration, only 30 days of old mail will be migrated from your mailbox. This includes mail in your inbox and other folders. Calendar items dating back one year from the day of migration will be migrated. 

READ your email - This is very important. Watch your inbox for messages from the Outlook Migration Team explaining the migration process and what you need to do to insure a successful migration.

	Complete the Questionnaire - Provide us with the necessary information by completing the 	email survey

	Push Our Buttons - One of the emails you will receive form the Outlook Migration Team will 	require action on your part. As close to your date and time of migration, you will need to click a 	series of buttons within the email so your personal address book, journal entries and 	           	private folders will be converted and available to you in Outlook.

	Print the Outlook Web Access (OWA) Email - In the event you have been migrated and 	Outlook is not ready for use, you will be able to access 	your mail via your web browser (Internet 	Explorer 5). The final email you receive explains how to access OWA, so please PRINT this 	email and have it available the morning you are migrated.

Your patience and cooperation is much appreciated during this migration. We apologize ahead of time for any inconvenience this may cause during the process, and hope for a very successful, smooth transition. Training will be made available between June 4-June 7 to those who are not already familiar with Outlook. 

 Thanks everyone!
