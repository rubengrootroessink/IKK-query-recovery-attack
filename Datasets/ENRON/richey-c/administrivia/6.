Dear Employee:

Previously you were sent a letter regarding Open Enrollment for U.S. Expatriates for 2002 with an attachment for electing Spending Accounts for 2002.  Unfortunately, the version of the Spending Account Election Form you received previously is not user friendly. Please complete the revised attached form when enrolling in the Spending Accounts for 2002 and fax to me at (713) 646-9501.  The original should be returned to me by mail to the address below.

Thank you.

Linda Hallmark
