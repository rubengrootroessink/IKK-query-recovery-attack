yah, i'm looking forward to yoga.  i didn't do anything over break and was really looking forward to starting up my practice again and went several times as soon as i got back, but then i got sick, so ... i may try to take a nap this afternoon before yoga.  i'm very bad with directions.  i have the address at home and can call you with it, but basically, i go east on 12th Ave, turn right on (i think) 8th Street and then turn left on (i think) 24th Ave (there's an asian restaurant at this corner) and then it's up on the right side.  there's a big block of warehouse buildings.  it's a little complicated to find from here actually, maybe you should pick me up and we can go together?  

i don't really shop for "yoga clothes" partly out of some sort of philosophical resistance and also because the women's stuff is so much cooler than men's stuff that i don't want to bother.  

dude, that 6:00am yoga story is brutal!  YIM is going downhill - i don't think rockne can hold onto his good instrucors.  i hope core yoga stays solvent!

Hey Cooper, 
So are you getting ready for yoga tonight??  I'm really looking foward to it.  I haven't gone in over a week and I am having serious yoga withdrawl.  Did I tell you that I went, or I attempted to go,to a 6am yoga class at yoga in motion yesterday??  I psyched myself up to get up at 5:30am to go (which is extremly early when you start work at 8:30!) and the instructor never showed up.  So we all sat outside waiting. We all finally left and went home. So I got nothing accomplished.  I was tired,  but couldn't go back to sleep, and I didn't feel relaxed, as I usually do after a yoga practice.
Can you tell me where the Space is again???  I am meeting Jaimie after work at 5:30.  She has her car here,  so if you need a ride let me know.  I have to warn you...Jaimie is a brutal driver.  It's almost funny!
Not much luck finding yoga attire.  I have been to lululemon in Vancouver.  It's a super cool store.  Have you bought anything from there?  I regret that I didn't.....but now that I have internet access at work the possibilities are endless (not to mention, expensive!)
Enjoy the rest of your day!

   After spending that long opening a bank account,  I would have settled 
   for stashing my money under my matress.  My brother did that for a 
   while.  Ya,  he's different,  but cool. 
   I keep forgetting your American.  Your not a shitty american,  as long 
   as you don't believe we live in igloos,  your fine. 
   Did Jai forward you Ingrid's e-mail from this morning about her "awful 
   news?"  It's funny. 
   Jaimie wanted to go see a movie tonight.  We were thinking maybe royal 
   tannebaums.  I'm going to call her after my run because it's still up in 
   the air.  She wants to go find some yoga pants...what part of "naked 
   yoga" didn't she understand???!!!!  If we end up going to a movie we'll 
   call you guys or maybe you want to come shopping with us???  Isn't that 
   every guy's dream come true?

   agh.  i just spent 2.5 hours opening a bank account!  banking in this 
   country sucks.  i hate to be a shitty american and i do love canada, but 
   the banking system is brutal.  yeah, working for a law firm is sweet, i 
   see 
   the same perks here working for a management consulting firm.  i'm glad 
   you 
   briefed the ladies on the naked yoga, maybe janice could give us a demo. 
   are you watching the royal tennenbaums tonight?  we talked about it long 
   ago... and i do want to see it. 
   glad to see you are breaking in your email account.  -c

      Hey Cooper, 
      I remember you telling me your address,  so I really hope this is it. 
   I 
      guess I could call you,  but it's more fun to e-mail...especially at 
      work.  Deloitte just gave me a new laptop....the perks of working for 
   a 
      prestigious law firm!!!  Stephanie and I even got a dozen cookies 
   each 
      from Cookies by George yesterday.  It's  a good way to make friends 
   in 
      an office full of vultures (almost worse than Earls!). 
      Are you still going to yoga tomorrow??  So far,  Janice, Jaimie, 
      Stephanie and I are going.  I know it's alot of women.  But don't 
   worry, 
      I told them all about "naked yoga" and they're okay with it. 
      Next time I see you I'll give you that book,  Tuesdays with Morrie. 
   I 
      am almost done.  It's an amazing book.  It is simple,  but in it's 
      simplicity it is so profound.  Wow,  that might have been a little 
   too 
      deep for e-mail,  but you get the point.  It's an easy read.  Jai 
   should 
      probably read it too. 
      Hey,  how are your Scooby snacks???  Are you bringing them to work? 
   Are 
      the stickers plastered all over your apartment and car yet??  I sure 
      hope so. 
      Talk to you later, 
      Emily
