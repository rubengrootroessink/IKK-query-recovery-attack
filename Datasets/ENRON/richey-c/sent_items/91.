Hi Cooper!! 
Well, it's finally Friday!!!  I hope work is going well....I just glad I don't work for Arthur Andersen,  otherwise we probably wouldn't be allowed to e-mail each other.
YIM this weekend sounds great!  How about the 11:15 class tomorrow???  I am running at 9,  so I should be done in time for yoga.  I'll call Yani.  About tomorrow night,  it's not so much a wine and cheese, 
 but more of a mix any kind of drink that people want to drink.  Whatever you want to call it...it will be fun!! I'll talk to you tomorrow about directions to Jaimies and times etc.  
Yes,  I am working at Earls this weekend.  I am working Sunday night. Speaking of Earls,  I know how much you liked the gingerbread....but the feature dessert just changed to carrot cake!  You'll have to come in and try it.
I a going for drinks this afternoon with Stephanie, Jaimie, and Sandy(I think you met her on Saturday at Lucky).  I think we're going to Ceilis after work.  You should come for a drink...afterall,  a drink with friends is a perfect compliment to a long work week!
Emily

   Hey Cooper, 
   I don't know if I can make yoga tomorrow...I might have to work late. 
   But I'll have a better idea by tomorrow afternoon. 
   I'm glad that you liked Tuesday's with Morrie.  You can pass it along to 
   Jai.  I have promised that book to so many people,  so I just hope that 
   everyone reads it quickly so I can pass it along to the next!  The wine 
   party is still on for the weekend, and of course you are invited!  It 
   should be fun.  Alot of Earls people will be there but also alot of 
   other fun people.  We are all going to the Whiskey afterwards,  so tell 
   everyone to meet us there afterwards.  You can bring whoever you want to 
   the wine party.  Speaking of bringing someone...whatever happened to 
   that girl that you went on that date with, you know, the one who ordered 
   the crantini??  I hope that isn't getting to personal...but come on, you 
   can tell me, we're friends.  I promise I won't say anything.(even though 
   you may think I have a big mouth, I can actually keep a 
   secret...sometimes!!) 
   By the time you read this it will be Wednesday, so...Happy Hump 
   Day!(that was just too cheesy) 
   Emily
