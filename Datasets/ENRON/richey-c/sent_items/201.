i'd have to see them and they'd have to fit my shoes, but as long as the discount is in the 85-90% range, 
i'm cool with it.

I have a pair of shoe trees that are slightly too big for my shoes.  Do you
want a look.  I'd give them to you, but I need a pair myself, and I'm cheap.
I suggest some sort of sale whereby we both win.  I sell you the new shoe
trees for a discount (you win) and I use that money to finance my purchase
(in turn receiving a discount on that pair).  What do you say bitch?
