Hey Cooper, 
I don't know if I can make yoga tomorrow...I might have to work late.  But I'll have a better idea by tomorrow afternoon.
I'm glad that you liked Tuesday's with Morrie.  You can pass it along to Jai.  I have promised that book to so many people,  so I just hope that everyone reads it quickly so I can pass it along to the next!  The wine party is still on for the weekend, and of course you are invited!  It should be fun.  Alot of Earls people will be there but also alot of other fun people.  We are all going to the Whiskey afterwards,  so tell everyone to meet us there afterwards.  You can bring whoever you want to the wine party.  Speaking of bringing someone...whatever happened to that girl that you went on that date with, you know, the one who ordered the crantini??  I hope that isn't getting to personal...but come on, you can tell me, we're friends.  I promise I won't say anything.(even though you may think I have a big mouth, I can actually keep a secret...sometimes!!)
By the time you read this it will be Wednesday, so...Happy Hump Day!(that was just too cheesy) 
Emily
