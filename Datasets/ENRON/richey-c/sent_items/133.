After spending that long opening a bank account,  I would have settled for stashing my money under my matress.  My brother did that for a while.  Ya,  he's different,  but cool. 
I keep forgetting your American.  Your not a shitty american,  as long as you don't believe we live in igloos,  your fine.
Did Jai forward you Ingrid's e-mail from this morning about her "awful news?"  It's funny.  
Jaimie wanted to go see a movie tonight.  We were thinking maybe royal tannebaums.  I'm going to call her after my run because it's still up in the air.  She wants to go find some yoga pants...what part of "naked yoga" didn't she understand???!!!!  If we end up going to a movie we'll call you guys or maybe you want to come shopping with us???  Isn't that every guy's dream come true?

agh.  i just spent 2.5 hours opening a bank account!  banking in this 
country sucks.  i hate to be a shitty american and i do love canada, but 
the banking system is brutal.  yeah, working for a law firm is sweet, i see 
the same perks here working for a management consulting firm.  i'm glad you 
briefed the ladies on the naked yoga, maybe janice could give us a demo. 
are you watching the royal tennenbaums tonight?  we talked about it long 
ago... and i do want to see it. 
glad to see you are breaking in your email account.  -c

   Hey Cooper, 
   I remember you telling me your address,  so I really hope this is it.  I 
   guess I could call you,  but it's more fun to e-mail...especially at 
   work.  Deloitte just gave me a new laptop....the perks of working for a 
   prestigious law firm!!!  Stephanie and I even got a dozen cookies each 
   from Cookies by George yesterday.  It's  a good way to make friends in 
   an office full of vultures (almost worse than Earls!). 
   Are you still going to yoga tomorrow??  So far,  Janice, Jaimie, 
   Stephanie and I are going.  I know it's alot of women.  But don't worry, 
   I told them all about "naked yoga" and they're okay with it. 
   Next time I see you I'll give you that book,  Tuesdays with Morrie.  I 
   am almost done.  It's an amazing book.  It is simple,  but in it's 
   simplicity it is so profound.  Wow,  that might have been a little too 
   deep for e-mail,  but you get the point.  It's an easy read.  Jai should 
   probably read it too. 
   Hey,  how are your Scooby snacks???  Are you bringing them to work?  Are 
   the stickers plastered all over your apartment and car yet??  I sure 
   hope so. 
   Talk to you later, 
   Emily
