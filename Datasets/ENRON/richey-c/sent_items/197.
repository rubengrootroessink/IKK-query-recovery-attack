      i'd have to see them and they'd have to fit my shoes, but as long as
   the
      discount is in the 85-90% range,
      i'm cool with it.

         I have a pair of shoe trees that are slightly too big for my
   shoes.
      Do
         you
         want a look.  I'd give them to you, but I need a pair myself, and
   I'm
         cheap.
         I suggest some sort of sale whereby we both win.  I sell you the
   new
         shoe
         trees for a discount (you win) and I use that money to finance my
         purchase
         (in turn receiving a discount on that pair).  What do you say
   bitch?
