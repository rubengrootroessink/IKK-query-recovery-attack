Chris,


I need to get whatever access Greg and Colin had to AlbertaPower and AlbertaGas databases on dev and prod.

I may already have it, but I'm not sure, especially about the AlbertaGas database.  

basically, their accounts have been cleared from the network and I need to run things under my own account, 
rather than theirs.  

Also, on dev db, I need to admin rights as Colin had these to do some OLAP stuff.  I'm guessing you are not the
person to talk to about this?  

cooper
