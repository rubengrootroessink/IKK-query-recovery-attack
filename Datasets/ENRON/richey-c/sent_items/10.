You should be getting a call from Shaw Cable, today or tomorrow to arrange a
time with you to install the cable modem.
 FYI, I bought a used computer at Computer Outlet, and two months free
internet and installation came with the package.

Let me know if  you don't hear from shaw in the next day or so. Looks like
I'm going to be working downtown starting sometime this week, we should try
to get out for a coffee or bit to eat again.

Cheers, Greg
