Dude...this is unbelievable.  I started the banter on the bottom.  This is
with the girl that I'm supposed to go to lunch with today.

You don't have to apologize, I'm a pretty curious person myself.

I work from 8 to 5 and walk to work.  It takes me about 20 minutes.  I live
on 10th Street and 14th Ave.  Now it's your turn...

What time do you typically get off work?  And where do you live?  (Walk to
work?)  Sorry about all the personal questions, but I have a curious nature.
