Well, if Cooper or his group over there have any personal/desktop instances, I don't look after them.

Are there SQL Servers you do not look after?

The SQL Servers that I look after all have a password for the SA account.

Subject: New Distributed Denial of Service Program in the Wild 

A new denial of service worm program, - like "sadmind", "nimda", etc. - has been discovered by the staff of SecurityFocus. This new program attacks Microsoft SQL servers that do not have a password set on their administrator accounts (named "sa"). Strange as it may seem, I know from experience that we have had a number of SQL servers at Enron that would be vulnerable to this (i.e., they don't have passwords on their "sa" accounts).

I am running a scan now on port 1433 only (where SQL server runs) to try to identify all vulnerable servers we may have. I will be providing this list to Eddie Ray and the EEL IT Security team for coordination of the remediation work.

Details on the worm can be found at <http://www.securityfocus.com/> on the front page.
