hi jill,

ah, i don't think you'll get this until next week, but maybe you're checking your email on the road.  hope your course is fun.  

how was it to see your family.  i've had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around.  i feel like i'm back in high school when i'm back home, i think, or something like that.  

don't tease me, what did you do on sat night?  

work is going really well - finally feeling some pressure.  

hmm, i don't know anything about painting pottery, but i'm interested. i've done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile, but could be fun with the right group of people.  

talk to you soon,
cooper

Hey Cooper, 
I hope you had a good weekend.  Emmy said you guys met up after I left.  My Friday wasn't a particularly exciting one.  I went out with the family (a five hour ordeal, for some reason my family is an anomaly when it comes to food consumption.  It's like being in the land of the sloth people).  Then I went home and crashed.  I made up for it on Saturday, which I regretted when I had to be up at 7am to see my dad off at the airport.
So, how's work going?  I'm busy b/c I'm going to be out of the office until Friday.  Their sending me to this gas marketing course for three days.  The itinerary doesn't look particularly exciting but I don't have to be there until 8am and I'll be done around 4pm.  It's sad that this is exciting to me.
So, I hear we're painting pottery?!  Are you going to come?  I have to admit its something I've never even thought of trying before but sounds like fun.  I'm not a very artistic person but I figure its hard to screw up painting pots.  But, you never know.
Have a great rest of your day 
jill

try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and 
"appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're 
not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do 
with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy. 
fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, 
although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer? 

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term 
alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and 
investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, 
things are looking up. 

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they 
may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much. 

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was 
thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do 
you have a cell #?

   You know what the worst thing in the world is?  Having no work to do on 
   a Friday but being unable to leave for hours.  I've been here for three 
   months and this is the first day where I haven't been busy.  This is a 
   Type A's worst nightmare.  E-mail is my sole consolation. 
   So what do I do, you ask?  I'm in Gas Operations, the marketer's right 
   hand man.  I do logistics, volume and supply/demand analysis, 
   nominations, monitoring of accounts, damage control...you know, more or 
   less hold the company together.  What exactly do you do over there? 
   Everyone always sees Emmy at Banana Republic.  She's a staple there. 
   Where did you get eze from?  I'm sure she loves it.  She never gets very 
   flattering nick names. 
   Well, I'm going to take off for lunch.  What time were you thinking of 
   coming down for drinks? 
   Talk to you soon 
   Jill

     hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three 
     neurons firing in my brain this morning... 

     i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia 
     for 
     christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket 
     on?" 
     and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition 
     to 
     being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost 
     every 
     day. 

     let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up 
     with 
     you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in. 

     i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a 
     small 
     town! 

     hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway? 

     cooper

        Good morning Cooper! 
        I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still 
     refusing 
        to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
        No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are 
     in 
        town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've 
     gone 
        soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
        colder people in my life. 
        Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
        You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
        I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
        part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing 
     most 
        of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
        tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming? 
        Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
        Jill
