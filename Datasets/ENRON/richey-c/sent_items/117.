i'm glad you made it to yoga last night.  how did you think the space compares to YIM?  don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings...  they're very different and i'm always surprised when people prefer something like YIM, but yoga tastes vary widely.  i thought last night's class was excellent and i'm glad we all got to go.  i'm not sure why jai goes to yoga - i've been to a few classes with him and it's always the same deep frustration with poses, but ...  

yah, the jump thru to seated is fun, eh?  last night i was playing around with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not be able to jump thru smoothly.  once you do it once you can do it forever.  also fun is to do the reverse - i think the mechanics are easier on the reverse and then you'll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly.

ian's email is indeed ian.cooke@enron.com

ceilis could be fun tomorrow.  let me know when you go.  this week has gone by quickly.  i can understand how you didn't see the scooby stickers on my car because it was dark, but what about the one on my forehead last night?
