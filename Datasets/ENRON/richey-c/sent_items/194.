Coop,

I was actually meaning to get in touch to see how things were going for you
after the big fallout. I will be in town at least until the end of the year.
Things are going well. Living good, getting in shape(dropped 50 lbs.), still
at Callisma(shaky), and got a girlfriend(going on 5 months). Looking forward
to seeing you over the holidays.

great to catch up on life.

uncertain
at this point ...  i'm sure you've seen what's going on with enron.
