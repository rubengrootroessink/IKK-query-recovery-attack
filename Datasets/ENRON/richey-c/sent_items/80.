hey emily,

don't think i can make yoga tonight - i went climbing last night and inflamed some tendonitis i have in my arm so i'm going to chill out for a few days.  however, i have made plans to see the royal t's with dorland tonight - so here's a look if you haven't already seen it.  

and to respond to your earlier email (i can't keep up):
the meeting i had on sunday was fine - it's always good to see what else is out there.  

the pipe and casing industry sounds fascinating - i can't wait until you're an expert and you can hold forth on the intricacies over some earls carrot cake.  and speaking of earls desserts, anything would be better than the gingerbread cake.  also, has earls updated the propaganda on the left hand side of the menu, specifically the "featured ingredients" section?  

not sure when you're going to get this, actually.  

oh, i'm going to a wine tasting at the double mo cafe on thursday night if you/jamie are interested.  do you interested in wine?  my friend craig's wife owns the cafe which is near the university.  i always have fun when i go, so give it some thought if you like wine.  i think it's going to be a new zealand/australian theme.
