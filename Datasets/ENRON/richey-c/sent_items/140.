dear elissa-

it's great to hear from you and i'm pleased you thought of my on your christmas list.  it seems like we started to get in touch awhile ago and then i think i dropped the ball.  oops.  i hope you are well and happy new year to you too.  i am still working for Enron, a company you have perhaps read about in the news recently.  things are ok with that for the moment, but i don't really know what's in my future.  probly know more soon.  i live in calgary (did you know?) and have for the last year or so.  i like canada very much.  much more than i expected, although it is very cold here.  mostly the people i like, especially but not limited to all the comely young women.  

are you still in NC?  are you going to make Ben a respectable man anytime soon?  

i got back from almost three weeks vacation yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that, since i do very little all day.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  

i wish you had sent one of those genero-grams in your holiday card so i would know what you're up to.  send a note when you get a chance.  

also, if you can think of it, reply to trycooper@hotmail.com as i'm better at keeping in touch from home.  

one big hug,
cooper

Apparently I'm not the brightest bulb in the
chandelier this morning.
