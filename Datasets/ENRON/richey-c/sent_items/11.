eze:

I put in a call to the deloitte systems admin to have your email name changed to "Purtzki, Eze".  I hope you don't mind.  

I'm tired from moving.  Enron's moved me in the past and I'm used to just pointing and saying "that will go over there", etc.  and i spent all sunday night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good.  i don't think you've ever seen my loft, but to get to it, you have to take the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this, I think they almost quit!  it was bad, but they did a great job.  I told one of them, "the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to this one" and he laughed and said "of course, you have the worst apartment i've ever moved".  poor guy.  that's the most entertaining tidbit i could come up with.  

you should meet the building manager in our new building.  he's a freak, but in a professional way.  he's already yelled at jai and i.  he sounds russian and says in a thick accent "if you vant to leeve here, you haf to obey da rrrulesss".  i hope you read that with a russian accent in your head.  he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen!  his wife is a piece of work as well.  

count me in for the wine fest.  if you pick up some tix, grab me one, or let me know where the website is, etc.    

i can't believe you've moved on from tubulars.  while tubulars does seem like the next big thing, oil and gas seems like a promising area to study.
