hi Jill,

i'm glad you had fun last night and we should definitely do it again.  

I may stop by ceili's on the way home, but might also go home to bed.  undecided at the moment.  if i don't stop by, can i take a raincheck?  

i'm sure i'll see you soon either way.  

Cooper

Hey Cooper, 
I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine tasting last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured Calgary hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon.
Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be done until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then.
Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest of your day. 
Jill
