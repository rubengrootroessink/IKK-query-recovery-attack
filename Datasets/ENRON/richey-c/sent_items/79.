All:

I'm attempting to use lattice on windows 2000 under R 1.4.

Rgui and Rterm crash when I invoke "xyplot" or "trellis.device" commands (including the oft-used "quakes" example)

In particular, I get a message box from the windows OS with the following text:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Rgui.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows.  
You will need to restart the program.  

An error log is being generated
--------------------------------------------------------------------

this seems to happen right after the graphics window is spawned. 

I'm using lattice version 0.4-0 and grid version 0.5

am I missing some sort of prep work for lattice graphics?

thanks any help,
Cooper
