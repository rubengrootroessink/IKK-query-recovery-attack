brenda was a test.  stratego failed.  this email is yet more evidence.  

the fact that stratego was not aggressively machinating does not impress me in the least.  

the fact that you are still representing makes me sad.  

asking for props?  please, dude, the depths of your selfishness have yet to be established.  

don't treat me like a fool or one of your bitches.  take a moment and peer inside - that tinge of guilt?  that's what i'm talking about.

in any case, i don't plan on claiming anyone again.

Dude,

Do you know how hard it was for Stratego to lay off this email and not start
machinating on it.  A few props every now and then would be appreciated.

      I was cleaning out my inbox and forgot that Brenda had sent me these.
      She's
      hot.  The game she's talking about here was the game that I was at in
      the
      box.  Didn't see here there.

      Hey Jai,
      Now that I look back at these pictures I kind of look like a loser.
      But, oh

      well.  I'm going to the game on Sat.  I won tickets through Molson
      Canadian!!  I'm pretty pumped!  It's the game against Anaheim.  Isn't
      that
      the one that you were talking about?
      Well, have a great day!
      Brenda
