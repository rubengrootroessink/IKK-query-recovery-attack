hey,

i don't have your phone number at work.  i have some bad news - i'll be flying out 3 days 
later than i told you before.  either my booking got screwed up or i never booked the flight!
i think it got lost on the internet some where, but i can't even remember what airline it was
on, so it's impossible for me to check!  just booked a one week flight and i'll be coming 
out on the 19th.  i'm still going to take the days off from work and relax in calgary a little,
which is good.  

by the way, if you haven't already gotten me something, i thought of a xmas present.  
a squash raquet.  lots of people play here and i'm looking to get into it.   

number here is 403 974 6946 if you want to chat.  

love,
coop
