what up... let me know when you are getting into town so we can hook up. by the way, would your parents be interested in dropping by for a drink on Friday evening?  mike's parents and my parents are going to be coming by a little earlier, then we're going to kick them out and and get wasted - just kidding.  anyway, it looks like mara, quang, tasha, jeff, etc. are all coming over, should be pretty fun.  see ya
