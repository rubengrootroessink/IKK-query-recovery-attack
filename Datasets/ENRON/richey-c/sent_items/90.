are you in the office today?  yoga tomorrow sounds great.  i went last night to a beginner YIM class with a friend from work who wanted to check it out.  it was crowded - are the w/e classes the same/better/worse?  i somehow always try to show up early to yoga but never manage to, but YIM may leave me no choice.  i feel like i'm in san francisco three years ago the way yoga is taking off here.  i love carrot cake.  ceilis sounds good - i'll see you there.  i like how you send each email with a takeaway thought.  i'm actually busy this morning, but wanted to reply sorry for the sound bites -- see you after work.  - c -

Hi Cooper!! 
Well, it's finally Friday!!!  I hope work is going well....I just glad I don't work for Arthur Andersen,  otherwise we probably wouldn't be allowed to e-mail each other.
YIM this weekend sounds great!  How about the 11:15 class tomorrow???  I am running at 9,  so I should be done in time for yoga.  I'll call Yani.  About tomorrow night,  it's not so much a wine and cheese, 
 but more of a mix any kind of drink that people want to drink.  Whatever you want to call it...it will be fun!! I'll talk to you tomorrow about directions to Jaimies and times etc.  
Yes,  I am working at Earls this weekend.  I am working Sunday night. Speaking of Earls,  I know how much you liked the gingerbread....but the feature dessert just changed to carrot cake!  You'll have to come in and try it.
I a going for drinks this afternoon with Stephanie, Jaimie, and Sandy(I think you met her on Saturday at Lucky).  I think we're going to Ceilis after work.  You should come for a drink...afterall,  a drink with friends is a perfect compliment to a long work week!
