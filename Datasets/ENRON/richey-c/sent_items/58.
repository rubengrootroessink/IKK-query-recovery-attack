I was cleaning out my inbox and forgot that Brenda had sent me these.  She's
hot.  The game she's talking about here was the game that I was at in the
box.  Didn't see here there.

Hey Jai,
Now that I look back at these pictures I kind of look like a loser.  But, oh

well.  I'm going to the game on Sat.  I won tickets through Molson
Canadian!!  I'm pretty pumped!  It's the game against Anaheim.  Isn't that
the one that you were talking about?
Well, have a great day!
Brenda
