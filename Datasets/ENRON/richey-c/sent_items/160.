Cooper:

Did you say shopping?????  My eyes lit up as I read it accross the screen.  (Just kidding).  That sounds great.  I made some progress on the X-mas list on Friday, but still have some to go.  How about a combo - shopping + dinner OR shopping + drinks?  I am working with my research assistant today trying to get my data ready for input.  I forgot to recharge my cell battery - so if I am not home when you call, I will call you back.

Nicki.
