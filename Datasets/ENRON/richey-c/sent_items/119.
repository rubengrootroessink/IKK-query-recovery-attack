hey craig,

happy new year.  thanks for forwarding me this - i'm investigating all career opportunities at the moment.  i hope you've been out skiing the last few days, it looks like its been puking.  i've been sick the last few days :(  first time in a year or so.  had a great break and i'm back taking care of all the little things waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operation.  we'll see ... 

hey, do you want to go to stronghold sometime?  be good to catch up.  i don't think i'm going to be healthy this week, but if you're interested next week would work.  i don't know how much time you're spending in calgary these days.  

cooper
