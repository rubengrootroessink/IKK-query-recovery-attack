Subject:	Be a Tour Guide in the Yucatan

Hi all,
wanna spend the winter leading eco-tours in the yucatan? check this out.

Background
CESiaK is located on the Caribbean Coast of Mexico, near the Mayan Ruins
of Tulum, south of Cancun. Still under development, the center is a small
ecotourism and education center that will serve as a model for sustainable
development in sensitive tropical ecosystems. The revenue generated
through tours and various on-site activities is used to fund conservation
and education programs within the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve. The Center
operates using ecologically responsible technologies, including systems
for wetland waste management, rainwater collection, and solar and wind
energy generation. It also focuses on community development, educational
outreach programs, turtle conservation programs, and biological research,
including propagation and  revegetation of native plants. CESiaK provides
a model for other sustainable development projects as well as an
informational resource for the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve.

Eco-Tourism Guide Position
At CESiaK we currently offer an all-day, educational, sight-seeing boat
tour through the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve and a shorter sunset tour
emphasizing bird-watching.

Highlights of the Tour include:
? Following the Mayan trade route used 1200 years ago
? Seeing abundant flora and fauna unique to Sian Ka'an
? Visiting unexcavated Mayan ruins hidden within the Reserve
? Floating down a freshwater river and swimming in natural sink-holes
? Learning the natural and Mayan history of the Reserve with experienced
guides

The primary responsibility of the tour guide is to lead these tours and
educate tourists about the unique diversity of ecosystems, flora, and
fauna found within the Reserve. Other responsibilities include preparing
food coolers for the tours, communicating problems with tour equipment,
and driving and maintaining the two tour vans. Depending on qualifications
and interest, the guide would also work with other staff members to carry
out other programs undertaken by CESiaK.


Qualifications
The ideal candidate would have an undergraduate or graduate degree in
biology or environmental science, as well as an interest and understanding
of general socio-economic issues of Latin America, including Mayan culture
and history. However, all candidates with a strong interest in learning
will certainly be considered. Once hired, the guide will be thoroughly
trained to lead the tours. Because in many senses the tour guide is the
face of the organization, it is crucial to have proven exemplary
communication skills, command of the Spanish language, an independent
motivation to self-manage the broad responsibilities of the tours, and a
dedication to conservation.
