Hi,

I work at Enron as a power trader and Gary Hagerty asked me to forward any prospects for a "junior power risk management" position at Epcor onto you. 

Michael Wong worked for us on booking the Sundance B PPA position and was let go soon after this was sold to TransCanada/Altagas and if you're still looking for someone, he would be worth investigating.  

Regards,
Cooper Richey
