that motherboard does look sweet!  why the scsi drives though?  personally, i want to find a RAID card that can handle RAID5 (everything i've seen is 0,1,or 0+1) and then link up a bunch of smallish IDE drives - if the controller is good, you don't need super fast and expensive drives, so you get speed and redundancy.  as i look at hardware, i can't believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware - it's amazing.  as for parts, what do you think about ordering from the cheapest U.S. source and paying duty?   

coffee or lunch would be great.  supposed to be big news about the enron auction today, but things are very slow and i'm more or less available any time - whenever you're next in town, give me a buzz, or if you're looking for a reason to come into town, how about tuesday or wednesday -- lunch or an afternoon coffee?

 We have delayed our trip to France, AGAIN! Janet threatened to divorce me if we don't go on a holiday soon, but she never follows through with her threats. Promises, promises.

Hardware... I'm in the process of building the ultimate server, myself. Check out the new Tyan S2466 motherboard. Sweeeet!. This with, a couple of AMD MP 1900+ processors and SCSI 15000 RPM U160 drives, this should be the ultimate. Hooked on the other end of the pipe to one of the servers at enron, it should push back so hard that those old Compaqs sream for mercy.

I'm shopping for hardware all over, really just out of the Computer Paper and by dropping into a couple of computer stores here and there. Memory Express, OA Group all have good prices, but I can probably get even better prices from a small computer shop out here in Cochrane. He'll order it in for me and I can negotiate with him.

How was everything back East. Hope you had a good time and got all caught on rest, relaxation and visiting.

I'm getting bushed sitting at home learning all the .net crap and am always anxious to get out for coffee or lunch. Let me know if we can catch a coffee sometime.

Greg
