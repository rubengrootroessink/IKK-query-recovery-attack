hey dude-

i hear you're engaged!  congratulations.  what's going on?  i haven't been in touch with anyone in the last year or so...  things have been going well in canada, but my company is melting down, so not sure what i'm going to be doing and probably won't know for awhile.  i'm going to be home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you going to be around?  looking forward to catching up ...
