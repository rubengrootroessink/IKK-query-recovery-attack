eze:  its at 7:30 and its usually $20.  all the money gets spent on the wine, so its a good deal.  its extremely casual and it would be great to see jill again. as for jamie, brokering is a slimy business and its hard to see how she fits in, but then i don't know her that well.  didn't see royal t's... i went home and went to bed (i'm sick! yuck).  dorland is chris dorland and a guy i sit next to at work.  he was there on saturday night.  i'm sure you'll run into him again.  i'll let craig know you are thinking of coming.

I know you have had a hard time keeping up to my e-mails,  but I don't blame you.  We have a solid 2 to 1 ratio.  Not bad.  I talked to Jill last night and she wants to go to the wine tasting on Thursday.  What time is it at???  It sounds like fun.  Is it casual?  I haven't talked to Jaimie about it yet.  She has been going on dates with potential clients.  Funny,  I didn't know you could use those two words in the same sentence!  She never ceases to amaze me (that's what I like about her!).
How was royal t's?  Who's dorland?? 
Sorry about all the questions.  
See you on Thursday!
