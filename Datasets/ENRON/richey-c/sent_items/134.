agh.  i just spent 2.5 hours opening a bank account!  banking in this country sucks.  i hate to be a shitty american and i do love canada, but the banking system is brutal.  yeah, working for a law firm is sweet, i see the same perks here working for a management consulting firm.  i'm glad you briefed the ladies on the naked yoga, maybe janice could give us a demo.  are you watching the royal tennenbaums tonight?  we talked about it long ago... and i do want to see it.  

glad to see you are breaking in your email account.  -c

Hey Cooper, 
I remember you telling me your address,  so I really hope this is it.  I guess I could call you,  but it's more fun to e-mail...especially at work.  Deloitte just gave me a new laptop....the perks of working for a prestigious law firm!!!  Stephanie and I even got a dozen cookies each from Cookies by George yesterday.  It's  a good way to make friends in an office full of vultures (almost worse than Earls!).  
Are you still going to yoga tomorrow??  So far,  Janice, Jaimie,  Stephanie and I are going.  I know it's alot of women.  But don't worry, I told them all about "naked yoga" and they're okay with it.  
Next time I see you I'll give you that book,  Tuesdays with Morrie.  I am almost done.  It's an amazing book.  It is simple,  but in it's simplicity it is so profound.  Wow,  that might have been a little too deep for e-mail,  but you get the point.  It's an easy read.  Jai should probably read it too.
Hey,  how are your Scooby snacks???  Are you bringing them to work?  Are the stickers plastered all over your apartment and car yet??  I sure hope so.
Talk to you later, 
Emily
