   How did the workout go for you today?  Mine wasn't so good.  Lot's of
   distractions, people on the equipment I wanted to use.  You know how it
   goes.  I was thinking about the Eau Claire classification, and I think
   where you live counts as Eau Claire.  I don't know what else it would
   be.  So you like your place, do you.  Why don't you tell me about it.
   If you're too busy, don't worry about it.  No boss for me means I have
   plenty of time to bother people with emails.
