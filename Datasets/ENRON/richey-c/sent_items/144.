hey nicki-

i got back yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  

i hope you had a relaxing break and are feeling productive again.

p.s. my sister-in-law really liked her sweater and it fit perfectly.
