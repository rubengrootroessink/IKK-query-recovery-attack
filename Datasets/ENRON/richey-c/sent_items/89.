at some point, you will stop demonizing emily and re-realize how cool she is, bitch.

here's your chance to get out with your rep intact, you can blame everything on the "complexity"

i would make it clean though, none of your half-assed bullshit.

Jai,
I haven't written you a long e-mail ina while, so I thought it was about
time - just for old times sake!
I guess there is also something I wanted to say...so here goes.
When we first started e-mailing and hanging out,  you were alot of fun
(well, you still are),  and I thought it was the beginning of a friendship.
Then after a short time,  I realized that there was more.  I just went with
it and went with what I thought felt right.  Recently,  for me at least,
everyone seems have involved themselves in a simple situation ,  making
everything more complicated and confusing (I guess this is my payback for
being such a big mouth/ gossiper about everyone else).

Now,  everything just seems weird.
 What happened to that "waitress/ customer" bond we once had???....(I
thought I would throw that last part in here to lighten the mood of this
e-mail).

Everything just happened so quickly,  that looking back it's hard to believe
that all this happened in a month.  I guess why I'm writing you this is to
let you know that I think your an amazing person,  and someone that I
consider a friend.  At the same time,  this friendship is not anything that
I'm going to force.

I'm not expecting a response from this e-mail and I'm not asking for
anything.  I just wanted to let you know where I was coming from.  What
better way to do it then over e-mail - afterall,  isn't that how this all
started?

Emily
