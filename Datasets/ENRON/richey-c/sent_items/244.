gotcha.  hood river would be a sweet place to live for awhile.  

alberta's great.  getting very cold here, but it's been puking in the mountains, so i'm looking forward
to getting out skiing, etc.  with the nosedive enron is taking, it's easy to blow out of work and head
to banff.  

alberta just built a 40MW wind farm (doubling wind capacity in the region) with more on the way.  should
be over 1% of installed capacity for the region soon.  

have fun in mejico.

nope, I figure you've been busy, and I haven't actually had time to start
working on it.  I am heading down to mexico in a couple of weeks to
interview on a wind/solar/eco-design project down there. Relocation to
P-town tentatively planned for next summer. There are a number of
interesting projects on windpower in the hood river region that I am
investigating.  we'll see how that works out.

how'z alberta?
