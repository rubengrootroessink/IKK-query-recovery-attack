 Just got off the phone with Colin, I pointed him at the code and gave him a short discussion of how the excel vba and dll work. He is going to investigate how things work and get back to me with any questions. Everything should be go to go into production with on the code, so he should not have anything to work on around this code.

Dinner is still on tomorrow. Just head out highway 1A (crowchild trail). After the end of the city, the highway will be a divided highway for about 12km, where it changes to a single lane highway. Keep goiung down that for about 3.5km. At about that time you should see a large radio transmission tower. Just past the radio tower you will see the GlenEagles sign on the south side of the highway. This is Gleneagles Drive. Take Gleneagles Dr. About 1 km down this road you will see a road to your left, go past this and take the next turn (about 1/3 of a mile) which is Gleneagles Blvd. This road is about 150yd long and and then turn to your left which will put you on Gleneagles View. Go to the end of this road about 1/3 of a mile and it will come to a tee. Turn left , you are on Gleneagles Terrace, we are the third house on your right 131 Gleneagles Terrace.

Things should start to happen about 5:00. Just bring your appetite.

Cheers, Greg
