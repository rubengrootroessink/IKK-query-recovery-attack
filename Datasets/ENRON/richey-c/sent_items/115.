   Hi Jai,

   I'm in the middle of one of the most incredibly busy weeks I've ever
   had.
   But I couldn't possibly forget the guy who wore one of the most unique
   and
   enticing shirts I've ever seen...(we met last Saturday)

   Thought you might like to meet for lunch next week....

   Jenny
