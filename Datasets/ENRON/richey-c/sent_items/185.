Okay. Here are the participant codes in handy-dandy lookup format. I've also put the categories I'd like them divided into in the third column. If possible, could you also flag anyone with >5% market share?

In any case, give me a call when you get this and we'll talk.

 << File: Participant Codes.xls >> 
For future reference:
http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/Market/Reports/ParticipantListReportServlet?contentType=html
has all of the pool participant codes defined.
