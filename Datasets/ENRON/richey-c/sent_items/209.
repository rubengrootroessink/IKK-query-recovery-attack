hey dude-

what's new?  

i'm coming home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you planning on being around?  be
great to catch up on life.  

i haven't talked to anyone from hs in the last year or so - feeling lame
and out of touch.  i hear howard is engaged.  

things are going well for me, although job situation is somewhat uncertain
at this point ...  i'm sure you've seen what's going on with enron.  

how's callisma and life in general?

coop
