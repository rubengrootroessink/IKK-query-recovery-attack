damn!

do you use microsoft outlook?  or some bizarre Corel product?  yes, it would be terrible to allow employees access to a cd-rom drive.  productivity would plummet.  enron let their employees have cd-roms and look what happened to them!

I don't see them but I don't have Corel installed on my computer.  It would probably work in a company who installs more software in their computers than just bare bones.  They even bought systems without cd-roms to serve a dual purpose:  1) lower costs and 2) minimize those pesky disractions so you can focus all your attention on your work.
