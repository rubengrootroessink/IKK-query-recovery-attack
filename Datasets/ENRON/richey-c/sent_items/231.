cell number is:  512 3312 but it's enron's phone, so ...

home number is 262 0205 and cooper@llamacom.com should be a good place to reach me.

as for me, i'm very unsure.  I'm still technically a U.S. employee and my visa expires soon, 
so I really don't have any idea.  

worst case is i take a well-deserved vacation for awhile and worry about the rest later ... :)

Thank you very much, Cooper.  I appreciate that immensely, and you probably don't know exactly how much that means to me.

Do you have a cell phone number I could use, if it ever came to that?

What happens to you, if things pan out that way?  Are you able to change jobs up here, or is your work visa void if Enron Canada goes under?  I would gladly do the same for you.

Hi Chris,

I don't know where you're at with things ...

i've been impressed how you've handled both the databases and the people involved with databases and
would be happy to provide you with a solid reference if you ever need one.  please keep this to yourself
as I don't feel this way about many people here ...

cheers :)

Cooper
