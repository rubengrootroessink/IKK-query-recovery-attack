What up, man!

Things have been extremely busy during the past 90 days or so.  We are
preparing to deploy on 7 Jan.  I will be home with Tina from the 20th to the
27th.  I guess Jimi is having an engagement party on the 21st.  I would love
it if you could make it to that.  You will need to talk to Jim for details.

Yes, I am engaged.  Crazy, huh?  It feels good though.  Tina and I are
happy.  More to follow whence I see ya.

I have to run, but just wanted to let you know I was hanging in there and
doing well.

Peace, Howie

been in touch with anyone in the last year or so...  things have been
going well in canada, but my company is melting down, so not sure what
i'm going to be doing and probably won't know for awhile.  i'm going to
be home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you going to be around?  looking forward to
catching up ...
