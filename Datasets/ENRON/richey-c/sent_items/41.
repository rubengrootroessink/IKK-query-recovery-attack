How did the workout go for you today?  Mine wasn't so good.  Lot's of distractions, people on the equipment I wanted to use.  You know how it goes.  I was thinking about the Eau Claire classification, and I think where you live counts as Eau Claire.  I don't know what else it would be.  So you like your place, do you.  Why don't you tell me about it. 
If you're too busy, don't worry about it.  No boss for me means I have plenty of time to bother people with emails.
