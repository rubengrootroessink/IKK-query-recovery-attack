Jai

I don't know if you are speaking to me or not but what happened...You
missed a good one!

I went to my game at 10pm and got back to Tania's about 12:15 and started
to light it up with shooters.

We stayed up until 6am.  At about 4am one of Tania's grumpy lesbian
neighbors barged into her living room and told us that she hadn't been able
to sleep for the last 4 hours.  Needless to say Tania was not impressed as
the lesbian bitch could have just called.

Anyway I am going to get a coffee soon, don't know if you are interested.
