Just an FYI, if you want to alter procedures in production already, you can use the command Alter Procedure, instead of Create Procedure.  Everything else would be as you have it in your scripts.  All it does is change the code of the procedure without touching dependencies or permissions.  I'll change that in these so that you don't have to.

Thanks, :)
