Here are few question that I think should be asked before the approval of this change be granted:
What is the particulars of the reasoning behind needing the site to be listed as Trusted?
What functionality is missing or broken because it is only listed as a intranet site?
What option in the configuration of Trusted sites facilitates the functionality that is broken or missing?

Please remit answer at your earliest convience.
