Who controls, developes and designs the activeX control?  If the control is developed in housen the component should follow and proper review/release process and then signed for production.  If this control is developed by an outside source, what is the functionality of the object?  what processes where taken to ensure the assurance of "fair-play" from a security risk evaluation point on this version and all potention upgrade versions?  And what relationship do we have with them to inquire about a signed version of their component?

Sorry for the incovienence of these queries, and I am sorry that these questions have to come from a desktop architect.  But to maintain tight security to ensure the stability for Enrons network, I think that these are important issues.

		What is the particulars of the reasoning behind needing the site to be listed as Trusted?
		TO FACILITATE POWER AND GAS TRADERS' ACCESS TO WEB-BASED DECISION
		SUPPORT TOOLS.

		What functionality is missing or broken because it is only listed as a intranet site?
		ACCESS DATA SOURCES FROM OTHER DOMAINS

		What option in the configuration of Trusted sites facilitates the functionality that is broken or missing?
		(1) DOWNLOAD UNSIGNED ACTIVE-X CONTROLS

		are these answers satisfactory? if not, please let me know what else I can possibly do
		to get this done.
