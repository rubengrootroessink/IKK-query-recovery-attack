Mark,

sorry if I was an ass.  i just want to get things done quickly and it didn't
appear to me that was going to happen, so I wanted to cut my losses.  

i don't have much patience for IT processes and I'm usually smart enough 
to not embroil myself in anything, but occassionally I have a judgement
lapse.  

I appreciate your help.  

Cooper
