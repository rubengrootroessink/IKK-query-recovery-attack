This request is complete.
 
Faheem, I think we need to sit down together for 30 minutes or so discuss the approval process so I am more aware.

Dan,
 
        No problem.  I just spoke with Cooper and he is sending me a justification for requesting this.  I will keep you posted.  Thanks.

Faheem,
 
My understanding was that discovery was part of the IT Security and Controls function before approval was granted.
 
Please advise if this is not the case.
 
Regards,
 
Dan

Mark, 

        I am going to have to defer this to Dan for an answer.  I am not sure of the justification that was given. 

Dan, 

        Can you please follow up with Mark on his question below?  Thanks.

I am just curious... why do they have to be listed as a trusted site?

Dan, 

there is a list of default "trusted sites" within the enron version of IE and i would like to get albertapower.enron.com added to this list.  

i'm not sure how this list gets populated (whenever IE runs or when it is installed).   

To get to this list go to Tools->Internet Options->Security->Trusted Sites->Sites... 

Do you have any idea about how to get a site added to this list? 

other sites on this list are: 

tradeportal.corp.enron.com 
*.pjm.com 
powermarketmodelling.corp.enron.com 
marketdataviewer.corp.enron.com 
livelinkeu.corp.enron.com 
eurohydro.corp.enron.com 

thanks for any help, 
cooper
