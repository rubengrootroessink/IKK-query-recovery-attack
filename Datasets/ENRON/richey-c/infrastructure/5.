Subject:	EOL Price Data

Hi Mark,

Dave Dronet passed on your name as an EOL contact point for internal data.  I trade 
power in the Calgary office and also manage some trading decision support work (similar to 
Dave's group, but smaller in scale).  

We are very interested in pulling EOL prices real-time as a number of our products are 
functions of other EOL products.

From talking to Dave, it seems that currently TIBCO is used to push eol price changes to 
clients, but that this will be discontinued in the near future in favor of rapid polling for price 
changes from a db.  Do you have time to bring us up to speed on your recommended approach
for monitoring EOL price changes?  I have two developers up here working on this project 
and Dave has also passed on the code his group has developed. 

Thanks for any help,
Cooper
