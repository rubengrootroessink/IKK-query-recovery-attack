As per instructions in the "EnronOnline RealTime Login API", I am requesting a read-only client account for EOL production.  

I work in the Calgary office and we are building a fundamentals decision support tool for trading that requires realtime EOL price data feeds.  This tool will be used initially for canadian power and gas products and will require access to power, gas, and currency EOL price feeds.

Please let me know if you require more information from me.  

Thanks,
Cooper
