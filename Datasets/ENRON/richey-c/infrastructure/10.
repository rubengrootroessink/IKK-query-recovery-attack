Shoot... I guess that print config page is not as "convienient" as advertised... :)

We are getting two of these:

Compaq ProLiant DL360
Dual Pentium III 1Ghz/133
1GB SDRAM 133MHz (4x256)
RAID 1 setting
(2) 18.2GB hot pluggable Ultra3 SCSI 15,000 rpm Hard Drives

So, that is the basic scoop... Being that we will only use this for final draft web stuff, I don't forsee ever hitting that 36 GB disk space limit... 

The coolest part is that this is a 5 times better system, but two of these will cost less than we spent on the current system almost a year ago...

Cooper -

I thought that you might be interested in an update to our web server activities...

Our plan (at this point) is to purchase a new production server and keep the existing system as the development server and file server.

This is what we are looking at:
http://www.directpluspro.compaq.com/printconfig.asp?oi=E9CED&dcpqsid=1DMLAVWF98S92G2N00AKHB60TV7UA5HF&BEID=19701

We are planning to purchase two of these (identical of course). We plan to have one mirror the other so the we can balance the load, and also so that (in the event of a problem) one can function independent of the other... the idea the we can literally shut one down without the web site going down is exciting... also, being able to upgrade by simply slapping in a new "pizza box" is quite intriguing...

Any comments that you might have are more than welcome.

Bob
