Louise,

What am I missing here?  We are offering an excellent deal for eMetra which
will take the business forward and we believe management supports.  We are
offering to get you into 3 markets which you are active in where you can
earn shares of our stock without paying an entry price.  I have found a
structural way of getting the $10 million in cash to you.

I am surprised you do not want to discuss this further.

Jonathan

Jonathan,

As stated in my previous message.  The letter and your two subsequent
emails confirm that Enron and eSpeed are not close to any agreement and in
order to ensure no time is wasted on the part of either Enron or eSpeed, we
have no further wish to pursue any further discussions.   The draft
proposal we sent was not subject to negotiation.

Regards


Louise Kitchen
COO
