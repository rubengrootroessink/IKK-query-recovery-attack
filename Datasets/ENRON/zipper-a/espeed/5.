Peter,

For your information, Enron has responded to Espeed's letter dated March 14th stating that we have "no further wish to pursue any discussions with Espeed".
I suggest that we all fully commit our energies over the remainder of this month in pursuit of the DB/Reuters opportunity, as it represents from our perspective the only viable alternative for Emetra at this time.

  Tom
