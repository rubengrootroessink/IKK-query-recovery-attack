You may think this sounds like an off the wall idea but Greg and I were talking about today's events and................  why don't we put our equity in eMetra on EnronOnline up for auction or even DealBench for that matter.  There is an irony with EOL though.

Think about it..................  I think its a good idea.    In fact in all honesty you could put an offer out there.  Start with say $3-5 million and reduce every week you don't get an offer.

The way we value this thing we could easily remove the problem in one move by just auctioning it off.  

There is no downside and it removes further issues you may have with future shareholders and eMetra's direction.

(I personally would love to offer a certain party a log on id and password to bid.)
