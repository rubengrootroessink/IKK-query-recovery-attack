Jonathan,

As stated in my previous message.  The letter and your two subsequent emails confirm that Enron and eSpeed are not close to any agreement and in order to ensure no time is wasted on the part of either Enron or eSpeed, we have no further wish to pursue any further discussions.   The draft proposal we sent was not subject to negotiation.

Regards


Louise Kitchen
COO
