Andy,

Back on December 15, 2000 you received a letter from True Quote confirming
the redemption and forfeiture of 7,731,942 Common Units of Participation
owned by Enron Net Works LLC in True Quote LLC.  Part of that letter
contained the updated capital structure of True Quote LLC subsequent to the
redemption.  However, the equity owned by APB Energy, Inc. was inadvertently
left off that summary.  The current capital structure is, and should have
been described in that letter, as follows

	B2B Internet Capital Corp.	7,440,000	Series A Preferred Units
	EnFORM Technology LLC	   560,000	Series A Preferred Units
	APB Energy, Inc.		1,172,838	Common Units
	PG&E Energy Trading -
	  Gas Corporation	           15,000,000	Common Units
	Enron Net Works LLC		 7,268,058	Common Units
	Employee Stock Option
	  Plan				 1,000,000 	Common Units

If you have any questions about this, or any other matter, please don't
hesitate to contact me.
