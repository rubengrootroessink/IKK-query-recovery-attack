After a week and a half of silence from Houston Street, I found out today 
that they have taken over responsibility for their exchange linking 
development from Sapient.  According to the Houston Street project manager, 
Sapient was being too cautious and thorough in their efforts to get to market 
and Houston Street wasn't impressed with their progress to date.  Sapient had 
as of last week finished the design work for the system and has provided the 
design to Houston Street.  Houston Street will use their own internal team to 
complete the project and feels confident they will finish by the 15 January 
deadline.  

This does not bode well for the exchange that appeared to be light years 
ahead of TrueQuote in their development efforts.
