Chris,

The System Test environment has not been available this morning for a couple
of reasons.  During the code migration code last evening which resolved the
problem of Power Prices not displaying correctly, an unrelated problem arose
with one of the application controls that handles some of the grid display
features.  During one of the comipiles the .dll was corrupted.  This has
required us to rebuild the control and update the entire application to
reference the newly rebuilt contol's class id.  Although the Power products
have been active since last night, we have been unable to bring the system
test environment on-line for testing because of the corrupted application
control.  We anticipate that the system will be back up within the next
hour, by 2pm (barring any other unforeseen problems).  We apologize for any
inconvenience that we've caused for the Enron testing effort this morning.

To address Enron's concerns expressed to you during this morning's
conference call, here is what we are currently doing in each of these areas:

Performance of the system - We believe we know exactly what is causing the
performance problem.  However, the person that is best qualified to resolve
that problem has been extremely busy addressing other issues, such as
verifying that the integrity of the data and messages that are sent back and
forth are accurate.  This person will spend the majority of today and
tomorrow fine-tuning performance.  We have a very high degree of confidence
that we can improve performance in short order to the level that is
acceptable to Enron.

Power Prices - We observed some problems with the Power filters and took
these products offline yesterday so that we could work on the problem.  We
believe the problem has been resolved and have migrated the code to System
Test.  Although Power Prices are available right now, the System Test
environment is offline right now due to code migrations unrelated to the
power issue.

Notification of Failed Transactions - The concern is that when a user's
order results in an attempted transaction against EOL and a Failure message
is received from Enron, the True Quote system does not display a message to
the user explaining that Counterparty was not available to fill the order.
We have analysts working on the notification messages right now.  If a
user's order is submitted with a duration of 'Fill or Kill' and the order is
not filled at least partially, we plan to push a message notification to the
user stating the following:  "Your order was received by the system;
however, no counterparties were available to fill your request".  We may
also display a 'small print' disclaimer at the bottom of the message that
says:  *Orders may not be filled due to unavailable volume, credit
limitations, or another platform particpant acquiring the volume slightly
ahead of your order request."  The wording of this message is pending
approval by True Quote executive management.    These changes will be
migrated to System Test this weekend.

Stress Testing - We are also concerned with the lack of stress testing that
we have been able to perform and have been concerned with amount of
realistic functionality testing that can be accomplished given the
compressed testing timeframe.  True Quote is dedicated to completing as much
functional testing and performance tuning as possible and will have our
entire team here all weekend to press forward with these efforts.  It was
our understanding that Enron and True Quote management had decided to forego
stress testing in order to take this system into production by March 12.  We
have assumed and planned for more rigorous stress testing using the System
Test environment AFTER March 12 to improve performance over the coming
weeks.  If management has now decided that a thorough and complete system
wide stress test is a pre-production requirement, then we agree that March
12 is not a realistic Go-Live date.

Yesterday, we received several errors from EOL when we attempted to login
and when we attempted to execute transactions.  The following is a list of
errors that we received throughout the day:

9:07 a.m. to 9:10 a.m.	Received three "Internal Server Error - Unable to
process request" messages
12:10 a.m.		Received three "Internal Server Error - Unable to process
request" messages
12:13 a.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with "Failure: Broker user's session
invalid" message
12:14 a.m.		Receved "A connection with the server could not be established"
message
12:15 a.m.		Received "Failure msg = User not found in session" Code = "Bus"
message
12:25 a.m. 		Received "Internal Server Error - Unable to process request"
message
2:43 p.m.		Received two Attempt Transactions failed with "Failure: Broker
user's session invalid" messages
2:51 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with "Failure: Broker user's session
invalid" message
3:06 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with "Failure: Broker user's session
invalid" message
4:47 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with "Counterparty has no offer access
to product" message

We are concerned about the stability of the Enron servers.  Could you please
ask Bob in investigate why we are getting these types of errors throughout
the day?  We are also concerned that the process for verifying the status of
a transaction that has not completed in a reasonable amount of time is not
yet in place at Enron.  We see this as a critical process that must be in
place and working before we go live.  In addition, we have experienced
things like receiving messages that we had not anticipated, receiving random
credit updates that we thought we had agree that we would not receive, and
changes in XML attributes and content that we had not seen in previous
testing.

We are working very hard to address issues as quickly as we can and
appreciate very much having Matt Mottsinger addressing issues on Enron's
side as quickly as possible.  We will take their offer on using Matt to a
higher degree.  If it makes sense for him to be here at our site this
weekend, than we are happy to find him place to work in our environment, but
if it makes more sense to have him available from Enron's location, we can
stay in contact with him via telephone.
