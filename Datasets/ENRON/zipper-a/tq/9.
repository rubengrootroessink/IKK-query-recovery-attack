I will be faxing our waiver shortly and will send two original execution counterparts by FedEx.  

I don't recall if you returned to us fully executed copies of the Amendment to the Subscription Agreement and the Amendment to the Posting Agreement.  If you have, great (did you send them to me?)  If not, please send executed copies as soon as you can.  Thanks.
