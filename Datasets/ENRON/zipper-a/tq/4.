Richard Tobia called to ask me to take a look at their screen as they felt they were gettign updates and a commercial manager should see the progress.  We were able to update prices at a speed of about 4 seconds.  We then attempted to send multiple updates at a speed of about 1 second per update.  True Quote was unable to accept the updates and the link was automatically diconnected by EnronOnline after multiple failures.
