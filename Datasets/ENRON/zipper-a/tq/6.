I talked to Chris Edmonds this morning to check the status on there system.  Tom Engel was available this weekend to test with them however they never were able to use him.  The True Quote test site is still not available this morning.  Chris indicated they should have a much faster site by lunch time.  

I mentioned to Chris that we were very concerned about there ability to move things forward.  I also indicated that you may be giving Dennis a call to discuss.
