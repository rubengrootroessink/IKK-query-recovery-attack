Andy,

 After discussing the performance of True Quote with Mike Guadarrama I am increasingly concerned that they have problems which may take some time to overcome.  Mike believes that the speed issue is a result of the way they have designed their architecture.  If this is the case we will not see improved performance for some time.  

I've asked Mike to have a conversation with the True Quote developer to give us a better idea of what he believes the root problems are.  Based upon Mike's assessment we can get a feel of the time it may take to correct the problems.

We continue to spend a great deal of time testing with True Quote and this is consuming a fair amount of time for the testing team.
