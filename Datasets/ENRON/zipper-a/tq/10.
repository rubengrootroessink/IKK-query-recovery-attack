Bob:

I will forward the letter to Frank and your questions regarding testing to
Linda.  As far as I know, we are ready to do testing right now.  I believe
Linda sent someone on your team a detailed testing schedule last week.   We
are snowed out of our office today, so we may have to wait until tomorrow to
take futher action on anything.  Feel free to call me on my cell phone at
any time you feel there is a delay on our end.

Best Regards,
John
