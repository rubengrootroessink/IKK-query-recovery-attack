Although the Master Service Agreement and the Project Services Agreement with Valtech do not expressly state that Valtech and its employees must keep the nature of their assignments confidential, the agreements do require Valtech to keep all "information, data, documents and materials" provided by Enron in absolute confidence and not to even disclose such information to its own employees except as necessary to perform Valtech's obligations under the agreements.    I think this language could be interpreted to cover the nature of the projects undertaken by Valtech, especially if we expressly tell the employees that the work they are performing for us is to be kept confidential and not to be disclosed to any Valtech employees except for those that have a need to know.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  Thanks.
