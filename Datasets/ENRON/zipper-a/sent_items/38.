Hi Andy and happy new year...

I chose one in NJ for my own use.

I did get some recommendations from some other people that were NY lawyers:

Jerry Solomon at Gallet, Dryer & Berkey 212-935-3131.

I have another somewhere, and I'll try to send it along.

A friend who works in New York asked if I could recommend an attorney who
does Will/Estate preparation. Do you have any recommendations ?

Thanks,
Andy

p.s. Happy New Year !!
