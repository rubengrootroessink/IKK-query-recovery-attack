REMINDER --

Opening comments start promptly at 8:00 a.m., so please allow plenty of time to arrive at the Houstonian, park and have breakfast.  The Houstonian is located at 111 North Post Oak Boulevard, phone 713-680-2626.  Our meeting will be held in the Cottonwood Room.

Dress code for the day is casual.

If you haven't turned in your presentation yet, please bring 20 copies to the meeting, 3-hole punched at the top.  You will also have to bring your presentation on a CD so I can load it on the laptop.
