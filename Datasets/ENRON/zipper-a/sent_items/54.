Ted,
Try these guys. George is excellent. I don't know much about Balal.
Hope all is going well for you and your bride. I know I owe you a phone call, and I will pay the debt soon.

Best,
Andy

Hi John,
I hope things are going well for you. Sorry I could not contact you earlier
- had been really busy wrapping up things. Thanks for stopping the other day
and inquiring about me. I have an H-1 visa and have 6 weeks to find a job
after which I will be required to leave the country.

I am attaching a copy of my resume for you to review. I would appreciate
greatly if you could go over it and offer any suggestions on how I can
improve my chances of finding a job.

Thanks,
Bilal
