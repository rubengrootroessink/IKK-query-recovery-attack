1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.

2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.

3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.

4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.

5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.

6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.

7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.

8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7).
