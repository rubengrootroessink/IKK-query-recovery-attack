Given the fact that we still have a significant number of transactions that are not captured on EOL, my answer would be thanks but no thanks.

Subject: Independent Kiodex analysis of EnronOnline risk?


Greg, we've been able to load thousands of EnronOnline trades into our Risk
Workbench, and we've correctly run risk reports on them.  Might we be of
service to Enron by loading ALL the EnronOnline trades into the Risk
Workbench, and running our risk reports on the aggregate?  I'm thinking that
such an independent analysis of at least part of Enron's risk position might
answer the requests, expressed among analysts and pundits in the FT, the
WSJ, and elsewhere, for greater disclosure.

Everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days.  Just
as Enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets, Enron can set the
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk.  (I know the other dealers
will want to squirm their way out of following suit.)  I have supreme
confidence in Enron's risk controls, and I'm thinking that an independent
measurement of this kind could dispel the market's overblown and baseless
fears.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Marty
