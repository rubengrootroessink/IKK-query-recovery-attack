I am attending the Bonanza Pilot Proficiency Program (BPPP) clinic at Adams Field in Little Rock. This is the big airport in Little Rock. The clinic will be run at Central Flying Service, phone number there is 800-888-5387. If you need to speak with someone from the clinic ask for Kathy Tatalovich who is the administrator. I will be staying at the Embassy Suites by the airport. I don't have the nuber now but I will call you with it. 

I'll call you from the road.

Love you and the kids mucho,
KPD
