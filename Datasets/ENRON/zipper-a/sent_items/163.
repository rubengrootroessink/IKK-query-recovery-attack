John,
On the first note: OK, thanks.

On the second, I would like the senior person on each team (and they know who they are) to figure how to divvy up the tasks based upon their teams relative skills. You guys need to figure it out, with my help. Right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and I am trying to find ways to cope with that. This is one. Your cooperation is appreciated.

Thanks,
AZ
