Who did it?     Foreign Report presents an alternative view 

Israel's military intelligence service, Aman, suspects that Iraq is the 
state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and 
the Pentagon in Washington. Directing the mission, Aman officers believe, 
were two of the world's foremost terrorist masterminds: the Lebanese Imad 
Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah, and the 
Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible 
successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden. 

The two men have not been seen for some time. Mughniyeh is probably the 
world's most wanted outlaw. Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has 
undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable. Zawahiri is thought to be 
based in Egypt. He could be Bin Laden's chief representative outside 
Afghanistan. 

The Iraqis, who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty 
work, were quick to discover the advantages of Al-Qaeda. The Israeli sources

claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling

between Baghdad and Afghanistan, meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri. According 
to the sources, one of the Iraqi intelligence officers, Salah Suleiman, was 
captured last October by the Pakistanis near the border with Afghanistan. 
The Iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties with Imad 
Mughniyeh. 

"We've only got scraps of information, not the full picture," admits one 
intelligence source, "but it was good enough for us to send a warning six 
weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was 
expected. One of our indications suggested that Imad Mughniyeh met with some

of his dormant agents on secret trips to Germany. We believe that the 
operational brains behind the New-York attack were Mughniyeh and Zawahiri, 
who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the Iraqi 
Intelligence Service (SSO)." 

Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before. On April 12th 
1997, he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest 
goal of any terrorist organisation (until last week): blowing up an Israeli 
El-Al airliner above Tel Aviv. A man carrying a forged British passport with

the name Andrew Jonathan Neumann was in a Jerusalem hotel preparing a bomb 
he was supposed to take on board an El-Al flight leaving Israel, when it 
accidentally went off. Andrew Jonathan Neumann was very badly injured but 
strong enough to reveal later to the Israelis that he was not British but 
Lebanese, and that his operation was supposed to be a special "gift" to 
Israel from Imad Mughniyeh. 

'A psychopath' 

"Bin Laden is a schoolboy in comparison with Mughniyeh," says an Israeli who

knows Mughniyeh . "The guy is a genius, someone who refined the art of 
terrorism to its utmost level. We studied him and reached the conclusion 
that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological 
reasons, which we have given up trying to understand. The killing of his two

brothers by the Americans only inflamed his strong motivation." 

Experts on Iraq and Saddam Hussein also believe that Iraq was the state 
behind the two terror masterminds. "In recent months, there was a change, 
and Iraq decided to get into the terror business. On July 7th, they tried 
for the first time to send a suicide bomber, trained in Baghdad, to blow up 
Tel Aviv airport (Foreign Report No. 2651)." 

Our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of 
this unprecedented terror operation. However, they believe the chief of the 
Iraqi SSO is Qusai Hussein, the dictator's son, and his organisation is the 
most likely to have been involved. 

Mughniyeh, 48, is a "sick man", says an intelligence officer who was in 
charge of his file. He is considered by Western intelligence agencies as the

most dangerous active terrorist today. He is wanted by several governments 
and the Americans have put a $2m reward on his head. 

[Detailed list of Mughniyeh operations removed for Non-Subscriber Extract] 

It was the assassination of one man in March 1984 that is said to have made 
Mughniyeh the CIA's most wanted terrorist. Mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped the

head of the CIA station in Beirut, William Buckley. The kidnapping triggered

what later became known as 'Irangate', when the Americans tried to exchange 
Buckley (and others) with arms for Iran. However, the attempt ended in a 
fiasco. By one unconfirmed account, Mughniyeh tortured and killed Buckley 
with his own hands. 

A year later, in a combined CIA/Mossad operation, a powerful car bomb went 
off at the entrance to the house of Hizbullah's spiritual leader, Sheikh 
Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah. Seventy-five people were killed. One of them was

his brother. Hunted by the CIA and the Mossad, Mughniyeh hid in Iran. 

In February 1992, Israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the 
then head of Hizbullah, Sheikh Abas Musawi, in South Lebanon. Musawi, his 
wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later.

According to press reports, Mughniyeh was called back into action and, in a 
well-planned and devastating attack, his people blew up the Israeli embassy 
in Argentina. The building was demolished and 92 were killed. Only last 
year, after a long investigation, did Argentina issue a warrant for 
Mughniyeh's arrest. 

The reprisal for the attack in Argentina came in December 1994, when a car 
bomb went off in a southern Shi'ite suburb of Beirut. Four people were 
killed. One of them was called Mughniyeh, but to the deep disappointment of 
those Israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one. Mughniyeh's life 
was saved, but his other brother Fuad was killed. Mughniyeh waited for his 
opportunity for revenge. 

Our Israeli sources claim to see Mughniyeh's signature on the wreckage in 
New York and Washington. How to counter this kind of terrorism? "To fight 
these bastards you don't need a military attack," said an experienced 
Israeli commando officer. "You only need to adopt Israel's assassination 
policy."

Subject: What's the Plan -- Patterns of Global 
Terrorism 2000 


Hello friends, 

For those of you who I have not spoken to I hope with 
all my heart family and friends are safe.  The victims 
will not be forgotten.  

I would like to engage all of you in a discussion of 
what is to come.  Or perhaps I'm ranting you decide... 

My first reactions like many others were decimation, 
selected occupation, no more standing military, slowly 
over the course of 30-50 years we bring these nations 
into the fold of economic prosperity.  This has worked 
before, but will it now?  On terrorism and 
intelligence, I think terrorism is not to be treated 
as criminal law; we cannot follow the diplomatic code 
when dealing with terrorist organizations (i.e., our 
intelligence should be permitted to assassinate these 
people, or have moles on the payroll). 

After a few days of kill 'em all mentality, I decided 
to begin my education in this matter.  I would like to 
share with you my first research and some impressions. 
 I do feel more informed.  My resolve is no different; 
but my initial general blood thirst is evolving into 
something far more calculated. 

Domestic and international terrorism has been a 
horrible problem for as long as most nations can 
remember.  There is on average more than one terrorist 
event a day in the world.  In the late 1980's it was 
as high as 2 events a day. 
This is terrorism.  From Colin Powell himself.  I 
found myself numb before I event got through the first 
months of 2000.

List of major terrorist organizations - they will all 
need to be eliminated but I have highlighted the first 
targets. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000>  
Start with Al Quida a focal point or umbrella 
organization for a worldwide network that includes 
many Sunni Islamic extremist groups such as Egyptian 
Islamic Jihad, some members of al-Gama'at 
al-Islamiyya, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and 
the Harakat ul-Mujahidin. 

Al-Qaida - an terrorist organization almost run by bin 
Laden, financially his network is like a holding 
company.  Al Quida exerts heavy influence over the 
four organizations listed below.  Each of the other 
organizations in turn exerts influence over other 
terrorist groups.  Most of these are fundamental 
Islamic extremist organizations.  A fear is that a 
general cohesive theme is to overthrow the 
middle-eastern governments, establish fundamentalist 
Islamic states which would persecute other religious 
observers within their borders, wage war on western 
influence internally,  and potentially engage in 
military actions against the United States and other 
western nations. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm>  

These organizations have signed a fatwa issued by bin 
Laden in 1998 calling for the death of Americans.

Geography - very good idea to look at maps of the 
region. 
http://www.randmcnally.com <http://www.randmcnally.com>  
I found the geography interesting to study in detail. 
Afghanistan is horribly difficult to access.  The 
ocean-to-land access is through Pakistan's Arabian Sea 
coast; then head North 800 miles, to Peshawar and then 
into Kabul (the mountainous route the British used in 
1946).  The Pakistan army is 50% Taliban sympathetic. 
Already 42 political parties have issued statements of 
opposition to their own government for offering to 
help America.  They will descend into civil war most 
surely.  The HUM will likely be a significant part of 
that problem.  It will do us no good to partner with a 
cooperative government and an uncooperative military. 
Could American planes be shot down over Pakistan by 
renegades within their own army?  

Things we should know: 
In Pakistan, many Afghan refugees were initially 
trained by the US and Pakistan Intelligence (ISI) in 
the 1980's to fight the Soviets.  They were called the 
Mujahideen.  Many were children living in refugee 
camps when recruited, having known nothing else in 
this world.  Left to their own devices for 10 years, 
these camps and training centers have given root to 
terrorist organizations (HUM) and violently 
anti-humanitarian fundamentalist movements (the 
Taliban).  The Taliban gained control of Afghanistan 
in 1996 overthrowing the then Shiite-Communist regime, 
killing and hanging the president in downtown Kabul 
for several days.  The Taliban are Sunni Muslim 
fundamentalists and conduct a religious proletariat; 
they terrorize other Muslim communities, the Hazaras 
and Hindu Kush people within their borders.    The 
Taliban recently issued an edict requiring Afghan 
Hindus to wear identifications tags.  Sound familiar? 
The Taliban is hosting Al Qaida, bin Laden's 
organization.   bin Laden also influences the 
fundamentalist (IMU) in Uzbekistan.  The IMU is 
another Sunni fundamentalist terrorist group - they 
are mostly involved in terrorizing Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzistan, and Tajikistan, north of Afghanistan. 
The Taliban constituents are predominantly from the 
Pushtun region.  Pushtun covers parts of Afghanistan 
and Pakistan.; There have been movements to create a 
separate Pushtunistan.  This map indicates the ethnic 
breakdown in the region. 
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg>
. 
 And the HUM focuses their attacks on India. 

The Shi'ite Muslims, many other Sunni Muslims, and in 
general the world muslim community do not agree with 
the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law.  The 
Taliban is not accepted by most of the Islamic world 
because of their extreme harshness and treatment of 
women, total eliminations of all modern culture, and 
being the worlds largest heroin production.  The 
elimination of western influence is not considered a 
problem within some other fundamentalist groups. 

Afghanistan is not friendly with neighbor Iran to it's 
West.  Iran is an Shi'a or Shi'ite Muslim nation. 
Because Iran is predominantly Shi'a; they are 
unfriendly with the more radical Sunni dominated 
Afghanistan.  Iran backs the ousted government and is 
angered by Taliban terrorism and slaughtering of 
thousands of Shi'a Muslims, including Iranian 
diplomats in Afghanistan.  Iran also has border 
disputes with Iraq further to the West even after a 
devastating 8 year war.  Afghanistan and Iraq are both 
25 million people; Iran is closer to 65 million.

mines were dropped in Afghanistan with no maps left 
behind.

<http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/>  

The only opposition to the Taliban is the Northern 
Military Alliance.  These people are also Sunni Muslim 
and ethnically are the Tajiks.  Their leader Massoud 
was killed last week, assassinated by men posing as 
the press.  The sliver of Afghanistan they still 
control is the finger squeezed between northern 
Pakistan and Southern Tajikistan and touching China. 
The Tajik presence cannot be eliminated by the Taliban 
without initiating conflict with Tajikistan.  The NMA 
is a political authority that may be put in place. 
They have offered 15000 soldiers, and 15000 more on 
reserve.  Their leader was killed last week, most 
likely in some coordinated effort - along with the new 
requirement that all organization in Afghanistan need 
to put monies in to the Afghan bank.  Many acts were 
clearly coordinated in this event. 

I have also been seeking out information on the 
Taliban in particular.  These link contain some very 
powerful information.  Quite frankly it is shameful 
that the Western world turned their back when this 
hellish situation was brought on upon Afghanistan many 
years ago. 

First a super high level overview - it is interesting 
to note how many times this land has been ravaged by 
invaders.

Try to digest this information - it is very important 
that initiate an informed dialogue.  But the Taliban 
must go. 

This section is organized geographically based on the 
waterways. 
The nations in question will need to eradicate, expel 
extremists from within their own borders.  This means 
partnering with a United States led coalition and 
contributing emphatically. 

Look at the Mediterranean coast. 
The South - Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Egypt are all 
plagued by terrorism. 
The East - Israel, Lebanon, Syria  all plagued by 
terrorist groups.  There is a dreadful rooting of 
terrorist organization.  Beirut was once a beautiful 
city I am told; For 20 years it has replaced Warsaw as 
the pop-culture reference to a war torn city. 
Terrorism surrounding Israel ties into several other 
organizations including Hizbollah and HAMAS. 

Look at the Red Sea. 
Egypt,Sudan and Saudi Arabia.  The Sudan is terribly 
infiltrated; this may be the terrorist plan hatching 
ground and safe haven.  And while the Saudi's are 
economically partnered with the western world, many 
extremists operating out of Saudi do fund these 
organizations.  Sudan is also suspected of being a 
meeting ground for the terrorist network.  

Look at the Gulf of Aden - entrance to the Red Sea 
Yemen - has allowed bin Laden to broadcast, site of 
the USS Cole bombing.  After the attack, the 
perpetrators fled from Yemen to Afghanistan. 

Rounding the corner into the Persian Gulf. 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - both 
acknowledge the Taliban government.  They have 
provided radical nationals to the Afghans, throughout 
the years, many support the Taliban; some trained with 
bin Laden.  We hope these governments have a change of 
heart with regard to recognition of the Taliban. 
Iran, Persia until 1935, has coastal territory along 
the gulf and the Caspian sea to the north.  We have 
had problems with Iran in the past; in the current 
situation, they may be helpful maybe not.  There is 
information pointing to an Islamic conference in 
Tehran which is another possible "hatching" ground for 
these operations.  Iran still may be a very serious 
issue in the future.  It is a religious government - 
something we all implicitly abhor in this nation. 
They exiled the Shah and began systematically 
eliminating western influence from their society after 
the event in 1979 
Iraq - Part of the Ottoman empire through 1932. 
Kurdish territory in the North bordering on Turkey. 
Hussein has used Sarin nerve gas against his own 
nationals, the Kurds in the North near the Turkish 
border.  As we know, he has invaded Kuwait.  An 8 year 
war with Iran over borders was going on at the same 
time the soviets were in Afghanistan.  This is a 
military regime.  Though the economic sanctions we 
have used for the last 10 years have kept Iraq down as 
military force; they have created a new generation of 
hatred. 

East from the Gulf into the Arabian Sea, part of the 
Indian Ocean, the Arabian basin is separated from the 
Indian Ocean by underwater land structure but there is 
nothing to prevent sea travel. 
Pakistan - a country on the verge of civil war.  A 
military regime. Probably half of the people in the 
army are Taliban sympathizers.  Pakistan may be in 
civil war shortly. 
India - the largest democracy in the world.  Still 
disassembling the 3500 yr old Caste System.  The 
British occupation left India with an intact system of 
representative government.  They are plagued by 
internal strife from the Sikh, who are separatists. 
Their brand of terrorism has been significantly 
reduced in the past 8 years.  They are also plagued by 
the HUM another extremist fundamental Islamic movement 
- very closely connected to the Taliban and bin Laden 
as described earlier. 

China actually shares a thin strip of border with 
Afghanistan near Tajikistan.  Pakistan also borders on 
China.  Though the Himalayas separate the bulk of this 
geographically from the 1 billion people of China. 
Having China on board is critical. 

I would like the US to investigate TSI, Telephone 
Services International, a New Jersey Corporation and 
Unocal, a California Oil Company.  Both of these 
companies have had business dealings with the Taliban 
government.  I believe that corporate greed with total 
disregard for the human condition in any country is 
unacceptable and should be uncovered and dealt with 
accordingly.  And I think the investment community 
needs to demonstrate in the markets to corporations 
who dabble in business with terror linked 
organizations.  The investment community was hit 
particularly hard; i hope going forward there will be 
a clear message to stop support for companies who may 
potentially aggravate terrorists to attack Americans. 
We may need to legally restrict what our corporations 
can do abroad and who they are allowed to strike deals 
with based on the opportunity cost of potential 
terrorist activity.  By all means, no corporation 
should have had any business dealings with the 
Taliban; perhaps this should be enforced by law. 

Some rants about waking the sleeping giant MIND! 
I firmly believe that the deadened state of 
intellectual discussion concerning these issues in 
America is part of the problem. 
We have been funneling our best minds into Technology, 
Banking, Law and Medicine for a very long time.  The 
general lack of information and interest in world 
political and human conditions, and the evolution of 
human governments is dangerous.  The average American 
simply need to be more informed and have an opinion to 
express to our government on what we can do to ensure 
the survival of our way of life and the spread of 
goodwill.  

Most likely we are all in agreement that a forceful 
military strike will initiate this new campaign;  I 
think there is quite a bit of confusion over what we 
really are about to embark on.  Our army may well 
include the corporate army and the casualties will be 
civilian.  We need to get every American to study this 
condition, it's roots, causes, directions and what we 
can do to end it.  Americans need to start an 
intelligent dialogue, around the country publicly so 
that we can demonstrate to ourselves and the rest of 
the world that we are educated and serious about 
achieving a solution.  Our military domination is 
already known throughout the world. 

Perhaps our long-term goal may involve bolstering the 
middle-class communities in these nations assuming 
they are moderate, tolerant and peace-loving; they 
need something to lose, and conversely, something to 
protect.  To get there we will need to eradicate any 
fundamentalist governments like the Taliban, under no 
circumstances can they be trusted going forward ever. 
We will need to partner with each nation and hunt the 
terrorist organizations down within their borders.  We 
need to seize assets, disable communications, engage 
in an unprecedented Intelligence campaign.   

Let's focus our efforts on thinking and providing our 
leadership with a collective strategy and wisdom, an 
opinion from within.  While I trust the powers that be 
to handle these affairs,  I never believed any day in 
my life that we were so vulnerable. 

Know the enemy. The threat of bio-chemical weapons - a 
simple overview of what the most likely agents are.

<http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deadlygas0210.html>  

There is one company in America that is contracted by 
the DOD to produce the Anthrax vaccine, the BioPort 
Corporation, formerly known as the Michigan Biologic 
Products Institute (MBPI).  I hope the defense around 
that company is solid. 

Hopefully, this will generate some interest in 
developing a public discussion regarding strategies 
for the eradication of terrorism and governments that 
support them actively, tacitly or otherwise.  bin 
Laden  Imad Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas  

operations for Hizbullah, and the Egyptian Dr Ayman 

  Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible

and the Taliban should go first, then perhaps 
the other organizations mentioned above.  Then what 
Hussein, Qaddafi?  Will Egypt be on board when the Al 
Jihad unleash terror in Egypt?  Do these nations host 
silently in exchange for less or no terrorism within 
their borders, completely bending to the will of 
terrorists for fear of their people being injured?  Is 
that support or a successful campaign of terror? Where 
do we draw the line?  I suppose where you stand after 
Tuesday is a good start?  Who's next?  How do we 
prioritize? Will they are be lined up behind the US in 
1 year? 

Be strong,  Be prepared, Be smart, Be heard, God Bless 
America
