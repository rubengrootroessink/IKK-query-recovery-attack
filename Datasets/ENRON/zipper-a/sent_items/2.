Jay that makes sense and is the right solution, however I floated it by Rob Benson and Dana Davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just TOO much. Go figure. So they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 5 min qty 5 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime. The non web visible route is my back up.

I'll let you know how it goes.

Thanks
Andy
