Dave,

Mike mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate. Just wanted to let you know that I have a very high opinion of him. He is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders I've dealt with in non-trading commercial situations. When he worked for me at EnronOnline I always viewed him one of my best folks. Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion, but I thought it best if I let you know. 

Regards,
Andy
