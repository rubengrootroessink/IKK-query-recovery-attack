Does Carol have a sister named Mimi, who is married to a guy named Steve Houston ? There is a guy I work with here who is this guy's (Houston) best friend, and the woman he is married to sounded like Carol's sister. I know it sounds complicated.....

Hope you are faring okay with the recent events.
