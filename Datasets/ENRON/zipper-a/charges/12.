John,

As per our discussion of this afternoon, I am noting below the points that we have discussed and agreed with respect to IP transport products, which were originally set-up for video taping purpose for the analyst meeting on 24 January 2001. 

As per your request, we will set-up the IP transport products in the product manager in such a manner so that they can be traded in the future, which will be some time next week, contingent upon 3 conditions to which you have already agreed.  

1.  The new GTCs and the product descriptions have to conform with  each other (we are in the process of checking this).

2.  For the foreseeable future, the products have to  be displayed on  EnronOnline on daily basis (with the exception of holidays) with relevant prices and 
     must  be made available for trading with  approved counter-parties .

3.  As I mentioned to you over the phone, in essence this is a full scale launch. Therefore, the cost associated with the launch of IP transports products will    
     be similar to that for  any other standard launch ( about US$ 250,000).  Further details on this will be provided to you shortly.  Obviously any cost that your      group has   already incurred for the analyst demo  will be netted off against the total cost of launch.

As I also explained to you that the normal operational  procedure for EnronOnline mandates that any changes with respect to system/database take place over the weekend. However, as you have indicated the necessity and the urgency of giving the reading rights to your counter-parties by Friday, we will endeavour to do so.  However, this will require substantial deployment of additional resources to ensure that we do not compromise the integrity of EnronOnline system while fulfilling your request.

If you have any questions, please let know.

Naveed
