Attached is a Price Schedule, which follows the approximate structure we discussed the other day. As previously mentioned, I aggregated some things where it seemed to make sense to do so.

I have highlighted the Bridge Setup sections. I boosted this level from what we discussed.

Also, I think our Auctions charges are too high. Suggest we drop the per-Auction charge down to $2,000 (cost is less than $1,000).
