The story is:

These are charges which are incurred for the setup of new countries on EnronOnline.

The charges were communicated to each of the business units - and agreed to by representatives of those units before we commenced due diligence.

EnronOnline receives cost allocations from legal and these charges are intended to defray those costs.

(of course, this last point is a bit weak - the business units could also claim that they receive legal cost allocations as well - so if we are charging them, it is a bit like paying for it twice. In addition, EnronOnline costs are allocated out as well - so to the extent that we are allocated legal costs and then allocate those costs back to the business units, it could be argued that the business units are being charged on several fronts for the same thing. We will probably want to reduce our allocated charges by the amount of each due diligence charge. This means that this is not truly "revenue" - but it helps to ensure that we are only working on things which are really value-added).

Andy,

Looks like we will be charging out around $300,000 for adding new countries, including $150,000 to metals.

Chile			Metals
Peru			Metals
South Africa		Coal
Hong Kong		Metals
Taiwan			Metals
Israel			Seafreight
Latvia			LPG
Russia			Metals
Greece			Seafreight
Monaco		Metals
Slovakia		Continental Power
Turkey			Seafreight

I will authorise invoices in the next few days. We might get some push-back as even though they agreed to the charges, we have not actually levied them before now.

Dave
