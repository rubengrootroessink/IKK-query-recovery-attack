Sure.

These are actually taken directly from the spreadsheet which Mike Bridges prepared several months ago.

If this is a route you want to pursue, we should first verify each of the numbers as current.

Could you send me the commission numbers used for each of the major products in your volume based approach .

Sorry - xxx (below) was supposed to be replaced with $54.50 per transaction, which is based on 2 * the July00-Dec00 transaction count. Note this results in $40 million of recovery, which includes Amita's costs.

If you just look at $35 million recovery, the per-transaction fee is $47.68.

This structure has the advantage that it is a little closer to the current cost allocation methodology, but this methodology is not well known by the business units. 

I actually started drafting this email with Alternative 1 as the recommendation, but decided that if we have to sell this internally, the brokerage lookalike structure would be easer to sell and defend.

Okay. good start.

I like the idea of a minimum for each product, and I like staying with existing structure for new products. Let's look at alternative 1, the flat fee per trade, and see what it would need to be to yield $35mm in revs based on average tradecount YTD, i.e. extraplolate that out for rest of year for a pro forma. 

Thoughts ?

Andy,

Attached are some ideas for possible charge structures for EnronOnline. I am recommending something which will probably be surprising, given our conversation. Let's discuss when you have a moment.

Dave


Recommendation

a) For new commodity areas, continue to charge a set up fee in accordance with our previously agreed schedule. (e.g. $350,000 for new Market Area)

b) Charge a per-volume maintenance fee which is comparable to industry brokerage fees, with a minimum charge equivalent to $4,000 per Product * Total number of Products).

This method results in a total charge of approx. $46.5 million pa. (providing coverage for existing charges, some growth and London's charges)

This method is recommended because it balances a fee to reflect real expenditure of effort on behalf on Enron Online staff (the per Product minimum) with a structure which is recognizeable (and hopefully more easily sold) to the traders.

This structure is primarily not cost-driven, but is value-driven; those who derive the greatest value pay the highest costs.



Example Charges

Here are some example charges if we use the recommended method:


Commodity			Charge

US Nat Gas			$24,282,875
US Power			$  5,163,563
Metals				$  5,798,144
Crude & Products		$  3,578,560 
Norwegian Power		$     380,869
Global Credit			$     400,000
Coal				$     966,265
Bandwidth 			$     312,000


Or, by Group:

ENA		$30,647,772
EEL		$  8,774,844
EGM		$  6,741,955
EIM		$     106,250
EBS		$     312,000
Total:		$46,582,821


Sensitivity

With the recommended structure, if transactions for 2001 are:

	a) The same as the last half of 2000 * 2, then we recover approx. $46 million.
	b) Double, then we recover approx. $90 million
	c) Half, then we recover approx.$24 million
	c) Zero, then we recover approx. $6.4 million


Alternatives - Basic Structure

Any of the following could be combined to create additional alternatives:

Alternative 1: As per the recommended structure, but charge a flat per-transaction fee instead of a per volume fee. This would result in a charge of $xx per transaction.

Alternative 2: Charge by Product Types (we currently have 358, so full charge would be approx. $112,000 per Product Type)

Alternative 3: Charge by Products (we currently have 1500 per day, so full charge would be approx. $27,000 per Product)

Alternative 4: Charge by Country/Commodity (we currently have 61, so full charge would be approx. $656,000 per Country/Commodity)

Alternative 5: Use the same methodology as currently used for the cost allocation (55% of cost allocation based on number of transactions and 45% based on Country/Commodity Markets Served) This would result in transaction charges of approx. xxx per transaction and $295,000 per Market served.


Alternatives - Different Structures

Alternative 5: Separate Marketing costs and charge directly to business units based on activity

Alternative 6: Separate Development costs as a separate item not covered by the basic charge structure, but recovered solely through increases in EnronOnline business.
