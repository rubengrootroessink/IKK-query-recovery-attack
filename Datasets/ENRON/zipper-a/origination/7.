Could you guys please copy me on your lists as well?

Also, it would be helpful for the lists to show companies in order of priority - i.e. whom do you plan to be contacting first.

Thanks,

Dave

Per your request we have outlined our priority origination companies:

Pipelines: We have compiled a comprehensive list of pipelines and begun to develop a prioritization strategy.  Our original focus will be targeted at the most active capacity release and parking & loaning pipelines.  In addition we are targeting certain regional pipelines and low liquidity pipes looking for a boost to their transportation volumes. (We have included some pipelines in the list that have already been approached by D. Forster that we still consider good prospects; Dave will continue to work on these pipelines)

ANR (Forster talked to parent El Paso but not ANR directly)
CGT (Forster)
Columbia Gas Transmission
Dominion Transmission
Gulf South Pipeline (needs liquidity)

Coal: A cursory review of the coal space and have identified a few opportunities.  We have listed below a few targets for the coal sector.  We will continue to look for additional opportunities in coal.  We have met with the coal group and they are open to allowing competing prices on EnronOnline.
