      <p>Dear Andrew,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to "Andrew Zipper" <andy.zipper@enron.com>, who belongs to

<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>We're going to make it through the winter - the <b>North American
Electric Reliability Council released its Winter Assessment</b> on
Tuesday, reporting that generating supply should <b>meet or exceed</b>
estimated energy consumption.  The Washington bureau will take a closer
look at the assessment on Wednesday.
<p>On Wednesday, <b>Interior Secretary Gale Norton</b> talks about the
upcoming <b>Lease Area 181 sale</b>.  Secretary Norton believes there's
still great interest in the sale despite the reduction in size of the
lease area.  The sale is scheduled to take place in New Orleans on
December 5.
<p>The <b>FERC announced sweeping changes on Tuesday</b> in how it looks
at the issue of market power.  The changes could have a big impact on
major power generators.  We'll have reaction from the Washington bureau
on Wednesday from <b><i>Megawatt Daily</i> Editor Michael Lustig and
Electric Power Supply Association President Lynne Church</b>.  Lustig
joins us during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast and Church is stopping by at
<br>10:00 a.m. ET.
<p>ENL's Kym McNicholas will also have reaction to Tuesday's <b>FERC
ruling</b>.  On Wednesday, she'll bring us comments from Mirant, the
California Department of Water Resources and the California ISO.  And
during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, <b>Independent Energy Producers
Association State Policy Manager Katie Kaplan</b> will join us from the
West Coast bureau to give us her take on the FERC's actions.
<p><b>Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Regional Manager
Leonard Spearman</b> is stopping by the Houston bureau on Wednesday.
He'll talk about the <b>TNRCC's role in strengthening homeland
security</b> at Texas petrochemical plants and refineries.  Catch the
Spearman interview during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.
<p>The Houston bureau will also bring us a new twist in the search for
<b>alternatives to MTBE</b>.  <b>Chris Paschall of Industry Information
Resources</b> will talk about the possibility of making <b>ethanol out
of wine vines</b> - potential good news for California.  Join us from
Houston on Wednesday.
<p>Broadcasting Note: Reminder - since the markets are closed, we'll be
<b>dark on Thursday and Friday</b>.
<p>Wrap Note: We're <b>adding some of the day's commodity settles</b> to
the Wrap.  Here you go!
