Andy,

This technically possible if we model this as a standard product.  To make it look like a realtime auction is also possible but will require some work.  It's something that would be interesting to have.

Regards,
Michael

All,

Dale Neuner and Ross Mesquita referred me to you all.  I work with Global Strategic Sourcing and am looking to implement an "online marketplace" idea into Enron Online.  This would involve vendors and suppliers providing bids in a structured format - kind of like a reverse auction E-Bay.  Vendors would be able to see their competitors bids online, but not their names.  Any registered vendor would be able to update their numbers online, "real time".

First, we would like to know if anything like this is being done at Enron.  
Next, is it technologically possible to bring this concept into Enron Online?

Please advise.  We would like to do a test pilot as soon as possible with Crane Rentals.  Please give me a call so we can discuss this possibility,  
5-6528.

Thanks,
Shelley
