Andy,

I note that Carl and Leonardo have been put into the Specialized Tech category. 

Do you know if this was intentional? At the last PRC, they were both on the commercial track and I don't think they have been advised of anything to the contrary.

In preparation for EOL's pre rating meeting on Wednesday, 6/13, please review and approve the attached listing of employees, peer groups, etc. and return by 6/11.

For information and comparison purposes, I will also send you a listing of all of the employees by job group/peer group that will be reviewed in the final meeting on 6/28.

Reminder: We will only be rating active, exempt employees hired prior to 1/1/2001, with a status of fulltime, part-time or reduced hours.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Ryan
