Nice to meet you over the ether, and I hope we will have a chance to meet w=
hen you are next in NY.  It certainly sounds like the Fortune 500 represent=
 a large market with the characteristics you describe.  I would guess that =
they are somewhat harder to reach and sell than energy firms that are activ=
ely engaged in trading derivative products and do regard risk management as=
 core, whether the system is run internally or accessed as a service.  I th=
ink the company will have to learn more about what it takes to sell to both=
 customer segments as it gets started with its sales and marketing efforts,=
 and I'm not sure any of us know enough about the market at this point to h=
ave a strongly held point of view.  I would certainly be interested in any =
information you have seen as to how the market will develop, and in particu=
lar what the breakdown of people trading with Enron as between Fortune 500 =
vs. energy industry players looks like.  Thanks for your thoughts, and this=
 is clearly part of an ongoing dialogue with the company as to how to most =
effectively design, market and sell its products.
