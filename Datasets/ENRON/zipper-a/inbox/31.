One of our Arkansas pilots died this week He had signed up in August of 2001 but had not flown a mission for us yet. Details on the memorial forthcoming. Below is correspondence regarding the crash. Be careful out there.

Beth, 

 According to news reports this morning Dr. Jim Arnold and his wife were
killed yesterday in the crash of their Cessna Conquest near Arkansas
City, KS, leaving two boys ages 5 and 7.
That will also effectively remove Stan Sence from the pilot list as he
flew Dr. Arnold's other airplane.

Beth --
   Following is the FAA preliminary accident report on Dr. Arnold's 
crash. The report says he told air traffic control he had lost his 
autopilot. The loss of an autopilot alone surely would not have 
caused him a serious problem. It sounds to me like he experienced a 
failure of his attitude indicator and/or his directional gyro -- 
possibly his entire vacuum system, but that latter suspicion is just 
speculation on my part.
   The report suggests he had been assigned a block altitude between 
27,000 and 28,000 feet on an IFR flight plan enroute to Rifle, 
Colorado from Springdale. The weather at the nearest reporting 
station at 1:45 p.m. CST indicated freezing rain was falling beneath 
a 1300-foot overcast. Radar contact was lost 70 nautical miles 
southeast of Wichita at 2:10 p.m. CST.
