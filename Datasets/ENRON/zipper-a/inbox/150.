I am working with IT on the look and feel for Kiodex Lite reports on EnronOnline.  I think the reports should be named "Kiodex Reports" and branded with the Kiodex logo.  While EnronOnline is delivering the reports, I want our users to easily understand that EnronOnline is not processing the reports and any errors/issues would be Kiodex's responsibility.  Pls. let me know if you agree.
