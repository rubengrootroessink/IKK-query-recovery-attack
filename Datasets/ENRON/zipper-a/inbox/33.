I know flying into Aruba's airport, which is exposed to high winds,  the pilots sometimes line up like that and correct last minute. But this guy looked like a drunk driver. So happy I was not on that plane.

I've seen it before. It is Hong Kong Airport and the guy kicked out the crab at the last possible second. He was seconds from riping the gear off.
