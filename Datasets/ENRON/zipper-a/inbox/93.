Presentation: Vector Pipeline (partnership between Enbridge [Calgary] and Westcoast Energy [Vancouver])
When: Tuesday, June 19 or Wednesday, June 20 (depending on our travel schedule, they can meet either day) 
Where: Livonia, MI (Detroit Area)
Who: Craig Fishbeck (President, Vector), John Donaldson (V.P. Marketing), Amy Bruhn (Manager, Marketing)
Comments: NGPL's presence in the Chicago Area should help; J. Donaldson has stated that Vector on EnronOnline could replace the need for them to hire a marketer; EnronOnline trades on several liquid points that Vector crosses; Vector needs an online presence
