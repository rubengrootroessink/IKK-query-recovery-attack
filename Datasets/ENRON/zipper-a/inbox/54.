I just wanted to let everyone know our time line with respect to NGX:

May 31st - Press release to the industry that Enron's information will be included in the NGX Index starting July 1st, 2001 (Rob Milnthorp).

June 15th - Enron systems are in place to transfer data to NGX (Andy Zipper & Jay Web).

June 30th - NGX is tested and ready to go.

July 1st - Enron's data is included!!!!


If anyone needs help facilitating this process please coordinate with Chris Lambie (974 - 6780).

Regards,

Jon
