Hi, Andy,

I am very interested in the position you advertised. I have a PhD. in X-ray Crystallography, and an MBA in Finance. I have extensive experience in options analysis, and quite familiar with TAGG/ERMS. 
I have a strong financial and quantitative background as you can see from the attached resume.
I'd like to have an opportunity to use my financial and quantitative analysis skills.


Thanks!

Dave
