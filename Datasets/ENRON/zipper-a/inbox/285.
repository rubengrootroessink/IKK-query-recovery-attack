Rika,

 Davis-Besse will probably be using Framatome to perform the repair work on the head crack.  You will probably see wire reports that Framatome expects to be complete with the repair in about 60 days.  We, however, totally disagree with that assessment.  Framatome may be estimating based on total amount of work they have to do, but they are not incorporating any delays for regulatory review and approval.  I believe our July restart forecast is much more realistic.
 
 
Thanks,
Dan
