Hi Andy,

I'm not sure if Andy Lewis explained to you what we were working on with
Enron.  Basically, our team is responsible for creating a performance
simulation to replace Enron's Basic Risk Management course. Along with the
simulation, a Knowledge System (series of html pages) will be delivered to
each learner. This Knowledge System is a series of topics or "chapters"
each consisting of content that will help the learner perform throughout
the simulation. Think of this as a encyclopedia, where the learner can go
to as a source of reference. Topics include, but are not limited to:
Hedging Basics, Risk Identification, Swaps, Options, Commodity
Fundamentals, and Accounting & Reporting.

I've attached the topic outline for Swaps and the practice exercises and
graphics section of the Knowledge System for you to review.
(See attached file: Framework Swaps_Final.doc)(See attached file: Swaps
Graphic ideas and practices_5.doc)

Sheri and I are responsible for this Knowledge System and would like your
help in the Swaps topic. Specifically, we would like you to help us with
practice exercises the learner will complete within the Swaps topic and
graphic ideas that will also support the content in this topic. In
addition, we are hoping you can provide us with some of the questions that
is outlined in the topic outline.(see above)

I will still like to meet with you this afternoon at 3:00pm, so let me know
what your schedule looks like.

Let me know if you have any questions, I can be reached at X5-6687.

Thanks,
Monica L. Brown
