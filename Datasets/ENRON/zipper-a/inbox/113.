Dave:

Just keeping you apprised of our progress.  As I mentioned in today's staff meeting, we are primed to call BofA.  

As described below, our proposed BofA contact works with Gary Hickerson.  Not sure if that's a problem or not; unless I hear from you, I'll go ahead and initiate contact tomorrow.

Best regards,

Mike

Mike,

Just to let you know.. In the FX market I have contacted the following to date:

Dan Almeida Deutsche,
