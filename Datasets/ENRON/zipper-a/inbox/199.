On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
11:00		Credit				Bradford
11:30		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
12:30		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
1pm		Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
1:30pm		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub
2:00pm		HR				Oxley
		
Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32.

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc.

Assume Big Pig will bring 8 people.


Thanks


Louise
