Andy,
 
As you know, I appreciated having had the opportunity to work with you at Enron.  Now that the time has come for me to search for new employment, I wonder if I can ask of you, to write me a letter of recommendation.  In addition, if I can have your consent to give your name as a professional reference during my search for new employment. 
 
I wish you and your family warm and Happy Holidays.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Lydia Cannon
