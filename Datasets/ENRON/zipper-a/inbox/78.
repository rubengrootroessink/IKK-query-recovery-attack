In addition to the follow-up e-mail from the offsite, I want to explore the possibility that when you click the auction tab on EnronOnline you get DealBench functionality.  I know this was explored once before but I want to explore the possibility that we have a single backbone with EnronOnline and customers have a single login to Enron's services, including auctions, data rooms, and deal rooms.

Your thoughts?
