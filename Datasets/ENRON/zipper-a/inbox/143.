Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

We embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow us to focus development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  However, due to what we believe to be inherent deficiencies in the J2EE specification, we have gradually reduced our use of these technologies.  In fact, EnronOnline's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  

The problem areas are performance and enterprise integration.  Specifically, the specification does not allow for sufficient tuning.  The result is that many of the "features" cause significant performance penalties, even when those features are not relevant to the application at hand.  Additionally, as B2B markets evolve, there is a greater need for integration between multiple platforms.  This need is not addressed at all.

It is our perception that the J2EE specification is influenced too heavily by vendor input.  We believe that large end-user customers should have an equal voice in the evolution of the specification.  Such input would be particularly valuable since vendor competition issues would not taint it.  We would welcome an opportunity to participate in such a committee.
