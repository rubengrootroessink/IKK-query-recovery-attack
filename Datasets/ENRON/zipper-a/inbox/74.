Alex Alaniz- He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Houston, Dept. of Chemistry. He is working on a research project in which he is trying to use statistics to reduce dimensions of very large protein folding problems. He has a strong understanding of stochastic differential equations, probability theory and Monte Carlo methods. In addition, he has strong Excel and Fortran skills. Current salary is 28K. He is excited about the opportunity to work for a company like Enron and feels he can contribute a lot because of his Math and Physics background.
