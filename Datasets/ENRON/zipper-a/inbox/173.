Andy:
 
Would you please look into this structure. The intention is to price the structure at the money. The time when they started - the basis diff was 25 cents. I propose to price it as shown below and one at NGI SoCal border minus  IFERC San Juan minus  market price.
 
I have included the LAX (Los Angeles Airport) weather data summary for your info.
 
Please call me if you need additional information.
 
Thanks,
 
Sanjeev
