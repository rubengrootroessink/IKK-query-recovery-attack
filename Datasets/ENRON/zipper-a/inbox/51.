Mike

I attach a letter of intent which I hope covers all the points we discussed this morning. On the basis that you asked for a memorandum of understanding the attached draft is fairly legalistic in tone. If you wanted something more informal let me know.

Paul - let me know if you have any comments.

Jonathan
