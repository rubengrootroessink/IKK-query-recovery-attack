Hi Andy -

Very good to hear from you --

As of the 1st of the month, I am now working for Allegheny in New York, with
Barry Kostiner and Jake Goldberg (not the fitness guru of the same name).  I
called you at home but got your answering machine - send me your work number
to this address and I'll call you sometime during the day tomorrow if that's
convenient.

Alex

Heard you had ended up at Allegheny. In NYC or Hagerstown MD ?

Drop me a line, I want to discuss something with you.

Hope all is well.

Andy
