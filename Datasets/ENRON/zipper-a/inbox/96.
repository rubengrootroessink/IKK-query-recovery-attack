As per our discussion today, I think it will be concluded that Reuters and NYMEX can do what they want, terminals or wallboard.  I am not sure if you want to talk to Whally first before you talk to Reuters.

If possible, I would give Whalley a day or two to talk to John and Lavo.

In the mean time, Mike can see, on an enterprise license for a year, how high they are willing to go.

Your thoughts?

I will also tell Philippe about this if you haven't already.

Also, Webb called me and I will see him tomorrow about planning around your departure.

Andy,

Unfortunately, the only stick we have in this game is increasing the total number of subscriptions to a price point whereby NYMEX passes.

We may as well capitalize on this because:
We can't not sell them terminals (Access will be available if the floor traders want it--  IF THEY WANT IT, THEY WILL GET IT.)
The large spread traders already know where ENE is at
Our competitors have been playing the EnronOnline/ floor arbitrage game since day one (it was part on our success)

REUTERS ABILITIES:

1.	Reuters has the right to limit "wall board" availability; NYMEX has the right to buy terminals from Reuters
2.	Reuters will request "consistency"; in regards to pricing, re-distribution, etc
3.	Do not have the capability of breaking up the data set

OPINION:

Sell it.  25K per month.  Unlimited enterprise license.
