Hi Lydia,

Just to keep you in the loop, apparently Andy will not be in London for this meeting we spoke about yesterday.  We will however, be including him via video conference.  Due to the time difference we have moved the meeting till 5pm (London time) on the 8th June to accommodate Andy's participation.  Would you be able to book a VC room for him please, and advise which room he will be situated in.  The meeting will be 2 hours maximum in duration.

Many thanks
Suzanne
