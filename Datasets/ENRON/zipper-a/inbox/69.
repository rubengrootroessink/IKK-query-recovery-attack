In short, the version of StackManagerServer you are using will no longer work after our next release.  The version you working with is about 9 months old.  There has been significant modifications to the interface, event model, and message types.  

Your version of SMServer cannot be used any longer.  We are still in the process of finishing development.  After we have completed it, we may be able to provide some assistance.  However, there will be little time for you to make modifications prior to our release.

Regards,
Michael
