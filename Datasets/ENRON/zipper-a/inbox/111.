Presentation: Great Lakes Transmission 
When: Monday, June 18 (3:00-4:30) 
Where: Troy, MI (Detroit)
Who: Shiela Walby (Marketing); The main guy is Great Lakes is Art Edmunds [this is who I spoke to] and he will be out of town for several weeks but wants us to meet with Shiela, his rates/pricing manager; An IT person will be at the meeting as well. 
Comments: Art told me that they run daily auctions for both firm and IT; He also told me that they were unable to get rid of much of their firm capacity this past winter; Alliance, Panhandle Eastern and Vector have created a competitive environment for Great Lakes; Art also told me that they rarely sell at their max. rate due to   new competition.
Note: We are meeting with Vector on Tuesday.
