Andy,
 
Attached is the contract draft for NGPL, which I have forwarded to Dave Devine.
 
The contract was originally drafted by Mark Taylor and has been revised by Travis. 
 
I have also reviewed it.
 
Please let me know if you wish to make any comments on it. I informed Dave that the draft I sent him was still subject to internal "departmental approval" - so we can still make changes, if any are necessary (and I can't imagine they will not have any comments!)
 
Dave
