According to the International Coal desk, the three brokers that have expressed interest are:

-	TFS
-	GFI
-	NatSource

Apparently the desk is not as enthusiastic about NatSource from their perspective, though they would be happy to see the other two getting access.

Let me know if I can further assist.

Thanks,
Paul
