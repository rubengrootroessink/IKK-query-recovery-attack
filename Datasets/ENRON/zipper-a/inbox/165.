 	  	 Dear Andrew,

With time running out before Congress finishes business for the year, ranking member on the Senate Energy Committee Frank Murkowski (R-AK) is making a new attempt to pass energy legislation. On Tuesday, the Washington bureau will cover a news conference on Murkowski's plans to announce his new approach to move an energy bill this year. 

Also from Washington on Tuesday, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is the guest speaker at Energy Daily's newsmaker breakfast. Abraham is expected to talk about the status of energy legislation in Congress. The Washington bureau will bring us coverage of the Abraham speech tomorrow. 

The Houston bureau will speak with Raymond James & Associates E&P Energy Team Vice President John Gerdes. Earnings for some companies are down compared to the third quarter last year, but Gerdes says production volumes seem to be in line with expectations. He'll discuss the third quarter during the noon ET newscast on Tuesday. 

PG&E and the California Natural Gas Producers Association are 
co-hosting an informational workshop on Northern California natural gas issues. ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us an update on the workshop on Tuesday. Kym says the meeting will cover a number of topics including discussion of new proposed well connection protocols, a review of the proposed gathering line auction process and a review and discussion on PG&E's proposed plan of reorganization. We'll have all the details on the workshop from the West Coast bureau on Tuesday. 

Goldman Sachs Chairman of the Global Power Group 
Doug Kimmelman will speak with Kelsey Hubbard on Tuesday from 
New York. Kimmelman will discuss the state of the merchant energy business and what the recent economic slowdown will mean for current power projects. Log on during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast to catch Kimmelman. 

Finally from Boulder on Tuesday, E Source Director of Strategic & Marketing Issues John Egan will join us during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast. He'll discuss the E Source teleconference titled, "Creating a Vibrant Retail Electricity Market." 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.
