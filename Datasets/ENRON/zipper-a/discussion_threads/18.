Andy:

It was a real pleasure to meet you yesterday.  I appreciate that you gave me 
the opportunity to tell you who I am, what I have accomplished and what my 
career goals are.  This PRC is critical in my transition to a manager role.  
Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely, Humberto
