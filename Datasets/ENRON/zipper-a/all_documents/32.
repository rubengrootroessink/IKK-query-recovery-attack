Would you like me to schedule a meeting to discuss real time data feeds to 
customers? If so who should attend?

I also would like to follow up with True Quote and Houston Street from a 
business perspective on the exchanges.  Is it ok for me to contact them to 
get a feel on progress on their side.  If so who are the commercial contacts 
at True Quotes and Houston Street?
