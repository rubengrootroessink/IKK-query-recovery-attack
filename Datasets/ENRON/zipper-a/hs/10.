Bob,
We have some good news regarding our client and testing that we uncovered
yesterday.

On Tuesday , during our testing with Enron we were unable to duplicate or
see some of the issues that John Applegate et al were describing and seeing
which concerned me.  We have been working very hard to try to see why this
was happening.

We uncovered 2 things:
1)  When a client application leaves the blue window open that indicates
that the bid or offer is not available, the client stops processing messages
which will cause the client to fall behind.  If this window is left open for
10 seconds, goes away for 2 seconds and is displayed again for 10 seconds,
the client will have fallen behind 18 seconds and took 25 seconds to catch
up.  This is a cumulative issue in that the more times this window is
displayed, the client is consistently falling farther and farther behind
which would explain why after 45 minutes of testing it took 5 minutes to
catch up and display all of the bid or offer not available warning and
confirmations.  We have addressed this problem and are currently testing it
into the evening to ensure that when this window is presented to the user,
the client continues to process updates without causing any backlog.
Included with this correction the label has been changed from ERROR to
WARNING, since this really isn't an error condition.

2)  The second item is related to inconsistent performance and numbers not
updating on the screen, but when the number is selected it updated to the
correct number.  After trying to recreate this problem on numerous machines,
we finally saw the scenario.  It is the result of an older version of the
software running on that machine.  This was verified by running the older
version of the software on multiple machines which resulted in inconsistent
performance and behavior from the client application.    To resolve this
issue, we are in the process of building a new release of the client
application that updates all of the version numbers on the software so that
a new cab download will be triggered which will automatically update all of
the required files on the Client.  This process will ensure that all of the
clients that we are using for testing have the latest version of the
software.  In order for the client to download and install the latest .cab
file, the user will require Administrative Privileges on the computer
installing the new software.

In Summary :
A) It appears that we were testing with different versions of the client
software.
B) We found a problem that resulted in the client falling behind.
C) We have corrected this problem and have been testing for the last several
hours.
D) We changed the wording of the Error Window to indicate a Warning.

Given this information we would like to schedule another test with you later
today, ensuring that we all have the latest software, so that we can all
feel confident that we have evaluated the correct version.

In our testing we have been hitting the software simulating enron updates
and continuous transaction attempts for 45 minutes to and hour with 8
clients.  The performance times between the transaction request and the fill
or fail message remained consistent across all of the clients at 3-5
seconds.

Please feel free to call me @ 603-766-8730 or John Applegate 713-590-5123..

Thanks,
