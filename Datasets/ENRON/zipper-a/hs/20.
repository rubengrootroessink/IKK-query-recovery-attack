Just got off a call with Linda Bradley.  She advised everything is going good, they are still working their interface and working out the bugs when receiving our data and feeding it into their database.  She advised everything is going well, they were out part of last week because of the snow storm up there but they are back at it.  I advised her to contact me if there are any problems with our connections.
 
Also, to my understanding there is a conference call this afternoon, approx 2pm cst with the business people.
