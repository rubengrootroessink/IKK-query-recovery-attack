The attached reflects the changes to paragraph 2 to clarify the $250,000 payment (I have included a marked version to show the change as well as a clean version).  Upon receipt of HoustonStreet's signature pages, I will send by fax and fedex our signature pages to the letter agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement.

Per the conversation between Andy and Frank, the paragraphs regarding the
issuance of the 763,305 shares at the time of the Interface Completion Date
have been removed.  Therefore, we are reverting back to the last draft of
the Letter Agreement, sent by Travis, on 3/28 and hereby attached.

I have accepted the changes and have attached a clean version of the
document.  This will be executed by Frank after the Board meeting and we
will fax a copy to you immediately thereafter.  Please be prepared to sign
the letter agreement at that time so that we can proceed with the wire
transfer of Series C monies.

Best Regards,

Derek Gamble

Importance: High




Gentlemen:

Per my voicemail to Doug Dunn and Derek Gamble, I am attaching a revised
letter agreement addressing the issuance of the volume-based shares.  It
was our understanding that these would be issued to us as well as the
warrant shares, but we discovered that it was not covered by the agreement.

This draft is marked against the draft circulated last night.   Please call
if you have any questions.

Attached please find the draft agreement incorporating our comments.  With
the exception of Board approval, the changes were not intended to be
substantive, but more to conform the Agreement (with defined terms, etc. )
to the transaction documents that we already have in place.
