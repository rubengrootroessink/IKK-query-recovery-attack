Linda:

FYI, I spoke with Bob Shults this afternoon.  We set up a meeting for Monday
morning, 9:00 EST.  Our objectives are to finalize a testing schedule for
the week, discuss the business questions we emailed Bob on Thursday, and
develop specific metrics to define when we are ready for "go live" from
Enron's standpoint.
