Importance:	High

Bob,
It appears that we may have had some confusion around the completed
transactions that were recorded on Houston Street during our demonstration
on Tuesday, May 22nd.  Since we have been unable to verify the timeframes
used, we have extracted from our database all of the transactions that
occurred after 2:45 Central Time through 5:30 Central Time.  We used our
DealCapture Product which enables customers to extract their deals done from
our database.  We are also providing a detailed log containing all of the
transaction responses that we received from Enron that resulting in a FILLED
transaction.  By expanding this timeframe we have the following Trade
Confirmation Details which is confirmed by the FILLED Transaction log and
the DealCapture XML that was generated.

	adams		19
	bptrader		58
