Andy asked me to send you the missed launch dates for your conversation with Devin Wenig.

1st Launch Date Missed:		 April 30th

2nd Launch Date to be missed:		 May 14th

3rd proposed launch date:		 June 4th

Ultimately, I would like them to hit the May 14th target, however, if that is not possible, a May start date would be highly desired.

Also, please thank him for his assistance with Europe.  We are seeing a new responsiveness, however, an additional resource needs to be identified.

Thank you,

Mike Bridges
