I have formatted the volume numbers in the past to show the commas, but I forgot to do that yesterday. Thanks for pointing that out to me. I will make sure to format them in the future and I will send it out to the usual mailing list starting tonight.

Justin, can we get the comma separator for the total qty column ? Looks good though. If we can do that I would like to put this into production for usual mailing list.
