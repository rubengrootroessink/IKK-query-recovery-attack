Two Verbal Confirms.  They decided they could send me their marketing materials.

Mike -

Attached are our latest decks.....the service overview deck and then the
beginnings of the technical discussion deck.....they are coming along
nicely.

Also, on Cinergy and Conoco, I would consider those verbal commits. They
indicated strong enough interest, however, that we are engaging in trying
to get the commit via an LOI.

Joe, your spreadsheet needs to accurately reflect the status of each of
these clients so that we are not misrepresenting anything.

Thanks,

Peggy
