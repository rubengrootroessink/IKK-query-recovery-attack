Greg,
Enclosed is the presentation that Jean-Louis presented yesterday. EDS is
very interested in the opportunities that were discussed.  A suggestion for
a go-forward strategy would be to have a team of EDS experts sit with Enron
Net Works to map the development of the Transaction Hub.  EDS would provide
individuals with both capital markets (with experience setting up
transaction utilities) and energy experience to identify an initial business
plan to build and bring the Hub to market.  The outcome will be a
fifty-thousand foot strategy that can then be driven down to
operationalizing the Hub.

EDS is also determining how EOL can be leveraged through our current
relationships with more discussion to follow.

Please let me know your review of the meeting and if we are in sync going
forward.

Thanks again for traveling to EDS and offerring the opportunity to work with
ENW in this venture.

Cheers,
Jim

Please
