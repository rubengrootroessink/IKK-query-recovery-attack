I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you=
 to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that=
 I don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously play=
ed by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscor=
e the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my =
operations team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping =
my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can ha=
ve an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once=
 in passing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over=
 gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  =
Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be =
out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the righ=
t players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact =
Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your =
support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within=
 operations.  --Sally
