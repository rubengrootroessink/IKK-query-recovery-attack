Hi Julie

Thanks for the feedback.  Useful to know what the Journalists are using EnronOnline for.

Will go ahead and extend Reuters' guest access for a further 2 months.

Regards

Amita

Subject:	EnronOnline Guest Access - media feedback

Following on from the Dow Jones request, I have now had a request from Reuters to extend their guest access.  Please could you let me know if this is possible?

In the meantime, to give an indication of the value of the media guest access programme, I have spoken to both Reuters and Dow Jones to get a feel for how they are using the prices.

According to Dow Jones, the reporters access EnronOnline regularly during the day to check where the prices are and if they see, for example, any sharp movements, they will follow up with a call to a trader.  They are conscious that traders like them to be aware of what is happening in the market when they call, so they feel that this is proving to be an 'invaluable' tool.  In terms of using Enron's prices in their articles, the reporters do use EnronOnline's prices when preparing their market commentary as they have been told by brokers that Enron's prices are pretty reliable (aware that EnronOnline is not an exchange, they will normally confirm the prices with other parties).

The Reuters reporters look at the prices on an almost daily basis and use some of the prices in reporting.  In their view, it helps them not to keep calling the traders constantly, as well as helping them to keep track of the market.  They say that they are 'addicted' to the guest access.
