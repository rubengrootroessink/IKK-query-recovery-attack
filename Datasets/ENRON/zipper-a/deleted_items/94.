Thanks for coming by our offices on Friday.  We learned a lot, found it very
useful, and would like to keep up an active dialogue with you guys.  Andy's
been terrific in all of our interactions, and it was good to meet you in
person, and Rex as well.  Of course, we're also delighted that we could be
better hosts that the NYMEX!

Regards,

Sean
