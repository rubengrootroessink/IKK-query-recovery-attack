Has anything developed on this front?

We have revised the anticipated charge collection based on using standard brokerage fees and projecting 2001 volumes based on Q1 2001.

The total anticipated revenue is $69 million.

However, this is based on previous brokerage rate estimates which should be confirmed before we make any final decisions on this.

Please let me know if it looks like we are going to proceed with this and we will confirm the brokerage rates for each of the commodities.

Thanks,

Dave
