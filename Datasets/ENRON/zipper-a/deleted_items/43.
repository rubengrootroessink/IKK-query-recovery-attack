Element Name: WOMANIUM
Symbol: WO
Atomic Weight: (don't even go there)
Physical properties: Generally soft and round in form.
Boils at nothing and may freeze any time. Melts when
treated properly. Very bitter if not used well.
Chemical properties: Very active. Highly unstable.
Possesses Strong affinity with gold, silver, platinum,
and precious stones. Violent when left alone. Able to
absorb great amounts of exotic food. Turns slightly
green when placed next to a better specimen.
Usage: Highly ornamental. An extremely good catalyst
for dispersion of wealth. Probably the most powerful
income reducing agent known.
CAUTION: Highly explosive in inexperienced hands!

Element Name: MANIUM
Symbol: XY
Atomic Weight: (180 +/- 50)
Physical properties: Solid at room temperature,
but gets bent out of shape easily. Fairly dense and
sometimes flaky. Difficult to find a pure sample. Due to
rust, aging samples are unable to create electricity as
easily as younger samples.
Chemical properties: Attempts to bond with WO any
chance it can get. Also tends to form strong bonds with
itself. Becomes explosive when mixed with KD
(Element: CHILDIUM) for prolonged periods of time.
Neutralize by saturating with alcohol.
Usage: None known. Possibly good methane source.
Good samples are able to produce large quantities on
command.
CAUTION: In the absence of WO, this element rapidly
decomposes and begins to smell.
