Great.

We have a call with Bibi tomorrow morning at 8:15 AM.  He is in NYC with Reuters tonight and tomorrow.  Tonight is just social and hopefully he will keep it that way.  He has a lunch tomorrow with Lynch and would like to discuss things before he has it.

Just come to my office if possible.

Thanks.

GP
