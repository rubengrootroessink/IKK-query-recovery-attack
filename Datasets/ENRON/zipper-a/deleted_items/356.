Here is what I think we could do:

1). We set up a new counterparty type that represents a voice trade submitted through an Enron Internal ID. This is to allow non-registered EOL users to contact their AE and have their credit checked by EOL during transaction process. The system would know then not to check for ETA, GTC etc, etc. We would then load these internal counterparty types into the "Internal BrokerClient" for use by AE's.

2). This counterparty type will be flagged to execute at submitted price as opposed to better of submitted or available. This way originators can embed margin in their deals and have the transactions execute and bridge at the price with the margin in it.

I think we could do this with a 1 to 2 week development effort.
