-- Experience Corps

Experience Corps is an independent, U.K.-based nonprofit company funded by the U.K. government and set up to encourage people to offer their skills and experience to benefit local communities. 

With a target of 250,000 recruited volunteers by March 2004, Experience Corps needed a system to handle recruiting, opportunity matching, and other volunteer processes. Savvion enabled the organization to automate volunteer processes by collecting applicant data, monitoring recruitment, and cross-referencing volunteer databases. Savvion implemented this system in just a matter of weeks.
