Cool on 1 million.  On another note, I've talked to Mark Tawney about your talking to Claudio.  While I would never want to hurt or hinder anyone's career, I've told Mark that I wand Claudio to stay in our group, and he in not currently available to join you.  I'll be happy to look at this again in the future, but he is doing a lot of very valuable work for us.

Thanks for understanding.

Jeff
