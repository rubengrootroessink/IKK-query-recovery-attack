Dear Andy,
I would like to thank you for interviewing me last
Thursday. Through conversations with everyone, I can
feel the vibrant Enron culture. I am excited by this
great opportunity and I??m confident that I can
contribute to your efforts in exploring and utilizing
the wealth of data/information/knowledge in this
potentially fertile area.

To highlight, the following areas of my strengths/skills
are crucial to this effort,
a.	Advanced and broad knowledge base, from large-
scale empirical data mining to option pricing, from
Econometric and Operations research; fairly familiar
with academic world.
b.	Hands-on abilities and real-world intuition.
c.	Managerial experience in leading and
motivating other analysts.

Again, thanks a lot, I look forward to hearing from you.
