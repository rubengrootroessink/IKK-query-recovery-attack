Raj and I will talk tomorrow.  I will tell him we are a no at this time for what they offered. For all the contracting and work it would take to set up a NewCo at that valuation for $5 million working capital, no.  I think we would consider them for a channel and I respect their skills, but to work on a NewCo for that valuation, etc. is not a good use of our time right now.

I understand Reuters is moved to all hands on deck Thursday the 31st.  Webb, Zipper, Shelby, Piper for that meeting.  Does this now conflict with Sungard?

Let me know if and when you hear from C1 or i2.

What is the purpose of Philippe's dinner with McNealy?  Who all will be there?  Did they set it up?  Does Philippe know the purpose? 

How long does it take for BEA to get in the loop?  Do you and Kevin really think they are a player for this?

GP
