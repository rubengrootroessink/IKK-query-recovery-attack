Subject:	Request for Interview

We have received a request from a free-lance journalist, who is writing an article on online energy exchanges.  The article will appear in Cisco IQ, which is a Cisco publication for both internal and external audiences.  EnronOnline is not the only subject.  His interest is in what is it, hwo it works, the future...basically a general overview.

Do we have any interest?

Eric
