Andy -- Mike and I have prepared the attached Reuters press release (including a quote from you) announcing the launch of the EnronOnline Real-Time Quotes product on Reuters.  Could you review and suggest any revisions?  The release will be sent out by Reuters on the day of the product launch.  Thanks.
