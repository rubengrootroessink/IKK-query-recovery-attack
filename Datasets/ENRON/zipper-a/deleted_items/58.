 =09 =09    Dear Andrew,  It's official: Sen. Jim Jeffords is leaving the R=
epublican Party and declares himself an Independent.  This move is going to=
 have repercussions touching aspects in every area of legislation, and will=
 undoubtedly affect the national energy policy.  We'll continue to update y=
ou on this situation from our Washington bureau.     Republicans and Democr=
ats are nearing an agreement on the Electricity Emergency Relief Act.  Comp=
romise language is being discussed behind closed doors, and members hope to=
 resolve their differences when the markup continues Friday morning.   In a=
 continuing effort to promote the Bush administration's energy plan, the De=
partment of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is scheduled to travel to a nu=
clear power plant in Maryland on Friday.  Correspondent Peter Cook is sched=
uled to be along for the ride.  Tuesday, Peter brings us details of his tri=
p to Maryland.    Also on Friday, I'm scheduled to speak with U.S. Chamber =
of Commerce Vice President of Energy Policy William Kovacs. He'll join us f=
rom Washington, D.C. to preview an energy meeting at the U.S. Chamber of Co=
mmerce where Vice President Dick Cheney will talk about the White House ene=
rgy plan.  Catch my interview with Kovacs in the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.   =
  ENL's Gale Smith reports the Houston bureau is scheduled to give us an up=
date from the ongoing story of 70,000 royalty owners who are filing a class=
 action lawsuit against ExxonMobil.  The royalty owners allege Exxon unfair=
ly determined the royalties they should receive from natural gas and natura=
l gas liquids sales.  On Wednesday, a San Antonio U.S. District Judge certi=
fied the lawsuit filed by a Houston law firm.  Gale says the Houston bureau=
 will bring you reactions from Exxon officials on Friday.     Dorothea El M=
allakh, the Executive Director of the International Research Center for Ene=
rgy and Economic Development is also scheduled to join us from our Houston =
bureau.  She says conservation is not synonymous with deprivation, and the =
current energy issue is not a problem with a quick solution.  We'll bring y=
ou more from Mallakh in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   Keep in min=
d things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests c=
