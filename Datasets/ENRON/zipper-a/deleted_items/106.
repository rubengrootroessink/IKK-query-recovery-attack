Steve,

I understand that you are rolling this product out for internal users only. In that case I have a couple of thoughts

1). I have no problem with an internal launch of this. If external, I have a very big problem.

2). I think it would be better for the relationship between ETS and ENW had you informed us of your intention to do this. You are using the EnronOnline brand and whether that is internal or external it is ours to manage. as this was a complete surprise to us. It doesn't really seem like just a pipeline risk management product.

3). Because this was not part of our development and operations effort, we cannot support the product technically. There will be no change management. Given the amount of changes we do to our back end there is a high likelihood that in the future your product will cease to function

4). It looks pretty good and I commend your ingenuity. 

If you disagree with any of this please feel free to let me know.

Andy Zipper
