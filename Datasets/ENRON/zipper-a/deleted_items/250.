Mark Palmer and Vance Meyer would like your approval of the attached press release for the EnronOnline Million Trades milestone.  The messages are based on our discussion with Mark a week ago.  After your approval, they will send to Whalley, Frevert, Investor Relations and Skilling.  Since we will probably hit the milestone by Wed., please approve today as soon as possible. The release will go out when we hit the milestone.

Thanks for your assistance.

Kal Shah
