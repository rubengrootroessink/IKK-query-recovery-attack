Please give Chris Edmonds a call.  He is calmed down now concerning the potential launch on 6/4. He is not threatening with Broker client. They are still moving ahead on that.  I told Chris you would call to check up on things including the status of broker client.  Just goodwill call.  Thanks

Have you called the Nymex?

40 trades on broker client today -  100 by quarter end.

Can I call Joe Robertson (NYMEX metals) or do I need to talk to you first?
