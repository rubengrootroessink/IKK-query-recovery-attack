I talked with Ed Fraim this morning.

He has a meeting with Phil Lynch at 11 our time regarding:

Ed and I agreed that more resources are necessary to i.) make EnronOnline Real Time Quotes successful and ii.) to fully develop other business opportunities that may arise between our companies (specifically time and sales daily updates and historical transactions)

Ed told me that Reuters is looking at creating an Enron Strategic Relationship position.  Ed thinks that it is between him, Rob Garfield some lady from London.  I told Ed that we would support him in that role but he needs more resources and more stroke.  

When you talk with Phil can you please ask that he personally moves this agenda forward?
