4th Annual Interactive Energy 2001 - CALL FOR PARTICIPATION 
Why You Should Participate: 
Timing - Utility deregulation in Texas will take place January 1, 2002.  Interactive Energy 2001 will provide the core issues for discussion that will shape the year 2002 and beyond in respect to the challenges and solutions affecting energy companies striving to compete in the newly deregulated utility industry.
Location - Nestled in downtown Houston, the George R. Brown Convention Center is the ideal gathering spot for energy IT executives.  Enron, Reliant Energy, ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, Texaco and Dynegy, among other global energy companies, set their roots within a five-mile radius of this facility.
Schedule - The Interactive Energy conference management team has devised the agenda for delegates, who are currently re-thinking their e-business strategies and B2B exchanges, to explorer the technologies that will continue to add value for the industry.  The exhibit floor hours are power-packed with technology demonstrations, luncheons and receptions offering multiple networking opportunities.
