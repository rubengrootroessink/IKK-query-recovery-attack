Thanks.  We had looked at OpenLink/Abacus last year, and we concluded that they were heavily risk control/management weighted.  We are concerned that they may try to "swim downstream." They are relatively small (about 100).  We will try to keep an eye on them...

OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile.
