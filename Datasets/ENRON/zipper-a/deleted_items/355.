Some questions:

Is Bridges set up to see Carghill?   Does Hickerson have any products out yet and is that all we would be required to do for him?  Has Carghill signed a CA?

What is the latest with Dow as it relates to Net Works?

What are your thoughts and next steps on GM?

How are we doing on a contract with service levels between EnronOnline and EWS?  Do you belive that this is a good thing in the first place?

Should we try to build a case to start charging for people to get at the liquidity on EOL?

Is Shults going to find a clearer and get some locals and institutions as sub users to a clearing master?

How is the Kiodx product coming?

How are we doing with the ICE API and arb engine?

Just curious.
