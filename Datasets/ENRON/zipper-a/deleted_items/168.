Mike:

As we discussed a few minutes ago, here is the latest and greatest NDA between us and Cargill.  As I mentioned, Greg has been extremely focused on getting NDA's in place before substantive discussions occur, so we'll need to get this in place before our next significant interaction with Cargill.

Note Greenberg's comments.  Given the events of the last few days, I haven't followed up with our Cargill contacts yet, but we promised them we'd get back to them by yesterday.  I would like to hear from Andy on the non-solicitation issue, but in my mind it should not be a problem to concede this point to Cargill.  It looks like our lawyers would pop a blood vessel if we conceded on the Minnesota/New York law issue; maybe we concede on the first and they concede on the second.

I will also forward you (via separate e-mail) the other key communications we have had with Cargill.

Jake and I are looking forward to transitioning this and our other agricultural contacts over to you as soon as possible.  Please let me know when we can discuss this, and we can call Cargill this afternoon.

Best regards,

Mike

Jake -

The Cargill changes are acceptable except for (1) the deletion of the non-solicitation provisions and (2) the change back to Minnesota law.  The non-solicitation provision is a business call and relates to the disclosures being made and individuals involved in the project.  If Cargill will have contact with key EOL IT personnel, the non-solicitation should be part of the agreement.  As to the change of law, we cannot accept Minnesota and must have New York as this is a neutral forum.
