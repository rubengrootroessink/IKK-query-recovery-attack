Hi Andy,

Re our tel conversation.  I've had another idea which, if you are receptive,
will actually help me get a much larger across the board buy-in to the concept
that you have presented.  If your team would be willing to come back to NY next
Thursday, I would be able to get a larger cross-section of individuals to attend
a meeting here than could come down to Houston.  I personally believe this will
improve the chances of getting a wider level of support in Reuters, which at
this stage is important given some of the concerns that have been raised.  Why
don't you have a think about the feasibility and i will call you tomorrow to
discuss.  I understand the issues why a demonstration in Houston would work
better.  However in terms of making positive progress, I would recommend that
this would be the best way forward.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Andy,

I just wanted to do a note to confirm that Jim Perrello will be visiting you at
1.00pm this Friday.  I have attached a recent press release we issued announcing
Jim's appointment as CEO of Reuters Liquid Markets.  As discussed, the goal of
Friday's meeting is for Jim to provide feedback on the applicability of the
EnronOnline technology to the financial markets and particularly if, with little
customization, it could be used in the commercial paper marketplace.

I have copied Jim and would appreciate if you could email the details of where
he should go on Friday.

Cheers,
Simon
