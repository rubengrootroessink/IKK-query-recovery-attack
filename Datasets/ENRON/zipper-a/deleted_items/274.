Dear Lydia,

It was great speaking with you. I was advised by  Ms. Kitchen's
office to touch base with Mr. Zipper for a presentation. As we
discussed, I am enclosing a brief profile of Daksh for your review.
(PDF file attached)

We provide online contact management services (such as
e-mail, chat etc.) for both eBusiness and traditional-economy
players embracing the web. Our clients include Amazon.com,
Intuit Inc. and PayPal Inc. (the largest Internet payment
service with over 6 million customers). We are currently
operating at an annualized volume of about 3 million
e-interactions and transact with over 30 million customers
in the US on behalf of our clients. We have now close
to 650 people and have extensive experience on multiple
contact management platforms including Kana, eShare,
Mombassa, Siebel, Talisma, Amazon.com proprietary
platform etc.

You could also visit our website www.daksh.com

the team and services we offer.

Key benefits we offer include:

* Unique co-sourcing model (operating through dedicated
  teams, customized processes and close-knit relationships)

  your metrics

  base

I would really appreciate an opportunity to set up a
longer conversation on this opportunity with our
Head of Business Development, Arijit who is based in
New Jersey.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
