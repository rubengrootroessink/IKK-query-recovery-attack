Yes we should disconnect connectivity.  I will confirm with Andy concerning the physical hardware.

Bob,

I just want to confirm if we should pull full connectivity for HoustonStreet.  Meaning, any cabling which were done to connect to our network and shutting down any servers which provided information to them.  Let me know if you have any questions.
