Coal is an area we hadn't thought of. I suspect it might prove difficult, but it's worth investigating.

My perspective on suggested assignments:

Ag : Mike Bridges/Carl Carter
Petchems/Chems: DISCUSS
Coal: DISCUSS
NGL's (storage and terminaling):DISCUSS
Energy (Gas and Power): Suggest we revise the list and agree strategy before anyone is assigned to chase.
Energy (Crude and Refined): John Cummings
Gas Storage: Bob Shults/Leonardo Pacheco
Pipelines:Dave F/Carl Carter
Pulp and Paper: John Cummings
Financial Services: Dave F/Mike Bridges
Legacy: As currently contacted

The ones I have marked DISCUSS are ones which might be split amongst John Pavetto, John Allario, Mike Haney and Jake Staffel.

Also: There might be some worth in bandwidth, which is not on the list.

Relevant Experience

Bob Shults used to deal with gas storage and knows some of the players.
John Cummings used to trade oil before getting into Pulp and Paper.
Mike B. and Carl have both traded in ags.
Mike B. and I have held or have scheduled meetings with RBC, Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC, TD.
Carl was responsible for getting the Enron pipes off the ground on EnronOnline and is familiar with their products.

	-Crude and Refined (with particular emphasis on Supply and Trading orgs of majors and independents)
