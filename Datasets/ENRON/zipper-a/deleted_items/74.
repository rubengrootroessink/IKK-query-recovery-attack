Hi Andy,
	I booked Thursday, June 7th from 5 to 8 PM at the Grasshopper downtown.  We have a nice, private room upstairs. Everyone under you and Jay totaled about 140 people, not including non networks people.

Please set one up for internal attendance. Use our original figures for attendance, i.e. all of EOL and 25 to 30 non networks people (whalley, lavorato, shankman et al). come see me with questions.
