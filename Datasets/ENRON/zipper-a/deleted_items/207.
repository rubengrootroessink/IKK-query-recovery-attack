Mark can you set up a full blown demo for this guy. I have a commitment from Simon that Reuters will try to keep it to two groups looking at demo's here.
Let me know if thee is a problem.

Thanks
Andy

Hi Andy,

I just wanted to do a note to confirm that Jim Perrello will be visiting you at
1.00pm this Friday.  I have attached a recent press release we issued announcing
Jim's appointment as CEO of Reuters Liquid Markets.  As discussed, the goal of
Friday's meeting is for Jim to provide feedback on the applicability of the
EnronOnline technology to the financial markets and particularly if, with little
customization, it could be used in the commercial paper marketplace.

I have copied Jim and would appreciate if you could email the details of where
he should go on Friday.

Cheers,
Simon
