QUOTE OF THE DAY:

"If [Oracle CEO Larry] Ellison thinks internally developed
applications are such a bad idea, why does Oracle sell
application development tools? And if Ellison and Oracle
think third-party applications are such a bad idea, why does
the company work so hard to get all those other application
vendors to use its DBMS?"

--Bob Lewis, Survival Guide columnist.
