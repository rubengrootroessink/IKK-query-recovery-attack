HoustonStreet:  Full connectivity to the stage environment was resolved on Tuesday.  Testing is being done with the number of updates flowing through our sys to theirs.  The number of updates were on avg close to 20-40 per second.  Ricky Oberai was not able to view their web site as they do not have their .cab file ready to load on our side to view the price updates as we send them.  They have advised they are seeing the prices on their side internally.  John Applegate called and advised they should have the .cab file to download sometime tomorrow.  There is more testing scheduled for 8am Central in the morning.
 
TrueQuote:  Finally got a hold of Steward Clark regarding any type of issues.  Testing with sending data with Ricky at 5pm today.  Also, they have upgraded their servers over the last couple of weeks.  They are handling approx, 10-20, maybe max 25 in a couple of bundles.  Finished a call with Stewart and Ricky with testing and TQ will be looking into peeling off a process which is eating up a large number of resources.  What has been stated by Stewart is they are receiving another server tomorrow and will migrate the database or another component to that box to resolve any resource issue.
 
ClickPaper:  As of Tuesday, they had filled 3 trades and one failed, the failed which was the test ran on Friday for testing purposes.  They are working out some bugs in the TEST/STAGE env for exchange.
