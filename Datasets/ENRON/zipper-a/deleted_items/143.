Dear Andy

I work with TechSpan, Inc. and we have been very excited over Enron's
initiatives in the e-commerce arena and wanted to explore opportunities of
working as a Strategic e-commerce development & integration partner. We plan
to achieve this through an unique methodology which couples high technical
competency and low cost structure for the Energy Industry.

You would be pleased to note that such a strategic partnership and our
unique process could save Enron close to 50% on development & integration
costs and yet enhance competitive advantage on various e-commerce
initaitives. As an example, we have established  credentials of completing
projects within $ 1.0 Million as against the projected $ 2.0 M for the same
projects (based on proposals from Big Consulting firms).

I see a good amount of synergy in a partnership with Enron , given our
experience in the e-business development space with over 600 consultants in
our Strategic Sourcing , Application/B2B Integration , Content Management,
CRM and Wireless Practices. Our competencies are built around the solutions
of leading e-commerce vendors such as MOAI, Ariba, eBreviate, Webmethods,
TIBCO, Vignette, Interwoven, E.Piphany, Kana, Epicentric, TopTier, BEA ,
etc.

Moreover, our development experience with more than 35
Exchanges/e-Marketplaces including Forest Express, e2Open, RMX/Chevron,
American Petroleum Exchange, etc and Fortune companies such as Chevron,
Goldman Sachs, Barclays Bank, Meryl Lynch, HP, Cisco has honed our skills
around the business processes in the e-marketplaces, on-line colloboration,
supply chain automation, e-procurement, e-sourcing, etc.

Andy, We would like to understand your technology objectives and see if we
can bring additional value to you through our expertise. I would like to set
up a telephone call next week with you for about 30 minutes, share our value
proposition with you and agree on steps to explore areas where TechSpan can
add value.
A brief profile of our company and capabilities are detailed below for your
kind perusal. I look forward to our discussions on synergies and mutual
value propositions.

Thanks and regards,
