Andy,

Following is a list of Areas and Companies which was previously circulated among the group. These represent the companies and areas which we felt had the greatest potential.

Since we originally prepared the list, we have started chasing gas Storage companies. Bob and I are meeting with Paul Bieniawski (Enron Storage Origination) on Wednesday to put together the US target list.

We have not yet pursued the Energy companies as we felt the overlap with Enron's core EnronOnline activities would be too strong.

John Cummings is in the process of putting together a pulp and paper list.

The areas which I see as candidates for our primary focus are:

	Agriculture
	Chemicals
	FX
	Gas Storage
	Pipelines
	Pulp and Paper


Would appreciate your thoughts . . .

Dave
