Good Morning,

No problem, I have gotten good at cold calling people to peddle my
wares. New Power shall not be spared.

Yes, the engagement has been great, the two families met a few weeks ago
for the first time, and all went well. Although I think her father
believes I am just marrying Wendy for her green card (just kidding).

Yes, Sunny is gone and so are 15 million of his closest friends. And I
believe you are correct that Alex starts at Allegheny today, although I
don't think it is trading related.

I will speak to you later this week.

Best Regards,

Jorg
