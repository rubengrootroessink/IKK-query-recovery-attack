Hi Andy

Hope you have had a chance to review our earlier details and hopefully it
would have given you further insights into our capabilities.

During the recent Board meeting with Goldman Sachs, our Enron strategy was
discussed and we indicated our correspondance with you. All of us are very
exited and working on ways of initiating the process. Moreover, due to the
strategic nature of partnership, our Management has also decided to invest
in developing this association.

I would discuss the proposition (from our Senior Management) during a
telecon and you could assess the feasibility.

Meanwhile, some areas that we are currently working with Goldman Sachs,
Nortel, Chevron, HP, etc are indicated below and we could replicate the same
with Enron:


1.	Module Development or enhancements to existing applications
      - Portal
      - Adaptor/Connector Development
      - Integrating online trading apps with Back End systems
      - Ariba customization/enhancements
      - Content Management
      - e-Procurement &  EBPP
      - other application specific integration

2.	Maintenance & enhancements (Could be done in India for cost saving
and round the clock operations)
3.	Re-engineering, Migration and porting for your existing applications

4.	QA

Andy, we are confident that this proposition of ours would be very
attractive and would go a long way in developing a strong association.

Could we discuss our business proposition this week ? I could call your
admin assistant tommorow (6/5) and fix up a suitable time for the call (10 -
15 Minutes Max.) We could follow this up with a technical meeting to
identify specific areas, should you feel comfortable with our proposition.

Looking forward to our discussions.

Thks, Arvind

Company)


Dear Andy

Thanks for your Mail. I sincerely hope you were able to get a high level
overview of our company. Further to my earlier mail, i am enclosing the
information which could provide further insight into our company. Pls
include them in your assessment process and give me a feedback if you
require any further clarification. We look forward to meeting you and your
team for an  presentation and the value we could bring to Enron. In the
presentation, we would cover our Methodology, Processes, Competencies,
Clients , Case Study & our economical/cost effective deployment processes.

Some synergies i perceive; Enron's initiative in ClickPaper could map well
based on our experience in Forest Express , EnronOnline could map into our
experience with RMX/Chevron or American Petroleum Exchange, Dealbench.com
maps well with our experience with eBreviate on the hosted ASP model for
eRFP,Auctions,Supplier Search. Moreoever, our development labs in India
could add great value for your module development, ongoing support,
maintenance, QA, Porting work; deploying a very low cost structure.

ambitions and clearly articulated vision of being a leader in the e-commerce
consulting space. We have achieved major milestones in being a $ 67.0

our customers and partners. Though the above are some achievements in the
past (giving you a base comfort factor on our long term stability), we are
keen in discussing what value we could bring to Enron, now and in the
future.
