Greg.

Welcome back!

Please advise ASAP whether or not your group is willing to give Bloomberg live access to Steel quotes on EOL, as the Paper group is willing to do. This live or not format will determine the form and substance of the agreement with Bloomberg.

I can not go forward with this negotiation with Bloomberg without knowing the format of the information, we will provide.

Thanks,

Greg,

As a follow-up to my voicemail today,if we do not want to give Bloomberg access to live quotes on EOL, Bloomberg is insisting on a very complex and most onerous and one-sided agreement, which is counter to Enron corporate policies.  

That Bloomberg long form is very inflexible and will take protracted negotiation. Please check with Andy to see if we can give them live access, just as the Paper group is willing to give them on EOL and Clickpaper.

Bloomberg has given the Paper Group a simple onepage letter authorization, which is acceptable to Enron. If we would give them live access,like the Paper Group, this authorization letter could be resolved immediately.

Please advise soonest.
