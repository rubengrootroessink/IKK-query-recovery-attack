Your minion request an answer to a question.

Hi Andy,

Despite the dot com melt down, and California setting back energy
deregulation, we at gromco are still alive. I was encouraged by Eugene
Lockhart's comments last month that New Power spends on average $140 to
acquire a residential electric or nat gas customer. You can, I'm sure,
see where this is going. We would be delighted to bring customers to New
Power for substantially less, and I think we are in a good position to
do so. Requests for alternative energy suppliers has dramatically
increased in the last 6 months, unfortunately alternatives have not,
since many suppliers have left the market.

At your leisure, could you find out who I should talk to at New Power
about customer acquisitions? I know that they are a separate company,
but hopefully you have some interaction with them.

Thanks in advance for your help, thoughts and opinions.

I know you are doing well professionally and hopefully also personally.
I, Senor Blas Pina, am getting married on December 1, 2001. Hard to
believe, but very good and exciting. I still live in Houston, but am
plotting my return to Boston, or at least the Northeast. I still keep up
with almost all the members of the former Coral risk management group.
Sunny left for Williams last week, on not so good of a note, so they are
looking for a new option trader.

Best regards and take care.

Jorg
