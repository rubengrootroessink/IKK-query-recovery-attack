Understood.  Please know that when I do travel I do take efforts to get the most out of the trip and keep my expenses to a minimum.  You have been very busy lately and I have been keeping Dave Forster informed as to my actions and what I was up to.   I will try to do a better job of getting you feedback/guidance and letting you know what I am doing.

On an unrelated issues.  It would be good to get guidance from you on how you want us to handle breaking up the markets.  You have assigned 2 and in some cases 3  people on each market.  Are we supposed to split up the companies, work together as a team on deals, or what.  With Jake for example, he does not really have energy background, so I am a little reluctant putting him in front of a high probability prospect by himself.  I have tried to bring along Jake or Leonardo to the meetings I have been having.  For local meetings that is okay, but there may be a few meetings in the future that will require travel and if expenses are an issue, how do you want to handle this?  You do not need to answer this now, but if you could think about it and give me a few comments I would appreciate it.

JC

I understand; however my request stands. I would like a heads up whenever you are planning a trip like this, it is the same I ask of all my direct reports.

Thanks
