Greg --

I definitely agree with your assessment.  We have a few other fish to chase=
 right now before we give up the boat.

A few thoughts:  TIBCO is proposing a sales channel arrangement that essent=
ially keeps Enron very much in the software business.  If we decide that we=
 are comfortable having a foot in the software business for a period of tim=
e, we can always sign up sales channels, including TIBCO, whenever we are r=
eady to do so.  Collaborating with a channel partner is a lot of work; in f=
act, initially it is actually more difficult than doing everything yourself=
.  So before we jump into the channels world, we would need to decide that =
we are ready to put the resources to the effort.  Regards.

-- Rex

Read this and let's get together maybe Friday afternoon to discuss.

I am inclined to tell them no thanks for nowand chase some bigger fish.

Greg,
=20
Thanks again for  our discussion of last week.  As we discussed, TIBCO rema=
ins  very interested in collaborating with Enron on the commercialization o=
f the  Enron Online software.  We agree that a significant part of the chal=
lenge  with commercializing a software asset like Enron Online is to get it=
 "out  of the starting blocks;" that is, to get the first few customer sale=
s that  set a full-scale market opportunity in motion. =20
=20
We  would like to work with Enron to overcome the "starting blocks"  challe=
nge by acting as the sales and marketing agent for the software.   Enron wo=
uld retain all IP, but grant the right to resell the software to  TIBCO.  A=
s a reseller, TIBCO would share in the revenue from the sale of  the softwa=
re.  For reselling, we would typically receive up to 45% of the  sale, depe=
nding upon the precise nature of TIBCO's responsibilites for the  marketing=
 and selling activities.  Similar to our discussions to date,  Enron involv=
ement in the sales process would remain critical.  The  involvement of an S=
I like Accenture would also continue to be important, but  TIBCO would act =
as the primary sales agent and apply its marketing capabilities  and sales =
force to selling the Enron software.  Again, we would be passing  the Enron=
 software through our sales channels without owning any of the  IP.  Based =
on 6 months to 1 year of activity we could then revisit whether  or not Enr=
on is interested in selling the IP to TIBCO.
=20
In  addition, though, we also believe there is a bigger opportunity for TIB=
CO and  Enron to collaborate that would yield greater benefitsfor both part=
ies.  That is, Enron could take an equity stake in TIBCO as  part of a larg=
er agreement for TIBCO to generally act as the partner for  commercializati=
on of Enron software assets.  We assume  that Enron has multiple software a=
ssets it would consider commercializing and a  broader agreement with TIBCO=
 would enable Enron to establish a process for  software commercialization =
that could be repeated for multiple assets.  The  nature of the agreement b=
etween Enron and TIBCO would be broader than just  resale, in that TIBCO wo=
uld assume the responsibility for all aspects of turning  the asset into a =
packaged software product and developing the related marketing  programs, i=
n addition to selling the products.  Enron would still retain  the IP to th=
e software assets, however.  Also, as a TIBCO investor, Enron  would see va=
lue not only in the revenue from software sold but also in the  appreciatio=
n of TIBCO stock, and all this value would accrue without Enron  giving up =
any IP. =20
=20
Obviously, this approach yields value over time from a software asset  rath=
er than up front, but it offers five key benefits.  First, it  provides a r=
epeatable process for commercialization of Enron software  assets--not just=
 Enron Online; second, it overcomes the "starting  blocks" problem while al=
lowing Enron to retain its IP and still take  advantage of TIBCO's software=
 commercialization processes and expertise; third,  it allows Enron to rece=
ive revenue from both software sales and TIBCO stock  appreciation; and, fi=
fth, it creates a larger software commercialization  framework that should =
have value in and of itself.
=20
We  hope that we can find a way to work with Enron on its software commerci=
alization  efforts, and we'd like to continue to explore the ideas here, in=
 addition to any  variations you may see as alternatives.

Thanks,
