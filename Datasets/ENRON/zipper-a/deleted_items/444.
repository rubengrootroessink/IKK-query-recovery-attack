I am not paying for either conference.  It is rather a larger concentration of companies and I felt a more efficient way to access the market opportunity for our products in pulp & paper & lumber.  The alternative is to fly around the country to visit them individually.  These 2 conferences hapnned to be back to back and have a decent roster of companies attending.
