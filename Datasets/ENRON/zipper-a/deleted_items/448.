The DealBench business case applies but the technology stinks.  We are planning to redesign DealBench with the idea to allow it to integrate with EOL.  The concept is to allow a product to evolve from auctions to principal to specialist based markets.

Short term, GSS can try to use DB.

Michael

Why wouldn't we use the deal bench auction platform ? This provides for open auctions with participants changing their bids in real time, no ?
