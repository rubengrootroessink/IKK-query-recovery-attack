My usual questions.

Are we doing this because we have to legally or that we want to or that TrueQuote wants to?

If we do one, what is the objective?  

Your thoughts on this?

Attached is a draft press release regarding the deal between EnronOnline and TrueQuote.  This is a follow-up to last year's announcement.  The system is being tested today.  If the testing goes as planned, they expect to release this when the system goes live next week, which could be as early as Monday, June 4.

If you have any comments, please forward to me by Monday, June 4 at 10:00 am.  Thanks.

Eric
