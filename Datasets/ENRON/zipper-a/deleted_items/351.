I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.

I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.

A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.
$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.

I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. Patience.

Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.

I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix. It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy.
