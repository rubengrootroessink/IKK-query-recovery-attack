Andy,

Carl and Leonardo were not included on this email. I think it is important to keep them involved with the marketing teams (as they were before). In particular, they provide valuable knowledge about how EnronOnline actually works to people who may not be so familiar with these details.

To address this, could you re-send the email with Carl and Leonardo assigned to specific teams? An alternative would be to send an amendment identifying that they will work with all the teams, but I'm keen to ensure they don't feel like some kind of 2nd-class support. They have been instrumental in preparing presentations, materials, company lists, research and contract precedents and they would very much like to continue to play an important role in the marketing and execution and not just to be seen as some kind of administrative support.

Thoughts?

Dave

Please read the attached document as it lays out what our focus will be from a product standpoint as well as a market one. If anyone has any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
