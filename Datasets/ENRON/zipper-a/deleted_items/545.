      <p>Dear Andrew,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to "Andrew Zipper" <andy.zipper@enron.com>, who belongs to

<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p><b>Congress is out of town</b>, but we've still got plenty of energy
news from Washington.  The <b>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
meets</b> on Tuesday.  One of the issues on the FERC's agenda is a
<b>complaint filed against the California Independent System
Operator</b>.  Some companies allege the ISO is giving the California
Department of Water Resources preferential market treatment in its new
role as California's main power purchaser.  We'll bring you the latest
from the FERC on Tuesday. 
<p>ENL's Washington bureau will also cover the <b>release of the North
American Electric Reliability Council's Winter Assessment</b> on
Tuesday.  The new NERC report will be released at 9:30 a.m. ET from the
National Press Club in Washington.
<p>Also on Tuesday, ENL's Alison Kosik will bring us more from the
<b>Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Conference</b> in
Washington.  The event focuses on the <b>latest in clean coal
innovation</b> and the prospects for coal-fired generation in the U.S.
<p>Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports, many companies feel
<b>wild price swings could be eliminated with more accurate weather
predictions</b>.  On Tuesday, Kim talks with <b>Reliant Energy</b> about
steps that can be taken to minimize weather risks.
<p><b>Ivanhoe Energy Vice President of Investor Relations John
MacDonald</b> talks with our Houston bureau about plans his company has
for <b>Gas-to-Liquids production</b>.  This type of motor fuel is
odorless and emissions-free.  We'll have more from MacDonald on Tuesday.

<p>From the NASDAQ on Tuesday, <b>ESAI Power and Gas Services Director
Edward Kraples</b> will join us.  During the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast,
he'll talk about the amount of <b>investment needed to keep Northwest
power prices from escalating</b>.
<p>Broadcasting Note: Thanksgiving is this Thursday and the ENL staff is
preparing the turkey.  The markets are <b>closed Thursday and Friday, so
we'll be dark</b>.  
<p>Wrap Note: In response to many viewer requests, starting today we're
going to <b>add some of the day's commodity settles</b>.  We hope you'll
enjoy this new addition to the daily wrap.
