Hello, 
I sent theses resumes to Mike Bridges and Bob Shults. Please note the second resume, Sean Smith, as I believe him to be the strongest fit.
As promised I will continue to surface talent, your feedback is much appreciated.

Hello,
This is Paul Weinberger, senior recruiter EWS working with Ryan Seleznov. Last Week I met with Andy Zipper who wants me to find orginators with an e-ccomerce combination background. I am attaching three resumes in hopes that you can give me feedback so I can better help your department. This feedback helps me zone in on exactly what to look for. If there is a time we can meet that would be great or please respond via email.
