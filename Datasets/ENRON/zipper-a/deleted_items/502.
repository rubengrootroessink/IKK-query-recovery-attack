Going okay.  I have been going at night a lot as our weekends are filled with 3 different sports now.  Been doing a fair amount of IFR but no actual.  Getting night landings back into shape was amusing.  Didn't break anything.  How much flying do you are you doing in actual IFR?  We don't have stormscopes or anything so a chance of embedded tstorms means I don't go.  I'm hoping they get another Bonanza or Mooney or something.  I would rather get a complex sign-off on the club's insurance nickel than my own.  Still angling to buy a plane at the end of the year.  I'm thinking of a Grumman Tiger.  They are faster than anything with fixed gear (other than a Cirrus), pretty cheap, and fine for one or two people.  Since I'm not allowed to take the kids, that's okay.

Don't know about the AGA....Seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right.

I flew to little rock last weekend for a BPPP bonanza school and had a really cool instructor who was a retired colonel in USAF and F4 pilot. Lots of good stories. Beautiful weeknd for flying.
Saw Jack Hirsch but didn't ask him about his club's bonanza...

How is yor flying going ?
