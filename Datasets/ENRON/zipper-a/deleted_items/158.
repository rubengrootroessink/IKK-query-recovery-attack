Andy,

Sarah Novosel called from our Washington office. 

As you know, FERC have requested to learn about EnronOnline.

They would like to come here on the afternoon of Tuesday, June 5 and receive our standard public presentation (one of the people coming is a person whom I presented to several months ago and he requested that we give the same presentation again, but updated for current data).

I am available that afternoon and can do the presentation. Would you like to attend as well or instead of me?

Dave
