Thanks for looking into it. 
 
If you want we can sell you the spread between nov/mar to jan/feb HDD basis. If this helps.
 
If you would like to propose this any other way that will make it doable for you, pl let me know.
 
The present bids are in the neighborhood of $120,000
 
Please let me when can we get together for lunch next week.
 
Thanks again,
 
Sanjeev.
