Jarett,

It was fun talking to some old colleagues. I agree with continuing a dialogue and who knows maybe at some
stage in the future we might get LEH & ENE to work together.

I appreciate the time that you guys made for us.

Kind REgards

Philippe

Philippe,
 
I received your  NDA.  I have referred it to one of our senior legal officers, Mr.. Scott  Kimmel (212-526-2439; email sckimmel@lehman.com << File: mailto:sckimmel@lehman.com >> ). Can you have one  of Scott's counterparts contact him directly so that we can sign the  NDA?  
 
Thanks very  much,
Jarett
