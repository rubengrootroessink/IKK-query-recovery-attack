Mark Greenberg is trying to get back in touch with their attorney.  I called Alan Kurzer Thursday and Mark called their attorney Friday.  We're still waiting on a response to the renegotiated definitive agreement.  Once that is finalized (should be any day now), it goes up to the parent for final approval.
