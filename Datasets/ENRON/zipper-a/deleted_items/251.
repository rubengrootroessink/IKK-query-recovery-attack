Andy -- To make a long e-mail chain below short -- a reporter from the Economist interviewed Jeff Skilling and Greg Piper about what makes Enron successful in e-Commerce.  Since he knows Accenture is one of our consulting companies, he contacted them to ask them the same question.  Their PR dept. and ours is asking for direction on whether Accenture should talk to this reporter.  

Mike and I think we should just request Accenture to not talk to this reporter since they are under a confidentiality agreement with Enron.  

I'll let our PR dept know, unless you feel otherwise.

Kal

Greg/Andy/Kal -- 

Not clear to me if this is strictly Accenture's work for Credit or for EOL.  Not sure if they've worked for us, but I presume we don't want them taking ANY credit for our success given our origination goals and messages!

NOT SURE WHO THE CONTACT WITH ACCENTURE WOULD BE ON THIS, BUT PLEASE CALL ME BEFORE MOVING FORWARD.  VIJAY WAS HERE AND HAS INTERVIEWED JEFF SKILLING, GREG PIPER, MIKE MCCONNELL AND OTHERS IN THE ORGANIZATION.  I WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COORDINATE.

MEREDITH SENT THIS TO ME KNOWING THAT VIJAY WAS HERE AND I WAS INVOLVED.  

Thanks

Does this have to do with any of your Accenture or Economist stuff?

We know Vijay quite well and he is not easiest to deal with.  He has believed for years that Shell was going to take us over and never cured from that obsession.  I don't know anything about Vijay's visit, so don't know who he's speaking to in the US.  If he needs to be briefed on Enron Credit, I think that should be done by John here from London. 

And the decision to let Accenture talk about their work with Enron is one that has to be taken from corporate hq (Meredith). I would imagine though that our own Enron story is enough of a story, we don't need to do or like any 3rd-party endorsement from Accenture.

Regards
Eva

Accenture has done some work for us defining the 21st century credit process to support the online business environment.....not sure if they would add value here but we certainly would like Enron Credit discussed in the article if possible....

thanks

Hello Bryan.  Please see the note below and let us know if there is any way
we can use this to the benefit of Enron Online.  If not, we'll simply not
talk to the reporter due to client confidentiality.

Greetings,

I will try to clarify what I know re: the ECONOMIST's interest in Enron,
and possibly speaking with someone at Accenture:

- Vijay Vaitheeswaran, reporter for the ECONOMIST, will be visiting Houston
next Monday-Wednesday; he leaves London this weekend for the States.

- he is doing 'an indepth' story on Enron, particularly interested in their
eBusiness operations;  he has been told that Accenture has worked on
different programs at/for Enron in general (NO MENTION OF SPECIFIC
PROJECTS!!!), that we are trying to ID what might be appropriate for the
reporter's needs .... and that we need more specific details from Vijay, to
nail down the right partner.

- Vijay has said only that he'd like to talk to someone who has worked on
Accenture's eBusiness work for Enron, to find out how Accenture has helped
Enron to maximize those ebusiness capabilities.

- would also like to discuss Accenture work around eBusiness in general

NOW, given sensitivities of the nondisclosure agreements around some of the
projects Accenture is currently working on w/Enron:

     1.  IS there anything that Accenture can tell this reporter about
eBusiness, without endangering the Enron relationship?  What would the
topics be?

     2. IF WE decide to participate, who would be the best Accenture
partner to be interviewed?  Peggy?  Kenny?  Jeff S.?

     3.  DOES ENRON approve of our speaking with the ECONOMIST?  (certainly
if they are talking with him, this could be an opportunity for us to
support, echo and otherwise fortify Enron's message points in this area - -
I look to Kenny and Peggy for guidance here).

Messages have been left with Vijay, asking for more specific information.
I will follow up with him as directly as I can on Monday;  since Vijay with
be in the US, he should now deal with me and/or Neil Nowlin, my media
relations colleague based in the Dallas office of BursonMarsteller
(Accenture's PR counsel).

I've attached some background info on Vijay (see below);

I look forward to your thoughts and comments.

Cheers
Darienne

New York City



BACKGROUND BIO INFO ON Vijay Vaitheeswaran:

Vijay Vaitheeswaran
The Economist

Vijay Vaitheeswaran covers oil for The Economist magazine in London.  He
earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. and recently was
honored with The British Energy Award for the Best Public Utility
Submission at the 2001 Business Journalist of the Year Awards.
(The awards are supported by the Corporation of London, the Confederation
of British Industry, the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the
Chartered Institute of Bankers, sponsored by
industry, and judged by prominent journalists, and representatives of
non-profit institutions.)
Eight years ago, the former New Yorker went to work at a new job in London.
He is now as much a fixture at The Economist as the clunky old Atex system.
Vijay is a former mechanical engineer turned brand manager at Procter &
Gamble turned reporter. In 1994, The Economist sent him out to Mexico to
open its first bureau in Latin America. He returned in 1998 with a tan, a
stash of tequila and fine cigars, and a very bad attitude about frigid
England.
He's gotten over it, and just recently took on the global environment
energy beat, with responsibility for topics ranging from the obvious to
agriculture, mining and commodities, as well as the impact of all of these
things on economic development.

Here's a link to his most recent article in The Economist
A brighter future?
The Economist, Feb 8th 2001
By Vijay Vaitheeswaran

For the better part of a century, governments the world over have been
running the power business as a command-and-control monopoly. Even in
free-market America, most people have been getting their power from stodgy
local utilities unencumbered by competition. This method has its merits:
most of the rich world is now wired up. But it conspicuously failed in the
developing countries, where over 2 billion people still have no access to
electricity. And now, as concerns about the reliability and
cleanliness of grid power grow, its limitations are becoming more apparent
in the industrial world, too.
