*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

We have struck common commercial ground with Bloomberg after all these months, however, there is still a technical obstacle.  This meeting's objective is to introduce our QDF and let them know what they have to build to.

Due to resource constraints this is not a deal we would consider until later in the year IF it requires additional development.  For now, your assistance in "selling" the QDF architecture would be valuable.

Is there anyone else you would include?
