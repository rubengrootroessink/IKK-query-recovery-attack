Andy,
 
Julie Ferrara is going to be rotating mid June.  We need  to fill this void.  My idea is to find an associate with strong commercial  skills (sales and commodity) primarily for the following  purpose(s):
Continued strengthening of the Reuters  product.  Insuring that we have the right product mix on the  service
Implementation of GlobalView
Other QDF opportunities (Bloomberg, DTN, ProphetX, CQG etc.)
Re-introducing historical data for  sale
further exploration of mobile  devices
Continued development and expansion of the  indexes  (find a deal with dollars attached)

In addition, she is deserved of a promotion.  What steps do I need to take for this to happen?  Let me know your thoughts on both ideas please.
