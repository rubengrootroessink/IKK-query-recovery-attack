LaGrasta wants to be able to generate a position report for his customers that shows all their trades, EOL or otherwise, on a MTM basis between ENE and them.

Does Kiodex do this?  He is meeting Kiodex today.

Is this a Sally issue or EOL issue?

Let's discuss.  It all is coming to getting your position or statement with Enron electronically.  Like STP, it sounds like it would help the clients.
