Guys

Please see article attached.  Pages 3 and 4 are interesting.  Page 3 discusses the options functionality available on the various platforms and Page 4 refers to the demutualisation of the LME leading to the possibility that LME Select may offer OTC contracts (similar to enymex).

Article also talks about LME Select enabling automated data transfer to the LME matching system.
