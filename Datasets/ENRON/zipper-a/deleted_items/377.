Hi Greg,

The ETS guys currently listen to our TIB traffic and use it in some of their internal applications.  This is a practice that I have never liked, primarily because these messages are intended to be internal to the EOL application suite, and we need the flexibility to change them as necessary.  As an example, as part of a recent exercise to reduce the overall network traffic, we re-engineered the entire EOL messaging layer.  However, it took us months to roll that change to production because we had to wait for the many pirates of our data to change to the new message structure. 

Our message to these guys has always been that we cannot support these efforts, and that we maintain the freedom to change our messaging at any time.  In practice, however, that is not realistic.  The "EnronOnline in the palm of your hand" e-mail refers to an application service that ETS has built on top of our message traffic that allows IPAQ users to request EOL prices.  This is particularly problematic, because as Andy as said, we must maintain control of the EnronOnline brand.  We don't have any control of the quality of this application.  The idea is a good one, so it is likely that if it is made available, our traders will be using it.  Or worse, our executives.  At that point, we have no choice but to fully support it.  As such, this kind of thing circumvents our prioritization process.  

Andy's message to Steve (below) is very gracious.  Frankly, I believe the message should simply be "kill this".

Steve,

I understand that you are rolling this product out for internal users only. In that case I have a couple of thoughts

1). I have no problem with an internal launch of this. If external, I have a very big problem.

2). I think it would be better for the relationship between ETS and ENW had you informed us of your intention to do this. You are using the EnronOnline brand and whether that is internal or external it is ours to manage. as this was a complete surprise to us. It doesn't really seem like just a pipeline risk management product.

3). Because this was not part of our development and operations effort, we cannot support the product technically. There will be no change management. Given the amount of changes we do to our back end there is a high likelihood that in the future your product will cease to function

4). It looks pretty good and I commend your ingenuity. 

If you disagree with any of this please feel free to let me know.

Andy Zipper
