Dear Andy

Thanks for your Mail. I sincerely hope you were able to get a high level
overview of our company. Further to my earlier mail, i am enclosing the
information which could provide further insight into our company. Pls
include them in your assessment process and give me a feedback if you
require any further clarification. We look forward to meeting you and your
team for an  presentation and the value we could bring to Enron. In the
presentation, we would cover our Methodology, Processes, Competencies,
Clients , Case Study & our economical/cost effective deployment processes.

Some synergies i perceive; Enron's initiative in ClickPaper could map well
based on our experience in Forest Express , EnronOnline could map into our
experience with RMX/Chevron or American Petroleum Exchange, Dealbench.com
maps well with our experience with eBreviate on the hosted ASP model for
eRFP,Auctions,Supplier Search. Moreoever, our development labs in India
could add great value for your module development, ongoing support,
maintenance, QA, Porting work; deploying a very low cost structure.
