According to Dynegy Direct, the last transaction that John had executed was on 03/26/01, but no transactions for 03/27/01. Apologies, It looks like there was a refresh issue for the Dynegy Direct -ENA data. It should only be 14 deals for 03/27/01. Prior data was for the Month of March.

Thanks on that. It seems like there is an error in the DD-ENA tab. No John Arnold in it and Kelli Stevens goes on for 450 rows. Other than that it looks good.

Sheri talked to Mike Williams at TradeSpark and they do not provide transactional or volumetric data to the public, and currently there is no activity for Enron on that platform.

 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 

There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:
"Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct"
"Enron Activity - ICE"

 << File: ICE - Mar27 Power & Gas VOL.xls >> 

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
