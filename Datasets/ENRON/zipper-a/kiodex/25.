Andy,

Here are the first drafts of the equity docs.  We (Enron) initially delayed providing comments to Kiodex until it became clear they were going to receive funding and that a commercial deal could be struck with EOL.  Since I believe we are well on our way to both of these things happening, I plan to meet with V&E and provide feedback to Kiodex shortly.

In addition to these documents, there will also have to be the following docs:
1) Co-Marketing Agreement
2) Warrant Agreement
3) Registration Rights Agreement
4) Employment Contract for Martin Chavez

Gentlemen:

Attached are drafts of the Stock Purchase Agreement and Stockholders
Agreement in connection with the Kiodex / Enron strategic alliance. The
Strategic Alliance Agreement will follow, pending discussions between Raj
Mahajan and Drew regarding the specifics of the marketing obligations. Best
