Andy and Jay,

As I mentioned to you last week, Kiodex is bringing a team to Houston this week to discuss a variety of commercial and technical issues.  They are available all day Thursday (2/1) and Friday (2/2).  Kiodex is hoping to make significant progress and come to an understanding regarding timing and next steps.  Please take a look at the attached agenda and let me know who should be involved in each discussion and when you think those meetings should be scheduled.  Thank you.

Drew
