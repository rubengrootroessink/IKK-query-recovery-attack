To all concerned:

Here is a revised EOL/Kiodex Co-Marketing Agreement updated to reflect the discussions that occurred with Kiodex last week and Andy Zipper's follow on comments.  I believe both EnronOnline and Kiodex have agreed to all of the key commercial and technical terms presented.  The Enron legal department expects to be able to use this document as a basis for the drafting of a formal Co-Marketing Agreement.

In addition, I intend to forward this document on to Kiodex this afternoon so please let me know if you have any final questions, comments, or additions.  Thank you.
