Andy -

We wanted to keep you in the loop on all of the Kiodex documents -- attached are copies of the Stockholders' Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, and the Warrant Agreement that we are preparing to send out to Kiodex for their review (these incorporate our comments to Kiodex' drafts).  Our comments to these documents were consistent with the approach that we took in the HoustonStreet and TrueQuote deals.

This is actually the second round of comments that we are sending in -- this round of comments is to reflect the new structure that we needed to implement to get the desired accounting treatment, which we have already discussed with Kiodex.  Since it is just a follow up to comments we have already sent, we will probably go ahead and send them out to Kiodex, but there will be more than enough time to get any comments you may have in front of Kiodex as well.

Mike --

Per Drew's request, attached are the Stock Purchase Agreement, Warrant and Stockholder's Agreement for your review.  The final agreement, the Co-Marketing Agreement, will follow shortly.  As Drew may have mentioned, we would like to circulate these documents to Kiodex tonight, so it would be helpful to get your comments as soon as possible today.
