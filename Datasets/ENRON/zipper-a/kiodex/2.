Drew and I have spoken about his suggested changes to the co-marketing agre=
ement regarding the annual mail-out.  I understand the issue to be that ann=
ual mailout to the EnronOnline customer list that we are giving under the s=
tock purchase agreement needs to stand on its own as very valuable consider=
ation (and it is).  The annual mail-out previously referenced in the co-mar=
keting agreement is so similar to the initial mail-out in the stock purchas=
e agreement, that a conclusion could be reached that the annual PR campaign=
 is the real consideration for the 12.5% stock (i.e., that it really takes =
annual mailings by Enron before Kiodex gets any value out of Enron having d=
one the mailout to its customer list).   Drew indicated that other co-marke=
ting efforts would probably be OK, just not the same ones that we used to g=
et the 12.5%.  Based on this, I have prepared the following revision of Dre=
w's suggestion (since we don't know what that distribution will look like t=
oday, I believe we need the items in (i), (ii) and (iii) to limit our expos=
ure on this obligation.   =20




At least once during each twelve-month period during the term of this Agree=
ment, Enron and Kiodex will cooperate in an annual distribution of marketin=
g and promotional materials with respect to the Kiodex Application, provide=
d that (i) any such materials to be distributed shall be in form and substa=
nce mutually acceptable to Enron and Kiodex; (ii) the timing, manner, and t=
argeted audience of such distribution shall be mutually agreeable to Kiodex=
 and Enron; (ii) any materials distributed to Enron Customers that are not =
also Kiodex Customers may only be distributed by Enron and must market or p=
romote the Kiodex Application as an additional functionality of the Enron W=
eb Site available through the Kiodex Lite Tool; and (iii) no such distribut=
ion shall result in any expense (including labor and materials) in excess o=
f $________.      =20
