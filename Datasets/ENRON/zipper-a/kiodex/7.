Travis:

	Attached please find the revised Co-Marketing Agreement.  This
incorporates the changes that we discussed on Friday.  It does not, however,
include a provision whereby Enron could terminate the agreement if the
Warburg financing is not completed by April 30th.  You said that you wanted
to leave that out of this draft, but to reserve the issue in the transmittal
email.

The redline shows changes from my last draft (not the Kiodex redraft).  I
will try to prepare a redline showing changes from the Kiodex draft of March
6th, but I don't know if that will be possible given the state of Kiodex's
document.

	If you have any questions regarding the revised draft, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Ted
