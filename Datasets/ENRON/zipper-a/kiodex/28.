Please take a look at the attached agenda, I believe it represents what we discussed in our meeting today.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any question, additions, or deletions.  Furthermore, I am interested in opinions on the following points:

1) When should the EnronOnline commercial (?) and technical (Bob Hillier ?) contacts be identified and introduced?
2) What is appropriate and not appropriate for Dave Forster to cover in his EOL demo?
3) Who from EOL should/could attend dinner with Kiodex on Thursday night?

Thanks for your help.
