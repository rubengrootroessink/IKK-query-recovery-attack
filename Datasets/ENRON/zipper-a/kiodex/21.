Andy:

How are you?  I would like to thank you for hosting us in Houston a couple
of weeks ago.  The entire Kiodex team had a great time and felt very good
about what we accomplished on that trip.  On a personal note, I was very
excited about our conversation on all of the straight through processing
opportunities that we could pursue together, once this deal is closed.

I have since spoken to Jay, Drew and our counsel and understand that we are
in the homestretch of closing our deal.  This is great news.  I think there
is only one open issue (historical trade feed) and one other one that needs
further clarification (web site placement).  I would like to set up a brief
phone call with you so we can put these to bed.  I have some ideas to make
this a win-win for both of us.

Are you available in the next couple of days?

Cheers,

Raj
