Sorry for my late reply.  I have been travelling.

Not knowing the structure of your deal with ABB, I cannot tell you whether we might have an exclusivity issue or not.  What is the proposed structure of your deal, and what ties does it have with future Enron business or linkages?

Jay

A brief update and then a question.

We are still in discussion with ABB re. Energydesk but the timetable has slipped as a result of their major reorganization announcement in late January. I understand that you are anticipating an announcement  on Kiodex in early March. Are there any exclusivity provisions in your deal with Kiodex that would infringe on the proposed transaction with ABB?

Thanks for the information.

You are aware that earlier discussions with ABB  were suspended when talks commenced with Kiodex re. energydesk.com( EDC).  We have recently resumed discussions with ABB and have had one meeting with them here earlier this month. There seems to be interest on their part in acquiring a majority stake in EDC for cash, and we anticipate due diligence to commence during the week of January 29th. If this happens and we can reach agreement on terms and conditions, including price, we might be able to close a transaction by the end of February. 

So far, we have made no commitments to ABB re. Enron's future use of EDC and do not anticipate doing so. My earlier query re. EOL and Kiodex came after I had a conversation with John Thompson, during which he mentioned your ongoing discussions with Kiodex. ABB knows that Enron had discussions with Kiodex re. EDC and I was concerned about ABB being spooked by an announcement of an association between EOL and Kiodex at a time when we are back courting ABB ( " Is Enron saying that they consider the Kiodex system superior to EDC's while trying to sell EDC to ABB?").

I will keep you advised about the ABB discussions here and would appreciate your doing likewise.
