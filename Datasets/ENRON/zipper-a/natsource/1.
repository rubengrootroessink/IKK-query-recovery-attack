They are not active so far in our markets.  This will obviously give them a leg up.  The gas desk like the current deal with Prebon, so let's give this one a go too.

Has Simon / Andy Fairley updated you on our deal with Spectron?  If not please do so, chaps!

Richard,

Jack Cogen of Natsource is ready to buy BrokerClient from us for European Gas and Power for a $200,000 1yr license. We would really like to do this deal as they were the launch customer in the states and have done quite a bit of business on the system. Thor is already doing this with them for his products. Unless I hear back from you to the contrary I'm going to assume that this is alright with you. Let me know if there are issues.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper
