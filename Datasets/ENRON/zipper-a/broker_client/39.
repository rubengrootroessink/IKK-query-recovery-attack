I am still pushing for a March 5th go live for Truequote.  This will not happen in my opinion.  I will give you an update tomorrow on the status and see how you would like us to proceed through the rest of the week.

Issues:

We still have not seen the Truequote screen
We need to come to some resolution on the structure of the Access Agreement (10:45 meeting tomorrow with Chris Edmonds)
We need to due a due dilligence on the website
