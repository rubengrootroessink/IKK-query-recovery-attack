Yesterday we agreed in principal to a broker client transaction with Amerex.  
the basis of the deal is as follows:

1 year
$500,000 license fee paid in 12 monthly payments
25% brokerage reduction for EnronOnline transactions
EnronOnline transactions may be executed either by clicking or by calling the 
trader and requesting to trade on the posted price (they have a contractual 
arrangement with Altra that potentialy precludes clicking, they are trying to 
negotiate with Altra)
NA Gas; NA Power; Bandwidth and Crude Products

Attached is my cut at an LOI based upon the Natsource model.  We need to get 
this out as soon as possible.  Let me know how I can help.
