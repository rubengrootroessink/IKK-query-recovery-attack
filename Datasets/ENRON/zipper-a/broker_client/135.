My apologies-- I have to admit that I dropped the ball on this one. WIth the
market going crazy, yearend and some stuff going on in London, I havent
totally formulated the response to you.  I will get a response to you early
next week.  Obviously, we have had alot of discussions internally with many
issues/questions.  However, I understand that you need an answer soon so we
will revert quickly.
Happy New Year.

Mary,

Just wondering what path you folks want to pursue. Give me a call if you
want to continue discussions, or let me know if you want to drop it.

Hope you had a good Holiday season,
Andy Zipper
