I just had a discussion with GFI concerning Broker Client.  There seems to be a difference of opinion within the company as to whether they should use broker client.  The desk level appears to want to however they have been overuled at the executive level.  

Don Fewer explained their position as this:

We cannot receive and pay for Enron information because they have committed to their investors and board that they are an independent provider of liquidity.  They have made a significant investment in GFI.net which is their electronic platform and they are going to the capital markets to raise money for this.  they feel it would be a conflict of interest to go against their commitment.

I warned Don of the inherent danger of pursuing a single avenue of success in a very uncertain environment which is full of "independent platform" wannabe's. 

You may want to have a conversation with Don to see if you can change their opinion.  I would be happy to set up a call between you and Don.

For your information GFI was the original interested broker you talked to in London.  

GFI does want us to stream our prices to them at no cost.  Nice offer on their part.
