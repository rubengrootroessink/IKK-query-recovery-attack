Andy and Bob, I've executed the docs.  Two  executed originals should be in your office on Monday, as they're being  fedx'd.  Please send a copy to my attention at:
    Amerex
    1 Sugar Creek Center  Blvd
    Ste 700
    SL, 77478
We're looking forward to a  successful implementation process, and in working toward the goals we both  have for this project.
All the best,
Steve
