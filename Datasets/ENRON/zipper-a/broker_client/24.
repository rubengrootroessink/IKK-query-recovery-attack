Andy,
That's not a problem.  I am out of the office today...but can run the Power numbers from home..I have asked one of my broker checkout people from Gas to run their numbers for Febraury and March.  I will compile them tomorrow morning when I am back in the office and send them to you.

Kim,
Thanks for your note. The only other thing I would need other than daily tracking is what the numbers have been over the past two weeks, so we can see the change.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper

Below is the Amerex Deal Count for Thurs., April 5, 2001:

Gas Physical/Financial:        18 deals

Let me know if you need anything else.  We will provide these numbers on a daily basis to you until we hear further from you.
