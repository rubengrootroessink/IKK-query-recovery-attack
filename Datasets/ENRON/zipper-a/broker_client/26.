Kim,
Thanks for your note. The only other thing I would need other than daily tracking is what the numbers have been over the past two weeks, so we can see the change.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper

Andy,

Below is the Amerex Deal Count for Thurs., April 5, 2001:

Gas Physical/Financial:        18 deals

Power Physical/Financial:    50 deals


Let me know if you need anything else.  We will provide these numbers on a daily basis to you until we hear further from you.

Kim Theriot
