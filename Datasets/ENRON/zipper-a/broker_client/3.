Don,

Concerning your request for a discounted rate on Broker Client I offer up the following:

$200 K if signed by COB 6/8
$225 K if signed by COB 6/15
$250 K if signed after 6/15

Just to let you know we have seen significant activity on the Broker Client since its implementation.  In addition we have experienced a steep growth curve on the number of transactions.  I believe that many of the concerns by your customers are going away as this tool has become a common practice in the industry.  

You can find Mark Greenbergs email address above.  Please have your attorney deal directly with mark on the Agreement.  Thanks
