I met with John Evans yesterday and agreed the following deal with Spectron for UK Power:

We will give them two-ways for their screen on "key" products. What constitutes a key product is discrestionary. There is no minimum spread we have to provide.
If we are hit on any number on the screen then they pass through 0.25p/MWh to us (half of their bro on the other side).
This is not an exclusive relationship.
This deal is not linked to EOL.
Either side can terminate at any time if it's not working out.

Effectively all this means is that we have another route to market, which ends up being 0.25p/MWh cheaper.

Spectron are keen to monitor this with a view to adopting something similar on other desks.
Comments welcome.

Thanks
Simon
