I am 100% in agreement.  I have not, and will not be buying anything to cover this load.  I did buy some Nov, but that was not to hedge load, that was to hedge right after the AGA came out and there was no long term market out yet to lift.  So just keep on screwing us Fornicator.  I know what you are up to.

Thanks for the info for the additional load.      As I understand it,  we now have approximately 20 mw's in the South.  This is great!!
Each day I review balancing energy prices vs.  daily prices and the choice is extremely simple:    We allow the pool to fill this load.

I would recommend against buying any hedges against this power until further.     There is a good chance that prices occasionally go negative for offpeak/weekends and we want to take full advantage.

Do we need to discuss this further?   I just want to be on the same page.
Let me know what you think.
