John,

I made an adjustment in Enpower for Friday.

When balancing the books, I noticed that we were 100mw's long into the pool for HE21 & HE22, but in the portal it only shows 50mw for each hour.
(A 16hour block of 50mw was already in the portal.)  So I adjusted HE21 & HE22 from 50mw to 0 mw, so that it matched the portal.  Please notify me 
if my adjustment was incorrect. I made a note in the comment field for enpower #871228.  

Joe
