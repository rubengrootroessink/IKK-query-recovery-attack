Hey John,

Thanks for the heads up.

FYI - I found an hourly ERCOT-Imbalance deal from yesterday (10/22/01) with a price on it - I've zeroed out the price but I wanted to let you know so you can pass the word on.  Deal 830711.1 - 25 mws HE 9.

Thanks,
Michael

Frontera will be running short for the schedule listed below.      I have sold them this imbalance for $28.57.    Any imbalance charges billed to them should be allocated to me listed on the schedule below.

hour ending 7 - 320
he 8 -320
he 9 - 320
he 10 - 215
he 11 - 150
he 12 - 50 

The total is 1375.   This is the equivalent of a financial swap,  but the settlement will remain intact.

Thanks,
JMF
