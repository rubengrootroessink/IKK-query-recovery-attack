Boys,

Can I get a copy of an ERCOT bill that has come through.  If one has come through for an EES account, that would be great. If it is some other account, that will be fine.  If there are disclosure issues, just black out the name of the counterparty on the bill if that is possible.  I need to start looking at this stuff to see if we are pricing stuff right down here.  Thanks.

-Joe
