Hi Smith,

  I am aware of the protocol changes and the change order on ERCOT side.
I will update the project plan with new requirements. As far as
  DST is concerned, ERCOT will be conducting the test next week and we are
ready for that.

 Also, I will see you next  Tuseday.

 Thanks,

 Jayant

Subject:  New Zones


Gentlemen:

As a result of changes at ERCOT we will have to revise the Position
manager and QSE MOS to incorporate the new ercot zones.  If the ESCA
team can come up with an implementation plan that would be great.

Also,  we have not heard a thing about testing for daylight savings
time.  Are we ready for the switch?

*    The ERCOT Board approved the congestion zones for next year,
2001. The ERCOT Board accepted the 3 CSC 4 CM Zone model for use in
commercial congestion management for 2002.  Effective date is January 1,
2002.  The three CSC's are Graham-Parker 345 kV DCKT, Sandow-Temple 345
kV DCKT and STP-DOW 345 kV DCKT.  The four CM Zones are West02, North02,
South02 and Houston02.  A power point presentation along with a map is
available at ftp://ftp.ercot.com/CSCDATA/csc.htm.
