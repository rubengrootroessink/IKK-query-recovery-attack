Kimberly and John:
 
Attached please find the index language for the ERCOT Balancing Services data a while back for Doug.  John, is this what you need?  I was thrown off by the reference to the East Power portal site in your e-mail to Kimberly.

That looks good. If you could forward the rest of the language vis a vis the fixed price and re-settlement language. Otherwise this looks in line with what we need.

Thanks very much, 

Doug
