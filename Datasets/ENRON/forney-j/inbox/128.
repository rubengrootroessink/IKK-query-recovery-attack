CRsI nformation Request 10_24_01 


Could you please respond to me by e-mail to the following technical 
questions to assist me in my review of your proposed power supply agreement 
(NOTE: if your power supply agreement has been updated from the copy that 
you provided me with your RFP response please send it to me ASAP): 

1.  At this time it is unlikely that Air Products will want to enter into an 
agreement with a QSE to allow it to bid ancillary services directly into the 
Ancillary Services market and instead will look to the CR to provide 
opportunities to Air Products which allow Air Products to utilize its 
interruptibility capability and thereby reduce its firm power costs.  Could 
you please provide a detailed explanation as to how you propose to provide 
opportunities for AP to utilize its Instantaneous and Noticed Interruptible 
capabilities to reduce its firm power costs, how these opportunities will be 
communicated to AP, how much time AP will have to respond, how AP's 
performance will be measured, any special qualification or registration or 
hardware equipment that AP has to comply with or install, the proposed 
sharing mechanism for any net profit made, and how participation will be 
excused from any interval and monthly minimum take obligations. 

2.  Please review the attached detailed list of possible CR, ERCOT, TDSP, 
and non-bypassable charges and note which ones are included in your power 
price and which ones are proposed to be a pass-through (it would also be 
helpful to understand if any of these charges are subject to change how 
often the change might take place).  If a particular charge is partially 
included and partially passed-through please explain the basis for 
determining how much is included and how much is passed-through.  If there 
are any charges that I have not included on this list (other those 
associated strictly with the power) please add them to the list.  On the 
bill Air Products will not feel an obligation to pay any charges other than 
those associated strictly with the power which are not listed in the 
spreadsheet you return. 

 <<TDSP and ERCOT Charges Analysis.xls>> 

3.  Please confirm whether you are willing to commit to use reasonable 
commercial efforts to minimize the non-regulated delivery charges that are 
within your control and that all regulated delivery charges will be 
passed-through at cost with no mark-up. 

4.  Will Air Products be allowed to communicate directly with the TDSP 
regarding outages and repair services? 

If you have any quesitons concerning this information request please feel 
free to contact me at 610-481-3497. 

Roger Yott 
Air Products
