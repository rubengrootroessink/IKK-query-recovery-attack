The deal number is 815970.1 - under your name but I think that it is Eric's.  Thanks.

JMF,

Constellation is disputing this sale we show to them in EnPower as well as the Hourly P&L.  I have nothing to give them for support, can you help me out or at least pass this along to whomever did the deal?

10/11/01 HE 23 50 mw @ $17

Thanks,
MJ
