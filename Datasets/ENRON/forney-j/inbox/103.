Could you please take a look at this rough proposal to Air Products on how we could handle their interruptible capability so that we can discuss it on Wed 11/7.  I want to make sure everyone is on board for this strategy.  Judy, could you please find a time Wed. that works for everyone and get us a conference room for one hour.

Thanks, - Mike
