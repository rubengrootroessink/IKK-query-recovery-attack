We need to talk about instantaneous supply and how it is dealt with under your Sand Hills contract. The contract I am working on with Austin really doesn't address this issue and in order for me to include this in the contract we will need to talk. I have a call in also with Lonestar to talk about this as well. I have Janet Wallis helping me address some of these issues. We may want to schedule a meeting to include her also.

Let me know where we stand.
