John,

These LDs for 6/15/01 are still outstanding.  From all my research I believe we owe Tenaska, but have not been able to determine whether we are at fault or need to pass the LD downstream.  

If I don't hear from you within the next couple of days I am going to enter the deal to pay Tenaska and wait until you respond before I bill the downstream counterparty.

Rebecca

John,

This LD from Tenaska is still an issue.  Are we going to pay it?

John,

I need an answer on the 6/15/01 Tenaska LDs I gave to you a few weeks ago.  They are calling daily asking the status and sent an invoice for payment today.

Thanks,

Rebecca
