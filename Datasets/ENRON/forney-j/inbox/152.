Anadarko does not currently operate any power plants.  Primarily E&P and
related marketing functions (trade gas/crude/ngl's).  I have heard of a
project that is beginning that is looking into the prospects of trading
electricity.  How soon that may occur is simply a guess.  Obviously
there is a substantial amount of hedging activity related to the
gas/crud/ngl's.  You can always check the web site to see if there are
other areas you may be interested in.  Hope all works out well.  Send me
you resume if you wish.  Give me a call after Thanksgiving and we can
try to meet at Mollys/Papas one afternoon.  Phone numbers:
832-636-7045 (w)
281-298-7860 (h)
Keep in touch, ajt.
