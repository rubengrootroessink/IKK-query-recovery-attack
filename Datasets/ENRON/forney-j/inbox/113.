Jeff,  You probably want to incorporate these scheduling changes into the attachment of the QSE agreement regarding scheduling deadline for ANP and the standard templates.  - Mike

This is to announce a change in the ERCOT day-ahead scheduling timeline
to comply with a recently approved protocols revision request (PRR 268).
The following is a description of the changes:

*       Submission of Ancillary Service (AS) schedules that include
self-arranged Ancillary Services and AS bids selected by ERCOT.  This
activity is currently scheduled to occur at or before 1400 of the
day-ahead period.  The timeline for this activity will be changed to be
at before 1500.
*       Submission of Resource Plans with non-binding unit-specific
information and submission of Replacement Reserve Service (RPRS) bids.
This activity is currently scheduled to occur at or before 1430 of the
day-ahead period.  The timeline for this activity will be changed to be
at before 1600.
*       Close of Day Ahead Market. This activity is currently scheduled
to occur at or before 1630 of the day-ahead period.  The timeline for
this activity will be changed to be at before 1800.

The above changes will be effective on Monday, November 12 2001 for the
Day Ahead scheduling activities for the operating day of Tuesday,
November 13, 2001. For additional information on PRR268 and changes to
