Karen,
I have spoken with Adrianne yesterday concerning the status of this process.    At that time,   I had left messages with all three candidates,  but was unable to reach them.
Late yesterday afternoon,  I received a call from Nicholas Watson.   
I was impressed with his previous experience in trading and his educational background.    He also had shown some innovation related to some projects that he worked on at JP Morgan Chase & Co.

I would recommend scheduling Nicholas for an interview.   I did relay to him that we would contact him within a week.

I will again call the other candidates.

JMF

John/John/Frank

As we are approaching the November 1st Trading Track interview dates, we need to finalize the reminder of the external candidate's initial screen.

Can you please provide me with your feedback/status.   If we need to re-assign your candidates to other traders please let me know by return.

Thanks,

Karen
