Attached are the results of the Balancing Test evaluation performed on
October 25, 2001.  According to may paperwork, I should send the results
back to Steve Olin but I cannot contact him therefore, I am contacting
you with the results.

I regret to inform you that Enron has unsuccessfully completed Balancing
Test evaluation.

Results are attached.
