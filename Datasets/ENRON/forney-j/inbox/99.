John,

I met with Sasha today for approx. 3 hours.
We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS.

Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra (the top of the list is the highest priority):

 - Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine (South Zone) and a Sell to FPL (North Zone).
   Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Calpine (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book 
   to FPL (North Zone).  Sasha said he is working on this, but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North.

 - Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation.  The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book.
   This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process.  (Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that
   it is a purchase from Frontera.  Essentially, this would increase the EPMI mw's in the Ercot Portal.)

 - Change the short name in <internal counterpary> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)

 - Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)
    So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal.

 - Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date.  One less step that we need to worry about.

I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading "time is of the essence" and that we don't have much time to input data.
Therefore, we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly.
I realize that the first two items will take some time, but the last 3 items should be quick fixes.

I hope this helps.

Joe Capasso
