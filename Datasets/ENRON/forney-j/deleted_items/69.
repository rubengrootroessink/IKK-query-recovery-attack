John,

Good morning or maybe it's closer to afternoon for you.  I've been checking
the conditions out at the Flower Gardens and it remains pretty rough.  The
seas are around 6.2' feet.  The boat staff said they won't go out if the
seas are over 4' so the trip might get canceled unless the weather really
improves today.  If the trip does cancel, I would really like to play golf.

Talk to you soon,

Scott Jacobucci, P.E.
