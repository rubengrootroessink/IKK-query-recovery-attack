John,

Last night, I towed my boat from a storage unit near Lake Conroe to a new
one on 242, just east of I-45 which is a little more convenient.  I think
the best thing for my trailer is  to back it into a fresh water lake after
it has been is salt water.  That way the salt water will be rinsed out of
the interior of the trailer.  What do you think?  Also, if we go, what time
would you want to head out?
