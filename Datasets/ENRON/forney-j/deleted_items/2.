I received a voice mail from Mike Curry, asking if I was still an Enron Emp=
loyee and what had happened to the regulatory reports that I used to send. =
 Here are the answers.  Yes, I am still an Enron employee. As for the repor=
ts, I have been negligent in sending then around over the past few weeks.  =
The meeting schedule has increased at ERCOT and due to the high congestion =
costs a Congestion Management working group has been formed to address, the=
 move to the full zonal model, auction of TCR products, local congestion is=
sues etc.  I have been asked to chair the working group which has taken mor=
e time.  Finally, I have had an ill daughter and they have been running tes=
ts to diagnose the cause of the problem, therefore, I have been traveling b=
ack and forth to and from Austin on a daily basis.  All of this has cut int=
o the time that I used to write the reports and have tried to contact the p=
arties directly when an issue arose.  However, I understand the need to dis=
seminate the regulatory information and will resume the summaries forthwith=
.  You should expect to get a summary of the last weeks activities this p.m=
