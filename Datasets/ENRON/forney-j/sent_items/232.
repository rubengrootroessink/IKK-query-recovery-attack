I have one half day of vacation tomorrow and I'm out on Monday.    As you can see, I am still a slacker.
No, really  we havent been anywhere since we moved back in January.   we are going to Austin this weekend to play some golf.
Houston is not that scenic,  so I'm heading out.

Hey Mr. Forney,

Hope things are going well. Can I buy you coffee or lunch one of these days ?
Is that a good deal or what. Just Kidding !

Wanted to find out what you guys are up to. Let me know when you'll be available.

Thanks
