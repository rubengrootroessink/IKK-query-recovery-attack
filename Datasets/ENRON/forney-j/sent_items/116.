Mr. Hinson,
Sorry I missed your call.      The Frontera Plant is composed of 2 CT's and and steamer.      Three units in total,  however,   the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's.    I say this because the Ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and Ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance.

There is no way under the Resource Plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered.       These units are behind a common point,  so the rules as they were written dont consider us.     

I know that this is more than you asked for,  but for whatever it's worth........


Thanks and give me a call if you need more info,
