actually, my hours are very good.  can't remember if i told you, i ended up hiring diane cook to join us.  so, she can take things and run with it, and so can tricia.  so, i have been getting in late, normally i take a lunch, and am out of here by 6 or 6:30.  this am I met a foundation guy  - ouch....$4100.  I will be meeting with 2 more.  hopefully he's the highest.

last week I saw a guy I have been listening to for about 3 or 4 yrs, but have never seen - Chris knight.  we was very good.  he is Steve earle-ish.  he's a guy's guy.  redneck.  you can always borrow a cd if you'd like.  oh, wait, i never get the cd's back.  hee-hee.
[Forney, John M.]  OWW  -  that hurts.   who do i have?  you prob dont even remember now 
i am seeing a band at the satellite this friday - jupiter coyote.  i was wanting to buy some ski boots last yr [never did cuz i couldn't find any store that sold those sock warmers/liners], but there was this big, long haired, hippy kinda guy helping me, and he had on a "son volt" pin/button, so we started talking, and he turned me on to jupiter coyote.  so, have their cd, and am going to see them.

tell debbie i said hi.

joan,
good to hear from you - everything is still pretty wild up here, but it is going very well.    Sorry to hear about the neighbors,  but i think that you will enjoy living downtown.
there is so much to do here now.  
how are your hours now?  im sure that they are pretty scary.

seen any good bands lately?

JMF

are you still around?  what's going on? 

we are so busy, it is amazing.  we will probably be closing 4 vpp's in the next 1.5 months...for a total of , well, with the curve as is, over $350 MM. 

i am moving...downtown to a hi rise.  my new neighbors moved in in july, with 4 yappy dogs.  they are right outside my bedroom.  so, i have not had a quiet nite sleep, or morning, or even afternoon since they've been here.  long story, but have decided to move out, then will put my house on the market.  hopefully, the housing and financial markets will stay up until i sell.  if not, then i will have to rent it out.

still not dating anyone, so if you know of someone.....
