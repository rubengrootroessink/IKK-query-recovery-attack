I notified Coleen at the ISO that Frontera will be off line starting at 2300 hours tonight for economic reasons.  I also told Coleen the plant will be available if needed.

The ISO sent OOMC of 164 mws for 2400 9-25-01 through 2400 9-26-01.  I called the ISO and spoke with Jay about the OOMC.  Jay told me that he will probably hold the plant at minimum load tonight.  He wasn't sure what loading the plant would be at during the day.

I notified GENCO ( John Pappa ) of the OOMC and told him that I will advise him of the output level once the ISO lets me know.

I called ( Ken ) and told him about the OOMC.  I told Ken the plant will have to run all day tommorrow.

At 1945, the ISO revised the OOMC for the 26th.  The new OOMC is 184 mws/24hr.
