Julie,
Please see my resume, as attached.    I would be able to meet Frank Busot and others this week or next,  at their convenience.	
Please note that I would prefer to travel out of Bush Intercontinental Airport, as it is very close to my home.

Thanks for your interest and let me know if I can provide more information to your company.

John Forney
Director, Enron North America
