Calculations for 2002 CSC/CM Zone Determinations are planned to be started on August 1 and must be completed by Oct 1 (protocol requirement).  The power flow base cases are currently being prepared by ERCOT ROS Steady State WG.  ERCOT System Planning staff is already gathering and setting up data files for these calculations.
Before calculations begin and due to two months being available for determination, we are planning a kickoff meeting with stakeholders as follows:
When:  Tuesday, July 31, 2001 
Time:  9:00 AM to 4:00 PM 
Where: Austin ERCOT Office (MET Center) 
RSVP:  jringling@ercot.com 
Lunch will be provided.  In order to plan for the proper amount of food for the meeting we request stakeholders attending the meeting RSVP to Julie Ringling (jringling@ercot.com) no later than July 26.
Comments and suggestions in advance of the meeting should be sent via email to me, Jose Conto (jconto@ercot.com) and Henrik Roycourt (hroycourt@ercot.com).
We are looking forward to the meeting, your discussion and input into the 2002 detemination process. 
Thanks Ken D.
