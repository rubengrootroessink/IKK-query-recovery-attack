Rogers,
Customers call 	quite often to inquire about Retail Service.    Is there a single contact person that we can transfer them to?
I talk to someone different each time from EES.     
I'd like to get a procedure in place for the floor so no one gets lost frmo the outside.

Let me know what you think,

JMF
