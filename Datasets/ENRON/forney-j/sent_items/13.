Jeff/John,

I have not heard back from either of you about this.  It is now time to allocate the bill and I don't know whose it is.  Shall I make them all Hourly ERCOT?

Rebecca

Jeff/John,

We have found that DC tie trades affect RI and LI.  Here is a list of trades and the imbalances related.  They are not in the QSE MOS as far as I can tell.  Do you know what (or whose) they are?
