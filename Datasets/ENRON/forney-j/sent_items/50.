Please see the attached.    Remember that we are planning on buying hour ending 7 (50 mw's).    So,   we wont actually generate 250's as the schedule indicates.
Alex will take care of this tonight.

Prices for the weekend look like:
onpeak $20.75
offpeak $ 12.25
gas  $2.06
This doesnt look too good for the weekend run.    Let me know what you need to do.


Thanks,

JMF
