Madhup,
We have been having alot of trouble with one of the big screens that is fed by the portal server.      It is the display over Doug's head.    This shows ACE and load forecast.

Doug is very excited about this,  as we have had a daily problem   It works temporarily ,  but goes down daily.

Is Sasha the guy to talk to on this?
