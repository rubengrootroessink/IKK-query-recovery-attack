There was additional language added to the fixed Price delivery point and that is reflected in the confirmation attached below.

We are still waiting on your final okay to start confirming Frontera deals on these formats.  Do you  have any problems with these confirmation formats?

I believe these are the final formats of the three confirmations we will be using for the Frontera deals.  Please review and let me know if these will be okay to send to the counterparty.
