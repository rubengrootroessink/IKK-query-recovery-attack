AJ,
Thanks for checking in with me.   I had a couple of questions:
Does Anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively?      I currently do several things:
I am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk.    I also manage the Ercot Asset book.   I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas.
I am required to trade gas along with  the power in order to properly hedge the plant.
I would be interested in continuing in this area. 

Thanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko.   I could send my resume,  but if we dont have paralell needs,  then I wont bother.
I have some other things that I am working on.

Thanks again for asking.  This company will be fine,  but I have worked 12-14 hours/day for 8+ years.   When the stock price is $90, I can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life.   However,   although I am sure that Enron will bounce back,  I am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so.    

I have been consistenly profitable in my time here.   I have never been on a losing team - we have always made major money for the company,  so it is very hard to understand how this whole thing is unwinding.

Anyway,  thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you.
