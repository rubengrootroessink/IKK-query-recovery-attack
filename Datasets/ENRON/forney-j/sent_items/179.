I have purchased from Duke   100 mw's at $51  for flow into Entergy (see deal#591863) .       Duke is  transmitting this power through their capacity through SOCO.     In the event of TLR's,   we have the option of cutting this supply,   without booking out (deal was negotiated with Amar).
If this happens,  of course  you need to fill the demand side and cut the purchase from Duke in enpower - see deal no. above.   The purchases  go in the ST SPP book.

Once again,  If RT has to intervene,  please make sure that Enpower is balanced with respect to ST SPP.     Also,   let me know immediately if there are problems with this or any other schedule that I have.

You guys are doing a good job.
