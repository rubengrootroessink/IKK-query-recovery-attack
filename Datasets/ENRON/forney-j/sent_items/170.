Things are going pretty well -  balance of month trading $43.75 in Entergy and it is going to be 90 degrees all of next week!
I heard that PV is down and its 1,000 degrees in the desert -  you guys must be busy.
Dave Ryan called for mild in the Northeast next week when Earthsat was preaching hot ........   did really well on that deal as I was short balmo  the Cinergy.
He's the man (this week).

I saw Swerzbee and Motley at the K-derby.    That was a good time,  but it was bright sun and hot,  while we were wearing the traditional suit and tie.
There was a trader at the party that weighed about 320.   He was wearing a black wool sportcoat and a khaki colored shirt.    He tried to take his coat off but strangers were dogging him about his sweat rings,  so he put it back on..........poor bastard.

Louisville Slugger factory and museum kicked ass.    They had all the original bats from Ty Cobb,  Babe Ruth, etc to current players.
The have been custom making bats since like 1847.    Good trip -  see you there next year!
