Rob,
attached are my friend's resumes.     i also added mine for your critique.   Let me know what you think.
I need to talk to you about negotiating a new deal;   unfortunately it looks as if I may be leaving the state,  either to Florida or back to Oregon.

The offers are starting to come in,  but I dont want to leave anything on the table.   Need your advice,  so let's have that beer!
