Mark,
Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments.
Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by awaiting instruction.

Has there been any progress in this subject?
