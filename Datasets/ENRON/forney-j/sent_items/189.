Amy,
Hope everything is going well with you.   I dont know if Tim has talked with you, but I am considering returning to Portland.  
I am talking with Wolfe and Tim,  but I would like to keep things low key.    I know this all seems pretty weird,   but my situation has changed so drastically that I have some major,  immediate decisions to make.    Basically,   the East Desk wants me to build a team in Real Time,  similar to how we did it in Portland.
Unfortunately,  that was not the job I agreed to take (always get it in writing - I never could).     Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had,  I never would have left.

Anyway,  Kim Melodick wants me to consider opportunities within Enron Houston and I have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists.   She is easy to work with and is being very helpful.    However,  I have expressed  to Kevin and Kim that my first preference would be to return to Portland.

I have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here.   
 I would like to have a new perspective on this if you have time to converse.     I would appreciate any feedback that you can give me.

Thanks,
JMF

I
