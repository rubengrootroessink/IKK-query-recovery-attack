Lloyd,
We received this from Preston.     Everyone on this distribution list would assume that EES is waiting on information from us.
We are still awaiting meaningful data from Narsimha/Preston.
I am going to discuss this with Narsimha.
I feel like a reply is warranted,  as we are making no headway on this project.

I fear for Preston if he is to work with me in the future.

JMF

I need your help to make September 1 physical delivery happen. Please talk amongst yourselves and set up meetings as necessary. Just keep me in the loop. 

Rogers Herndon and I (and others) are going to meet this Friday to go over the report. Please have your plans of action/feedback/comments to me by Thursday morning, so I can make sure they get included in the report he sees. 

 

Thanks for all your help so far. 

Preston
