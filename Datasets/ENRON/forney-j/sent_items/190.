Bart,
que paso,   juaro?    
Jeff passed on your e-mail.   Too bad about the beetles.   Is that the Taylor High School Mascot?   "Taylor,  home of the fighting beetles,"....  Go beetles!
I think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up,  but it just reemphasizes the need for you;    they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths.
Well,  enough about you,  let's talk about me..............
the Entergy gig was made more difficult,  as I received NO training in cash trading.     After a couple of months,  a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging,  which is especially important in my region.   The month of May was very profitable,  finally,  and things were coming together until..........

(Please keep this confidential)
Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group,  his decision being final,  no negotiations.  (thanks for your understanding, bunghole).
I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his decision.
I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with,  given that we have retail load to service,  etc.   However,   thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.   I suspect other changes would ensue,  once I established this region.

So.     It looks like I will be returning to Portland.    We bought a new house here and are very happy with everything,  except my job (which is a huge thing).
I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service Desk.    I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.     
Anyway,  I was pissed in the beginning,  but I had to take time to digest this,  analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision.   
I am too deep in the (out of the money)   options to cut and run,  so it now boils down to where do I want to live.   There is interest outside of the company  in me,  but I am under contract.    I miss Portland and I think about it all the time.     I must be a mountain man at heart.

Well,  let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.   Once again,   I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk,  just yet.
I heard that you did really well on your home sale.    That's awesome.    Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.  (just kidding).
I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a house.   How is your housing in Taylor?
I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.   It is freaking hot here in Texas!

Anyway,  keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!   

JMF
