We are required to input down balancing bids for all generators that we represent.     Every morning it is especially important that we have a DBES bid input for Frontera.
We should have balancing bids in for all hours,  but we are most likely to be deployed in the morning hours.
We are required to monitor the Deployment instructions and communicate any instructions to Jerry Watson @ Teco/Frontera.

Frontera is willing to pay a max of $10 to decrease their gen.    This bid tells Ercot that we are willing to pay up to $10 for Ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being "balanced down."

We should never see prices below $10 without being deployed down.     If this situation happens,  we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO.
This is an important part of the Services side of our business,  and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions.


If anyone has any questions on this, please give me a call as this is very important to all of us.'
