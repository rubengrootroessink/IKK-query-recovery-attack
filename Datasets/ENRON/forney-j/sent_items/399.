If you are referring to the OOMC for September 14th we are still working
on a number of issues pertaining to that trade day.

Mark,
Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was
wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments.
Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover
at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by
awaiting instruction.

Has there been any progress in this subject?

JForney
