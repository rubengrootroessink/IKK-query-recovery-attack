My desk is available for training purposes at night or weekends.    However,     I am missing my notebook and my tradelog.   
Frequently things are moved and I have a hard time finding such items as listed above.

If you use my desk and you need to move my notebook, etc.   then place them in my desk drawer or somewhere else that makes sense.

Thanks,
JMF
