What about New Power,  should we refer this deal to them?   It looks pretty good.

Fornicator,

We have a non-compete with New Power, so we can not serve residential load.  It would be a good idea, but we can't do it.  Unless your brilliance can find a way around the non-compete.

Hey,  melon-boy -

Who would I talk to about the residential customers.    I received a call from a load aggregating company that specializes in residential sign ups.
This sounds like a good idea, provided that our strategy hasnt changed.

Whatup?
