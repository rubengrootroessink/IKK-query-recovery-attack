John,

Here's the response from MSN.

	"We have changed his account to the $5/month plan and credited his account
for previous "overbillings".  For some reason, the account was created
as a "Standard" $21.95/month account.

He should see a $5 charge on his statement going forward. His next
billing date is October 11, 2001."

Is this okay with you?

Please let me know if this does not happen.

Thanks,
Marie Newhouse
