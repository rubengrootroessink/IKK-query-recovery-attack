Kim,
Cammi Mursch has asked for an e-mail from Enron authorizing an extension.
Can we do this?

Thanks,
JMF

Kim and John,
The benefits can be extended if they are expired.  If they are expired, all we would need is an email from HR stating the approval to extend.  John, contact your consultant, Cami Mursch at (800) 241-6529 and she will assist you in getting the expenses processed.
Thanks,
Deborah 3-1426

Kim,
I had mentioned that I had not completed submitting my expense for temporary housing,  etc.    I mistakenly thought that the deadline was one year.
Can I still get this in?   I think I have everything in order.

Thanks,
JMF
