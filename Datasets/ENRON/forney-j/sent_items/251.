Chris,
Good questions:
1. You are fine using Ercot System as the delivery opint until the Ercot ISO opens on July 20th.    Subsequent to that, we will enter the appropriate zone for each purchase or sale as West, North or South Zone.       If we wish to schedule mw's across a path,  ie South to North,  we will need to create an Ercot transmission deal to link south>north.     We do not actually do an Ercot Oasis, etc, to buy this transmission,  rather,  this is a way to reflect the desired pathing internally.
Risk Management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us.  I will let you know what it is called.

2.  The positions that we manage for Frontera/Teco Services should not be reflected in the P&L sheet, as we had been doing.
My fault for not knowing the process as agreed to previously with Settlements & Risk Mgmt.    We are to keep these deals in the Services P&L sheet,  as Real Time has done for MDEA.     
The location for this spreadsheet is:

M:Eservices/applications/services

We will request access to this tool for everyone.

Thanks,
JMF

Attached are a few questions Steve and I have talked about.

1)  What do we need to be showing as the delivery point on our Ercot trades (i.e. Ercot system border only?  the various zones "West 2001"  "South 2001, "North 2001"?  split delivery point b/w the buy and sale piece "i.e CPBS border on the buy form San Antonio and HLP border on the sale to RHLP?

2)  What acronynm do we need to put in the P&L for Frontera?  EPMI Teco Services?  or Frontera?  

NOTE:  Steve Olinde wanted me to remind you that he will not be in the office for training tomorrow (Thursday) b/c the Ercot portal will be down.  He will return for training on Monday around 3:30 pm.
