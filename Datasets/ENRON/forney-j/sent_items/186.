It looks like we will be moving back to Portland before summer starts.     The job didnt turn out as promised and I was put into a role that I didnt want.
Oh well.    The Portland team still wants me and has offered 4 different roles to choose from.   
You cant beat that.

Anyway,  I will let you know how it turns out.
