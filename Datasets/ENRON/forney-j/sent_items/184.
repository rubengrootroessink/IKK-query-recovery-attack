Hey,
looks like I will be returning to Portland.    They want me back and it is a much better place to work.       HR is wanting me to consider other opportunities in Houston,  however.     They have one week to come up with something,  otherwise I'm outta here.  Other companies are paying ridiculous sums to experienced West traders (California experience).
Thanks for considering me for your group and I'll keep you updated.

JMF
