John:

	One more thing I neglected to mention.  Deal Blotter only refreshed lookups once per day, the first time it is run.  After that, you must do it manually.  When Deal Blotter comes up, you will see that one of the main menu items is "Refresh."  Choose Refresh, Lookups, All and the lookups will be refreshed.  That should solve the problem.  Sorry for not mentioning that earlier.

William,   things look better  but,    George does not have access to the EPMI Hourly Ercot book.       This is the book that he trades primarily.
He also needs EPMI Ercot Asset.

Thanks,
JMF

	Have him log out of EnPower, log back in and try again.  I've got him set up in Blotter with East portfolio.  Let me know if this did not work.

The Resolution desk has given me the password.   However,  George was not set up in deal blotter under North America,  East Region.   I have since submitted another E-request for George.   The reason is,   he cannot log onto blotter or create deals under his name.
Can you watch out for this?

	The user ID was apparently set to GPHILLIP  The password should be the same.  If that does not work, please let me know.
