I used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.   He asked me one day:  " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in  taxes?"    I told both of them (laughing)  that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that,  since they didnt enter any contest.
They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.    I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.

The jackass scam artist called them back,  bitching that they had cancelled their check.    My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN.
He tried to reinstate the check ,  but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.    He was going to do this again,  but I told his in-laws,  friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.   He finally saw the light.   Just doing my job.

Anyway,  this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.    He works at the Harris county courthouse.    His wife ran off with a crack head,  left him with the kids,    didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.    The divorce was in Liberty where this woman,  also a dumbass friend from wayback,   had worked for the Judge presiding over her case.     
She got the kids and he pays $2500/month.

Life is less fair to dumbasses

Not sure if you knew of this or not...

DON'T EVER DIAL AREA CODE 809

This one is being distributed all over the U.S.  This
is pretty scary - especially given the way they try to
get you to call.  Be sure you read this and pass it on
to all your friends, family and business associates so
they don't get scammed!!  THIS IS A MAJOR SCAM.

Don't respond to E-Mails, phone calls or web pages
which tell you to call an "809" phone number.  This is
a very important issue of Scam Busters because it
alerts you to a scam that is spreading "extremely"
quickly.  This can easily cost you $24,100.00 or more
and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it.
We'd like to thank Verizon for bringing this scam to
our attention.  This scam has also been identified by
the National Fraud Information Center and is costing
victims a lot of money.

There are lots of different permutations of this scam,
but HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. You will receive a message on
your answering machine, voice mail, etc, asking you to
call a number beginning with the area code 809.  The
reasons you are asked to call varies.  It can be to
receive information about a family member who has been
ill, to tell you someone you know has been arrested,
died, to let you know you have won a wonderful prize,
etc.  In each case, you are told to call the 809
number right away.  Since there are so many new area
codes these days, people unknowingly return these
calls.  If you call from the U.S., you will apparently
be charged $2,425.00 per minute.  Or. you will get a
long recorded message.  The point is, they will try to
keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase
the charges.  Unfortunately, when you get your phone
bill, you'll often be charged more than $24,100.00.

WHY IT WORKS:  The 809 area code number is located in
the British Virgin Islands (The Bahamas).  The 809
area code can be used as a "pay-per-call" number,
similar to 900 numbers in the U.S.  Since 809 is not
in the U.S., it is not covered by U.S. regulations of
900 numbers, which require that you be notified and
warned of charges and rates involved when you call a
"pay-per-call" number.  There is also no requirement
that the company provide a time period during which
you may terminate the call without being charged.
Furthermore, whereas many U.S. phones have 900 number
blocking to avoid these kinds of charges.  900 number
blocking will not prevent calls to the 809 area code.
We recommend that no matter how you get the message,
if you are asked to call a number with an 809 area
code that you don't recognize and/orinvestigate
further and just disregard the message.  Be wary of
E-Mail or calls asking you to call an 809 area code
num! ber.  It's important to prevent becoming a victim
of this scam since trying to fight the charges
afterwards can become a real nightmare.

That's because you did actually make the call.  If you
complain, both your local phone company and your long
distance carrier will not want to get involved.  They
will most likely tell you that they are simply
providing the billing for the foreign company.  You'll
end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they
have done nothing wrong.  Please forward this entire
message to all of your friends, family and colleagues
to help them become aware of this scam
