Lloyd,
This is the guy I was talking about last week.   Kevin seemed to think he would be good on the retail side.   I can answer any questions that may arise, or ,   I can put you in touch with Saji.

Thanks,
JMF

Hi John,

Nice meeting you on Friday. I have attached my resume which gives an outline of my background and the work I had done while at ENA origination and ENA trading/structuring. Since I have been with EBS for only 3 months, I have not included any details of the work I have done here. 

Let me know if I need to meet or talk to anyone at the desk to move this forward.

Thanks for all your help.
