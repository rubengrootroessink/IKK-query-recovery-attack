They are members of the RT group,  so they will sit at the "rotating seat" of 3111f.
They will have the same access as Steve Olinde, Joe Capasso,  etc.

Can we copy the profiles of existing team members?

John,

Please confirm the following people and when they should arrive:

George Phillips	09/17/01

Wong Iz

Where are these guys going to sit and what system access do you want them to have?  I am assuming they are going to shift?

Thanks for your help,
