I have 2 tee times reserved for a foursome but I only have 2 golfers (my
friend from vegas and myself).  It would be great if you could join us.

Fish Creek 7:50 am Saturday 8/4
TPC  3 PM saturday 8/4

We would like to try and play sunday morning as well but I do not have a tee
time as of yet.

Scott

Scott,
I heard that the TPC was in decent shape.    Are you planning on playing on
Saturday in the morning or afternoon?
How many people do you have in the group?

   John,

   Just checking to see if I have your email address correct.  Did you find
   out
   anything on TPC?

   Scott
