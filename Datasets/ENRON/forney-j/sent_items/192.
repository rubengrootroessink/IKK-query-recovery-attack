Brett,
Have heard that Platter was given trading responsibility on EOL for offpeak California and other markets.   I heard he has done an awesome job and Richter & the gang are really happy with him.    He is motivated and challenged,  which is what he needed.  
As far as timing,  I dont know yet.     Could be next week or next month.    I kind of wanted to work on the Ercot desk,  but not for Presto.

Anyway,  keep in touch you wino.

JMF

Actually, it's the Taylor Ducks!!!!  I don't think Ducks like to be called Beetles.  As far as mascots go, I personally don't see any difference.
What's been up mgt's butt?  Isn't it in their, and Uncle E's, best interest to give you all the tools and knowledge needed to be successful?  
What changes do you see happening once ERCOT real-time is established? 
I'm a little cornfused (speaking of Platter, have you heard how he's doing?).  Are you going back to Portland before, during or after you've done the ERCOT gig?  Services desk in Houston or Portland? I'm not a smart man.  I'm actually envious of your potential move back to the Pacific NW.  It's cool to have you and Debbie down here and all, but my vote is for a return back to Portland.  The more connections we have up there, the better.  But don't get me wrong - I'm keeping your best interest in mind.  It's all about you!
By the way, we've found a few places that sell MacTarnahan's, and even some Sokol Blosser wine.  Speaking of wine, I am now an official of both white AND red wines.  We spent the Memorial holiday at my buddy's place just outside of Galveston.  It was a lot of our friends we've known since Jr. High.  I drank more red wine than beer that weekend.  Took a lot of crap about it, and got called "West Coast", but the wine was gooooooood. 
Anyway, it's 20:07, so I need to get my fat butt home.  Keep me posted on any new developments.  I'm sure it will work out for the best, whatever that may be.  Tell "Wifey" I said hey.  
Best Regards, 
Brett

Bart, 
que paso,   juaro?    
Jeff passed on your e-mail.   Too bad about the beetles.   Is that the 
Taylor High School Mascot?   "Taylor,  home of the fighting 
beetles,"....  Go beetles! 
I think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up,  but it 
just reemphasizes the need for you;    they need an organizer and this 
situation fits your strengths. 
Well,  enough about you,  let's talk about me.............. 
the Entergy gig was made more difficult,  as I received NO training in 
cash trading.     After a couple of months,  a coworker took me in and 
gave me some pointers on hedging,  which is especially important in my 
region.   The month of May was very profitable,  finally,  and things 
were coming together until.......... 
(Please keep this confidential) 
Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of 
the Real Time group,  his decision being final,  no negotiations. 
(thanks for your understanding, bunghole). 
I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas 
in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his 
decision. 
I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved 
with,  given that we have retail load to service,  etc.   However, 
thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.   I suspect 
other changes would ensue,  once I established this region. 
So.     It looks like I will be returning to Portland.    We bought a 
new house here and are very happy with everything,  except my job (which 
is a huge thing). 
I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service 
Desk.    I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.     
Anyway,  I was pissed in the beginning,  but I had to take time to 
digest this,  analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional 
decision.   
I am too deep in the (out of the money)   options to cut and run,  so it 
now boils down to where do I want to live.   There is interest outside 
of the company  in me,  but I am under contract.    I miss Portland and 
I think about it all the time.     I must be a mountain man at heart. 
Well,  let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.   Once again, 
I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk,  just yet. 
I heard that you did really well on your home sale.    That's awesome. 
Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.  (just kidding). 
I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a 
house.   How is your housing in Taylor? 
I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.   It is freaking 
hot here in Texas! 
Anyway,  keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!
