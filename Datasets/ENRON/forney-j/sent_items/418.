We are collecting information to dispute Ercot's OOMC calculation.    OOMC has not had a defined clearing price due to the the non-functioning Replacement reserves mkt.
Ercot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an OOMC.   I think that this goes back to Sept 14th.

Also at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for.    Ercot claims that OOMC means run, instead of standby.   So,  for the times that we were asked to run,  Ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price, versus the OOME heat rate calculation.

How far can we go back in a dispute?  I thought we were somewhat limited.
