I have sold Frontera a financial swap for $28.50 for hours ending 7-12.    The first 3 hours are for size (300 mw's).  
I would buy hours 7-9 tomorrow for up to $20.      I could buy up to the 300 mw's.     Schedule this to load in the North.
I could also use 200 mw's for he 10 and 150 mw's for he 11.

Calpine has had an offer recently for hours ending 7-9.

If you have questions,  please give me a call,  as this is a very important issue.

Words of advice:

Dont go into the market with a $20 bid for 300 mw's.   Quietly accumulate these mw's if possible.     Do not tip your hand on this deal,  as that would contribute to spiking RT prices.

Thanks,
JMF
