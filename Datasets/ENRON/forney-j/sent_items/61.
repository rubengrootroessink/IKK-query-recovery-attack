Andrea,
apparently an imbalance deal was entered under Teco services and the mark to market flag was not removed.    I show negative new deal value for Teco Services,  when I sold above the curve on their behalf.
I assume this is the reason for the negative new deal value.

The deal has been revised,  as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway.   This imbal. sale deal will be taken to zero and resold to another counterparty tonight.

Will I ever get a true up for the negative new deal value?
