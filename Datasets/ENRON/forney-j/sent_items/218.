We have four direct lines to the Ercot ISO that have been installed on each of your turrets.    As an ISO participant,  we are required to be staffed 24-7 to handle any request from the ISO concerning our generation, or to handle contingencies related to our preschedules.

If any of these lines should ring,  we need to be sure to pick it up.    Ercot  may just be testing our responsiveness,  or ,  they may have a specific question about the mock market that is taking place now.      Any questions that cannot be immediately answered should be relayed to Smith Day or myself.

We will be installing hardware soon that will receive generation instructions from the ISO.   For RT purposes,  this will be used for billing purposes.    Any action ordered by the ISO will also be communicated to the Control room simultaneously.   They will be responsible for the actual dispatch of the unit.

We will be announcing a meeting soon to describe our new Ercot world and to exchange ideas.    I would also like to have a session with the group to explain the logic behind the reports we are responsible and to explain how the whole floor works.    This can be a broad overview,  or we can drill down to specifics at your request.

  

Thanks for your attention.

JMF
