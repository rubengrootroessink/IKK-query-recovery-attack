Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.     Hope she's a good sleeper.      Now at least you can field some different questions,  "how is the baby?"   versus "where is the baby?"
But,  as Kim used to say,  "enough about you,   let's talk about me."   I spoke with Tim B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.    He mentioned that West has needs in Services,  Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.    I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt,  as I could build upon my experience  and also learn as much of the structuring side as  possible.     Wherever I go,  I am ready to make an impact.

 The HR department here in Houston wants me to entertain other opportunities within Houston and they have brought some things before me today.    I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here,  as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.    However,   Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.   I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here,  but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.   

Anyway,  I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss,  but that's probably not practical.     Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.      

 I know that you are out of the office,  but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.

Thanks,
JMF
