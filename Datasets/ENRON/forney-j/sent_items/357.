Kim,
Havent talked to you for awhile.    Hope everything is going well.
I do have a question about who will be doing my review.     Also,  dont we still have a rating system?     I would like to see my entire review and have the opportunity to sign off on it.   
Also,  is it possible for me to review my personel file?   Is this within company policy?

Lastly,   can you provide to me a copy of my contract?    Mine is packed in a box somewhere due to the move.

Thank you for your time.
