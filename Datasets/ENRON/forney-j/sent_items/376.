Victor,
 We spoke  a couple of days ago concerning employment opportunities at LCRA.    Do you have any questions about the resume that I sent?
I can supply additional info or answer questions,  as necessary.
I was also wondering what specifically LCRA was looking for.     I have QSE experience and am familiar with Ercot billing.      
Addtionally,  I have some extremely capable co-workers that would be interested in talking with your firm.     Our Ercot team has been profitable and is extremely motivated.

Let me know if we have something in common.

Thanks,
John Forney
Director,  Ercot Trading
