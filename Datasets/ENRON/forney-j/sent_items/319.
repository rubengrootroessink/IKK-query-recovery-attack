I left you a request over a week ago concerning clarification of your question.
Could you please present your question in written form as a reply to this e-mail?
If I cannot answer the question,  then I will get an answer from our Ercot Rep.

The Ercot Settlement Statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they Protocols are being followed.
This is what is complicated as Ercot doesnt yet know their own rules.

Let me know what you have.
