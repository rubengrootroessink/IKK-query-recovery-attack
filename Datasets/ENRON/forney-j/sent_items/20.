Frank--the summary of duties for trading at Enron is as follows:

Enron:
Jeff King - Long Term ERCOT (front months, Quarters, Calendar Yrs)
Paul Schivone - Short Term ERCOT (daily, bal-week, bal-month, front month)
John Forney -  EPMI ERCOT Hourly


TECO / Services Trading:
John Forney - TECO (Day-Ahead, Bal-Month, Front-Month, etc.) Trading, TECO ERCOT Hourly

As the manager of the ERCOT hourly desk, John "wears both hats" for TECO and Enron and is responsible for maximizing opportunities for TECO and Enron.
