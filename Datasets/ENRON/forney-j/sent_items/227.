Thanks for getting back to me - I can certainly understand why you made this decision and I really hope that it works out!  I would love to have you back in Portland but you need to do what is best for you and Deb.  

Sounds like you will have a busy year trying to turns things around - but I know that you can definitely make a difference once you put your mind to it.  Also, the training piece of it sounds great too - what a great way to learn and not necessarily have the book responsibility right off.....

I am in Houston next week - would you be able to catch up for a coffee?

Thanks!
Amy

Amy,
I have elected to stay in Houston until at least February.  It is so late in the year,  that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have "lost" the first part of this year,  as I was training (myself).
There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself.    To that end,   Lloyd Will has offered me an opportunity to trade around Enron's assets in Texas,   learning the term trading side of the business from Doug Gilbert-Smith.
Both Doug and Lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need,  while they get my experience in Services,  training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.

These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.   I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.    I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone,  and I will revisit this issue in Feb.

This compromise seems reasonable.   I have asked that this be committed to writing,  so I am editing what Lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities.

Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason:    they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money.
This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the "back corner."
The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.

A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him,  then he has them sent home.     I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.     One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told.   This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.   This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors,  but I will not be any part of it.

I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture.    If we dont get buy in from the top,  I will also be at risk of going home.    Some of these guys just dont get it.

There are, however,  many positives to staying here:  the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.   They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.   I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.

Well,  thanks for listening to my sermon, sister Amy.   My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.
Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.    If you have any thoughts or advice,  please share,  as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.   

Later,
JMF
