Due to Oklaunion being down  for maintenance,    we are being cut again on offpeak schedule #570719.     This 25 mw purchase from Tenaska needs to be replaced for hour ending 23 and 24 today.     Buy the power tonight  and enter deal under Ercot Mgmt book, as this is Doug's power.
I have already made the cuts in Enpower for both hours ending 23,24 and tomorrow.

For tomorrow,  I have purchased energy for this schedule,  so we dont have to worry about it on a real time basis.

If you have questions,  let me know.

Thanks,
JMF
