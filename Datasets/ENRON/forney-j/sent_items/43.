We are short on the offpeak for the three days including saturday,  sunday,  and monday.     We are floating 55 mw's   in the South zone.
If you replace this power,  please remove the appropriate counterparty in the portal and replace with new counterparty.

Also:

The Frontera plant is currently NOT scheduled to run this weekend or Monday.    We are currently,  as of Friday,  experiencing problems with units #2 & #3.  These tripped offline when a breaker problem on CPL's side occurred.
We have been asked by Ercot to reflect in the Resource Plan that unit #1 is available but offline.   We have done so.  When the other units become available,   please update them as available in the Resource Plan for the remaining hours of Saturday.    We should make sure that we have OOM premiums (up and down) and zero mw's scheduled.

If you have questions,   give me a call.
