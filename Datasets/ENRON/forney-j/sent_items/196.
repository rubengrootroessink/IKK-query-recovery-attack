Please note that when you start/stop a schedule to or from the following control areas,  the listed static scheduling fee applies.   

Reliant/HLP  - $49
TNMP  - $55
COA   -  $40
BEC  - $25


For example,  if we schedule for one hour from BEC>COA,   the one-time charge for scheduling alone would be a flat  $65.      Also applicable would be the per mw  line losses and the wheeling fee of $.22  .    
Please account for all such charges in the P&L report.

Thanks,
JMF
