Jeff,
If you've rec'd a deployment instruction that is a Category 2,3  or 4, it implies the deployment is to relieve operational, or local, CONG.   The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch algorithm has determined your unit is  located such that its movement per the instructions will help to alleviate the  local congestion.  Following is copied from the document, "Market  Bulletin-Thursday August 8, 2001".  This is the last paragraph on page 2 of  that document.
"Therefore, when Operational  Congestion exists, the solution found in STEP 1 may be augmented in STEP 2 with  both resource specific and modified portfolio awards. The result of STEP 2 is  always a set of final portfolio based and resource specific dispatch  instructions to be issued to the QSEs to solve the operational congestion.  Because the final portfolio based dispatch instruction equals the net result of  the preliminary STEP 1 portfolio based balancing energy awards and any STEP 2  portfolio adjustments, the QSE's bid curve may not match the MCPE  determined in STEP 1. This may be causing the appearance of being incorrectly  "struck". Whenever a QSE receives unit specific deployments, it will  also receive a Category 1 portfolio based deployment. ERCOT expects that the  portfolio-based instruction will be followed."
So, even though your customer is determining your bids, your  unit could be called upon to relieve any local Cong that results from "Step 1"  (per the referenced bulletin) deployments to resolve load/gen imbalances and  zonal cong, if that unit is deemed to have an effect (the shift factor) on  the constrained line.  
 
Clear as mud?  Hope this  helps.  
 
I'm leaving here in about five minutes to go to an appt with  Holly, but will be back in on Monday.  
 
Regards,
 
Brett

Brett--
we're  being deployed down (DBES) for more than what our bid states.  In
other  words, we had a DBES Bid in for $-5 and we're getting deployed to  dec
generation and the MCP is $28.  The kicker is the "category" of DBES  in
which we're being deployed.  I just got off the phone with Mark  Paterson &
he's indicated that if you are deployed to provide DBES in  "category" 2
through 4, then that DBES Deployment was given--unit specific--  OUTSIDE THE
BID STACK (he said it was because we were CAUSING  congestion).
My concern is that our bids are instructed by our  customer.  The customer
is wondering why we're being deployed above our  bid.  Also of concern is
that, according to Mark, that these  DBES's--categories 2 through 4 are
treated and settled as OOM's--largely a  different settlement than DBES.
Add to that that the "category" treatment  relative to settlement (or even
being mentioned, for that matter) is NOT in  the protocols--per Mark.
He's just sent me a one-page explanation of this  process so I need to
review it but have you heard of  this?
