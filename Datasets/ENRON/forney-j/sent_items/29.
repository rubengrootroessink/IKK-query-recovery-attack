A friend over at tractebel told me that they had a plant coming on line 9/14.  The plant is located in the North zone with the capability of 340mw, 35mw will run on 9/14 and be thrown into the pool. If you  don't already have them as a contact their number is 877.350.8420.  Kenneth Kemp and Tim Ming are ERCOT contacts.
