Erik,
I will be available earlier than 5:30 for an informal discussion.  I will be in the office Monday and Tuesday of this week.   I will be out the remainder of the week on vacation.
Let me know if this works.

Lloyd, 

I wanted to try to set up an appointment with you regarding any opportunities on the power desk. 

I have worked for Greg Woulfe and Jim Fallon managing the advertising trading in EBS and formerly on the Coal desk for Dan Reck and George McClellan.

How does your schedule look tomorrow or Friday? 

Thanks for your time, 

Erik Simpson
