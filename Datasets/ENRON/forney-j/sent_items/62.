John, A resolution to this issue has not been made.  Obviously we will need to have a resolution prior to final settlement.

Subject: More questions 
Mark, 
Hope all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC 
capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual 
OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO. 
He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 
9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th. 
We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand 
the payment for the energy portion of the exercise. 
However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity 
portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement 
reserve market. 
The replacement reserve prices have been zero. 
Could you provide some help on this? 
Thanks, 
J Forney
