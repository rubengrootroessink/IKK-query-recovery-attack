You are done on those dates.   Thanks for being specific.
Sorry that Johnny had not spoken with me,  but it will work out okay.
It seemed like you were needing some additional days off in July?   Is that right?

Hope your training with Errigo went well this weekend.

John,

I made a list of dates that I had requested off to Johnny Palmer(recruiter) when I hired on and he told me he ran them by you but obviously he did not.  I wanted to give you these dates and see if you could work with these days that I need off.

8/10 (6:30pm - 9pm)  Marital Seminar
8/11 (9:00am - noon) Marital Seminar
10/13 (evening) couples shower
11/2 - 11/11 Wedding and Honeymoon

Thanks, Alex.
