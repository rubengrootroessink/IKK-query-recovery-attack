Chris,
I had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes,  but was unsuccessful.    I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out.     Enpower is out of balance  and the books are as well.  
Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced,  as we cannot tie out with our customers.

We will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status,  then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in.

You mention inadvertancy in your Notes,  but I dont know the particulars of this problem.    I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower.     If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift,   then you should be in balance when you leave.
The Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not.

Give me a call to straighten this out.

JMF
