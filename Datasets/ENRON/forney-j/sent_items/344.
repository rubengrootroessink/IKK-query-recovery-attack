Ercot has a problem that could cause us great financial pain:   
Sometimes when we are  submitting an hourly schedule, through the Ercot Portal,  the Day-ahead schedules are affected.
Mismatches for every counterparty occur.     We are subject to the hourly price for mismatches and this could prove extremely costly, even for one hour.
    Eric Saibi spoke with the Ercot help desk who indicated that the problem was on our side.

I called Ercot  and after some time,  they relayed that they were experiencing server problems.

Attached below is the ticket number related to this problem.   If this occurs again,   make sure that you reference this number.

Thanks,
JMF
