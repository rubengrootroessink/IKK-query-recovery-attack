	Please make the following arrangements for me in order to join Tom and Jeff in Tampa for the Teco meeting:

7/16 - Depart Hobby to Tampa at 7:50pm flight.
Stay at Hyatt - Jeff Miller has made the arrangements already.

7/17 - Depart Tampa 4:30, arrive Houston 6:35pm.




I will  be calling on Friday to check on this.   Remember,  I will be on vacation Friday and Monday.   I was scheduled to take Tuesday off, but I will have to attend this meeting.
Please do not schedule a vacation day for me on Tuesday.


Thanks,
JForney
