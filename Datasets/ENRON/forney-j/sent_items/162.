Frank,
I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities.     Although you mentioned that  the $1,800  (the amount in my account) is a small sum,  I have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm,   given to performance of the suggestions provided previously.   
I have been a market maker in the electricity business and I realize that no one is right all of the time;    I dont expect this.      However,   I do expect some consistent contact from a broker  who has been successful in his own trading, not just success in brokering trades.      My view will be that the more success we have,  the more money I will be willing to invest.

I am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you  and learning more about you, your track record and your abilities.
I do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that I have expiring in January.    I would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile.

I will not use your suggestions to trade at  discount brokerage or otherwise abuse our potential relationship.   


I look forward to hearing from you.
