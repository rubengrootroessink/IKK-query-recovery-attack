Lloyd,
I received this from Preston.    It appears now that they wish to choose the customers that will switch.   
We were of the understanding that we were to pick the customer based upon the information that EES was to provide.
We havent received the necessary information,  so no choice has been made yet.

Please see the attached and let me know your comments.

JMF

We would like to switch these accounts. We'd like the switch to be effective September 4th, but our top priority is to make sure they get into the pilot program. (I realize that it may be impossible to decide exactly when the switch will become effective)

Please confirm that we can get this done.

Preston,

I talked with Rebecca this evening.  Here is the summary:

- We cannot be ready to do business with CP&L or TNP by August.
- She has a relatively high degree of confidence (85%) that we could be ready with HL&P and TXU, here are the main issues:
She would like the rate schedule (and account number if available) of each account we would like to get into the pilot to confirm that there is room.  She indicated that she had understood that all rate schedules are filled and that the website may be in error.
There are outstanding issues on how interzonal congestion and gross receipts tax will be billed.
Invoicing will likely be manual with additional costs associated.  There may also be other manual workarounds necessary at additional expense.
The Pilot Agreements will need to be completed (per Gloria Ogenyi).

Please send her item #1 asap so that she can confirm that there is room for these accounts.  Once this is done we can put on the full court press for August.

Thanks,
Jeff
