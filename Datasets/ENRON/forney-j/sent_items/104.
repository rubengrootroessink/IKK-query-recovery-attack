So,  you waited until the weather became bearable before coming to Houston?   Good call there.
I travelled to Portland a week ago to visit friends.    Deb and I had a great time and the flight was so cheap,  $165.       The weather was awesome and the wine was good 
(  as far as I can remember ).    
Anyway,  it was good to see Stewie, Tim and even Richter.    

What are you working on here,  is it classified?
