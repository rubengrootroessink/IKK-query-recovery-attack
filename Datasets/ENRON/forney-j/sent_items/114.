Anoush, 
I have talked with John Phillips with Cinergy Worldwide.    His company is an experienced residential load aggregator in the Northeast.  They are not related to the Cinergy utility.      They are interested in a partnership with Enron/New Power where Cinergy would market directly to individuals using our paper/ terms in return for a negotiated fee.
He is interested in entering the Texas Choice arena.     They claim to be capable of size in signups.

I thought that this may be a good fit for NewP. 
The number for  John Phillips is :   410-365-5613


Let me know what your thoughts are.
