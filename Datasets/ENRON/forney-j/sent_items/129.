The Resolution desk has given me the password.   However,  George was not set up in deal blotter under North America,  East Region.   I have since submitted another E-request for George.   The reason is,   he cannot log onto blotter or create deals under his name.
Can you watch out for this?

John:

	The user ID was apparently set to GPHILLIP  The password should be the same.  If that does not work, please let me know.
