Unplanned Losses - ($898.22)
Static Sch Fees - $49.00
ERCOT Sch Fees - $136.40

Total - ($713.82)

Don't spend it all in one place!


PS  I'll be out on Friday however I will be in early Monday to finish calculating June's losses and fees then putting the monthly annuities in so that they will be included in June's numbers.  I can email you the file when I finish it so you can check the numbers if you want.  Let me know.

Thanks,
MJ
