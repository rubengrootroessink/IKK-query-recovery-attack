Allan,
I havent heard anything from Anadarko,  but I am talking to several other players.    There is a possibility that I will be relocating to Tampa Florida or possibly back to Oregon.	Thanks for passing my info along and inquiring as to my situation.      We still need to make time for that beer.   I get out of work very early each day, as our trading opportunities are severely limited.

I would like to pass on a couple of resumes from two of my friends that were released at Enron.      My friend has some solid accounting background and his wife worked in HR as a specialist.    They are a Woodlands couple and would like to avoid that crappy drive to Houston.

I know that Anadarko is probably being swamped with resumes,  but I didnt know if your department had specific needs that may match what Jim has to offer.  This guy is extremely detail oriented and capable.
If you could review and pass these on,  I would really appreciate it:  this is my golfing buddy and he cant play anymore if he isnt working.  Just kidding

Tell me what is happening with you.  ( I still dont miss Koch,  but I miss working 8 - 9 hour days!).  I think that Mike Eiben has been long gone from Enron.   I had been looking for him before the layoffs,  but hadnt been able to find him in the voice directory, etc.

Call or e-mail and I will meet at Buffalo Wild Wings or somewhere else.  We dont have to talk about work.....no,   lets not talk about work!

Thanks,

JMF
