Kim,
Thanks for spending time with me yesterday.   I have spoken with Tom May concerning what my status was.   I mentioned that my preference would be to return to Portland,  however,  I would be considering other options within the company for one week.
My thought was that I need to relay this same message to Presto,  Doug and Lloyd.     I will communicate this today,  unless you have other ideas.

As discussed,  I have attached a copy of my resume.   It is getting kind of long,  but I havent really gotten a chance to "abbreviate."

Thanks again for helping,  
JMF
