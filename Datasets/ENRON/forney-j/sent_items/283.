Lloyd,
I spoke with Steve directly about Kevin's e-mail and concerns.    Steve said that Dan of C.O.B contacted him,  inquiring about job opportunities here.     Steve did mention to Dan that "someone" from their shop had already inquired.   He was not specific.    Dan,  evidently,  figured who this was (not very hard)  and spread the word at the COB office.   Subsequently,   Dan and Brandon sent their resumes.

I have spoken directly with Steve about this issue.  I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.    Clearly,  this is unacceptable and Steve has apologized.

How do you feel about this:   
if we hire Kevin,  then this problem somewhat goes away.    I need someone immediately and Kevin could be plugged right in,  similar to Alex.     I know that Kevin may not be a solid fit for the trader track program,  but I am needing some help pretty quick.

Let me know - sorry for the very awkward  situation.

JMF
