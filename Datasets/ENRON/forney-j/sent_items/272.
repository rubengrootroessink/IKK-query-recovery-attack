John,

This is what I've come up with so far on Market Opportunity & Operational plan.  I think this would be a good place to also include Mexico opportunities.  Please add/edit as you wish.


Thinking out loud:

Operational Plan and Market Opportunities going forward:

Off-Peak Energy (including Weekends & Holidays):		To date, this market has been less-attractive-EPMI and TECO need to work together to ensure Frontera is gaining maximum value.  This should begin as soon as possible.  Examination of  NOT running the plant during  [Forney, John M.]  the weekend and other offpeak hours  is paramount.

ERCOT Market:	EPMI personnel have a wealth of experience in working in ISO Markets.  It is our feeling that the ERCOT market, which opens July 20, will provide [Forney, John M.]  significant   opportunity in maximizing value for Frontera.   [Forney, John M.]      Opportunity should lie within the Balancing Market [Forney, John M.]  ,   Ancillary Services Market [Forney, John M.]   and the decremental bidding "market."  [Forney, John M.]  Immediate plans will include submitting decremental bids into the ISO.   We will be responsible for responding to the ISO instructions by decreasing the output from Frontera during key hours.
