Scott,
The wife is out of town until Saturday night.    I can play alot of golf on Saturday,  but I need to spend time with the wife on Sunday.     I will be available for the golf marathon on Saturday.    I have one player for Saturday morning,  but I dont have a player for Sat. afternoon yet, although I have another co-worker who is interested.
Should I fill this spot as well?

JMF

John,  I am setting up a tee time for Sunday 8/5 around 8-9 AM at Augusta
Pines.  I just wanted to confirm if you could play Saturday afternoon at TPC
or Sunday morning at Augusta Pines?

Talk to you soon,

Scott

Scott,
I heard that the TPC was in decent shape.    Are you planning on playing on
Saturday in the morning or afternoon?
How many people do you have in the group?
