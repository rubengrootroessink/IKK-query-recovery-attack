Frank,
I spoke with Victoria Bender and Julie Gildea yesterday.   Julie expects to send me some info today.
I will be out of the office after lunch today,  so it would be best if she sends e-mail to my home address,

fourknees@msn.com

My cell phone will also be on,  the number is 713-412-7529.


Thanks,
JMF
