  John,

I had a mismatch problem in the portal that I think you and the group should know about.

I completed a trade with Calpine tonight (09/08/01), I purchased 50mw for HE 3 & 4 and 
quickly input it in the portal.  At approximately 1:50am, Calpine still did not have their side 
of the trade input, so I gave Scott at Calpine a quick call.  He was in the process
of inputting the information in the system and I could see the Calpine entries turning from 
red to black.

All of the entries matched up correctly except for the 300 interval and this is where
the problem begins.  Scott confirmed the trade verbally and I, also, had the same information
(i.e. - 50mw, South Zone, etc...).  Even though, everything was the same in both portals, it remained red
and unmatched.  

Scott called Jake at Ercot and confirmed that both sides of the trade were correct, 
but he did not know why it did not match up.  He said it was a system problem and 
that he would have it looked at on Monday.

Jake at Ercot mentioned that we should contact our customer service rep. to make sure that we 
are not incurred any penalties.

Please keep an eye on this as it could become a chronic problem.
I have documented this in the QSE Mismatch log book.

I hope this has been helpful.
