Johnny,
I just received this from Lloyd.   I dont want to cause any double coverage by HR, so you might want to check with Kim.
Thanks!

Talk to Kim she is running with this now I think.

I dropped George and Sanjay a quick note last night that Kim was working on the offer and hopefully this week they would see something.

Thanks.

Johnny,
What is the status of George?   I think that you have been speaking with Lloyd Will concerning bringing him over from EES.   George is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to EES.    I would think not, at this time.
Lloyd is out of town until Monday,  so I am trying to follow up on his behalf.


Thanks,
JForney
