John - 
How is business?   Things not as fun here as PDX.
I am still in the market for a car and I have a strong candidate:    1990 Carrera 2 cabriolet.    It has 64k and the interior is flawless.
The exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips,  etc in the front.    The paint has some waterspots on the hood as well.
The guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car.     It may be possible to get these out by a detail shop.

Heres the kicker:   the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable.     I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k.         It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip.   The car drives great.

Do you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model?   The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great.    Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots?   The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000.   The retail is supposedly $33k.
What am I missing here?

Thanks,
JMF
