Please use the following:

Cell -  813-760-7199
Office - 813-228-4907 (should roll over to his cell after hours)
second line in home:  813-634-7772


We have had problems locating Jerry on occasion in order to affect schedule changes.   He lives in a rural area and his cell phone doesnt always work.    In these instances, we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation.    They have refused in the past, as they were only to receive instruction from Jerry.

The plant should now be aware that this communication problem can exist and will be receptive to making generation changes per our instructions.
