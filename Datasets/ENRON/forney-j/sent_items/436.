Ben,
Our Ercot lines arent working.    We are located at desks 678-680.
Also, could you please make the Ercot lines 1-4 appear on page 1 of all Ercot hourly traders phones?
You did this for us in the old building,  but those changes didnt transfer.

The traders are:
Joe Capasso
Alex McElreath
George Phillips
Steve Olinde
Seung-Tak Oh
John Forney

Thanks,
JMF
