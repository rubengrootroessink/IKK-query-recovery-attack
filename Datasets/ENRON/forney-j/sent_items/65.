joan,
good to hear from you - everything is still pretty wild up here, but it is going very well.    Sorry to hear about the neighbors,  but i think that you will enjoy living downtown.
there is so much to do here now.  
how are your hours now?  im sure that they are pretty scary.

seen any good bands lately?

JMF

are you still around?  what's going on? 

we are so busy, it is amazing.  we will probably be closing 4 vpp's in the next 1.5 months...for a total of , well, with the curve as is, over $350 MM. 

i am moving...downtown to a hi rise.  my new neighbors moved in in july, with 4 yappy dogs.  they are right outside my bedroom.  so, i have not had a quiet nite sleep, or morning, or even afternoon since they've been here.  long story, but have decided to move out, then will put my house on the market.  hopefully, the housing and financial markets will stay up until i sell.  if not, then i will have to rent it out.

still not dating anyone, so if you know of someone.....
