Thanks for keeping me updated,  jackie! 
Seriously,   how are things going in the homeland?   Are you glad to be back?   Let me know what 's happening.
I havent talked to brother Jimmy lately.   He is not answering his phone here.
Say hello to the wife -  we never hear from anyone in Portland.  

Knock em dead in your new job!
