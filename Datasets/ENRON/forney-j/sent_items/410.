A lot of shops are interested,  mainly speculators.       I have had at least 7 different counterparties use this.      Utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure,  locking in a fixed return.   How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc.
No problem with EOL,  as we are trading it up.
You need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile, in my opinion.     You will see Ercot S 8-22  and N 8-22.   You will need to add these and every other hour listed.
Thanks,

Thanks for the info.  Just curious, are there many other shops showing an
interest?  Also, I haven't seen any numbers yet this morning, have you not
shown any or is it a problem with my EOL?  Thanks again.

Sure,  I am online everyday.
I get in about 6 am, usually putting the numbers on at 6:30.   I start with
hr ending 8-22 and change to 9-22 usually when the first interval of he 9
is printed.
This is at my discretion.
You may post a limit order (either a bid or offer) that covers mine and
transact online.   You wont necessarily be trading with me,  another
counterparty can lift your offer or hit your bid.

Let's trade it up!!!

   Are you all still showing numbers for intraday ERCOT swaps?  If so when
   do
   you normally post them.  Thanks.
