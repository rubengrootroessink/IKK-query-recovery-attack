Dave,
I should have been more specific;    Brett is working at the Ercot ISO,  near Austin Texas.    His e-mail address is below.


'bhunsucker@ercot.com'

Thanks,
JMF

Hey John!
I'm glad got through to you and that your settling into Texas life.  I did
not know Brett was at the ISO now.  How long ago did he make the switch? If
you have an email addr. for Brett, I would appreciate touching bases with
him also.

Not sure if you remember me telling you before I left PDX, but Phoenix is my
home town.  I have been loving it!  And the family really likes it here too.
Went javalina hunting with my son for the first time back in Feb. and love
camping out in the desert.  We did not kill any of those little pigs (did
not even see one), but it was still a blast.

Of course it is hot as hell here too.  Not a lot of humidity, which is a
life saver, but still keeps a fellow inside were the AC is working.  From
October to May, the weather is great, and that's when we do most of our out
door stuff.  My son is 12 years old now and already as tall as dad.  Man!
Does that ever make a fellow realize he is getting "old."  If I'm ever in
Houston John, I'll look you up.  I usually bring my wife (Joy) along on
business trips, so maybe we could meet you for one of those famous Texas
steaks one evening?

Take care John and may God continue to bless you!

Your friend,

Dave, its good to hear from you.
We are in Houston and its hot!   My wife is doing great and we are still
trying to get used to life in Houston.
I am trading in Ercot region (Texas) and, of course,  Brett is now working
at the ISO.
MY WIFE AND I MISS PORTLAND
Working in the main office isnt as much fun as working in Portland.
There is a good chance that I will return to PDX, as there are so many good
people there and so much to do outdoors.
So, tell me what you are doing now in Phoenix.    Everyone that I've met
from SRP has been very nice,  (Perry,  John Sullivan,  etc.).   Hope you
enjoy working there and all is well with your family.

JMF
