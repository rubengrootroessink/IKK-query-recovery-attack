The turrrets are programmed in the order of personal preference.   However,  you can use someone's while they are gone.  
I will get you access to Watt's or Eric's.

Thanks,
JMF

I've spoken w/ TJae....

My turret ID is gone...But there is a temporary turret number that is normally used for visiting personnel that I may be able to use.  To get around all this, why don't you just have a list of the guys working under you & have these numbers programmed into each turret..When you need my help, I can just use their turret IDs & we'll have the problem solved. 

TJae will be getting back to me on the turret status but what about this solution?
