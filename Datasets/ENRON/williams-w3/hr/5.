I believe CPE stands for "Continuing Professional Education." Basically, some certifications (CPA, CFA, Legal) require a person to complete a minimum number of training hours to keep the certification current. A CPE hour goes toward filling that requirement.

Howdy all!

Just an FYI: If you are interested in applying your Derivatives Course(s) to a particular certification as CPE hours AND have completed Derivatives I and/or II, please let me know. I will arrange to have a CPE certificate sent to the office in your name.

Thanks,
Grace
