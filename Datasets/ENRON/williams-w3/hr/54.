Hi Bill...

Kourtney Nelson will be unable to interview Justin. Could you let me know who you would like to interview him in her place?

Thanks,
Grace

You have been selected to interview Real Time candidate Justin Bates. Justin will be returning to the office for his second round of interviews and has indicated that early morning interviews will work best for his schedule. 

With that in mind, I would like to set up the interviews to take place at 8:00am on Thursday, July 12th. Each session will be about 45 minutes in length (max), with the last interview ending at 11:00am.

If you are aware of any conflicts with this day/time, please let me know as soon as possible. I would like to have the schedule finalized by tomorrow morning.

If you have any questions, let me know!

Thanks,
Grace
