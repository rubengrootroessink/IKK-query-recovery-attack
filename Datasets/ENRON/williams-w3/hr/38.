Dear Grace,

I hope your summer is giving you some opportunities to enjoy nice weather.

We've had an interesting inquiry from a national business publication;
they're looking for stories about people who've been through our negotiation
courses who feel the course played a significant role in their professional
-- or personal lives.

Can you think of anyone from Enron/Portland who might be interested in being
interviewed?

Please give my regards to the 'gang'.  I look forward to working with you
again.

Cordially,
Steve
