Hello!

Amy reminded me that we will need to get new hire announcements out today for Marina and Todd. Please let me know if you'd like me to draft something for you to review and distribute to the floor, or if you would prefer to do it yourself. I have their resumes for your reference, if needed.

Thanks,
Grace
