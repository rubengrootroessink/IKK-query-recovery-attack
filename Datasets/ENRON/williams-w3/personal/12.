Howdy. 

So are you about to leave work or what? I really can't believe that it is already 4:30. Crazy. Anyhows, are you going to that Happy Hour deal on thursday night? Free drinks?! Should be a good time. I didn't make it to the last one and I was kinda bummed about it. 

I hope I can get outta here at a reasonable hour tonight. I'm gonna go pump some iron at Bally's with all the meatheads if I do. Should be pretty fun. See ya later!
