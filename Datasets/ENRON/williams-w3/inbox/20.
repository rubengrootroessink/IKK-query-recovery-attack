Dave,

We are currently working on options to have the roles each of the resources you have identified performed by the resources in the Estate.  However, I do not feel that the accounts for the resources should be disabled.  There are possible situations where we will need to call on them for coverage and assistance in this transition.  I have not heard from anyone yet as to the expected transition time frame.  We are trying to get all issues resolved as quickly as possible.

Please respond is anyone has a different view.

Thanks - MO
