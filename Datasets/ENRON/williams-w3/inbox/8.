Group,

There are two new paths for EPE information.

The first is for EPE schedules:
This path is P:/Trading/Real Time/El Paso Schedules/Admin/El Paso Schedules/2002/Feb02/EPE_FEB_02

The second is for the EPE models:
M:/Electric/EPE/EPE 2002/Models/February02/...

The estate will be settling CAPS each day (creating DA and HA finals) beginning on Friday. 

Please work closely with John and Dave to get all problems resolved as quickly as possible.

Thanks,
Bill
