Susan -
I just tested the schedule pull again and found one more deal type we need to exclude - ANNUITIES. The download pulls in purchase and sale annuities as regular forward purchases and sales, recognizing the average price as the total annuity price, which is, obviously, wrong. Anyway, when you get a chance could you exclude these deals from the query as well?

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks.  Perfect timing, Kate.  Check the on and off peak.  Working on the archive schedule version - it's far too slow right now.

Susan -

This looks great. Now we've just got to tweak the on-peak and off-peak averages, and I think we'll be set. (Hopefully someone will get to use this someday!)

Thanks for your help,
Kate

HI Kate!

I changed the query for a couple of things.  It was averaging per deal rather than per MW.  The way a transmission schedule was excluded.  

I also excluded 0 price and 0 volume schedules (leet me know if this is correct).

Note:  still testing the code for the on peak and off peak average - so just review the hourly ones.

Susan -

This is the last thing Susmitha sent me. If you look two e-mails down, you'll see the parameters I sent to her. The spreadsheet is still coming up with some weird numbers - all are much, much lower than actual average prices for these days. Would you mind taking a look at the query to see if all the appropriate deals are being excluded? Also, the spreadsheet doesn't pull in anything for the first half of November (i.e. when I try to download av. prices for 11/1/01, nothing comes up.)

Let me know when you get a chance to look at this. Thanks a lot!

Kate

Susmitha -

Bill sent me this spreadsheet to look over, and the prices it pulls look much too low to be an accurate average of our forward purchases and sales. My thought is that certain deals are being pulled into the query that should not be included. The deals in Enpower that need to be excluded from this query are:

1. Transmission
	- All deals under this heading in Enpower must be excluded
2. Forward 
	- All purchases and sales to counterparty "California Imbalance" must be excluded
3. Buy-Resale 
	- All deals with counterparty "EPMI California Pool" must be excluded

Please let me know if you have any questions about this, or if you'd like me to show you specific deals in Enpower to illustrate this.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

Susan,
Thank you. This looks good. To answer some of your questions, price is per mw, not per deal. Transmission deals, EpmiCalPool deals, and sales or purchases from the counterparty California Imbalance in Enpower need to be excluded. 
Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Here's an outline of what we talked about for the average price spreadsheet:

Pull deals for WHourly at Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, NP15, SP15, and (Palo Verde +) WSCC_S
In a tabular format display:  Average price from the schedules for buys and sells for each hour in each region (i.e. Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, etc.)

Underneath the table display:
On Peak average 
Off Peak average

for later:  (i.e. next version)
sort by groups:  24inc, EOL, EPEC

For clarification:
Average price is per MW not per deal?

I've asked Susmitha Nalluri to work on this for you.  She sits 2 desks down from me and works on the VMS team.  She has experience with spreadsheets, however she is not yet familiar with the EnPower view of the database.  I have given her a query to give her a jumpstart on pulling the data data you need from EnPower.  She and I have also met to go over where the data is being pulled from.  In my abscence she can go to Lei, Pete, Matt or David about questions regarding the EnPower Data.  I told her to feel free to ask you or Kate any questions.  I brought her down to meet you and Kate but did not realize you both (as well as most people) had left around lunchtime.

Kate,

I told her you would be bringing her more information on the Dow Jones sheet.  I forwarded Susmitha our earlier emails about it.
