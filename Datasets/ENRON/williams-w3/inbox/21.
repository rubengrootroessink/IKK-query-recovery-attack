All,


Legal has said that all EST accounts will be disabled this Sunday (sometime before Day 1). If any users require their EST account on Monday or beyond, they need to they would need to be cut off except for very critical cases. You likely have some of those cases. 

Here's what is needed required by each user requesting this:

1.	Send an email to Roberto DeLeon requesting an "EST_" account extension

2.	Please copy your local IT Support on the email (i.e. DL-IT Calgary or DL-Portland IT)

3.	In the email please state:
	Business reason for needing access
	Length of time needed.

Roberto, please advise if any points have been missed.


Thanks,

Dan
