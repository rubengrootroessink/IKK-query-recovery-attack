After the Day ahead market ran, the Mirage branch group TTC in both
directions was changed from 70 MW to 0 MW for HE's 0700 through 2400 for
operating day 1/30/02.  The reason(s) for the change is:  transfer trip
forced out of service to Devers-Capwind.  The first applicable Hour Ahead
market to run with these values is HE 1200.  The ISO will update you of any
changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please
call the Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
