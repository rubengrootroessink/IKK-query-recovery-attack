Attached for your review are the finalized versions of the ISO Statement
Files Specification (v14.0), ISO Charge Matrix (v14.0 ) and overview
documents describing the key changes.  Draft versions of the same documents
were distributed in January for your review and comments.  Version 14.0 is
created due to changes in two settlement areas:
*	The existing Market Operations Charge (CT 523) will be replaced by
the new Ancillary Services and Real Time Energy Operations Charge (CT 524).
*	To facilitate automatic processing of Manual Line Item entries by
the SCs, ISO will impose more rigorous validations upon these entries when
they are created in the ISO Settlement System.

The above changes are scheduled to take effect on trade date 1/1/2002.  The
additional changes in the finalized versions are mostly minor corrections
and clarifications.

ISO has also added two new Manual Charge Types (CTs 691 and 692) in the
Charge Matrix:
CT 691 - Emissions Cost Payment; and
CT 692 - Start-Up Cost Payment.

These Charge Types were created as a result of the FERC's Order (dated
6/19/01) to reimburse generators for their Emissions and Start-Up related
costs incurred as a result of ISO dispatch.
 
Please send your questions and comments to Mr. C. P. Ng via email
(cng@caiso.com).  Thank you.
