I had quite a bad conversation with Kirk at LADWP yesterday.  Geir supposed=
ly purchased only spinning reserves from LA however, when I called to verif=
y this Kirk at LA said that Geir bought power from him at $50 on top of the=
 reserves.  When I called Geir he said he didnt.  Therefore I called back K=
irk at LA and told him that Geir said he didnt purchase power from him and =
that we would just pull the tapes in the morning to solve the dispute.  Kir=
k then proceeded to go on a three minute tirade about how he "isnt even sup=
posed to deal with Enron" and was doing us a big favor because he doesnt wa=
nt to deal with us anyway.  He completely erupted on me and was absoulutely=
 unprofessional  and  cursed at me several times during the entire conversa=
tion.    I kept trying to calm him down however, he just continued to rant.=
   Anyway we will probably need to pull tapes for Giers conversations with =
LA. I would imagine from about 16:00 thru my conversation with Kirk at 18:0=
5.  Please let the guys know that when dealing with LADWP to be absoulutely=
 clear, to state exactly what they are purchasing, be specific when stating=
 time zones etc, as it appears that any dispute these guys will just procee=
d to completely melt down on us which in the end just causes problems for E=
PE.  Thanks.
