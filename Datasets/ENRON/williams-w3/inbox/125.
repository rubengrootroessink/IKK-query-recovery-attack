ENRJ_CISO_8000 has been corrected for the whole day.  There is now a load zone under the STSW book in SDG1 to reflect these changes.  Hourly templates are in for hours 1-24 and Isaac at the ISO is aware of the changes made.  No changes were/are necessary to the tags.

Craig and Bill:

Please note that for Wednesday 01/02/02, Import ID ENRJ_CISO_8000 is wrong.  The On-peak needs to be a 35mw and the off-peak needs to be a 45mw.  You will want to change the load zones in SP15 to make us flat in position manager.

Thanks,

Bert Meyers
