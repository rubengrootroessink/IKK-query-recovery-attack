Dan,
	What do we need to do to make sure these accounts stay active past Sunday?

Dave

It is in the best interest of the Estate to keep these accounts active until the Estate has a solid alternative plan established!

Dave,

We are currently working on options to have the roles each of the resources you have identified performed by the resources in the Estate.  However, I do not feel that the accounts for the resources should be disabled.  There are possible situations where we will need to call on them for coverage and assistance in this transition.  I have not heard from anyone yet as to the expected transition time frame.  We are trying to get all issues resolved as quickly as possible.

Please respond is anyone has a different view.

Thanks - MO
