> Questions to keep in mind:
> *	Are our current timelines as good as it gets?
> *	Do we want to adopt the Eastern Interconnection's timelines?
> *	What are the deficiencies of our timelines?
> *	Will these deficiencies be present under 1.7?
> *	Which timing requirements could be changed with an reasonable amount
> of effort (i.e., tariff items, AGC ramp times, A3A1, etc.)?
