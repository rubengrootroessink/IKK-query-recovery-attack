Bob,
Sorry for the late response, I've been gone the last 10 days. I will not be
able to make the meeting on June 27. I do like Jack Dempsey's proposal. I'm
not sure I completely understand Mons' reasoning, but I believe the PSE
submission deadline should be left at 30 minutes for the following 2
reasons:

1. 3A1 is very explicit in its definition of transaction start time and
excluding the ramp time. If we change it to read "20 minutes prior
    to start" that would allow a tag to be submitted at 40 after.

2. If the 20 minutes verbage is to be used, then the the remaining verbage
defining transaction start time as excluding ramp time will
    need to be removed.

It was my understanding that both proposals intended to leave the real-time
deadline at :30 after.

However, I still have the same questions as a few weeks ago with respect to
the new BP's being put forth by the ESC/ESTF. Are we going to take into
account the BP's that the ECS/ESTF have put out/being commented on? The
schedule process BP has several ramping/timing changes, as well as frag
tags. They aren't asking whether or not we should adopt Eastern Connection
timelines, they're just doing it.

Personally, I don't think the majority of the WSCC's units can handle a 10
minute ramp, and the idea of finishing the ramp on the quarter is a prelude
to a perpetual time error correction and excessive inadvertent accounts.
However, that is being proposed.

I would appreciate someone else's opinion on where the proposed BP's fit in
with our goal.
