Bob and team -

If it works at all for the group - June 27th works great for me as I would already be in Portland and can attend this type of a meeting.  None of the other dates would work for me.

thanks - Jerry

Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day
timelines.

May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?
A fly-in, fly-out meeting 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I'll
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I'll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.
