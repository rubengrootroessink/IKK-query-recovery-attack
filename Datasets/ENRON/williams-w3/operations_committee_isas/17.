	Has anyone, or everyone, read the latest business practice proposal
that was released by NERC on Tuesday? It is ESC's Scheduling and Approval
Practices submitted by the Multiple Task Groups - Scheduling Process,
Approval, Schedule Timing, Granularity and Ramping Task Groups.
	Specifically, they are recommending changing the ramp time to a
10-minute straddle ramp (:55 to :05). In addition, they're recommending
allowing schedule changes on the quarter (as already exists at :15, :30,
:45) with a 10 minute ramp. Their reasoning is, and this is a quote, "large
generators that require longer Ramp times (e.g. 20 or 30 minutes), could
partially ramp for 10 minutes across the schedule start, then finish with
another 10-minute ramp across the next quarter to complete the full ramp.
This would accommodate areas such as Florida and WSCC, where longer ramp
times are needed."
	Their asking for feedback for the public posting. This proposal has
a serious impact on our recommendations. Anyone have any comments? I'm
attaching a copy of the document. It's 21 pages long, about 15 of them on
frag tags. The ramping stuff and recommendations are the last couple of
pages.
