Starting HE19 the ISO is posting incorrect 10 minute pricing and hourly
expost pricing due to software problems.  As soon as the problem has been
repaired the correct pricing will be posted.  Sent by the Real time desk.  

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
