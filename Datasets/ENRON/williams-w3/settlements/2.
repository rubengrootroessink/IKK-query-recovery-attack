Dear Real-Timers,

We are having the same problem with Montana Power's checkout as we had last month: the volume of disputes is overwhelming!!

I have looked at the Inc sheets and found that EnPower matches the Inc. sheets.
But in fairness to MPC's disputes, last month when I trusted the Inc sheets, and I pulled the tapes, I found that our Inc. sheets were wrong in a number of places.

Mike and I are doing the March 2001 checkout and are having trouble finding your logs, your notebooks, or any information regarding the dates in question.

I am listing below the dates and HE that we are having disputes for.  Please look at your logs and let me know the MW value, price, and who you spoke to at MPC at what time.  Please do not give me what the Inc sheets say, as Mike and I have already looked at them.

I expect an answer from each of you ASAP.

Thanks for your help,

Virginia
