As I am not sure whether or not Craig gets his e-mails, can you please pass this along.

There is a first for everything!

Craig -

I just received notice that there was a collector error on your sample.  Can you please contact EMSI to reschedule a drug test at 1-800-522-3674?  Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you.

Kind regards -
Amy
