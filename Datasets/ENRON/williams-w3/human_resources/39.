Leaf -

I just received a call from payroll - they miscalculated your vacation payback.

Rather than the $1,113.66, you actually only owe $957.04 (they forgot to take away your OR state taxes in the first calculation).

Can you please write another check and we will void the first one?  Do you want the check returned to you?

Sorry for the inconvenience.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Amy
