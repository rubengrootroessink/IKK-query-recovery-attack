Hi Bill,

I know you have been out and I will be out all next week so I will e-mail
these to you.

May 18th    HE 12 sale to PNM the 40 needs to be a 45 @ $120.00
May 18th    Got the note from "you all" that HE 16 PNM Cont, they show 0
and you show 13.  Need to know who is correct on this.
May 20th    Purchase totals not adding up
May 21st    Change HE 13 sale to PNM to a 20

and

May 13th   An on-peak schedule -32@Amrad ran on Sunday (13th) and shouldn't
have.  PSCO had done a month long tag that was incorrect.
                     What we agreed on was to by the -32 HE 7-22 @ $30.00
from them.  Need you to please add this to the model and ENPOWER as a
                      real-time deal.

If you have any questions, Roger will be filling in for me.

Thanks,

Kathy
