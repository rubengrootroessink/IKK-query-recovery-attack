Here is a confirm that is designed to go under our EEI agreement with El Paso.  If signed, it would entirely replace our old services consulting agreement with El Paso. 

 Please read the document from a business perspective.  Do not worry too much about the legal boilerplate, of which there is plenty.  At the end of the day, the document should contain what you guys think you are doing with El Paso from a common sense perspective.  Pushing all the (very important) legal boilerplate aside:  do you see our deal in these words?? Please let me know your comments. Thanks very much ----cgy
