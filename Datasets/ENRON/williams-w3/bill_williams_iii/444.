Gwen:

I am working with our trader regarding a deal that was changed after the flow date passed.  

Desk: EPMI Short Term West Bom 
Counterparty: Pacificorp
Deal entered: 4/24/01
Deal changed and auto-scheduled: 4/27/01

Our flashed amount for April should be different from your flashed amount, but this variance never come through desk analysis afterwards.  Would you please advise why it's not being picked up by Settlements?  

Thanks,
Fran
