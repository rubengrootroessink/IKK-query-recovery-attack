A pregunta is a question in Spanish. I am going to Seattle with my friends from FL on the 14th-15th. The Palace of Fine Arts is just this really cool place in San Fran that has huge statues (greek in nature) around this gorgeous pond with awesome flowers and trees, etc. It's so wierd just to be sitting in the city the way it is. I saw this place that looked similar but in Seattle in some movie recently, but they never said the name of the place. I just figured you might know, but thanks for the ideas.

There is the Soundgarden on Lake Washington...that's more just wacky modern art.  There is the Seattle Art Museum (as its name implies).  There is the Experience Music Project that is a music museum (www.emp.com) and the Arboretum has statues as well.  I have never been to the Palace of Fine Arts in SF but I can't think of anywhere really like a statue garden in Seattle.  When are you going?  And what is pregunta?

Bill,

Is there someplace in Seattle that is like a statue garden? Maybe kinda like the Palace of Fine Arts in San Fran?
