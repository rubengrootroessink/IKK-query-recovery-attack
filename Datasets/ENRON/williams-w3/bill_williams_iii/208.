After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 4030 MW to 4000 MW; and the Path 15 branch group
TTC in the (N-S) direction was changed from 1275 MW to 1100 MW; and  the
Path 26 branch group TTC in the (N-S) direction was changed from 3000 MW to
2500 MW for HE's 1300 through 1800 for operating day 8/20/01.  The reason(s)
for the change is they were removed from service due to a low battery alarm.
The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with these values is HE 1500.
