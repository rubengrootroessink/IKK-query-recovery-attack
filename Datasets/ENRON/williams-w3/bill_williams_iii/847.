Hi Bill,

Sorry I haven't been alive earlier but it's been busy, busy here too. 

After leaving Portland we went to NY for a few days and we got here in Houston during the weekend of the flood but we were lucky not to get any of that. In fact I was suprised when I saw the news the next morning.

First thing,  I checked my past paychecks and you were correct, I have been receiving the 10% extra for shift work. I apologize for bringing it up in our meeting as I did not know anything about it. I did not receive any explanation that I was going to get it for shift work and I never check my paychecks in detail anyway.  
Thanks for sitting with me in that meeting too. I had a good time working in real time.  

Work here is fine. It is a new market that Enron is exploring, that of paper and pulp and trading is fairly thin. I do market analysis for pulp traders and it includes intensive news-reading and passing on important info and gathering of the data and compiling spreadsheets, creating graphs and so on. I like it a lot, I take a lot of the reading home.  I get to do some travelling too both in the US and overseas, and I like that too. I like the people in my group and they help me when I don't know stuff. One good thing about being here is that there are a lot of classes offered and I am going to be in some of them. 

Texas is different for sure but we like it. Yes it is hot but I feel like home. We have been out a bit and went to Dallas last weekend to visit some cousins. There is a lot of spanish around here, you hear it everywhere so I decided to learn it  and I am going to start it this week, twice a week. It's great beacuse when I learn new words I can practice with my latin co-workers.

That's pretty much it for now. 

When is evaluation taking place? How are things there, I bet much busier. 

Let me know,
cheers,
Monika
