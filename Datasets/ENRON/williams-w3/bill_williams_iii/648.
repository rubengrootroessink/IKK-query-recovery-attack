Group,

As a general rule, we are not submitting supplemental bids for our generators unless there is a Stage 1 emergency.  We wanted to lay out a plan of action in case the ISO dispatches one of the generators during non-business hours (i.e.... when the Services Desk is not in the office.  And I know what you're thinking Leaf, this does not mean between the hours of 9am and 4pm :)

We have two rules of thumb to follow:  (1) if the ISO dispatches Harbor Cogen  (2) if the ISO dispatches any of our other generators.

(1)  If the ISO dispatches Harbor, please decline the ADS instruction.  The reason for the decline is they are off-line and are having start-up issues.  Then, immediately call one of the members of the Services Desk.  The order to call would be Stan, Chris, then Les.  Either one of us will then discuss with you what should be done next.  The most probable scenario would call for you to put in Supplemental Energy Bids in for Harbor equal to their costs.

(2)  If the ISO dispatches any of our other generators (Arco, Delano, Sierra Power, Wheelabrator), please decline the ADS instruction.  The reason for the decline is they are off-line and are having start-up issues.  Once again, immediately call either myself, Chris, or Les to discuss what should be done next.

Thanks,
Stan
