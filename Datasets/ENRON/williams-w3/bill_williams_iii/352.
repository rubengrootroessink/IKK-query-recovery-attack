You have probably seen the notice already.  I expect some sort of industry response.

Dispatch Instructions
Importance: High


Greetings:

The ISO just released new requirements for scheduling and dispatch
instructions for generators. I have attached these requirements for your
convenience.

They claim that they had put these requirements in place, which are in
effect immediately, because people were continually out of compliance with
their (and FERC's) orders.  All of the requirements are extremely
concerning- and we should discuss further.  One note of interest (but not
surprise) is that the ISO is inflicting these requirements (such as failure
to submit feasible schedules) on the generators only, claiming their actions
are causing grid instability, when in fact failure of the load to properly
schedule and procure for their customers is of graver concern.

Other requirements will cause the units to be run harder that needed,
further jeopardizing reliability and supporting our arguments made in the
protest.

If you think we should discuss further please e-mail me and I will set up a
call.

Instructions

ISO Market Participants:
in light of a growing pattern among Market Participants of failure to submit
feasible Schedules, failure to comply with the must-offer obligation,
failure to comply with Dispatch Instructions and the recent untenable acts
by certain Market Participants that resulted in serious threats to WSCC-wide
reliability, the ISO is compelled to immediately impose new requirements to
prevent reoccurrence of such events.  Please see the Market Notice posted at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/01/2000060109560313721.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/01/2000060109560313721.html>  for a
complete discussion of the new requirements.
