We'll be short 25 mw at Palo Verde under the STWBOM book for Monday (also 25 short under STSW). Buy to cover this real time. Sell back to EPE @ $0. Enter buys and sales under the same desk, either STWBOM or STSW. Here are the deals:

727298 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 MW/$57.17

727299 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 On Peak/PV	
	 25 MW/$57.17

727302 - STSW buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 MW/$57.17

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
