Gentlemen,

Just a couple of things regarding Delano for Sunday and Monday:

For Sunday, 8/5:
Delano is prescheduled at 30mw, so they have 15mw available to sell, HE1-24, SP15.  Please try to sell them for above their variable costs of $40.  It should be pretty warm on Sunday, so you should be able to sell them for most of the peak hours.

For Monday, 8/6:
Delano wants to implement the buy-back strategy once again.  So please try to buy-back 15mw, HE7-10, SP15, for below their variable costs of $40.  When you contact the control room, please only speak in "hour ending."  They said that would clear up some recent confusion on their part.

Thanks guys,
Stan
