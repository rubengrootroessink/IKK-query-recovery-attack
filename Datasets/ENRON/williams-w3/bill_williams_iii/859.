Hey there Bill!

Ok an update and a little explanation.  I'm sorry I couldn't write you
yesterday I got sooo slammed with patients.  But I'm writing you now.  I
just pray that I won't get too busy today!  That probably won't work all
that well since I'm here and not at church where I should be!!!  Catholics
are funny about that stuff.  Yep,  I'm the "good little Catholic girl".  My
mom's a first grade Catholic private school teacher, my dad used to teach
CCD and my sister and I do our very best to go to church every Sunday and
confeesion on Saturdays.  It doen't always work out so well if you know what
I mean.  I took a Sunday shift today didn't I?

Anyhow... the POrtland trip.  Let me share with you the dilemma.  Ok I set
aside money for Portland as kind of a mini vacation.  That money is
currently being used to help with the traveling expenses out to the funeral
in LA.  Also my family members (the son of the one who died) was coming up
to Portland just for the day to take Sarah and I to the REALLY expensive
restraunts etc.  So that probably won't happen.  But basically it's the
first reason.  I don't know if I can financially swing a portion of my plane
ticket plus any other details food, funeral flowers/gifts, etc. and still
get to go to Portland.
Plus I'm moving in a month so I'm going to have moving expenses as well!
Ughhh!  I want to go soooo bad!

But things all happen for a reason.  It looks like I may not be able to go
but I did use my frequent flyer miles to purchase the ticket.


Aprox. 3 hours later............

Well I just got off the phone with you, so you actually know all about the
about issues above.  I did want to say though that I enjoyed talking to you.
You made my morning fly by and yes we talked for over an hour!  WOW!!

I don't think I can send my picture on this computer.  I'll try but it may
not work.  Or maybe I will just go along and you can think I'm an ogre (is
that spelled right??).  I tell you what... I'll send you one if you send me
one.  Deal?  I think it would kind of be nice to actually know what the
other person looks like that you are talking to.  Then again some people
look better in pictures than in real life.  I'm not fortunate enough to be
one of those!

Geez... we covered so much in our last phone conversation that I don't
really have anything to say.  Ok you may want to highlight this and save it
because I guarantee that when we get to be better friends you will want to
reference this!! :)

Oh well saved by the bell....a co-worker of mine has just bought me lunch!
He really is a sweet guy.  I'm not sure but I think he's a little slow.
Every weekend I work though he volunteers to help out in radiology and do
the filing and patient transport for me.  He is such a nice guy!  then today
he knows I'm moving and even though he worked the graveyard shift he came in
to bring me lunch.  Awwwh!  I am going to miss alot of people out here.

You mentioned that you had friends in LA you needed to visit.  Any ideas
when that might be?  Because I would love to extend the invitation to you
that oyu have extended to me.  If you are in my vicinity you are more than
welcome to stay with me and I'll show you around.  Unless of course you are
coming out soon then it would be more like ...."ok we are two lost tourist."
I would love to see alot of the LA things!  Sunset BLVD., Universal Studios,
all of the little bars and drinking establishments in that area!  I hear
they are fabulous!!!  Maybe by the time your trip rolls around I'll be well
versed in "the places to be".  Oh there is a must go that I do know of the
Wishire Regency Hotel.  It has an all oyu can eat dessert buffet!  Complete
with chocolate covered strawberries!  Yummm.

Oh I am a fanatic about desserts!

I better not keeping Lee waiting!  He's figitty!  Talk to you soon!!

Nikki
