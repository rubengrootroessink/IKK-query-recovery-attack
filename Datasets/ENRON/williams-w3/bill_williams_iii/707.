All

We had 2 service outages today, the External Internet and Email both became unavailable at about 11:00 am today, service was restored in after about 15-20 minutes.  The fact that both services went down at the same time is only coincidence.

Below are the basic causes for the outages:

The Internet outage was caused by an error in one of our Network Routers.  The device was rebooted and service was restored.

The Email outage was caused by a bug in Exchange that is remedied by rebooting the server.

Sorry for the inconvenience these outages may have caused.
