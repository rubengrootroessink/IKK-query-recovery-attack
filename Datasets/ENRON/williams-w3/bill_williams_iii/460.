Bill -

Jill and I have moved the file folders (containing Enpower-to-CAPS reports and preschedules) to a drawer in the back of the office just outside Christian Yoder's office. It's labeled "Real Time" - on the bottom left-hand corner. Fran Chang keeps the keys to it.

Let Jill or me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
