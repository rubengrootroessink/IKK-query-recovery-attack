Because Lotus will probably go away when the new Enpower system comes online,  and Mike brought up a good point about not being able to mine information from the current emails that we do,  we need to think of a way to have a data repository like the West Power discussion.

I am thinking a web-based format kind of like a news group, but would like to talk to you.
