Bill -

Could you take a look at what I've put together? Conceivably, this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we (or I) could maintain, which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information. I talked to Cara about setting up an intranet site, as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that, and she said she was working on setting something up with Fundamentals and Volume Management. That's a whole different subject - maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment. At any rate, this is a rough draft, but I thought I'd show it to you to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

Kate
