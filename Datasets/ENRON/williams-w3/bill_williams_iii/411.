This is a reminder that a Supervisor Review Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, August 7th at 3:00 p.m. in 35C2.  Please come to the meeting with your completed feedback form for your summer intern.  In this meeting decisions will be made as to who will receive offers to join Enron.  If you cannot attend the meeting please send the form to Traci Warner prior to the meeting or have someone come in your place to properly represent your summer intern.

Please call me if you have any questions.


Bill & Amy - I know that you will not be in Houston to meet regarding Todd Bland but show that his exit date is 8/17/01.  I assume you will send Traci Warner the completed feedback form and notify her if an offer is going to be made.  Please also have Todd complete the 2 exit forms and send a copy back to Traci Warner for her records.


Thank you!
Dolores
