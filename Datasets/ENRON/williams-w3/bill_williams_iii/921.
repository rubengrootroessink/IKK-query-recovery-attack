Hi All!

We've received several calls today regarding a locked storage door at The
Roosevelt. We only have keys to the front lobby door & any condos that have
not closed escrow yet. If you have any troubles with Common Elements, keys,
access codes etc... your Property Mgmt Company is CMI. Brad Atchley is the
Community Mgr and can help you with these situations.

Please call Brad Atchley with any questions or needs at 503-233-0300 x215
Vancouver # is 360-694-0300 and email is   brada@communitymgt.com
