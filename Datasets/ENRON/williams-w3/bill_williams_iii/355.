Real-Timers,

Harbor Cogen has been prescheduled for Thursday, 8/9, 80mw, HE7-22.  There are a few things that needs to be done in real-time:

1.	We would like to try to buy-back the first few hours for something under $67.50 (what they sold for day-ahead.  We'll use their day-ahead price rather than their generation costs because we sold day-ahead for slightly below their generation costs of $69.50 in order to make money with this buy-back strategy and selling 15mw from the steam turbine in real-time).  So, please try to buy-back, HE7-10 (or through HE11 if prices warrant), 80mw, SP15.  Treat this like the Delano buy-back, where we split the profit with the customer.  Please stay in contact with the control room to communicate which hour they are supposed to come up for.

2.	We need to sell 15mw from the steam turbine in real-time.  The steam turbine can only be started up 3 hours after the gas turbine is fired up.  On the back end, it can shut down the same hour that the gas turbine shuts down.  So, please sell 15mw, SP15, beginning 3 hours after the gas turbine comes on.  For example, if you bring the gas turbine on beginning HE11, please begin selling the steam turbine HE14 through HE22.

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.

Thanks a bunch,
Stan
