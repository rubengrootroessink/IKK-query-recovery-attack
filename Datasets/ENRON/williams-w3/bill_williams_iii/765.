Hey there!!

Oh I was sooo upset!  It didn't rain, thunder, sprinkle shoot it wasn't even
humid or misty!  I got screwed!  :)  Ok it wasn't all that bad.  I actually
had a really great time.  Imagine someone actually going on vacation to see
it pour rain.  Sick sick individual!

Let's see the first day all we did was tour the city and allow lil' miss
Nikki to be a spy!  Portland was great no wonder you live in the middle of
down town.  There were so many things to do and see!  Unfortunately because
we didn't exactly have a good idea of where to go and so on and so forth we
just wondered around aimlessly.


Then on Saturday we all drove to Astoria...you knew I just had to go!!  It
was great!  Absolutely beautiful!  On the way we stopped at the fresh berry
market and had the most amazing berries!!! Oh they were good!  Next we ate
at a little fish place mmmm...clam chowder and fried seafood.  Then went to
Cannon Beach.  What a great little town!  I bought some pulled taffy and
some hot chocolate and was in heaven!  Alot of the beach sites , (for
example Haystack rock) were in the Goonies film.  Then of course I found the
little hotel that "Kindergarten Cop" was filmed in.  what a loser I was
taking pictures like a fool!

Bill you don't understand, for years and years every Saturday after cartoons
I would pop "KC" into the VCR.  I loved it! Ok ok dorky but hey you have to
have some abnormalities in your life.

Then if you haven't been here I am going to be the one to take you for your
first time....if you'll let me.  And hey don't get any wild hairs about
exploring this before hand mister!!!I'm the tour guide on this baby!!! :)
It's outside of Cannon Beach just past Hug point.  It's a little trek called
Falcon Cove.  you can reach the beach and it is the most beautiful hike we
went on.

Finally we drove back into town and ate at the most discusting little dive
downtown!  Bush Gardens????  Blech!  Horrible I felt like I had licked the
hair on my dogs butt!  Oooo it was just gross.

Then of course I got to meet you.  That was a nice highlight to my trip.
You rate right up there along side the "KC" hotel rooms.  yeah I kinda like
ya!  :)

Next morning I ate the best breakfast of my entire life.  Not kidding!  It's
something like the Otwalia???  It's in the Westin hotel.  Ok we all shared
our plates so this was our breakfasts...Sarah got a fruit plate, I got eggs
benedict and Todd got pecan encrusted french toast with orange zing butter
and syrup.  Swear to God that is the first place I want to go to eat when I
get to go back.  Ok it was a little pricey though.  Not tooo bad.  it was
31.25 for 3 of us.  Not alot but breakfast is usually like 5 bucks!

The next two days were spent in Hood River/ Cascade Lockes.  We hiked the
Mananomah (whatever) falls the next day we rented bikes and rode them around
the town of Stevens,WA.  15 miles!  I was really hurting by that night! 3/4
of the trail was up hill!  Oh my tail end hurt like crazy!  In Steven's we
ate at a little snack shop.  It was probably one of the better places!  Oh
what was it's name???  Oh Little Viking's.  Really cute place.  You've gotta
go!  Oh one more that I won't recommend...Tugboat Annie's in Hood River.
Again I felt like I had given an ATB to someone!  Too fancy.  I'm a meat and
potatoe girl.  That fancy stuff is nice sometimes but usually they just over
do it.

WE ate at Stanford's the last day and it was another fancy place.  I ordered
onion rings and they were good.  The salad was horrible!  So on a food
rating scale POrtland/Oregon recieves a 70%.  I guess I'm just not going to
the right places.

As you can tell by the length of this I am at work and needing to use some
of my time up!  You are the poor sap I've chosen since you don't know me
yet.

Well the move out date is set for me.  I move out on July 31.  I'm not too
sure when the townhouse will be available though so I'm playing it by ear.
DO you have any idea when your trip out there might fall?  If you have a
ball park idea that might be nice until you get concrete dates.  I just want
to be sure that I'm off of work as much as possible the day or days that you
have elected to spend with me.  That is if you still want to spend them with
me.  I mean I did sort of stalk your house and found out where you
lived....that can't be good! :)

Ok I honestly and sincerely feel bad about that whole situation.  I'm just
sort of a small town girl who knows that those things really aren't
appropriate but do them regardless.  You'll understand once we become better
friends!  I warned you a little though.  I did say that I was spontaneous
and might just show up on your doorstep.  Well there you go I did!

Please don't tell Brendan.  You probably already did!  I actually need to
E-mail him and tell him what a sweetheart he is for introducing me to you.
The small amount of time I got to spend with you was very nice.  I look
forward to doing that again sometime.  We'll just up hte time slot a hair.

Ok I will let your weary eyes seetle back to work.  Oh I did receive your
voicemail on my phone but it was in NM.  I wouldn't have had time anyhow but
thank you for your hospitality and the offer.  I can't wait to reciprocate
it in CAli.!

Take care,
Nikki
