I was talking with Deanne about schedule and since we have both visited these guys many times you may want to indicate you interest in who we should see.  Your choices are as follows:

SMUD
NCPA
CDWR
Wapa Sierra Pacific


I was told the agenda is go into Sacramento in the morning spend the day visiting two entities and then grab dinner in the city with a bunch of these guys.  Let's get together in the next couple of days and strategize and then do some inviting.
