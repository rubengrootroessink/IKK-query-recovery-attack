Elsie - 

  Can you get ahold of your contact at Mirant and find out the following:

  We had a cut at HE 11 on 6-2-01.  PAC cut a schedule to Mirant that was to come to us at EPMI and we were sending to WAPA.  Mirant didn't call us until HE 12 and they said that they booked it out with WAPA.  Now WAPA is not showing the bookout.  Can you get the name of the trader at Mirant who booked it out with WAPA, the time of the conversation and the name of the person they talked to at WAPA?  Also, if they have the time of their call to us, that would be great.


  Thanks Elsie,

  Virginia


  By the way, if it would be easier, I can call your contact at MIRANT.
