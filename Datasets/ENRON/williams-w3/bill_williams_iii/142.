FYI -

I've received a message similar to this one from EES for the past four days. It appears the EES sheet is not getting to EES every evening, so this is a reminder to send a spreadsheet detailing all real time trades done with EES each day to EES POWER SETTLEMENTS. Also - don't follow Geiv's example in your attempts to spell "real."

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate:

I was just wondering why the 8/23 real time deals have not dropped yet. Please send them to me when you get a chance.

Thanks, and have a great weekend!
