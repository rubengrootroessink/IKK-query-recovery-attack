We have a fantastic opportunity for employees of our sponsors and suite
holder companies.  Due to last minute scheduling conflicts, a large
block of our volunteers for the Party at PGE Park this coming Friday had
to cancel.  This has obviously created some last minute challenges for
PGE Park, but it is a great opportunity for your employees to volunteer
a few hours of their time on behalf of some great causes plus see the
Four Tops and The Spinners in concert for FREE.  Here's how:

Party at PGE Park is a fundraiser for the Portland Oregon Sports
Authority, SOLV, and Special Olympics Oregon.  
We are about 40 volunteers short to assist with serving the VIP dinner.

Volunteers would work from 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on assisting with the
pre-concert food service.
In exchage, each volunteer will get two free tickets to that evenings'
concert plus a voucher for a free hot dog, chips, and soda.

This opportunity is open to your employees and spouses, significant
others, or other adult family members.  We're sorry, but children cannot
volunteer for this particular opportunity.

Interested parties can call or e-mail:

Please share this information with your employees as you deem
appropriate.  Obviously, time is of the essence in coordinating
volunteers.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call
me.  Thank you in advance for your support.
