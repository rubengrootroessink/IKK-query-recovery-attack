Bill, you were going to send me the example of how the new change has caused
problems for you with regards to congestion.  This would be a good time to
raise this concern of yours and any other issues.

Client Relations Team:

Many of you have received questions from your clients regarding the ISO's
implementation of the June 19th FERC Order.

Please send any questions you have received thus far, to me as soon as
possible, and preferably by tomorrow morning, Friday, June 29.

We would like to have one document summarizing what is on our clients minds.

Many Thanks!
Byron
