Cara, could you please verify that the tags I referenced in the previous mail are in fact the proper tags.  One of the tags was coming up as undelivered instead of delayed but, appeared to be the right path.  If it the undelivered tag is not correct please email the group with the corrected tag number.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
