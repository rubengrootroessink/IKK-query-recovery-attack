I entered 658780 Annuity for $18750 6/21.
This is a true-up for deal # 551890.
Deal was originally entered W-Hourly buying from ST-CA - after liquidation it was changed to W-Hourly 
buying from EES.

Heather,
I spoke with Chris and he is on board with the annuity of $18750 from ST-CALI to ST-WHOURLY.
Thanks for the help with this.

Bill
