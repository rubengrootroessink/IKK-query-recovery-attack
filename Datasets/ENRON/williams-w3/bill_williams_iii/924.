I wanted to let everyone know that Lavorato has organized a "trader boondoggle" for next weekend.  He has invited electricity traders with primary book responsibility from the east desk, west desk, ees wholesale, and alberta.  I was limited on both the job function of the people that could go as well as the total number from our desk that could go.  I know that many people would like to go on such a boondoggle.  I also feel that everyone here works hard and is equally committed to our success and arguably deserves such a boondoggle.  Unfortunately, I only received five slots for Portland west ena traders.

Next Friday morning Bob Badeer, Matt Motley, Mike Swerzbin, Mark Fischer, and I will be boarding a plane and heading to Cabo for the weekend.  We will be returning Sunday night and will be in the office for normal hours on Monday.

Tim
