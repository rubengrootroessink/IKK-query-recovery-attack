Based on the very positive feedback that we received on the Electric Systems course earlier this year, I am trying to coordinate another course for this year.  Skip, the previous instructor, is available to run a Friday/Saturday course on August 24th and August 25th.  

Couple of questions....

1.  Will this date work for your respective groups?

2.  Do you have an idea of who from your group should attend or you would like to have attend?  (I will open it up to the entire floor, but just want to get an initial headcount.)

Thanks for your help!
Amy
