Hello hello!

I was so worried that I had said something in my last E-mail to make you say
"Whoah!!! What was Brendan thinking?"  So when Brendan came in as my patient
for a follow-up, I told him "Nope your friend didn't E-mail me...Nope I
haven't heard from him."  I actually was sort of embarrassed.  I told
Brendan, "I worked like 92 hours that week and was E-mailing people to stay
awake.  He may have been one of those early morning E-mail's.  I don't
remember saying anything too bad???"  But hey I was working a ton!  People
get a little odd!

He's like "Well why didn't you E-mail me to tell me that?  Bill is just like
that sometimes.  I'll give him a call about it."  Actually I didn't plan on
hearing from you, but I'm gald I did.  There's only one slight
problem...because I didn't hear from you, the only day I have free and it's
actually a night is July 3rd after like 3pm then I leave back to NM at 5:54
AM on the fourth.  Now you may already have plans for this night if so no
worries.

I need to find a hotel close to the airport for that night with a shuttle
service.  If you know of any that would be a great help!  After our first
E-mail experience I'm assuming it might be easier to call you than to E-mail
you.  So...I will talk to you soon unless you E-mail me first.

I actually just got home from CAlifornia and am absolutely exhausted!  So I
will write more or call you later on this week!  I also apoligize for not
having a spell check on my E-mail.  My fingers sometimes get away from me
and I don't always proof read!

I will be in touch soon! :)

Nikki
