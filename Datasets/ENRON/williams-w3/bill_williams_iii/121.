  Gentlemen,

      The $13,529 congestion charge on the 18th that was allocated to the stCA desk has been split between both of your desks though the change will not show up until the month end flash reports.  Look for it then but trust me it has been changed.  In the future I will ask about HA congestion charges that show up on stCA to make sure they are warranted.  Any questions let me know.

later,

Darren

Darren,

RT and stCal desks have decided to divide the congestion cost between the two desks.  We need a manual entry to adjust this.
