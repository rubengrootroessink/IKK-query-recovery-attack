We're going short again - 50 mw - in a lending agreement with El Paso for Thursday. As we've done the past three days, please reduce the purchase from El Paso (702181) to $4 after purchasing elsewhere in the market (adjust price accordingly if you buy from El Paso). Then sell back to El Paso at a zero price. Details are as follows.....

702181 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 PV/HLH
	 25 mw @ $69

702184 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 PV/HLH
	 25 mw @ $69

702194 - STSW buys EPE
	 PV/HLH
	 25 mw @ $69

If this makes no sense, ask Bill or me or a colleague of superior intelligence for clarification.

Thanks,
Kate
