Three things to be aware of for MONDAY:

1. EPE Lending Agreement - STWBOM will be short 25 mw on peak at Palo Verde, as will STSW. Don't forget to reduce the STWBOM purchase (706936) from El Paso to $4 after purchasing the energy elsewhere. Sell back to them at $0. Deals are as follows:

	706936 - STWBOM buys EPE
	706950 - STWBOM sells STSW
	706954 - STSW buys EPE

2. STSW Parking Agreement - STSW will be going long 13 mw on peak at Palo Verde coming from PNM. (Deal 707099 - $45) Please sell this off Real Time and link it to their day-ahead puchase. 

3. STCA/STWBOM Short to California Imbalance - Each desk will be short 50 mw total on peak: 25 mw in SP15 and 25 mw in NP15. STWBOM deals are as follows:

	707071 - STWBOM sells Cal-Imb @ NP15
	707087 - STWBOM sells Cal-Imb @ SP15

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
