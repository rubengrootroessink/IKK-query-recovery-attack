Bill,

Enron Canada has encountered several hours in the last few weeks where we have acquired non-firm transmission (hourly) from BC Hydro, been able to flow (i.e. not been cut) and the Portland real-time desk has been unable to find a buyer. I realize that the timing of the hourly non-firm transmission is difficult. The financial cost to Enron Canada is C$6.40 per MWh for every MW we buy from BC and can't flow- in excess ot C$1,400 last night.

Are there any players in the Pacific NorthWest who Enron can use as a buyer of last resort? Do have any suggestions that may alleviate the "no buyer found" problems?
