Real Time Traders,


This Saturday 7/28 Frontier needs to repay BPA for Control Area reserves that where used on 6/30 and 7/21. The total Frontier owes is 32 Mw. I've arranged with BPA to return 2 Mw on peak for Saturday.

However, this payback needs to be done Real Time as BPA's ability to take the energy is dependant on their system operations. 

The Real Time procedure is as follows:

1) Call the BPA Real Time power scheduler at 503-230-3341 around 0400 or 0500 and tell him you are calling to schedule energy imbalance paybacks from Frontier Energy for 2 Mw On Peak. If BPA can take the schedule try to get them to commit to take all 16 hours. Then call BPA Real Time transmission and buy a 2 Mw wheel using account # 805608 for Energy Imbalance paybacks to BPA merchant. 

If BPA is unable to take the 2 Mw schedule for any hour please sell it Real Time for the best price in the Northwest. 

2) In Enpower enter a buy from Frontier at zero price and note in the comments section that this is a energy Imbalance Payback deal. Enter a sale to BPA at zero price and note in the comments section that this is a energy Imbalance Payback deal. Extend BPA transmission deal 704168 to include the additional 2 mw.

Call me if there are questions or problems. We tried to do this payback last Saturday and the energy just went inadvertent for 3 hours because we didn't call BPA.
