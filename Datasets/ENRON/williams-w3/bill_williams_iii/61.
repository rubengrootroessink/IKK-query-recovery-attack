Bill and Kate:

Attached please find the prior month adjusment items we just got from Settlements for WBOM book.  I have verified them and believe they are all valid.  Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions.  If you don't disagree, you shall expect to see those amounts recognized in your final P&L for 8/31/01 next Tuesday morning.

   

At this moment I am looking at the items we got for WHOURLY book.  I will let you know at the latest sometime Friday (8/31) afternoon when I pulled them together.

Thanks,
Fran
