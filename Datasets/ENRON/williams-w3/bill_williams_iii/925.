I received a stack of Bloomberg hourly confirms today, apparently for deals they didn't see in our system. Turns out Craig Dean entered Ryan's Bloomberg deals for 6/13 and 6/14, but wasn't aware of the fee or the need to enter it in the deal. Just wanted you to be aware that I've added fees to the following deals so you (or I) can watch for them on Monday's DPR.


648840 - 1 trade/$15
648125 - 3 trades/$45
646716 - 5 trades/$75
646832 - 4 trades/$60
644716 - 2 trades/$30

Let me know if you have questions, or see problems arise due to these changes.

Thanks,
Kate
