Group, Here's the plan for Sunday/Monday:

Only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a Stage 1 emergency is called.  This is due to the ISO's ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes.  We don't want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a Stage 1, 2, or 3 emergency.

So, please try to sell the generators excess available output as an SC to SC trade.  Below is their preschedule, mw's available, minimum price threshold, and unit ID's.  Also, attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone #'s.  Please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators.
