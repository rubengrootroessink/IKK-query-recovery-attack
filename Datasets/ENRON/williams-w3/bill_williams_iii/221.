Notification of Operating Procedure Update

*	The following new or revised ISO Operating Procedures have been
implemented and are posted for reference on the ISO Website.

ISO Operating Procedure posted:  T-140  McCullough 500 kV Fault Duty
Mitigation
Version: 5.0
Effective Date: 7-31-2001
Procedure Purpose: This procedure outlines, describes, and incorporates a
Nevada Power Standard Operating Procedure for mitigation of the 500kV fault
duty at LADWP's McCullough Substation.  The status of the transmission
network in the McCullough Substation vicinity (including various elements of
the LADWP, NPC, SCE, SRP, and WALC systems) ultimately determines the fault
duty level at the McCullough Substation 500kV bus. Nevada Power had the
primary responsibility of overseeing the fault duty mitigation efforts, but
the CAISO has responsibilities and roles under the Nevada Power Operating
Procedure.
Changes / Reasons: see attached
 <<T-140 Procedure Change Description v5.0.doc>> 
*	Please find them at
http://www1.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/opsdoc/index.html under the
appropriate Operating Procedure section heading.

If you have any questions, please e-mail the 'Procedure Control Desk'
mailbox [mailto:procctrldesk@caiso.com] and we will respond as soon as
possible.

Thank-You,
