Thanks for the heads up. Just curious - do we have any estimation of when the charge will hit our book?

Kate-

  FYI - I have entered deal # 669230.1 for ancillary charges for April reserved and used transmission.  Detail is listed in the deal itself.  I have also put a copy of the deal in your box.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Reservations for SPP tranny were made real time.
