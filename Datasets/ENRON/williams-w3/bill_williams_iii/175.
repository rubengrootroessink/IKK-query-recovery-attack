Hello Everyone,

I wanted to invite everyone over to my house this friday afternoon for a little get together.  We can grill out, have a few refreshments and enjoy the Portland weather.  Brats and beer will be provided, feel free to bring any other meats/fish to grill and something other than beer to drink.

Feel free to invite anyone not on this list, I think we will start in the early afternoon (around 4:00 p.m. depending on when people can get out of work) and plan on eating around 5:30 p.m.  Let me know if you have any question.

See you on friday,
Jeff
