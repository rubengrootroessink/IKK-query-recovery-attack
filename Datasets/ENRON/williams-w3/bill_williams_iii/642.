Here are a couple of the highlights of today's ISO call:		

1.  The ISO expects generators that are incapable of ramping up within 10 minutes to remain online at all times.
2.  Because of software limitations, marketers are still capable of setting the MCP.  The ISO hopes to fix this within a few weeks, at the earliest.
3.  The ISO plans to publish the emission costs this week that will be charged to SCs for demand within California.
4.  SCs scheduling wheel-through transactions or exports out of California will not be subject to emission or start-up fuel costs.
5.  The ISO is dispatching generators during both emergency and non-emergency hours.
6.  For purposes of determining when a new Stage 1 has occurred, the ISO requires a minimum of 70 minutes:  10 minutes before the operating hour plus the operating hour.
7.  Under this requirement, the ISO could be in Stage 1 for up to 128 minutes without triggering a new Stage 1 that is capable of resetting the proxy price.

If you have any questions, let me know.
