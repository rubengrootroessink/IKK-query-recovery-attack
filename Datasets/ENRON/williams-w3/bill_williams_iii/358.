Good Morning

For August 9th only:

We are long 51 mw HLH at PGE system due to a parking deal Sean did with Bill Casey.  The deal number is 723296.1.  

Please sell this in the RT market for the STNW book.  There are several options for this energy.

1. We have available PGE transmission PGE/COB on deal 146517

2. Portland will lay this off at Colstrip if we sold it in Montana

3. Buyers could pick it up at PGE system

4. We could also sell this at the Mid C if PGE approves it ahead of time

Please see Sean or Myself if you have any questions.

C
