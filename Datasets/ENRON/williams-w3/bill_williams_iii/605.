Thanks for the note Bill, I appreaciate it.  I have been checking your sheets every morning and believe that I have captured all of the cong revenue since 7/10.  A quick FYI, I start in Fundies next week and thus the responsibility transfers back to Jim for the daily Flash.

Kourtney,
Just a quick heads up for the flash.
Path 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24.  For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98.  We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO.  This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT. 
If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill
