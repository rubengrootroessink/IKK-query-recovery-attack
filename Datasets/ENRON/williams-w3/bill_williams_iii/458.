Real Time Traders,

Willamette has sold 15 Mw on peak FIRM to the LTNW desk. This schedule is tagged and scheduled by the Northwest desk. Should there be an outage resupply the schedule at Mid-C and enter a deal showing a sale to Willamette and a buy from the resupply source. 

Services will also be selling 3 Mw of unit contingent energy from Willamette on going. If there is an outage on this schedule cut the schedule and call Pac transmission to take the schedule to zero.

Let me know if there are questions.

Les
