Just a quick reminder that the Green Room has its first outdoor soccer game
this Sunday at 12:15 at Delta #8.  Please let me know if you intend to be
there and also if you have not yet paid whether you are going to be on the
team.  No pay no play.  I need to get a final count in order to know whether
we need a few more guys or not.  Let me know.  Thanks guys!

Jon

I guess it's a comment on our times when the height of a person's morality
is being choosy about whom they steal from.
