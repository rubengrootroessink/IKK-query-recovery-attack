Group,

This evening, Wednesday, 7/25, for HE23-24, Sierra Power has 7mw available to sell.  Please sell for the best price you can get.  They have to run, so they are not price sensitive (but don't rape them).  Since they are only 7mw, if you take a $10 spread that would be fine.  They are in SP15, we are their SC, and their unit ID is VESTAL_6_WDFIRE.

Any questions please give me a call.

Thanks,
Stan
