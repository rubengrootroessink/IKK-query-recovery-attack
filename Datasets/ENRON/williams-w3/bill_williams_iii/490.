	Request complete Kate. EnPower IT is looking into refreshing the System.

	You should "see" all Traders, including Steve Merriss, upon refresh of the EnPower System
	or 7/31/01. 

	Please call me if you're still not seeing the Traders by tomorrow morning.

	Best Rgds.

Samuel -

Thanks for completing that request so quickly. Unfortunately, I received a message from Todd Bland over the weekend saying he is still unable to save deals using his own name. He called Enpower support and spoke with Nicolay, who told Todd he needed an Originator ID - are you familiar with that or how Todd could get one? Also, we have one more trader who never received access to trade under these desks: Short Term West BOM, Short Term Southwest, Short Term California. His name is Steve Merriss. Could you please add his name to the list as well?

Thanks again for all of your help.

Kate

Sam -

We're once again in need of a new trader ID - Todd Bland joined the Portland Real Time group as a summer intern, and it seems he hasn't been added yet. Could we get his name added as a trader for the following desks:

Short Term West Hourly
Short Term West BOM
Short Term Southwest
Short Term California

I appreciate your help with this. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
