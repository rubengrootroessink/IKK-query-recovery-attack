Sue,

Bill Williams III from the real time desk has asked me to contact you to see if you could ask the ISO to resume publishing the "as bid" and Out Of Market cost information for imbalance energy purchases.  According to Bill's contact at the ISO, Keoni, the ISO made the decision to publish only the proxy price, but not the accepted bids exceeding the proxy price. The "as bid" information needs to be published so that SCs can get real time price signals about imbalance energy charges.  The proxy price is not enough to determine the cost of imbalance energy because the ISO doesn't buy all of its energy at the proxy price.  Some will be purchased at the proxy price, some at bids exceeding the proxy, and some through OOM calls.  Absent this information, SCs incurring imbalance charges will not find out what their costs are for 75 days.
