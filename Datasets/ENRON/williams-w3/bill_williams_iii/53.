After the Day ahead market ran, the  branch group COI TTC (Path 66) in the N

direction from 2450 MW to 3675 MW and the branch group PDCI (path 65) in the
N to S direction from 2525 MW to 2875 MW and in the S to N direction from
1904 to 2084 MW all for HE's 03:00 through 24:00 for operating day 9/1/01.
The reason(s) for the change is due to completion of line work. The first
applicable Hour Ahead market to run with these values is HE 06:00. The ISO
will update you of any changes in line rating status. Sent by Market
Operations, inquiries please call the Hour Ahead Desk.
