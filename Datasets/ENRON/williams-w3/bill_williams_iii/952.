Bill, 
Just wanted to confirm our meeting in PDX tomorrow @1 p.m.  The following is just a brief checklist of Hafslund's current / potential needs / wants on mw's ranging in size from 10  to 150 mw:
*realtime dispatchability of our firm power contracts.  
*day ahead parking / lending services at major hubs (pv,mid c, cali) 
*ancillary services bidding from our cogen /  qf contracts. 
*optionality of services...i.e. some days hafslund may not need enron's services.  
Looking for Enron's price on the bundled services or individual service.  Would it be a fixed price per mw? percentage of power sales per mw? sliding scale based on mw volume and # of services provided?  etc....
Let me know if you have questions or concerns or if Thursday's meeting no longer works for you. 
Regards, 
Scott Mckinney
