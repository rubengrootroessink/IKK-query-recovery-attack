EPE Lending:

STWBOM and STSW are each short 25 mw on peak at Palo on Monday. Purchase power to cover these short positions. Sell back to El Paso at $0. Reduce purchase prices in the following deals to $2 per the new EPE lending fee.

747813 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $49

747816 - STSW buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $49

In California:

We'll be short 50 mw on peak at SP15 under STWBOM. Please cover this short under the STWBOM book. Day-ahead price has not been set at the time of this e-mail, but I'll let you know when it has. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
