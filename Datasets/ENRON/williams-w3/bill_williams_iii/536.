After the Day ahead market ran, the  branch group COI TTC in the (S-N)
direction was changed from 3675 MW to 2450 MW for HE's 1700 through 2400 for
operating day 7/26/01.  The reason for the change is for the Northwest
Generation Urgent pump repairs.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to
run with these values is HE 1700.  The ISO will update you of any changes in
line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the
Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
