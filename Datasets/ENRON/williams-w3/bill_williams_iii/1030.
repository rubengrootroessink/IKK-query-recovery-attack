Bill,

Thank you - I enjoyed our visit as well.  I will try to find a time to get to Portland sometime later this summer.  Please let me know if I can ever be of help to you.

Take care,
Billy

Billy,

I just wanted to thank you for your making the time to meet with me on Tuesday afternoon.  I appreciated your time and felt it gave me some useful information regarding the analyst program.  I believe the better understanding of the program that you provided will allow me to better manage and coordinate the activities of the analysts in the real-time group in Portland.  I do think a visit and information session later in the summer might be helpful as well.

Thank you again for your time and enjoy the holiday weekend.

Bill
