I talked with the same reporters yesterday (with Palmer and Shapro).

Any other information that you can supply Gary would be appreciated.  Steve, did Gary A. get your original as the CAISO turns email?

Subject: Busy Day with the LA Times


Investigative Reporters at the LA Times called me today (I'm not going
to say who, but they are long-time pros, don't worry about that) asking
questions about the enormous amount of Out of Market (OOM) energy being
purchased by the ISO.  They wanted to know if this was due to the
DWR/CERS long-term contracts?  They wanted to know if this is effecting
the real-time markets.

The answers, of course, is yes.  However, I need you folks to help me
collect information from your settlements people substantiating what is
currently conjecture.  That is, the OOM costs are being allocated to
Scehduling Coordinators who are "short" in their hourly schedules.  Your
generators may be buying real-time energy from the ISO, thinking they
are getting a bargain, only to discover 60 days later, or more, that an
enormous OOM charge has been allocated to your company.  That is highway
robbery.  Help me put some evidence to this.
