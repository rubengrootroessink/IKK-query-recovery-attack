Our records show that you will be up for rotation soon.  In order to secure your next rotation and to ensure a good fit, please choose one of the following options.

Please forward me an updated copy of your resume along with your business unit and function preferences.  Once we receive this, we will begin sending your resume out to those business units with open positions and the managers will then contact you directly if they are interested.
Please email me to schedule a meeting.  We can discuss your business unit and function preferences at that time as well as any other issues that may have come up.
If you plan to extend your current rotation, please let me know the date the extension will end.
If you have already started another rotation, please complete and send back the following information so that we may update the database.
