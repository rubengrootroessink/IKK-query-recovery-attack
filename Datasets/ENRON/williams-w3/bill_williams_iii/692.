Bill, this is an awesome story.  I was too awestruck to fully understand
when you explained yesterday!  Companies can make and lose money, people get
promoted, emails are exchanged--- but you never forget the moments like an
omelet lady catching on fire.  I hope she is OK!  It sounds serious.  Hey,
great show last night.  I took off at the end of the 1st encore.  Talk to
you later,
Scott
