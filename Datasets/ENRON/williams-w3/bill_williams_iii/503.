FYI -

Roger called today to inform us of a transmission capacity bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we will need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to ensure that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee or buy transmission  with SRP-PNM-TNP-APS-etc.to fill the lending short. Note: EPE will still deliver us energy at PV. Then enter a zero priced buy-resale in Enpower to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV. 

This is how it should take place - 
Day-Ahead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
Hour-Ahead	
	Buy from Counterparty such as PNM, SRP, TNP, or APS at FC or Greenlee 
	Buy-Resale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
