Virginia - please ensure future correspondence of this nature goes to <bill.williams.III@enron.com> rather than to me.  I am not working the trading floor.  Bill the younger is.

Cheers

Bill the Elder.

Bill,

  I wanted to let you know that I killed deal # 692792.1 because it would not auto-schedule.  I have entered deal # 695840.1 to account for payment from ST W_HRLY to LT_NW as agreed by you and Mike.

  Please call me with any questions.

  Virginia
