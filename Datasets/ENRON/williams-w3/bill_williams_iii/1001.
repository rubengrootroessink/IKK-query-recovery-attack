This is the 37 MW generator in Montana that Enron has some ownership interest in. They are due to come up off maintenance around June 22 and will have the power available for us to market through the end of June (before their next QF year starts). I have agreed with Terry Donovan that we would charge $5.00/Mwh as a services fee and recover all wheeling costs. We can sell this power to third parties or to internal Enron books. There will be wheeling in on MT system unless we can talk with Dianna about serving MT load with it. It is unit contingent.

Just a heads up - I spoke with the Rosebud guys today and they want to do the deal we discussed yesterday.  Let's speak sometime the next couple of days to get things coordinated.
