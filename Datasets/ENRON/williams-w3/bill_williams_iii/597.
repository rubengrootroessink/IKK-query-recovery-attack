  I think I sent this to your dad first.  OOPS!


Bill,

  I wanted to let you know that I killed deal # 692792.1 because it would not auto-schedule.  I have entered deal # 695840.1 to account for payment from ST W_HRLY to LT_NW as agreed by you and Mike.

  Please call me with any questions.

  Virginia
