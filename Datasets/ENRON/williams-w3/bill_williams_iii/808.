Dear Melissa or Thresa,

  I have completed DMS's # 8704 and 8699 for Sierra Pacific.  The total of the two will be a negative $ 9033.39 impact on the real time books.  
  I was wondering if we could pull this change thru today so that it comes thru in the next PMA report?
  I know Amy will be back July 2, so I was wondering if someone could do it for her. The real time book will be taking another $10,000 hit soon, so I wanted to split these 2 big    hits between 2 PMA reports if at all possible.

  Please let me know.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
