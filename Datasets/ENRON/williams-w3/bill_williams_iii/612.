FYI -

I've created a spreadsheet that will track APS line losses our group has incurred and paid back. This will allow us to see at a glance the month's transmission purchases and what it's cost us to purchase power in order to pay APS back physically. Keep in mind that loss volumes are calculated as 2.5% of the total volume of transmission purchased in a given period. 

I will maintain this spreadsheet, and you're encouraged to reference it at your leisure. Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
