I'm just sittin back here (WAY BACK HERE) trying to watch the X games on the TV up front. My workout was very very good.  I've been running and/or weigh training at lunch for the past month. I feel so much better when I workout. It's helped me deal with my work issues. Anyhow, yes I did get invited to that candlelight party thing. First of all, I don't even know who Erin Hall is. Secondly, I have no idea what a candlelight party is, but it sounds lame. 2 in the afternoon? Candlelight? What is that all about? So, I'll talk to ya later gator.

What up?  How was your workout at lunch?
Did you get that email on the "candlelight party"... and what the hell is a candlelight party?
