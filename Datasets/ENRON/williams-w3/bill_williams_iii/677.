Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) and PGE Park are proud to announce "Party at PGE Park," a fundraiser, celebrating the opening of PGE Park. PFE has been very fortunate to have an outpouring of support from our community. They want to acknowledge the community's enthusiastic response to PGE Park by giving back to those organizations that make a difference for Oregon.  So, they are hosting Party at PGE Park.

Party at PGE Park is a fundraiser and 100% of the proceeds of our party will be distributed to three prominent local non-profit organizations:

			*	Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism (SOLV)
			*	The Portland Oregon Sports Authority Foundation
			*	Special Olympics Oregon
