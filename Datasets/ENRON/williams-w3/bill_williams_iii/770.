Group,

If the ISO hits a stage I emergency any time on 7/4 or 7/5, please submit supplemental energy bids (at $91) immediately for any generation that is not already sold.  Generation that's not already prescheduled is as follows:

7/4
80mw, HE1-24, HRBGN_7_UNITS
17mw, HE1-24, HRBGN_7_PL2X3

7/5
80mw, HE1-6, 23-24, HRBGN_7_UNITS
17mw, HE1-24, HRBGN_7_PL2X3

Also, please try to buy-back HE7-11 on 7/5.  We sold for $88.50, so if you can buy-back 80mw in the market for less than $88.50 please do so.  Please stay in contact with the control room regarding output of the unit.

Thanks,
Stan
