Keoni:

We had another unpleasant experience with Hildago last night.  This is the =
third different individual at EPMI who has had an interaction with him resu=
lting in a hassle.  The other day I wrote it off to my fault, but since it =
has happened with 2 other people here, and only with Hildago, I now believe=
 the problem is him.  He has a natural antagonistic demeanor that makes peo=
ple defensive and angry.  When he calls he accuses us of not meeting our ob=
ligations and demands information and says things like, "if you do not prov=
ide this information I will turn you in."   We understand our responsibilit=
y to provide outage information to the ISO.  We are diligent in completing =
outage reports and submitting them to the outage coordination desk at the I=
SO.  The ISO is requiring an additional communication with the Real Time gr=
oup to either: 1) confirm that the outage ended as planned, or 2) change th=
e outage timing if required.  Although, to my knowledge, this requirement i=
s not in the ISO tariff, and has not been communicated to SCs in writing in=
 any way, and furthermore is a waste of time for everyone, will make effort=
s to do this.  The ISO should recognize, however, that in most cases, our R=
eal Time Group is not aware of outages our generator SC clients, nor should=
 they be, as these units our off line and therefore "out of play" in Real T=
ime.  Hildago should work to communicate better and treat people with respe=
ct.  He clearly is not doing that with us.   =20


Thanks
