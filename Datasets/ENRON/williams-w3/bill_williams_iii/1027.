This is what I think.  I'll let you know when I get confirmation.

My response to the questions would be that they get the proxy price during
the mitigated intervals when they do not have a bid in.  If they have a bid
in, they get the higher of the proxy or the bid and they submit the cost
justification to FERC.  Right?
Who do they send cost justification to?

Keoni:

In addition to my questions below, can you clarify what we get paid when
we are inc'd pursuant to the FERC Order?  Is the proxy the inc? If we do
not have a bid in, do we get the inc?  If we have a supplemental bid in,
do we get the higher of the inc or the bid?   If we do get the higher
of, to whom do we send our cost data?

Chris
