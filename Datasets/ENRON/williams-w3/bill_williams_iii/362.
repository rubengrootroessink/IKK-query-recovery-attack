This is on-peak only. We scheduled the energy as contingency (emergency) so I would be interested in seeing if we get called at all.

We purchased 24MW of Spin from LADW&P at LA4 for August 9 
Capacity payment 16.50 - energy strike 79.51 

We want to continue to offer the energy to the ISO at the price cap and to check the contingency flag (yes) so that we will only get called on in a contingency or  emergency situation.
