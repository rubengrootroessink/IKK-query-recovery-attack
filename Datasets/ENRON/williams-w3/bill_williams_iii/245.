Kate,

Bill will be taking care of this request.  He has already talked with the developer involved and will keep you informed.  Let me know if there is something with which he can not help you.

Regards,
Will

I have one more thing to add to the list of Enpower requests:

Deals done under the EPMI Short Term West Hourly desk do not need to be confirmed. The Real Time traders know they need to check "No" in the Confirmation box in Deal Entry; however, it's one detail amidst many that sometimes gets overlooked. It occurred to me that we could avoid the problem of Real Time deals getting unnecessarily confirmed - and unnecessarily confusing counterparties - if we could make "No confirmation" an automatic default for all deals entered under the Short Term West Hourly book. 

I can't think of any other groups which would be adversely impacted by this change, but let's discuss that during the next Enpower meeting. Please let me know what we can do to get this implemented.

Thanks for your help,
Kate
