Group,

Delano is back from a unit outage, and all day (Monday, 8/20) we have been selling 25mw for them.  Bert has already sold them through HE22.  Guys on the night shift, please sell only 10mw for HE23-24.  They will produce a total of 45mw through HE22, then drop to 30mw HE23-24.  They were prescheduled at 20mw all day long.  They are back to their normal preschedule for Tuesday, 8/21 (45mw peak, and 30mw off-peak), so no real-time action is required for Tuesday. 

Thanks for your help.
Stan
