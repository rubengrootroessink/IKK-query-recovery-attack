Group,
We will be sending 25 mws to CRC for HE 1-22 on Friday and HE 1-22 on Saturday.  The purchase should be made under ST-SW.  The price for the sale is $50.34.  We will then split profits 50/50 with ST-SW through an annuity.  CRC should be prepared.  But we should touch base with CRC and NEVP well ahead (3-4 hours) of time to make sure the schedule flows properly.  This is THE trial run so this will set protocol going forward.  Be sharp and give me a call if you need anything.  503-887-3449.

Thanks,
Bill
