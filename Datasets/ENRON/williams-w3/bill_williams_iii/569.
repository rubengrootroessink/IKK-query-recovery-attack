I did the do the cloning process for John Anderson and this time it didn't work. It's worked for other users but I'm not sure why it didn't work this time. I need to have a list of items that John needs so I can individually request and add to his account. I'll work with Kate to get his account updated.

Has there been any progress on creating a profile for our new trader, John Anderson? I know you had copied Ryan Slinger's profile over to get him access to all the necessary applications, but I just heard from Bill that as of this morning John (aka Casey) was still unable to access Enpower and the M:drive. Could you let me know when you get a moment today how this is going? 

Thanks,
Kate
