Hi Kate - Lisa is out today.  I have added the users to the appropriate groups which should give them access to the required databases.  I show that their notes id's have alread been created - I will go ahead and drop the id's into the H:\notes4\data directories of the respective users.  The passwords have been set to changeyourpassword - you may need to contact a floor tech to install notes on the user's machines and install the id required for accessing the databases.

Salman.

Lisa -

I'm still attempting to get our three new traders set up with the necessary Lotus Notes databases. I just tried to login as Darin Presto, and it appears he does not yet have an ID. Could you let me know what more I need to do to get these guys access to the following Lotus Notes databases?

Thanks,
Kate

Lisa -

Thanks for looking into this, and for your quick response. I'm not sure which databases you're looking at (possibly East Real Time?), but I've attached a list of the four databases the new Portland Real Time traders need access to. The traders names are: Darin Presto; John C. Anderson; Michael Mier. Of course, their need for a Lotus Notes account is implicit in this request. Beyond that, they need the following:

Title - WSCC Outages
Server - ECTPDX-LN1/ECT
Filename - mail\wsccnet.nsf

Title - West Realtime
Server - ECTPDX-LN1/ECT
Filename - mail\WestReal.nsf

Title - West Power Scheduling Archive
Server - ECTHOU_LN1/ECT
Filename - Power\powrschdiarchive.nsf

Title - West Power Scheduling Discussion
Server - ECTHOU_LN1/ECT
Filename - Power\powrschdi.nsf

Again, thank you for your help with this, and please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

Thanks,
Kate

There are two databases which I cannot locate:

West Realtime
WSCC Outages


However, I did locate:

Real Time Operations:  ECTPDX-LN1/ECT\realtime\myaccoun.nsf (Would this be the correct database?)
Realtime:  ECTHOU-LN7/ECT\mail\realtime.nsf


For WSCC Outages and West Realtime databases, if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following:

Close the database icon
Right-click on the database icon
Choose File, Database, Properties
Then send me the Title, Server, and Filename information.  This will be of great help.


Many Thanks and Please Advise.

Lisa Scully
