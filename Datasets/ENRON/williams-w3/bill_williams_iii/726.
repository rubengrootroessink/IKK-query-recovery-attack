I believe I have asked before, but in case I missed you...

If you or any of your traders get an error while working in excel about not being able to save, please capture a screen shot and e-mail it to me. I am currently working with Microsoft to get this resolved, but they have requested a screen shot of the actual error message.

Much Thanks,
