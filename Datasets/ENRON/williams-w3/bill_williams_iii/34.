To whom it may concern:

E-request 58321 was sent on 9/5 with high priority status. I have not heard back regarding this request, and its approval is becoming increasingly important. Bill Williams III, manager of the West Real Time group, needs to be able to move important e-mail documents from his overloaded inbox into public folders in order to simply send new messages or store incoming mail. 

Could you please let me know if there is more information I can provide regarding this request and give me an estimated time of its approval?

Thank you,
