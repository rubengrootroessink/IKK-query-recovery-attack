Bill,

Thanks very much for taking the time to speak with me this afternoon.  I am very interested in a real-time trading position in Portland.  It sounds like an excellent opportunity and a challenge that I am ready to take on.  I have heard many good things about the group in Portland and I trust that real-time trading would be an exceptional learning experience.  I certainly look forward to visiting Portland and further discussing this opportunity with you and your team.
