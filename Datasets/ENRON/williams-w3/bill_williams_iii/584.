I've entered two annuities to account for the interdesk swaps between the Services desk and ST-Cali and ST-West Hourly entered last week during the now infamous "Great Wheelabrator Clean-Up of '01." Risk informed me today that these interdesk deals would not value because they were entered for a date which has already liquidated; thus the need for annuities. They are as follows:

696403 - STWS buys from STWH
	7/21/01
	1 mw @ HE 1
	$10,880

696401 - STWS buys from STCA
	7/21/01
	1 mw @ HE 1
	$15,325

These purchase prices are strictly the value of the interdesk swaps which have been entered but will not calc. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
