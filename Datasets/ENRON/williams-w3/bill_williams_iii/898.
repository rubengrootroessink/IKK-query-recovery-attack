Bill,

Attached to this message is the presentation I am prepared to share with your real-time traders.  Please let me know when you'd like to reschedule me to make this presentation.  

As we discussed a couple weeks ago I have other ideas relating to power systems operations that you may find benefical to share with your trading group.

Kind Regards,

Dave
