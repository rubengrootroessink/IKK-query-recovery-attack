Group,

There are two actions required for Delano Energy on Monday, 7/17.  First, please try to buy-back HE7-10.  They will be running at 25mw HE1-6, and then they are scheduled to ramp up to 45mw beginning HE7.  If you can purchase 20mw for HE7-10 below $40 (their cost to run), please do so.

Second, we need to sell 5mw for HE23-24.  They are prescheduled for 25mw, but they will be actually running at 30mw, so we need to sell 5mw.  Their variable costs are $40, so please try to sell above this level.

Thanks,
Stan
