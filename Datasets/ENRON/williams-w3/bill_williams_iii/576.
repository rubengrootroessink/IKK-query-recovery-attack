Bill,
I just wanted to let you know that it's going to take a couple weeks (I think) until I receive access to the timekeeping system.  Apparently after requesting access, ISC sends back a ticket number and an FYI (below).  
As soon as I receive access I will go back for your group and enter their time, and from then on keep track of the groups time for each month.

Thanks, Jill
