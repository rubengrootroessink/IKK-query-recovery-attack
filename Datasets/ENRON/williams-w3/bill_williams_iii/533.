Amy and Bill,
     Here is my resume for consideration in the Real Time Trading group as a
West Hourly Enron Online Trader.

     This position would utilize my MBA skills and my desire to transition from
the telecom sector to trading and energy business. I have great interests in the
trading business, and EOL in particular. For EOL to remain the world's top
e-commerce sites per volume of transactions, new markets and counterparties, and
constant innovations are required.
