Modules
Modules are designed to help managers and other decision-makers to build essential business skills and  enhance the strategic perspective of any member of the enterprise. Learners are challenged to achieve specific real-world business objectives and master the fundamentals of general business skills. 

Business Leaders
Professors from Babson College, a leader in Executive Development & Entrepreneurship, provided materials and content for the courses.  Babson College is ranked #1 in entrepreneurship by Business Week, Financial Times, Success magazine and U.S. News & World Report.  

Course Delivery
You can take the course in segments of time that are conducive to your daily schedule - if you want to work on it for 5 minutes or 5 hours, it will bookmark the place when you last left.  Each module is approximately 8 hours in length and can be accessed from any computer with Internet access.  

Your Involvement
If you chose to participate in this pilot, you are agreeing to complete one of the aforementioned modules and provide feedback based on your experience.  The pilot will begin in mid-September and will conclude in mid-October.  

How do I WIN?
In order to be qualified for the Airplane tickets, you must complete one module and provide feedback.  The completed evaluation will enter you in the drawing.  If you complete more than one module you will be entered multiple times.  You'll have a great chance to win the tickets because less than 100 people will participate in this pilot.
