Over the past few weeks the real time desk has had several cuts on schedule=
s that have involved Mirant in the Southwest.  I thought that I should brin=
g it to all of your attention that Mirant has not been fulfilling their obl=
igation to re-supply cut schedules. In several instances Mirant is also  no=
t telling any of the downstream counter parties until after the hour of the=
 cut.  This evening  Steve and I had four separate schedules in which Miran=
t was cut by PAC transmission for several hours.  In each of these cases Mi=
rant was unwilling to re-supply and was unwilling to contact the downstream=
 counter parties.  It appears to me that they don't want to take the time t=
o re-supply or are simply not competent enough to fill the schedules.  On t=
hree of these schedules I had to negotiate a book out for Mirant and on one=
 I was able to re-supply.  In all of the recent cuts I have dealt with them=
 on they have acted in a similar manner.  After discussing this issue with =
Cara, she thought it would be prudent to pass this information along to all=
 of you.  If you have any further questions about this issue please feel fr=
ee to contact me.
