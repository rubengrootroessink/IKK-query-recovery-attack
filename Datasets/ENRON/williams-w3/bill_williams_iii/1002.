Les,
Last night 6/6 Dave Mitchel called at 17:45 to say he would be generating 3mw at 18:30.  I told him I'd start selling the 3's for HE:20 and if there were any problems or any changes to give me a call.   After I had already sold the 3's and bought transmission hour by hour for a couple of hours, Dave called me at 21:45 to say they would be coming on in 5 minutes.  So we sold 20,21,&22 for frontier when they were not generating.
Eric
