hey, i am back in olympia now.  my friends wedding was sunday and i drove
home last night.  too bad i didn't have the better e-mail address.  the
wedding was really good, i tend to get cynical about such things but found
myself enjoying it and even tearing up at times.  i saw a lot of people i
haven't seen since high school which was mostly good. it doesn't seem like
that much changes, a bit of growing up but people are still the same.
jennifer was one of the other bridesmaids, do you remember her?  i used to
call her niffer. anyways, seeing her was especially good.
are you still enginering??? (smiles)  when you get a chance, let me know how
you are.

erin
