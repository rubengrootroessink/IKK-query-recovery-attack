It is on like Donkey Kong.  Too bad Im going to have to "show you guys" how
its done on the golf course.  We need to get a pony keg for the pre-party.
1201 sounds good but Im afraid of that chick.

   Ahoy young Williams.  Where do you want to play golf on Friday?   I
   think
   something in North or East Portland would be cool.  We definitely need
   to
   get a pony keg for the bbq Friday afternoon.  The note I sent at work is
   copied below.  Only a couple people have responded.
   Later.

   Subject:     Timbers game this Friday

   To all,
   The Portland Timbers are playing this Friday evening.  Admission is ~$5
   and
   the game starts at 7pm.  These games are a blast and it would be fun if
   we
   could get a group together.  There will be a pre-party at my house from
   5:30-7:00.  Please let me know if you would like to go.

   Also, Please forward this message to anyone else in your team that would
   be
   interested.
   Directions to my house and PGE park are attached.
