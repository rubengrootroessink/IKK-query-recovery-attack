Bill -

I talked to Heather about the term of this annuity - HE 1 on 6/21 - and she seemed to think it would pull into tonight's calc so we'd see the revenue on tomorrow's DPR. If we don't, however, Heather has said she would be happy to forward-date the deal so we can avoid the iniquitous payment-by-PMA.

Let me know if you have any problems with this.

Kate

I entered 658780 Annuity for $18750 6/21.
This is a true-up for deal # 551890.
Deal was originally entered W-Hourly buying from ST-CA - after liquidation it was changed to W-Hourly 
buying from EES.

Heather,
I spoke with Chris and he is on board with the annuity of $18750 from ST-CALI to ST-WHOURLY.
Thanks for the help with this.

Bill
