I was told that this application is not suported in any way at this point, but Gary Bode was the person who helped us in the past.  You might call him with a restoration of data request.  Let me know If I need to bark louder.

Virginia, 
I have no idea.
I would recommend checking with Cara...she's omniscient.
Good luck.

  Do you know who in Houston  keeps up the Lotus Notes Database?  There is a 2 week gap in the database between current and archived records.  
  Just wondering if you know..
