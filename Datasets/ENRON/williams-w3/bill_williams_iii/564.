RT traders,

Due to a meeting I need help. I need real time to call into BPA Frontiers and Grays Harbors schedules. The tags have been issued and approved however the account numbers need to be called into BPA.

The tag for Grays is 26932 the tag for Frontier is 27806.

The account numbers for BPA are hilighted in the Services Book.

Call around 2200.

Call me if there are any questions.
