Thanks for the heads up.  This headcount reflects who was in this cost center in April, and will not include May or June changes.

Lindsay,

Bill Williams III, Manager of Portland's Real Time Desk, brought to my attention some changes that will need to be incorporated into the June budget figures.  Please remove Jesse Bryson, Mohamed Elafandi, and Monika Causholli from the budget as they are no longer in his cost center, 107302.  Also, please add Kate Symes.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Anna
