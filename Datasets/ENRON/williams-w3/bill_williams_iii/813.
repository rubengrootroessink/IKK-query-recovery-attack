If you are interested in borrowing a video tape of the PBS Frontline broadcast titled, "Blackout," please see me.  This video features interviews with Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and other energy industry executives.

Best regards,

"California's power disaster has made 'energy' a front-burner issue for everyone. Through interviews with state and federal officials, power company executives, and average citizens, the documentary examines whether power companies and energy trading giants have capitalized on deregulation to make tremendous profits even as users suffer power shortages." (60 min.)
