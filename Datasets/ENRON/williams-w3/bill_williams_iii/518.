Juan -

It was nice meeting you on Tuesday at the Mid C conference.  I am interested in getting you and Bill Williams together for a meeting so we can get more real time business going.  Perhaps next week is convenient for you?  Bill would love to also meet some of your real time traders.  You can reach me by email or at 503-464-3810.
