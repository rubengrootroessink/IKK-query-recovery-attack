We have 10 MW of length from Sierra through the APX light load at $185.  Stan purchased this NP15 length from the APX and it should be scheduled DA by Jeremy.  There should be a ECTRT load zone in PGE3 with this length.  Use whatever opportunities are out there (dynegy across COB or a straight export) to maximize this position.  The deal numbers are: 581335-purchase from APX and 581356-desk to desk deal.  Please make sure this gets taken care of.

Cheers
Jesse
