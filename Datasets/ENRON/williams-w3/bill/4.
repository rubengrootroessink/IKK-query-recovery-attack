That is so rad Bill. I'm pretty jealous, but at least one of us will get to enjoy this amazing day! What happened to the drive up to St Helens on your motorcycle?? I think that sounds like a rad time. Maybe you will take me up there one day during the summer when the sun is shining?? That would totally rule. I would be so into that. Anyhow, have a great time playing golf. Try to shoot a birdie for me. hee hee
