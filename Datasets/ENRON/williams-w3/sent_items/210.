Jeff,
I will be glad to discuss this with you in the future. However, I am on my way out the door to Pullman, WA for a recruiting trip. I will be back late on Friday afternoon or we can talk on Monday.
Give me a call on my cell and let me know what you would like to do.

Bill

Bill,

I would like to sit down and discuss the $5.00/MW charge that is being associated to each EES transaction.  Since Tim Coffing is now up here and managing our intra-month portfolio, I feel the ability to manage a retail position is better than what it was and the volatility in the wholesale market has come off quite a bit.  I would like to discuss this further with you sometime today.

Let me know when you are free.

Thanks,
Jeff
