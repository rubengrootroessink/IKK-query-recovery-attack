Group,

A quick reminder. The cell phones are for group member to group member usage.  As such, calling between group members, and our 1-800-684-1336 number is free.  We have 200 minutes each for use in calling other members of the West Desk on work related matters.  Over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month.  Some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 200 minutes per month!    Group member to group member usage is approximately 45-90 minutes per month-and this is not calculated in the minutes used.  If you want to use this phone as your only phone, let me know, and we will work out a calling and billing plan for you. 

Thank you,
B
