Steve,

Good afternoon, I have attached a draft of the Control Area Services Agreement to this email. Please take a look at it when you have a moment and let me know what you think about it. I understand we may not implement it for a while. However, I thought having an agreement in place might provide us with more flexibility and the ability to take advantage of opportunities as this month winds down. I appreciate your time and feedback.

Thank you,

Bill
