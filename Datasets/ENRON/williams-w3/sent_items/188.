Catherine,
I believe this was meant for Bill Williams in Technical Assets.
Please note the difference in email addresses.
Thanks, 
Bill

Finance is fine with the change order inclusive of Scott's comments.  Please send us an executed copy, as we are obligated to pass it on to the banks.  How will the payment of the additional $6,000 be handled?  Will the next progress payment (23.5% of purchase price, scheduled for Dec 1, 2001) be based on the new price + the "catch-up amount" ($2,850,560.30)?  Please let us know so E-Next can budget accordingly.  Thanks,
-Catherine

Brian,

Please see the attached Change Order No. 1 on which I have redlined my comments.

Check to make sure that the signature block for E-Next/ENA conforms with the signature block in the Purchase Agreement.

Also, please verify with Lisa, Kathleen and Billy that they are OK with the form Change Order. 

Thanks,

Scott
