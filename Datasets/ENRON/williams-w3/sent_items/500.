Thanks for the information Heather.  This looks good and useful.
Would you have any information on what tools we used to settle?  Or was it all a manual process?

Bill and Chris - this is what I remember as to settlements with the DEC bidding strategy.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Delano will schedule into the Day Ahead market and make a sale at the PX index price.  Real Time submits dec bids in the Suplemental Energy Market for any hours when they believe there is a good chance of being dec'd at a 0 price (the pprice you bid may be different than 0 to establish ouselves in the ISO Merit order - ).  Real Time makes 50% of the difference between the day ahead PX and the dec price (in this case 0).
