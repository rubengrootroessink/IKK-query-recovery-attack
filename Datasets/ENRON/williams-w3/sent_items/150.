Good to hear you're a big believer in time off. How about a compromise? I'll wait until the middle of next month, and then I'd like to take off Nov. 12-16. That way, I'll be available to settle October, November, and hopefully many months to come. Sound good? Let me know. And I appreciate your understanding.

Kate

Kate,
It is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times. Granted, renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor, and I am a big believer in it. We have in the past discussed that I would prefer  that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week. If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance, again like everyone else in your group, please just let me know.
I appreciate your understanding.

Bill

I'm glad to know that I have only one purpose here. If that's the case, then maybe I should just start taking the other three weeks of the month off. And the purpose was NOT not to settle October - which is of course something I await with bated breath. The purpose was to relieve some of the pressure I'm starting to feel and ideally return with renewed motivation to do my job well. While I realize this should be something I do all the time, without occasional days off for incentive, I think you can understand that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. I can hardly believe I'm so indispensible you couldn't survive two days without me with a week's notice. Come on....

How? Unless the purpose was to not settle October...which would defeat A purpose of you working here...

That completely defeats the purpose of my taking time off. Forget about it.

Kate,
If you are flexible, I would prefer if you took the 8th and 9th of November off. This would allow us to settle up PMA's at the end of October and make sure we are settled going into November. 

Let me know if this is what you would like to do.

Thanks,
Bill

What would you think about me taking off next Thursday and Friday? If that doesn't work, perhaps the following Monday and Tuesday? Let me know.
