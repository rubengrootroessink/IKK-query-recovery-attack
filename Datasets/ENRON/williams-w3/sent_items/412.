This is from a guy on our floor.  He's a summer intern...and this is his Tu=
esday morning story.  Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the =
old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke l=
oose.  I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in se=
arch of a fire extinguisher.  Didn't find one, and like Scott (the intern) =
was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well.



I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am s=
itting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks lo=
ose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morni=
ng.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that a=
re serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food w=
ill last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast f=
rom a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used t=
o because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enro=
n employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the flo=
or is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice b=
reakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would=
 wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first =
omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill. =
 Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they w=
ill get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straigh=
t out of a FOX tv show or "You've Gotta See This" episode...this old woman =
is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks he=
ating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to te=
n feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, o=
r anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmo=
re's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this =
high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in t=
he middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and=
 glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV =
that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is dire=
ctly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly faci=
ng the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat=
 of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thou=
ght, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is g=
oing to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,"=
Somebody get me outta here!"...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, so=
meone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man=
, I have no clue.  However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing hi=
s best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the=
 only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing=
 a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the =
fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to=
 blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on th=
e old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torc=
hing a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in o=
ur building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to m=
ake even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old=
 woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who know=
s what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bu=
nch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in =
flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted abo=
ut 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, Scotty


Enjoyable or what?
Give me a call and let me know what is up.
