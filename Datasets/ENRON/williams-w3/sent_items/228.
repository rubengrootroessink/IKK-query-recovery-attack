Hey Bill,

      Been thinking that I understand the aspects of Real Time trading on a more general scale but I am interested in leaning more of the specifics.  I would like to sit in with some of the people at your desk to pick some of that stuff up.  If you don't mind I should have some time to do this in the next few weeks.  Let me know.

Thanks,
Darren
