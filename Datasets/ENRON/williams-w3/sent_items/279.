Sorry to hear about Racheal...so the Bretts weren't gay? But what about Nancy...
I haven't been to the Breakroom. I think I will be coming up to Seattle on either Friday afternoon or Saturday morning. I haven't decided yet. I am taking Friday off from work though...my birthday is on Thursday...isn't your birthday here in the tail end of August--or am I thinking of Chuck. Erica Price? from the dorms, rowed crew, tall, red hair, sometimes slightly neurotic?..that would be kind of fun to run into her, anyway...I'll get back to you when I figure out what the heck is going on.
Later.
Bill

It's at the Breakroom on Capitol Hill.  Ahhh yes, Racheal, I showed up with
a couple of friends and she wasn't there.  At about 7:30 Nancy came up to me
with one of the "Bretts" and said that Racheal got caught up in a Job for
Costco....whatever...

Erica is in town for her sisters wedding.  She might come to the Brad show
if she can make it.
