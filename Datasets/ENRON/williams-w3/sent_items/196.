FYI -

I left a message with Rich Brueger @ MPC regarding power we resupplied at Montana System on 8/1, HE 13. I'm giving you the same information I left with him in case any questions arise in my absence. Fortunately, there is a detailed cut note in the Lotus database, so you can refer to that if I've missed the mark entirely. Out of Montana's 62 mw of choice customer load that hour, we resupplied 41 mw. Following is the breakdown of sink counterparties:

Luzenac America, Inc. - 5 mw
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. - 25 mw
Express Pipeline Partnership - 6 mw
Cenex Harvest States Coop. - 5 mw

Deals entered real time to resupply are 714148 (Buy PGE @ Mid-C) and 714150 (BPA tranny Mid-C to Montana System).
