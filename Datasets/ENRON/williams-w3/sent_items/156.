Julie,
I received this message yesterday from a student group at the University of Washington. Do you still want some to go to Seattle and stir up interest?
 
Bill

Bill Williams,
 
    As you know, the Dow Dawgs are an Investment Club at the University of Washington.  KC Anderson informed us of your interest in coming to one of our meetings.  My officers and I are happy to hear of your interest and would like to help you get the word out about Enron. 
    We were hoping you could make it to our next meeting Wednesday (10/24) 5-6pm.  We will, however, work with your schedule and move the meeting to a different day next week.  The sooner we hear back from you the sooner we can schedule a meeting room and advertise to students.  This would also be an excellent opportunity for you to highlight any career or internship opportunities at your company.

Thanks,
 
Adam Perino
President 
Dow Dawgs Investment Club
