Is this the only revision you'd like to see?

FYI -

Roger called today to inform us of a [Mark Hall]   [transmission capacity]  bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we  [Mark Hall]  [will] need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to  [Mark Hall]  insure [Mark Hall]  (sic)  that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee [Mark Hall]   [or buy transmission/do a buy/resell with SRP-PNM-TNP-APS-etc.]  to fill the lending short [Mark Hall]   note-EPE will still deliver us energy at PV- , then enter a zero priced buy-resale [Mark Hall]   in enpower  to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV. 

This is how it should take place - 
Day-Ahead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
Hour-Ahead	
	Buy from Counterparty such as PNM, SRP, TNP, or APS at FC or Greenlee 
	Buy-Resale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
