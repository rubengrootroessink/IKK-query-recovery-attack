I will only be in Albuquerque for like 4 hours Monday morning...so it doesn't look like I will have to much of a chance to meet up with you. Maybe an early afternoon brew...
Emily Willis--huh--didn't you and her...oh yeah...I remember the flat tire.

I was looking around on "classmates.com" and found out that Ryan Leppert
