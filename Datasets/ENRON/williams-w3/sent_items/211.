Bob,

We would have the following hourly physical products out until 6 PM CST (4 PST) on Friday--HE 17 through HE 20 Palo Verde; HE 17 through HE 20 MID-C; HE 19 through HE 20 SP15; HE 19 through HE 20 NP15. We can then suspend or inactivate these products at 6 PM. All other physical products will have already been suspended or inactivated before 6 PM CST (HE 12 through HE 17 etc.).

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thank you for the help.

Bill

Tim,

Greg and I spoke about your need for EOL to stay up until 6:00pm CST on Friday nights.  We have made the change to our outage window and I wanted to check with you to make sure you were aware.

thanks,
bbh
