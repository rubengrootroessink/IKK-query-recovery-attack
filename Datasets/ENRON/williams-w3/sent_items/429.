Eric,

I have forwarded this to Bill Williams.  Please note that there is a subtle but important difference between the two email addresses.  Please make the change in your address book.

Thanks,
Bill

Eric:
 
    Could you please tell us what the maximum temperature of cooling water
at maximum ambient temperature will be?  Could you also tell us what the
minimum temperature of cooling water at minimum ambient temperature will be?
We'll need this fairly quickly to design the generator for this job.  Your
help is greatly appreciated!
 
    Thanks!
 
Cheryl
