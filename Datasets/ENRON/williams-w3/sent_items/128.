This is at the top right after you turning the volume on your computer down.
Also...
Right after the boxes, but parallel to FSP parallel testing.
Thanks,

Bill -

Would you like me to work with Cara on this? I know you initially asked Mark Guzman to test it, but it appears she may be looking for some kind of feedback soon. Like I said, I tried getting into it today to go through the format, but was unable to. So my question is - where is this on our priority list?

Kate

Good Afternoon,

I was able to import all of the Palo Verde Heavy Load schedules into Path Confrimation!  

The sorting and Pathing looks right.  After routing the screen froze completely, but routing was done. I had to end task to get out of the PSW, and we will look at why this error occurred.


With Real time Approval,  If this month goes well for me at PV we will attempt to put everyone on the system starting December 1.  If I do not hear anything from real time, I will assume passive approval has taken place.

There are still some issues with running the build route report, but they are being worked on now.  

I am routing day-ahead to test, but am wanting direction from real time as to whether to route ahead or after the day. Right now the only deals un-routed on PV Heavy are the Parking Deals from PNM and EPE


Thanks,

Cara
