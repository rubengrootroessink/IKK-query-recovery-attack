Group,
I have copied in a note from Roger at EPE. As you can see they are placing a VERY high importance on economic dispatch of the units. Please be aware that every move with regards to marketing and running their system is under EXTREME scrutiny.

Please call me before you call our customer.

Thanks,
Bill



Correction:
The burner problem is on Newman 3.  (Thank You! Mr Ward)   The unit will be held at 85 MW's until repairs can be made.  The plan is to assess the problem Monday morning and make the necessary repairs.    

If prices continue to be below cost we need to purchase power and back down
local units.  With Copper off, the dispatch shows we need to purchase power for 5 or 6 hours through super peak. 

Depending on load,  GT 1 and GT 2 should be put in the hole (around 7 to 10
MW's each) HE 1:00 through HE 9:00...

If  Market conditions are less than $14.00  BACK DOWN Four Corners...   As
load picks up be sure to pick up Four Corners first!
If there is a reason we have to dump FC power please send me a note!   If
there is any confusion over whether to back down FC CALL.

Any questions or comments please call at  5808  or  915-204-1202...
 
Roger
