Kysa,
This is totally inappropriate and HIGHLY unprofessional. In these difficult times we need to continue to put forth and display Enron's core values: Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence. I look for this in each one of my coworkers and for every member of the real-time team. Please see what you can do to better respect Kate's feelings and the effort she puts in each day.

Kysa -

If you would like to add EES Hourly data into your daily mail-out - and feel comfortable that EES won't bombard you with silly questions at the end of the month - then go ahead and send this to them as well. Let me know if that works for you, or if you have any questions.

Thanks. Here's an example so you can see what I've been sending them.
