Keoni,
I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem. I have not yet been able to pull up "corrected" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids. The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed. Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids. Will the change in running the "solutions" change this? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly. 

I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.

Thanks,
Bill
