Steph,
Great to hear from you. I got a call from Scotty this weekend but have not had a chance to give him a call back yet. Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me. It should be good for our stock price though. One can hope anyway.
Glad to hear you guys are doing well. Let me know when you guys are coming down...you can definitely stay at my place--its not big but I will have a futon for a bit longer. You may prefer the Paramount hotel--its right next door.
And my liver will likely always be in shape.

Take care.

B

Bill,
How is the swinging Portland ladies man?  Thought I would see how you are 
doing in light of Enron selling Portland General....are you still employeed? 
  I am sure you are since you have made them lots of money!  How is your 
place?  Any new girls?  I must say that I miss hanging out in Portland and 
causing trouble.  I am sure you have carried on the tradition.  Things in 
Seattle are good.  Scott is living on Eastlake and taking some computer 
classes.  Work for me is the same.  We will be coming to visit soon so start 
getting your liver in shape!  Hope you are well.
Stephanie
