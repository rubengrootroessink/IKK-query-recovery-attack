There are several annuities related to the profit sharing of this deal.
First--
All deals should have been made under the ST-NW desk to route with the PGE =
deal-buy tranny-etc. (I recognize this did not happen but this was my inten=
t and should or could have). Consequently all revenue from this deal origin=
ally went into the ST-NW book. Therefore. An annuity was made from ST-NW to=
 ST-WHOURLY. Deal #531524--$23468. Next an annuity was made from ST-Whourly=
 to LT-NW at $5472 to compensate LT-NW for the $48 purchase price (deal #53=
1546). This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-=
Pac-30/70. Consequently, ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part=
 of the profit share, Deal #531549--$12597.73. All this left RT with a prof=
it of $5399. If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large im=
pact on ST-NW, and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times. The=
se profit share numbers are accurate. After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for =
the original deal, then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73. All thes=
e annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of Februa=
ry. It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW boo=
k...ideas?

Questions?

Just come see me and let me know.
