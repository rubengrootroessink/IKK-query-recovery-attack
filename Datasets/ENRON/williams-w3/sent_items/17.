REAL TIME TRADERS,

SPS HAS MANAGED TO OVER SCHEDULE BY 100MW PER HOUR ON PEAK HOURS SUNDAY 1/20 AT PV THEIR EDDY/PV SWAP WITH EPE. Steve at EPE has agreed to a leading deal with SPS where SPS/PSCO will supply 100 mw at PV real time to EPE. El Paso already has tags out there showing EPE as the source for SPS sales. 

SPS/PSCO will supply the energy to El Paso at PV and El Paso should show it going to their system. Steve was supposed to let the dispatchers know all the details.

Les
