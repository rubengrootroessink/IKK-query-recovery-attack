Pretty much, its turning into the only day they have available for what we need...short of Thanksgiving weekend or late December...which is getting a bit close to the Holidays...

What do you think? Is it a good way to end the month?

Cara,
Sounds good but...we had to change the night to November 30th...I'm sorry. Hopefully it still works for you guys. Did you want to get rooms as well. If so just speak with Jill Chatterton. More to follow.
