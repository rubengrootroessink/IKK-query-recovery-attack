Dave,
Thanks for the update and I appreciate the work. I understand that moving turrets, and reconfiguring desks takes time. Just let me know what I can do to help on moving turrets, or changing the RT desk configuration.
 
Thanks,
 
Bill

Guys,
    We got cable (120 I think) moved from Mike Tully's area to between the 2 real-time guys last night.  it is coiled up and ready for the move of Kate's Turret,  Please verify the cable number and work out the move with Kate, Bill, and Ryan.
 
Thanks
 
Dave
