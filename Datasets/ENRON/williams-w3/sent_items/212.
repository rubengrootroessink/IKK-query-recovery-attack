The compensation issue is still under review by our management.  The T&M rates AMEC has provided for the Pre-NTP PSA are all we have from AMEC at this point.  We do not have the NTP rates worked out for Exhibits yet. The current document is still in draft form and we are considering your wording, however our management is adamant at achieving an all-in rate per hour for the NTP PSA, so we consider this to be an open issue until we see your lump sum price estimate.  I assumed your position is that 60% is "deemed" to be what I refer to as the Variable Rate in the attached document.  Mike

Mike ,as we have discussed several times Amec will perform the work based on trhe rate schedules provided ton date with a lump sum based on the estimated hours times these rates.This does not mean we will provide the profit/overhead /bare wage breakdowns as described herein.We also said we would execute work in overrun at 60% of the scedule rates.This is what was discussed and written into the latest documents we reviewed last Friday.I am available in Toronto for awhile this a.m. at 905-8295400 ext.2489 if we need to discuss again.

In order to further clarify our understanding of how the payment 
mechanism would work in the exhibits of the PSA, I am attaching a 
summary of the preferred method for compensation under the Pre-NTP and 
NTP phases of the PSA's.  In particular, on the NTP Lump Sum price 
determination, we would prefer to see the breakdown of manhours in the 
format previously transmitted (by task by month), and by Engineering 
Discipline.  The Canadian rate structure you provided had about 15 or 
more categories of Engineering Disciplines, and this should be used to 
reflect the all-in hourly rates times the manhours in each category 
which will equate to the estimated Lump Sum price noted in the 
attachment.  

Your organization chart reflects all personnel in Vancouver being 
assigned to the project team, except the Customer Sponsor.  We would not 
expect to have to pay for the sponsor's cost, nor any travel time for 
personnel to/from Atlanta. 

We are getting clarification from LED if the actual driving of the test 
piles will be included in your deliverables or will be done directly by 
LED during the Oct 1-31 period.  Will advise. 

Mike
