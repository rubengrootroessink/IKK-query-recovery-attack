I spoke with Jim Danielson at MWD regarding this cut on 11/26. We did not deliver the 25 mws to MWD. Jim at MWD requested that we "book out" the cut with him at the contract price of the 25 mws. I entered a deal to buy 25 mws from MWD at the contract price ($113.00) deal #882054, and a deal to sell to Calpine to capture LD's ($113.00) deal #882064. I attempted to enter this in the cuts database but got several errors and do not have confidence that this occurred. Please let me know if you have any questions.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

Tag number 38616 was cut for he 06 on sunday.  The schedule was 25mw to the ciso @ mead sinking with MWD.  Calpine couldn't supply the energy so the schedule was cut to zero.  I made every attempt to resupply the power from NEVP, which was willing to sell me the power for $16.00, but Dawn @ the CISO would not let me resupply the schedule.  I thought this to be sort of wierd considering even WAPA was on board.  Please see me with any question.
