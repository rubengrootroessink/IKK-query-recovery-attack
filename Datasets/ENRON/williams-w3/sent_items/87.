Group,

We will have an emergency meeting on Monday, November 26th at 4 PM. We will be going live on EOL for HE 7-22 on Monday. We will be discussing EOL trading, the new confirmation workspace in Enpower, business practice changes, and the Dynegy merger. Please make plans to attend. Contact me as soon as you can if you think you may not be able to make it.

Thanks,
Bill
