Jill,
Ryan Slinger previously had a plan set up. It looks like our AT&T rep switched him back to the group calling plan. Please check with Ryan and he will let you know what he needs.
Thanks,
Bill

Effective October 1st Real Time individuals will be responsible for anything over $55.00 on their AT&T bill.  As of now you all have 200 minutes per month plus free calling within your group all the time.  You are welcome to come look at recent and old bills to see approximately how many minutes you use within a month.    This might help you to choose a plan that might better suit you.  I urge you to do this soon so you are not stuck with a huge bill in October.  If you decide to go against the group calling plan you will have to remember your minutes talking within the Real Time group will be accounted for.  

I'll list some plans that are available.  If you are working at night and are not able to get a hold of me, please e-mail me with your decision and I will take care of it.
