Heather,
We had some double deal-entry last night under the ST-WBOM book.  Consequently I zeroed the following deals out this morning after receiving the DPR and running a BOM SAR.  The deals are as follows: 665907 (buy from imbalance), and 665913 (sell to PowerX).  The extra sale to PowerX provided the excess $10,875 of revenue.  I apologize for our mistake.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Bill
