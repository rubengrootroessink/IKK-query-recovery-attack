Last year when all the original 209 requests were sent in for EPSC, this wa=
s one of the contractors someone needed.  This is to advise you that Gary J=
ohnson WILL NOT provide waivers of subrogation or additional insured clause=
s.  So the bottom line here is that you can still take trucks to him to wor=
k on at his place of business (don't need a contract for that), but you can=
 not, let me repeat, can not have him on our property for any services.

Questions - call me.
