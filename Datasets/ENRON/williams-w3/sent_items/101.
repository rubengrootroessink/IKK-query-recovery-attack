ST-WBOM is importing 20 mws for HE 2 and 3, and 10 mws for HE 4 and 5 at MEAD 230. I have made the Enpower deals (868223, 868224, 868234) to buy from PinWest and sell to the imbalance in SP-15. I have entered the schedule in CAPS and it should be good to go.

ST-WBOM also purchased 10 mws from Redding in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. Chris Mallory brokered this deal.

Thanks
Bill
