 I appreciate the goals and accomplishments, I was looking more for a quick outline of duties. This should work though.
Thanks,

Here's an initial draft of my daily activities and accomplishments. Please let me know if there is anything you'd like me to elaborate upon. I did this fairly quickly, so I may be adding to it on Wednesday.

Thanks,
Kate
