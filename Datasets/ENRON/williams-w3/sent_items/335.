The new column on the services sheet regards energy that we may need to market but that is not prescheduled, usually in the off peak hours...Call with any questions. Home number is 503-274-0502

According to BPA we are almost their on Grays. The only change is that Enron needs to report the total generator output which as indicated on the prescheduled sheet is 6Mw. One Mw is going to Grays Harbor PUD and we have no responsibility other than to report the total generator output.

I've sent to BPA on a prescheduled basis all the prescheduled so that shouldn't be a issue.

The good news is that on Oct. 1 Grays will no longer be our customer and BPA is saying they'll have a automatic system in place to record these numbers automatically by Mid August so hang in there.
