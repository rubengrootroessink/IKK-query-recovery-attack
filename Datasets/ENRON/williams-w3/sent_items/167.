Tim,

Probably 3 to 5 months ago David Poston demonstrated a new position manager=
 to work with both FSP and Enpower. David Poston showed the position manage=
r to me, Cara Semperger, and Phil Platter. Dave suggested that the new posi=
tion manager would replace the current stand-alone position managers in CAP=
S and Enpower. When Dave and I ran through the demonstration, I was told th=
at the East desk had driven most of the development work to date. The funct=
ionality of the position manager in the stage Dave presented to me seemed u=
seful, with little development needed for us to implement it. The position =
manager looked like it would offer several improvements over Real-Time's cu=
rrent position and report reconciliation methods. My impression of the appl=
ication was that it would be a portion of FSP when implemented and was not =
a stand alone application. Within a week after demostrating the new positio=
n manager, Dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would=
 be delayed until after FSP was in production. As a result of the FSP delay=
, I have heard nothing of the position manager and have had no input on it =
since that first meeting. I think this application (as I saw it last) has t=
he potential to improve our reports and reduce our time spent running them.=
 This application should be of benefit to preschedulers, risk and deal cont=
rol. Now that the position manager is back on the table, I would like the r=
eal-time group to be involved in the implementation of this portion of FSP =
and work to improve its ability to act as a report reconciliation tool.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill
