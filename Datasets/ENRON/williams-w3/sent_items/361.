Correction to COI rerate message;see direction of power flow: After the Day

changed from 3675 MW to 2450 MW for HE's 1700 through 2400 for operating day
7/26/01.  The reason for the change is for the Northwest Generation Urgent
pump repairs.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with these
values is HE 1700.  The ISO will update you of any changes in line rating
status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the Hour Ahead
