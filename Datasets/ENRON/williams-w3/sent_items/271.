Virginia,

All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW. Revenue was moved from ST-NW to ST-Whourly for 70/30 split between LP and ST-Whourly.

Annuity to ST-Whourly from ST-NW #531524--$23468.76

Annuity from ST-Whourly to LP #531549--$12597.73

Annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW #531546--$5472--this compensated for original deal sold to LP (take or pay).

ST-Whourly kept the difference between #531524 and #'s 531549, 531546.

All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW.

If you have questions, just let me know.
Thanks,
Bill
