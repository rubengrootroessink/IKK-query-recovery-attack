I think that's what I gave you. I just didn't know what to call it. You can just imagine the subject of my e-mail was "Quick Outline of Duties."

 I appreciate the goals and accomplishments, I was looking more for a quick outline of duties. This should work though.
Thanks,
Bill

Bill -

Here's an initial draft of my daily activities and accomplishments. Please let me know if there is anything you'd like me to elaborate upon. I did this fairly quickly, so I may be adding to it on Wednesday.

Thanks,
Kate
