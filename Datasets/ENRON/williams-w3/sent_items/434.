Group,

Two totally different issues for you.

First:  When scheduling transmission on Portland General Electric from John Day to Malin we MUST use deal #146517, we MUST make the price zero.  We extend this deal in scheduling and change the delivery points.  We then make an annuity to ST-NW for losses.  Easy.

Second: For the third time in two weeks the behavior of the Real-Time Group after 6 PM has been brought up.  We will talk more regarding this in our meeting next week.  It is important to note that we need to remain within the bounds of professional behavior at all times.  Enron has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment (language or behavior that offends or belittles others).

Thanks for your attention.

Bill
