Mr. Kuehn...
I like the BridgePort idea, unsure about the Food idea at ZOOP.  What did you have in mind?  Nate Stanton gave me a call today...we could invite him and folks from work...either way I am cool...also bear in mind that my place has no furniture...
JOY!
B

Billy Williams,
re. Thursday summer solstice,
1.  I can stop by Bridgeport and get two growlers, and pick up some food at
spans.
2.  what time should we start?  I am available ~6:30
3.  should we invite people from work, or keep it "real".  I am impartial.
Later,
Kuehn
