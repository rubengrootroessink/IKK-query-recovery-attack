Enpower Preschedule Workspace and Path Confirmation

Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use. A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail. You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward. You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night. This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, Duke, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, Williams, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp. Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP). These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21. 

NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login. 

Following are a few pointers to help you get started. 

1.	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation. This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under "Tools."
2.	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk. Choose "West" and click "Okay."
3.	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue.
4.	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by. Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls. When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule
5.	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen. Highlight multiple rows by holding the "Control" button and while selecting multiple rows.
6.	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon. A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty. Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute.
7.	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon. A screen called "Cut Information" will come up. Select the "New Path Cut" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.)
8.	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule. This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.

Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in Houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes. These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.)
