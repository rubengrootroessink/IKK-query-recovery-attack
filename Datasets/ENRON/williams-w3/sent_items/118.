Murray,

Thank you for your interest in our group. I will certainly keep you informed of our next available opening. We will likely have some openings in February (it always seems to happen around that time). As you might assume, we are interested in hiring the best person for the job, if you were that person, then we would do our best to facilitate your move. 

Again, thank you for your interest, and if you have further questions just give me a call.

Bill

Hi Bill,

I wanted to let you know that I had a talk with John Zufferli and he is alright with me transferring to your office subject to you hiring me.

I really am excited about this possibility!  As I said on the phone on Wednesday, I would love to come and work for you in Portland.  When I saw the advertisement for the Real Time Specialist on the Enron website I had to call you to see if the position was still available.  Unfortunately it wasn't.

I learned so much when I came down in June to watch your traders.  I speak with them all a lot on the phone and I am continually striving to learn more about the power business south of the border.  In fact, now that there's potential to come work for you, I'm going to work even harder to learn more about west power trading.

Please keep me in mind when the next available real-time position comes up.  I would be happy to come work for you as early as the beginning of the new year.  Do you know when you will be in the market for another trader?  And more importantly, would you be willing to hire a Canadian?  I don't suppose there would be a problem getting a green card considering I would just be transfering offices for the same company.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks a lot Bill, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Murray
