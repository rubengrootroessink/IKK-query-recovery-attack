Just need to know why there will be a BOM charge of $5331.90? My impression is that this was totally trued up...
Is this some weird tranny charge?
Ideas...
As always, if you could go through these charges that would be great, and I like the idea of showing the $96,065.15 this month.
Thanks,
Bill

Bill -

I've asked Fran to include the El Paso true-up annuities in this month's PMA. Please let me know if you'd like to do otherwise.

Thanks,

Kate and Bill:

I have received documents from Settlements indicating the annuities per your 10/10 email (as attached below) have been captured as upcoming prior month adjustments (i.e. pmas).  These are the pmas associated with El Paso clean up for Feb, March, and June 2000 ONLY.   The annuities you entered for Sep and Nov 2000 shall come later but possibly after this month-end (10/31).

The total impact of Feb, March, and June 2000 annuities will be +$108,388.02.  Although they will come through on regular desk analysis for 11/30, since I have received documents from Settlements indicating this $108,388.02 have been captured successfuly, if you like we can take it early, which means taking it on 10/31.  Let me know if you have a preference.

Also, at this moment I am working on all other pma items which you shall expect to go into your P&L this month-end.  As soon as I have them ready I'll send you the details for review.

-Fran
