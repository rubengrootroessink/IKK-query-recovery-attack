Guys,

When you see Four Corners #5 come back tonight. Please use the fundies webs=
ite to send out a message confirming it to Traders and RT. Also, you should=
 give BPA and CERS a call tonight to see if they are selling off cheap powe=
r. Also, we are long 50mws flat at PV (see Kate's email)...The prices are $=
27 and $37. Feel free to sell off up to HE 17 at around 39...if you can get=
 43 bal peak--go for it!!! We sold 50's across the peak at PV tonight. This=
 was a result of the Four Corners 5 derate so prices may fall hard tomorrow=
. Please try to find some information on the status of SouthPoint and the D=
esert Basin unit tonight as well (this used to be Reliant's plant --rumor h=
as it this is now SRP's starting tomorrow). As a bonus, CalPine scheduled o=
ff of SouthPoint for tomorrow while the plant was still down for maitenence=
...If you get cut--sell them the off peak at PV for $75...MAKE THEM WEAR IT=
! As an added bonus don't forget LADWP and CORAL cut us off for "credit rea=
sons"...please treat them as you would any other non-performing counterpart=
y...


Finally, Services has a new deal with a cement company in NP-15. We will li=
quidate the energy for the Services Desk RT at NP-15 +/- $2. We need to mak=
e a buy/sell from imbalance under Services at $0 price. We then make a buy/=
sell from Services under St-Whourly at NP-15 +/- $2. Finally we buy/sell fr=
om/to Counterparty X under the St-Whourly book. Then we need to give Servic=
es the swap deal # and the price. The mw values should be on Kysa's sheet. =
If this procedure works...please send out an email detailing the procedure =
with whatever comments are necessary when this goes physical.

Have fun and good luck.
Thanks,
Bill
