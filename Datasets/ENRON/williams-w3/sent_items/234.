It still is in the master file at 87.92. I will follow-up and make sure that
it is changed to 80.

K:

Clearly there is some weird stuff going on here.  In addition to not
getting the instructions through ADR, it looks to me like we are getting
dispatched for some strange quantities.  My theory is we have reduced
the PMAX on some of these units through formal unit outages, but the ISO
dispatch system does not communicate with the unit outage system.  Can
we check this theory for the dispatch on September 4 for Harbgn_7_units?
Your spreadsheet is showing a dispatch of 7.92 MW.  Our records indicate
that Harbor's PMax is 80 MW as we changed the PMax some time ago.  I
believe the old PMax was approx. 87 and maybe even 87.92.  Can you check
on this?  This might help explain what's going on.

Chris

If you can shed some light on the 82% Decline Count that would be
helpful.
Thanks
