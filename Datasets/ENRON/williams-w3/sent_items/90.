Jim,
We also received congestion revenue for HE 10 through HE 18. HE18-although it shows nothing from the CAISO on their site (their server went down) is the same as HE17-the CAISO specifically relayed this to me on a recorded line.
Thanks,
Bill

Bill, 

I got a hard copy of your inc sheet, and the above is what I calced for yesterday.  When the system comes up,
I'll be sure this is reflected.

Jim

Good afternoon.
We have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 11/13. Please use the inc sheet or CAPS to settle in the morning. The inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule ID's.

Thanks,
Bill
