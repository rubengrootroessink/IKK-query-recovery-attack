Crystal,
Seattle was sweet this weekend. I went and saw Brad at the Breakroom...what did you think of Husky Stadium? Woohoo!
Man, Thursday...whoa...and think, I went out after that...whoa...but it was my birthday...sorry for calling late.
Are you doing anything cool this weekend?  Motorcycle dirt track races are on Saturday night at Portland Speedway...
I am stoked. Plus the first Husky football game is this weekend in Seattle against Michigan!
 
How are other things going? Hopefully well.
 
Later,
Bill
