Ken,
 
Thank you for your inquiry. I will do my best to answer your questions, but would prefer to answer your questions by phone. I feel that this will provide each of us with greater flexibility and likely will give me even more of an opportunity to answer your questions. I will usually be most available after 3 each day. You can reach me at 503-464-3730.
 
Thanks,
Bill

Dear Mr. Williams:

I am contacting you at the suggestion of Hollie Krebs.  I would like to arrange a brief meeting in which I could obtain your expert advice and insight on your company and the industry in which you operate.

I am in the networking phase of searching for a new career opportunity.  Hollie and I discussed some aspects of her career as a marketer of utilities.  She mentioned that, with my background, your industry would be excellent to evaluate.  Hollie spoke very highly of you and your company.  She thought that I would learn a great deal from your expertise.

Please understand that I am not expecting you to know of a job opening nor am I asking you to help me find one.  I believe your guidance will help me to further develop my career strategy.  I am enclosing my resume for you to critique. Please be candid with any advice and/or ideas that you may have.

During the last eleven years, I worked as General Manager of Sunset Office Outfitters and Office Manager of Chemcentral Corporation-Portland.  The president of Sunset recruited me to help turn around his business. My primary responsibilities at Sunset Office were to correct serious personnel and financial problems, create policies and procedures to allow the company to refocus on marketing.  Chemcentral is a large, international chemical distributor.  My duties as Office Manager were to generate and analyze financial statements, manage personnel issues, create and monitor company policies and procedures.  Both companies provided great learning experiences for me.  My combined administrative and sales experience should prove very beneficial in my next position.

I realize your time is very valuable.  You mentioned that you will call me today around 3:00 p.m.  I would like to arrange a brief appointment at a time that is convenient for you.  My questions deal primarily with your education, career path and your opinion on what career(s) I should be pursuing.  I will talk to you soon and thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Ken McClintock
