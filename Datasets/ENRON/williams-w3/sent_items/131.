Darin,
I need you to send emails regarding our disputes to myself and Kate Symes. Please do NOT send emails regarding our disputes to our customers--El Paso or others. Also, my email is bill.williams.iii@enron.com. I appreciate the email, but I had to receive it from our customer. Let's set up a time to meet and run through some things on Sunday or Monday morning. Give me a call on my cell phone on Saturday when you have a chance.

Thanks,
Bill

Hi Kate,

I noticed you were not on the distribution list.

Let me know what you find out.

Kathy

Subject:  HE 19 purchase from SRP


To whom it concerns,

I had a discrepancy with SRP for a purchase in the hour for HE 19.  I
spoke to SRP at 4:55 and again at approximately 5:02 about purchasing
energy for HE 19.  HE 20 was not part of the discussion.  I spoke to
them about the hour we were ramping into and the hour we were in each
time I spoke with them.  I decided to leave the 25mw purchase in and
review the tapes.  I have made a note of this on the model for 10/28/01.
Sorry for the inconvenience.


Thanks,
Darin L. Presto
