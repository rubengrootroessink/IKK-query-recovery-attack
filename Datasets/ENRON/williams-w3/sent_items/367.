Kate,
I think we need to enter the buy from EPE flat to our day ahead sale to STSW.  Otherwise the new deal sheet shows revenue that we did no receive.

We have entered into another lending agreement with El Paso for Tuesday, 7/24. I've entered deals to show this in our system as a purchase from El Paso at $4 (fee for lending - to be changed if we end up actually purchasing from El Paso) and a sale to STSW. This is a 25 mw on peak schedule (tag entered by Lisa Gang) to be delivered at Palo Verde. We need to send 25 mws (zero price) to EPE real-time at PV to fulfil our part of the agreement. Following are the terms of these deals:

697528 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $4
	 (This price represents El Paso's fee for lending)

697536 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $68

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
