Kate,
Bobette from Powerdex will want to speak to you regarding timelines, templates, etc. to set up an hourly index to be published the next day. I gave her your name because of your past experience in deal control. She will likely be calling around 9:30 or 9:45. I am not sure where I am at on this index, your feedback will play a large role in whether we participate in this index. Sorry for the short notice.
 
Bill

Subject: Bill, it's Bobette, with the hourly index template


 
It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 
Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you. 
 
Thanks,
