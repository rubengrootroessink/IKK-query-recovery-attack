Group,
We will be covering for Enron Canada Corp as stated below. All submissions will have to be faxed to the Power Pool as we do not have a working digital certificate. Call me with any questions. Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

We are looking for EPMI West real time to provide coverage for Enron Canada Corp. on Friday, September 21 and Sunday, September 23 from 7 AM to 7 PM (MPT). ECC will be looking for EPMI to dispatch the plant if necessary and to inform the Power Pool of Alberta of a change in availability. ECC will forward the real-time number to Portland and will also provide a cell phone number if you have any questions. 

Let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks in advance,

Bill
