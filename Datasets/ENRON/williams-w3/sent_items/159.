We also received congestion for HE 5--50 mws at $74.83. HE 5 is not in the inc sheet but will be. The CISO is again having difficulties reading our bids. They have been working on this for a week.
Thanks,
Bill

We got awarded cong for hours ending 5,6,7,8,and 23 on the 21st the volumes were 50,100,100,75,and 50 respectively. We priced these MW at the market clearing price or our bid price whatever was higher. HE 5 was cut because the finals were not able the be imported in time due to ISO web site problems, all other hours flowed. The price in the inc sheet for HE 6,7,8,and 23 are $189,$189,$144.95,and $89.
Thanks 
Leaf
