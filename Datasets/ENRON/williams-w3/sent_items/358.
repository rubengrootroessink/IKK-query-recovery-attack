Last time I checked, I was not a gentleman.

Gentlemen,

After discussion with Roger, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.  This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.  They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's). Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time. Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion. 
I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.  If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.

Thanks,
Bill
