Virginia,
I also had a question on a PMA from January.  On TransAlta deal #509285, your notes indicate that mw volumes for HE 23 and HE 24 were reduced by 95 mws each hour.  Enpower and the inc sheet do not reflect this change.  The PMA indicates a charge of $42750 for a reduction in our purchase from Transalta.  Why would we receive a charge for a reduction in purchased energy (ie. less money from us to Transalta)?  There is no indication of a reduction in volume on the other side of the trade (sale to Sempra-Deal#509277). Please come see me when you have a chance.  I think we need to go through this.

Thanks,
Bill
