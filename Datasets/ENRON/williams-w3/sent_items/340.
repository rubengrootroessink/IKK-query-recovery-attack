For Wednesday:

We're short tomorrow on peak at Palo Verde - 25 mw under STWBOM, 25 mw under STSW. Please puchase to fill these schedules; reduce the purchases from EPE to $4 (711216 and 711225); sell back to EPE at $0. You will know you've done this correctly when the CARP report EXACTLY matches the El Paso model. Following are the details of the lending agreement:

711216 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On Peak @ PV
	 25 MW @ $51

711224 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 On Peak @ PV
	 25 MW @ $51

711225 - STSW buys EPE
	 On Peak @ PV
	 25 MW @ $51

Please let me know if you have any questions. I can always be reached on my cell phone - 503-819-2181.

Thanks,
Kate
