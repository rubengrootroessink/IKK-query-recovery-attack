Group,

A quick important reminder. Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW cou=
nterparties have been growing. While I recognize that we have some newer me=
mbers in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the g=
roup to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes. The EPE system =
is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. =
Do not wake up Roger, do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet ne=
ed to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost n=
ever buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2.=
 We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our abili=
ty to lend and to lend at $2. Disputes with counterparties will quickly era=
se this opportunity. Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with reg=
ards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling t=
he CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met. If you ha=
ve questions, please see me. We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at =
the start of September.

Thanks,
Bill
