We have entered into another lending agreement with El Paso for Tuesday, 7/24. I've entered deals to show this in our system as a purchase from El Paso at $4 (fee for lending - to be changed if we end up actually purchasing from El Paso) and a sale to STSW. This is a 25 mw on peak schedule (tag entered by Lisa Gang) to be delivered at Palo Verde. We need to send 25 mws (zero price) to EPE real-time at PV to fulfil our part of the agreement. Following are the terms of these deals:

697528 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $4
	 (This price represents El Paso's fee for lending)

697536 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $68

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
