Darren,
Could you meet with me regarding congestion revenue for 10/05?
We had two wheels that were not in the inc sheet but were awarded by the CAISO and are in finals in CAPS. The wheels were EPMI_CISO_GREEN for HE 17 and HE 18. We were awarded 38.96 mws for HE 17 and 31.92 mws for HE 18. Both wheels were awarded at $54.90.
We should receive revenue of $3891.31 from these wheels.
Please give me a shout with questions.
Thanks,

Bill
