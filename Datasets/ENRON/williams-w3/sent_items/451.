Nikki,

Good afternoon, How are you?  Hope everything worked out in LA.  I don't know if you are still coming up to Portland but I was emailed a picture at work today from opening day at PGE Park (the minor league baseball stadium up here) and figured I'd pass it on.  The picture was taken in the Enron suite at the park, I am the one directly in front of the TV.  The rest of the folks are from the Origination (not Trading) side of Enron, except my boss, who is on the far left of the picture as you look at it.

Portland has been nice the last couple days, though its been raining like crazy.  I went up on my roof last night, the sun was setting and there was a lull between the storm systems moving through.  Beautiful night.  The sun had already gone down below the west hills, but was still reflecting off some of the taller buildings to the east of my place.  There was this slice of deep blue sky extending from the west over my head, and all around were low menacing storm clouds.  A stiff breeze was blowing south to north and smelled of fresh rain.  Amazing.

It should be a nice weekend up here.  In fact, I am taking tomorrow off and getting in a bit of golf.  I am playing an hour north of Portland on a links style course.  If its a clear morning, I should be able to see Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens, and Mt. Adams.  It is an interesting course to play.  Now if I can just get the ball to go in the hole I'll be happy.

Hope the pic makes it to you through our firewall.

B
