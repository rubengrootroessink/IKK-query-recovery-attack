Absolutely,
Please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $55 a month. Let them know they can set up a different plan if they need (I would prefer they stick with the group calling plan and add minutes...but the choice is theirs).  Let's put this in effect by October. I am seeing $20000 ytd as of June in cell phone charges (and $55 x 13 group members x 6 months should equal $4290--have we really spent $16000 on new phones?
Thanks,
Bill

Yeah that's a good idea.  Some of the bills lately have been bigger then others and that is because of purchases of new phones.  The rate you should be paying right now per employee is $49.99 PLUS taxes which usually adds up to be about $53 to $55 a month.  Granted most of your group goes way over that.  I set Mark Guzman up on a plan yesterday that is 1100 min. per month and he will probably be paying about $69 out of his pocket if you want to cap it at $50 bucks.  Do you want me to send an e-mail out to your group to let them know they should come see me about different plans?    I'll give you the latest report by the end of today from your latest bill.  Also to be aware that if I put everyone on a different plan they will NOT have the free group calling.

Jill,

I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs. I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan. Effective in October, I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone. If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month.

Thanks,
Bill
