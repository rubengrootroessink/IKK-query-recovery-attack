Anna,
When you have a chance, I would like to pay you for the golf tournament and grab a receipt from you while I am at it.  My impression is that the deadline is approaching and that this is something we need to get done today.
Please let me know when you might be available or just grab me when you have a chance.

Thanks,

Bill
