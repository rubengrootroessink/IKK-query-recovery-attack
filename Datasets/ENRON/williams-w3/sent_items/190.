John,
Thank you for the letter and for the resume. I will be putting them in front of Julie Kearney in our HR department and will be getting the process started. I am still waiting to see exactly what the needs for my group will be, but should have a better idea in a few days. 
I will be in touch.
 
Bill

Thanks for the visit, and for picking up lunch and the ticket.  Attached you will find a letter to you, and on a following email, I will send my resume.  Very much looking forward to further discussions at your earliest convenience.
