Dear Traders,


We will have our regular bi-weekly Enpower meeting this Wednesday at 1 PM in the CASCADE conference room (unless otherwise notified of a conference room or time change).  Please make plans to be in attendance.

Agenda items:

Update on DPR impact for each trading group

Discussion on establishing dollar threshold levels for each group

Discussion on new ideas for timely dispute resolution 

The meeting should last 15 - 20 minutes. If you will not be there, please let me know in advance who will be in attendance for your group.

Thanks and see you there!
 
Virginia and Mike
