Matt,
I will work on these this afternoon and give you some ideas...
BTW-I heard from Kochel this morning, he is getting married March 2nd in Seattle--did you know his sister was already married to Steve Darue? (poor woman!). The Kelso/Camas game is on Thursday--maybe I will take Friday off...what do you think?
Check your hotmail around 3.
B
