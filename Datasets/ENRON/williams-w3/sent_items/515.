Greg,

Sorry for the delay in getting you my accomplishments.  I filled out the self-evaluation portion of the PRC back in May.  I have attached my responses to the self-evaluation form.
My accomplishments and more long-winded descriptions of what I do are in the attachment, by comparison my near-term goals for the next 6 months are pretty concise.

1. Continue to maximize the abilities of the group, and try to leave nothing on the table.
2. Minimize our settlements and disputes over Enpower mistakes, or other avoidable actions.
3. Continue to provide those in the group opportunities to improve themselves and get where they want to go in Enron.
4. Stay ahead of California with regards to political, legal and credit risk.
5. Work with middle-marketing and services groups to develop new opportunities.
6. Improve my education through SQL training and more advanced Derivatives training to better allow me to understand the fundamentals of the market and the movements of spreads relative to market fundamentals.

I greatly enjoy my current position and look forward to the next 6 months.

If you have any questions just let me know.
Thanks, 
Bill
