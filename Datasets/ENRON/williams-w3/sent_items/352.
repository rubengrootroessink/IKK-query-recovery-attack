Group,

I have discussed our lack of handsets with Dave Steiner.  Dave perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group, however, we should be getting new handsets (two for each turret) early next week.  These handsets will be labeled Real-Time, this should prevent others from switching out our handsets.  If one of these handsets stops working (cuts out or mute doesn't work) please let me know. Dave Steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us, but if a heightened handset consumption continues, we will have to pay for them.  Dave suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets, as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground (apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out). I feel this goes without saying but maybe...

Thanks for your help with this.

Bill
