<<...OLE_Obj...>> The Wholesale Power Marketing Group Invites You To Be Our Guest For The  2001 Fall Energy Fiesta! 

The Wholesale Power Marketing Group cordially extends this invitation to join us Wednesday evening, October 10th through noon Friday, October 12th as a guest at our annual 2001 Fall Energy Fiesta!   This is an occasion to meet all the members of our team, tour our trading floor, explore possible business opportunities and of course, enjoy Albuquerque's historic International Balloon Fiesta!   As our guest, we will provide, at no expense to you, the following:

        

<<...OLE_Obj...>> 
          
          -  Tickets to the Balloon Fiesta 

-  Balloon rides (weather permitting) 
- Ground transportation to and from the airport and throughout your stay 
-       Shared lodging in a Class A Recreational Vehicle on-site at the Fiesta 
-       Meals  
-       Day sight-seeing and shopping trips to Santa Fe or complimentary golf 
-       Fiesta memorabilia 

You will be responsible for your travel to and from Albuquerque. 
I have attached an RSVP form for you to fill out with certain information that is needed prior to your arrival.  Please fill it out and wither email it to me at sstephe@pnm.com < <mailto:sstephe@pnm.com>> or fax it to me at 505/855-6240.

Thanks. 

<<RSVP Form.doc>> 

And........If you decide to go, 

1.  Please email me, call me or fill out the attached form and fax it back to me with your travel information as soon as you know it, so we can arrange times to meet you at the airport. 

2.  In October, Albuquerque can be very cool.  Please bring a light jacket and/or sweater, and some warm clothes, as many of the events we will be hosting are outside.

3.  You will be lodging in a Class a RV on site at the Balloon Fiesta, with one of our other guests.  There will be 3 RV's that we have secured for our guests (6 guests in all), and these RV's will be parked in our own reserved area of the Balloon Fiesta.  This way, there will be no "early rising" to attend balloon events, as some of the start times for ascension events are 5:45AM - 7:00 AM!  And you will be in midst of all of the excitement.  These RV's are top of the line: roomy, comfortable, and well-stocked with all the necessities (snacks, drinks, toiletries, sheets, blankets, towels).

4.  All meals will be hosted by us, either at local restaurants or they will be professionally catered to our area. 

We will also host an outing to Santa Fe; sightseeing and museums, or you can play golf instead (please indicate in your reply if you will be renting clubs or bringing your own).    We would also like to treat you to a balloon ride (weather permitting) if you are so inclined.  Just please note it on the attached sheet.

And last but not least, we would like you to provide us with your sweatshirt size so we can send you home with an official Balloon Fiesta sweatshirt.

I have enclosed a schedule of events for you to know what will be happening here at the Balloon Fiesta while you are here.

All of us at PNM's Wholesale Power Marketing are thrilled that you are coming!  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.
