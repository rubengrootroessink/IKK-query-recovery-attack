Kysers and Mary-

ST-WBOM is long at PV parking with PNM for HE 2 through HE 5, 20 mws each hour--for Friday and Saturday. The price of the power after the parking fee is $15.50. The deal number is 826094. This deal is just hanging out there under W-BOM and should make us 80 mws long at PV on Friday and Saturday. 

Also--we are still short the two BOM pieces in SP-15 for a total of 50 mws each hour on peak-Friday and Saturday- average price of $27.60. You would have the deal numbers on this one.

Sweet.
