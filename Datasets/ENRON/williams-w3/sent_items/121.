Bill -

It has come to my attention that several members of the Real Time group would prefer an outing that involves running, hiding, and shooting balls of paint at each other instead of engaging in polite conversation while cordially sipping cocktails at McMenamin's Edgefield. They do not want time to get to know each other in a civilized setting outside of work. They want to beat the living crap out of each other. I am merely letting you know so I can win a bet for $7,000.
