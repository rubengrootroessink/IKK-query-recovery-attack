In reference to the SI security upgrade can you please provide us a test server
for testing our product Gatewayplus( before the upgrade of the production
server).
This will help us knowing and inplementing changes we need to make in our
product and release it to our customers in time.

Thanks,
--Pankaj

All,
Please be advised that the SI Server Certificates on the primary SI site in
Folsom will expire in about a month.  We are planning to install ISO
issued/trusted Certificates on the Folsom SI servers as we have already done
on the Alhambra server several months ago. We presently use Verasign as the
Third Party Trust.  We would like input from you as to any known issues with
authentication at the Alhambra SI site and any impact you may have seen
after our implementation there.  Please provide feedback to me via e-mail
prior to this Wednesday's TSWG meeting and I will consolidate concerns so
that we may discuss these in that forum.
Best Regards,
