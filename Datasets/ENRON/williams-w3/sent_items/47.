Jason,
Good afternoon. I am contacting you regarding activating a pass to the Employee Store. I did product testing for you in late spring (for soccer). I would like to activate the pass for tomorrow, December 14th, if possible. I recognize this is short notice but if this would be possible please give me a call back at 503-887-3449. I would like to have my parents attend as well. Their names are Bill and Joy Williams. I appreciate your help.

Thanks,

Bill Williams
