Kate,
We need to move you more towards a trading support role and less of a settlements role.  Please take some time over the weekend to consider what might be helpful for the desk (ie. collecting pertinent weather information, transmission derates, day-ahead prices, congestion, historical spreads, etc.) and let me know on Monday or Tuesday what we can do.  Take your time but have a good weekend.

Bill
