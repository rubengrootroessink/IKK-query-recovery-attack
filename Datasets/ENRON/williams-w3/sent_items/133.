FYI -

I have entered the following annuities to reconcile El Paso records and Enpower for 2000. 

847713 - Sale annuity for Dec. '00
847721 - Purchase annuity for Dec. '00
847731 - Purchase annuity for Aug. '00
847783 - Purchase annuity for Aug. '00

All annuities are retroactively scheduled to liquidate on the first hour of the first day of the month they are intended to reconcile. Total impact to the STWHOURLY book will be ($32,218.06). Please let me know if you have any questions.
