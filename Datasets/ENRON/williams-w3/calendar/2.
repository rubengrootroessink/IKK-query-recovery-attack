On Tues and Wed  27-28 Nov 01 CAISO will be having "focus" group meetings on its proposal to begin assessing penalties on uninstructed deviations.

I have already briefed Foster and Williams III on this topic.

Tim Belden was unavailable last week but wants West Desk to be "on" this topic, particularly Mallory and Williams III.

I am out of town on Monday but would nonetheless want to have a meeting with Belden and Mallory on this topic to better focus our position and figure out who will attend the session in Folsom.

Attached is a white paper prepared by CAISO and my list of questions/issues.  If the white paper seems to formidable, there is a briefing chart available on the same topic on CAISO's website (Kit Blair has copies too).

  

Kara, please set up a call in number and get a small room at the above referenced time.
