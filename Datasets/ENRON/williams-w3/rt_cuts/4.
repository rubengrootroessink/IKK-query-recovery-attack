We had an issue with a PSCO schedule at FC 345 for HE 7-8.  Craig sold PSCO=
 50 mw at the 345 bus.  It was not specified which bus it was to be deliver=
ed to.  There was a tag put out and it was made by us and has PSCO listed a=
s the PSE on the transmission from the 345 bus to the 230 bus.  It was deni=
ed so that does not mean much.  I had a lengthy discussion with PSCO on thi=
s around 7:40am on the 17th(turret #149).  You will want to listen to the W=
HOLE conversation since we take several different directions throughout the=
 conversation.  Bert also had a prior discussion with them about 3 minutes =
earlier on turret #143.  Craig should have done the deal between 5am and 5:=
30 am.  I finally got PSCO to take responsibility for the schedule in a sec=
ond discussion at 8:15am.  They are supposed to put in a transmission reque=
st after the fact for HE 7.  They claimed on the last phone call that Craig=
 did not say "until further" and they will not accept responsibility for HE=
 8.  He is supposed to pull tapes and get back to me but of course I have n=
o faith in PSCO and am writing this now since, I'm sure you will hear on th=
e tapes, the guy knows that he is wrong and wants to cover it up and hope s=
ettlements doesn't get after him.

thanks
