This is ok.  I have changed the profile, but Legal and Contracts need to look at it before it goes through.

Wendi/Tom,

Below is customer's email:

Aquila Broadband Services (ABS) is requesting that you please reauthorize
our ability to execute broadband trades with Enron.  We currently have the
ability to view the markets with our user ID, but we would like the access
to transact with Enron from both the bid and offer side.

Please let me know your decision.

Thanks,
Griff
