Good Morning Everyone,

In order to make access easier in connection with the our financial trading forms, Mary Cook has asked that the SWAP FORMS directory be divided into two (2) subdirectories as follows:

		(a) 	Current
					
		(b)	Old 

Therefore, if any of you wishes to access (a) the current forms used, or (b) the old forms now retired from use, just access as follows:

	Current Forms:	O:\Legal\ATTY.FMS\SWAP FORMS\Current

	Old Forms:	O:\Legal\ATTY.FMS\SWAP FORMS\Old



Cordially,
