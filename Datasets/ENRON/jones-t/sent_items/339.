RE:		EFP Filing Deadlines

	Effective immediately, all EFP submission deadlines will return to
their pre-September 11, 2001 standard timing.  For example, the day after
expiration EFP deadlines for the now-expired November 2001 Heating Oil,
Unleaded Gasoline and Propane contracts is 2:00 p.m. today, Thursday,
November 1, 2001.  Generally, all other EFPs must be submitted by the close
of each futures market on a daily basis.

Further, Notices of Intention to Deliver and Accept to be submitted by
clearing members related to the aforementioned November 2001 contracts are
due at the clearinghouse at 3:00 p.m. today.
