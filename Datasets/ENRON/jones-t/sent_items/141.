I spoke to Mark Taylor and we would like Dave removed from this corporation as well.  We can date this revocation effective as of 10/1/01 as well.  We really appreciate your help with these resolutions.  I am circulating the EPMI resolution and will forward it to you as soon as it is fully executed.

David A. Forster was granted agent and AIF status via resolution on 28 Mar 01.  If Tana wants it revoked, she will provide a date of revocation.

Please draft the appropriate document for Teresa's review.

Tana - - I'm on vacation 8 - 13 Oct.  The EPMI consent electing Forster as VP is dated 1 Oct 01.  It's on it way to you.

Thanks to everyone.
