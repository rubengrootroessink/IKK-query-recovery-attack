I cannot approve the referenced counterparty as agent for those three utilities until it comes thru on an overnight spreadsheet for approval from Credit.  I need to give my whole legal team around the world the opportunity to say "yea" or "nay" for legal issues with these counterparties.  So, I am waiting on Credit...
