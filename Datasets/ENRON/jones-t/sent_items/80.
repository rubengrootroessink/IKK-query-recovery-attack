D/MWh

A US Power Spread Transaction (as defined below) with Enron Power Marketing=
, Inc. under which the Seller (the "Spread Seller") and the Buyer (the "Spr=
ead Buyer") shall enter into two physical power transactions, under which e=
ither (A) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to buy from E=
nron, Counterparty shall buy the First Product and sell the Second Product,=
 each in respect of the quantity of Firm (LD) energy equal to the Hourly Qu=
antity at the Contract Price in accordance with the terms of the "Firm (LD)=
" definition in Schedule P of the Edison Electric Institute Master Power Pu=
rchase and Sale Agreement Version 2.1 (modified 4/25/00), including, withou=
t limitation, any defined terms contained therein, notwithstanding anything=
 to the contrary in the master agreement, if any, that governs these Transa=
ctions ("Firm (LD) Energy"); or (B) for the case in which Counterparty subm=
its an offer to sell to Enron, Counterparty shall sell the First Product an=
d buy the Second Product, each in respect of the quantity of Firm (LD) ener=
gy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price.
The transaction is for the applicable hours as set forth herein on each Del=
ivery Day for the Effective Date 01 Oct 2001 to the Termination Date 31 Oct=
 2001.
The Contract Price for the Second Transaction in this short description wil=
l be the midpoint of the bid and offer price(s) on the Website for the seco=
nd product listed in the short description at the time of the Transaction i=
f both the bid and offer prices are then available or the available price i=
f only one of such prices is then available. The Contract Price for the Fir=
st Transaction will be the Contract Price used for the Second Transaction, =
modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the Website.
The Spread Transaction shall mean the ERCOT Transaction together with the E=
RCOT N 2001Transaction.  The Spread Seller and the Spread Buyer agree that =
the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction shall be treated as =
separate transactions under any applicable agreement(s) governing such tran=
sactions.  Accordingly, for example, if a party fails to perform under the =
ERCOT Transaction, the other party is not excused from performance under th=
e ERCOT N 2001 Transaction based on such non-performance.  However, unless =
otherwise expressly defined, the term "transaction" as used on the Website =
shall mean each of the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction. =
 The ERCOT Transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points w=
ithin the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. ("ERCOT") at Seller's=
 daily election. If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertine=
nt ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ER=
COT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined=
 in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.  The ERCOT N 2001 tran=
saction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the North=
 2001 Zone as finalized pursuant to the action on April 17, 2001 by the Ele=
ctric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. ("ERCOT") Board of Directors, at S=
eller's daily election. If such North 2001 Zone is superceded by a zone or =
zones of different boundaries, Seller shall nevertheless be required, unles=
s otherwise agreed by the parties, to deliver the energy to points within t=
he geographical area coextensive with the originally defined North 2001 Zon=
e.  If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT sche=
duling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmiss=
ion Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT=
 Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Con=
tractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hou=
rs (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicab=
le hour for the duration of the Transaction (the "Hourly Quantity').
