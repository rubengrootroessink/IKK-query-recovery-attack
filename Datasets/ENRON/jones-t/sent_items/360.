Tana,

I got your name from Michael Neves who developed the Financial Trading Agreements database.  He said that you can approve access to this database.  If you are not the correct person, do you know who is?

Nekesha Clark has requested access.  Can you tell me what type of access she should have?  Listed below are the various types of access to this database:


Group					Access		Delete Rights		Role
ECT Credit - Core			Editor		No			CreditGroup
ECT Credit - Global			Editor		No			CreditGroup
ECT Legal - Swap - Mgrs		Editor		Yes			LegalGroup
ECT Legal - Swap - Readers		Reader		No			LegalGroup
ECT Legal - Swap - Users		Editor		No			LegalGroup
Legal-Interest Rate and Currency Desk	Reader		No			OtherAgreements

Thank You for Your Help,
Lisa Scully

Hello Michael....

Do you know who can approve access to the Financial Trading Agreements database on ECTHOU_LN1/ECT\Legal\new_swp.nsf?   Nekesha Clark has requested access.

Many Thanks!
Lisa
