I just agreed to the changes on the phone with Bob Klein and am going to finalize the agreement and fax it to him tomorrow and then follow-up with originals.

Tana:

I just talked to Scott Freeman; he said his lawyer Bob Klein sent you a few minor comments a week or so ago.  Have you received these?

If not, please feel free to call Bob at 212-816-3336.

Thanks,

Mike

No, the last note I have is proving the revised NDA for you to send to them.  No word since then.

Mike,

I'll look look into our schedule and follow-up with legal on the NDA.  I
