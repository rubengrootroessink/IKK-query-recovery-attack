Ralph -

I have attached for your final review and approval copies of the NDA - both redlined and clean.  The redlined version incorporates the changes that were last suggested in August and also reflects the item we discussed yesterday.  

If these are acceptable, please advise me accordingly and I will have originals printed, signed by Enron and forwarded to Sabine for completion.

Thanks for your assistance.

Mark

Robyn -

I have reviewed your comments on the NDA between our companies.  I have
attached a revised version which incorporates your changes and reflects
- as redlined - the additional changes I have made.

The language you initially provided for the end of Paragraph 1 (relating
to notice prior to disclosure for legal process) was too restrictive as
it would seem to require that the disclosing party either be able to
obtain some proctective order or waive confidentiality prior to the
receiving party being able to disclose the legally required information.
Since a legal requirement of disclosure is an exception to the
non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions, a waiver of compliance
with the agreement by the disclosing party would not be necessary.

Please review the attached at your convenience.  If these changes are
acceptable, please advise me accordingly and I will arrange to have
final agreements forwarded to your attention for signature by Sabine.

Thanks.
