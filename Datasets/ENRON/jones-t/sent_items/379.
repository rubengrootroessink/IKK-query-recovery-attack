Hi Tana.

Could you please forward Ross or me a NDA for the possible sale of EnronOnline functionality?  The NDA would be similar to the one you did for Louis Dreyfus.

The contact information is:

Mr. Massoud Sedigh
Chief Information Officer
One Allen Center, Suite 2900
500 Dallas Street
Houston, TX 77002

Thank you.

Mike Bridges
