Mark,

GM wants us to look at this new NDA with an Exclusivity clause in it.   I will
look into the business side of agreeing to an Exclusivity clause within the automotive
sector for our proposition.  From your end, what has been the general position on exclusivity.
See agreement attached below.

Talk soon

John
