Anne, Mark Greenberg will not be in the office for the next two days.  Will you have time to look at this?  Thanks!

Mark:

We are investigating the use of Live capital products for application with RAC and Enron Credit and need to get an NDA in place to cover the discussions.  The attached file contains Live Capital's standard doc.  Please review and edit.  I need to get this NDA in place by 9/20.

Thanks for your help.
