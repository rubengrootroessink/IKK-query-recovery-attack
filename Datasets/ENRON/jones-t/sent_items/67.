Michael-

I caught up with Jay Webb regarding what you are looking for.  He indicated that market manager tools that you could had to each CheMatch participant would not be a problem.  I have requested legal to prepare a confidentiality agreement that will then be forwarded to you.  Subsequent to its execution, we can schedule the in-house meeting where we can go through the back-end of the system and how it would work for you.  I am fairly open next week, except Friday.

Michael-

Larry has forwarded your name as the appropriate initial contact.  I
would like to follow up with you about where we could work together.
Larry has had several conversations internally about a year ago, but our
business goals have changed significantly since that time.  I am
available most of the week.  My direct line is (713) 345 - 8913.

I will be out of the office most of next week but would be happy to meet
with you later. Suggest you start by contacting Michael Ereli our VP of
