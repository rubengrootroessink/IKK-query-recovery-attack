Per my conversations earlier this week with Stephanie Sever and Wendi LeBrocq, I have sent down the Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement and the three Password Applications necessary get the following three entities set up to start trading on EnronOnline.  Per my conversation with Stephanie and Wendi, the counterparty would like the counterparty to start trading on EOL by tomorrow.  The three entities are:

1.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agent for and on behalf of Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE)
2.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Ameren Generating Company
3.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Central Illinois Public Services Co. (d/b/a AmerenCIPS)

What if anything do we need to to to ensure that they can start trading by tomorrow.  The counterparty is calling me daily checking on this?  Can you please let me know?
