She needs to get a copy from London, I would suggest contacting Matt Dawson.  We do not have copies of London's masters.

Tana,

Are you familiar with the above?  If so, is it possible to provide soft copies to Jane McBride?

Thanks.
Nony

I need to get a copy of the above because customer wants to do the same form of ISDA docs with Enron Japan for weather trades.  Not sure whether it would have been done out of London or Houston although I suspect the former.  

If it was London, Paul, I wonder if you coudl let me know who to contact for full soft copies of the docs.

Nony, if it was Houston, do you know how I get full soft copies of all the docs (including guarantee).

Thanks to both of you.

Thanks.

Jane

Subject:	ISDA contract wiht Mitsui-Marine 


Dear Jane McBride

I got a call from Mitsui Marine that they want to forego ISDA contract.
They and Enron credit have already had an ISDA agreement.
According to this, the contact was done under the head office guarantee basis.
(I don't know the detail)
If the contract between Enron Japan and them will be made under the same term and condition
It will be great help for both sides.
Their interest for us is only trade of weather derivatives (they don't have a needs of any other commodities). 
Could you show it them under the same term and condition?
Again if it will be all right that this thing will go smooth and quick.

Kaoru Hijikata
