Thank you for your kind words about our country and our people.  The horrific nature of this brutal crime still smolders in the ashes of the World Trade Center and yet the sight of Palestinians dancing in the streets or reading in Saturday's paper the stunning words from the Greeks of all people that we had somehow brought this upon ourselves.  Their country would be marching to the strains of "Heil Hitler" if we had not brought our military and economic might in to save Europe from its despots.

I am proud to be an American...!

I could not agree more.  Every free and democratic country owes an incalculable debt to the US.  I admit I cried more than once on Tuesday, both for the tragedy and for the resulting selfless acts of humanity and sacrifice.  That is the amazing thing for me - from the absolute worst of mankind rose the absolute best of mankind.  I thought about you, and thought how proud you must be of your country, your fellow Americans, and your fellow New Yorkers.  I thought that in attacking New York the terrorists failed to consider New York's dominant characteristics - muticulturalism (50 to 100 Canadians are missing) and grit.  I must also comment that I have been uniquely impressed with the leadership and strength shown by Rudy Gulianni (sp?).  Finally, I couldn't help but think how fortunate the US is to have George Bush et al at the helm compared to the alternative.

Peter.

Subj: Something to lift your spirits
This appeared in a Canadian newspaper is worth sharing

America: The Good Neighbor.
Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a
Canadian television commentator. What follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:

"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most
generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy we lifted out of
the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying
even
the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who
propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. When earthquakes hit distant
cities,
it is the United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 American
communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into
discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about
the decadent, warmongering Americans.

I'd like to see just one of those counties that is gloating over the erosion
of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country
in
the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star,
or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all
International
lines except Russia, fly American Planes? Why does no other land on earth
even consider putting a man or woman on the moon?

You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.

You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.

You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon - not
once, but several times - and safely home again.

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store
window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
and
hounded. Their are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are
breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma an pa at home
to
spend here. When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking
down
through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania
Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old
caboose. Both are still broke.

I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other
people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to
the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during
the San Francisco earthquake.

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired
of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with
their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at
the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is
not
one of those."

"Stand proud, America!"
