I don't have any record or receiving any such assignment and I checked with the other paralegals and they don't have a record of receiving it.  Can you have Mirant resend it to Samantha Boyd, as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now.  Sorry about that!

I did not receive documentation regarding this assignment nor has it been logged in by one of the other Paralegals.

Hi Tana,

A couple of weeks ago I sent up to you (I think it was you) the letter I 
received regarding an assignment between Transcanada and Mirant.  

Joyce Reed from Mirant is looking for an update on the status.  Can you
give her a ring when you have a free second (ha!) - 403 218 1031.  

Thanks,
Diane

PS - Go Levittown!
