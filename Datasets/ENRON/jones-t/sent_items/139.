It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.  Any dealmaker interested in business with them?  If not, I think we should just inactivate them.

This Cp was primarily interest in price discovery and was going to consider whether to pursue EOL access.  I informed them that if they want EOL access, I need documentation re municipal authority.  They never followed up with me.
