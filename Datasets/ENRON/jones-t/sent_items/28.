I saw you across the dining room at Luther's but you left before I got a chance to wish you a Happy New Year's.  I'm sorry you're bring me such cold weather for this week.  I'll have to take your class and you can explain to me how you went from lawyer to weathercaster.

Happy New Years again, and let's hope this year is better than the last!
