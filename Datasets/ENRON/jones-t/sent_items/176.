I got a call from my buddy Mike Mulligan with Paribas in NY last night asking me to see if I can't check with you on the status of the guaranty he is trying to get in place with Enron Metals Limited.  He says he has been trying to get this in place with London for some time.  Is there some particular problem holding up this guaranty?  Is there anthing I can do to faciliate getting this guaranty to Paribas?  Please let me know...
