Subject:	BP Exploration & Oil Inc. Merger Documentation

We have received Articles of Merger from the referenced counterparty evidencing the merger of BP Exploration & Oil Inc. with and into Amoco Oil Company, with the surviving entity being Amoco Oil Company, which shall continue under the name of BP Products North America Inc., such merger being effective 10/11/01.

Copies are being sent to the usual Houston distribution.  I am sending a copy of this email to London Credit and Legal because I understand ECTRIC has done some financial trades with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.

Houston Legal is awaiting Houston Credit's approval of the merger and its impact on our ISDA Master and underlying credit.
