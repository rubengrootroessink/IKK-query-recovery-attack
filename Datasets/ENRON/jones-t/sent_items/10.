Can you please provide me with the clean copies of the licenses Angela is referring to?  If I need to come pick them up to copy them, give me a call and I will do so.  Thanks!

Please distribute the revised index to the above persons and to me.  Thanks.  Also, could you assist me in getting clean copies of the licenses from Laine Borgman.  We redacted the copies she sent and need unredacted forms now.
