Hi everyone:

I've attached the recipes for the May 13th Church Gourmet Dinner.  They are in
Word, but please let me know if you have problems with the attachments.  I can
convert them or fax them to you.  I have made notes on the recipes regarding
the advisability of doubling some of them for a party of more than 8 guests.

At the bottom of this email, you can still review Alicia's original
instructions and comments about the parties (and the guest lists as they stand
now).

My only thoughts about dividing up the recipes among your guests are:

1.  Remind everyone to bring a bottle of wine for the group.

2.  The dessert recipe should perhaps not be given to a single male as it
requires a springform pan (an item I'm guessing is not common to most bachelor
kitchens).

3.  The person(s) to bring the soup should also bring bread.

4.  Remind the people doing the main course to do a mixture of pork & chicken.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Penny
