Tana - Attached is the file of customers who have been approved by Tom Moran 
in credit for Clickpaper.  Please review from a Legal standpoint and let us 
know which ones legal approves.

Camille, Jarrod - The file below is in O:/P&P/Clickpaper/PCG .  I think we 
should save these as we receive them back from all checks.  Also, Tom has 
declined TFS but we should have them set up w/ a Global Counterparty ID.  The 
company already set up in GCP as TFS is actually a Singapore company so I do 
not think it is the same one.  Please fax the registration to Mary Gosnell.  
We can then register TFS in Clickpaper w/ a "guest id".  You will also need 
to update Jarrod's daily registration report that he is preparing for the 
traders and check w/ Bob before sending back a "Reject" letter to these that 
Tom has declined - Bob may want to set up a "guest id" for them.

Let me know if you have questions.
Thanks,
Michelle
