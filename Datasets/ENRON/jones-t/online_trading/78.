Stephanie and Tana:

I have a revision to the profile for Black Hills Corp. -- read-only access 
for West power products (set them up to trade East power now) pending 
negotiation of master agreement.

Spoke with Tim Belden and Mark Fischer from Portland. They said to give Black 
Hills "read-only" access until the EEI is signed. The client is OK with this..

Shari:

I understand from Rhonda that you are working on a Black Hills EEI Master.  
This CP has applied for an EOL password, so this moves this up a notch in 
terms of current priority.

Thanks,

Leslie
