The following CPs are not authorized to trade US power products:

EEX Corporation - restricted by credit
Town of Braintree - trades through Braintree Power and Light
Vastar Resources, Inc. - not a current CP/not FERC approved

**********************

If Town of Braintree calls us about their power access, I'll talk to them -- 
I don't expect any comment, though.
