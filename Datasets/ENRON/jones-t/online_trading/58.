Puget Sound -- open to trade Western power products.  However, this CP is NOT 
authorized to trade Eastern power products.  Thus, disregard the previous 
recommendation to set them up for Enron sales only for the East.

City of Roseville:  Open to trade all US power products pursuant to on-line 
GTCs.

Leslie
