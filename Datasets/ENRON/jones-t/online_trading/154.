The products listed in the two notes below is the current framework for the 
Singapore products that will be offered to our Japanese counterparties along 
with the current products available on EnronOnline.  My understanding from 
Dave Forster is that all of these products will be financial.  As the launch 
for Japan is fast approaching, the review process will need to be completed 
by next week in order to meet this timeline.

In addition to this list, Singapore informed us yesterday that they would 
want to trade the following products (this list was provided by John Thomas, 
Singapore)

Crack Spreads
Sing Gasoil v Dubai crude
Sing Fuel oil v Dubai crude
Sing Naphtha v Dubai crude

Sing Gasoil v Tapis crude

Regrade (similar to crack)
Sing Jet v Sing Gasoil

Differentials
Tapis crude v Dubai crude

also time spreads for Dubai, Tapis, Gasoil, and Fuel Oil... these could be 
second priority to the cracks.

I am will be putting together the product type descriptions for these today.  
I will include you on the distribution list once they have been drafted.
