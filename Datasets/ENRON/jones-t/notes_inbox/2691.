Richard Sage is coordinating the initialing and signing for us which is why I 
included him on the replies.  We will not be meeting with them in person 
tomorrow, but will be discussing the relationship and the documents that we 
will be sending.  They have changed the appropriate contact person so we will 
be determining who the new person should be during the call.

Thanks.

Gillian

I understand that this will be executed in London.  Is there a lawyer who 
will initial the NDA for EnronCredit in connection with our execution?  I'm 
assuming you will have this NDA executed prior to the meeting.

Subject: I2 NDA

Gillian:

Attached please find the I2 NDA as revised to provide that the term of the 
NDA is 3 years and that Confidential Information disclosed under the 
agreement is protected for 2 years after the date of the disclosure.

I can finalize for execution after I2 has approved the contents of this NDA.  
I'll leave it to you to distribute to them.

Leslie
