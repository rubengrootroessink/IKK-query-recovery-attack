Hi Tana

Have a question on EOL which I hope you can help answer.

Chevron USA Inc and Texaco Inc and two companies which I understand have ISDA 
Master Agreements in place with Enron (in fact, I think you negotiated 
them!). I also understand they are signed up for EOL. Would be grateful if 
you could confirm this and advise whether they had negotiated to change any 
terms in the ETA or PA.

Thanks for your help.

Best regards
Matt
