Stephanie -

Below is an NDA for Calpine Corp. requested by Tom Gros - MD for 
CommodityLogic (a Net Works project).

If you have time, would you please print two originals (on letterhead) and 
assist me in getting them to Tom.  If you cannot assist because of other 
commitments, please let me know.

Thanks.
