Tana,

Accounts Payable received a hard copy of your expense report; however, it is 
not submitted in XMS for us to process for payment. Please go back into XMS 
and select the report and click submit to your manager for approval. The 
report not submitted is for $728.58.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,

Vance Bates
