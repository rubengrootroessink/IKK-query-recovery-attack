Hi Tana,

I tend to agree with you, however, that's the verified name in the GCP 
System. Exposure roll-up should be fine, being that it's Ultimate Parent is 
the Government of the United States. If you have proof of a CP Name 
discrepancy, it should be directed to Global SAP (Cheryl Johnson, x3-3101).

Have a Great Day Tana !!

I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the 
Interior.  I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt 
agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think 
more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals 
Management Service.
