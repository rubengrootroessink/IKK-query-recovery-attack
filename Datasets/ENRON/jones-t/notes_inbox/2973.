Samantha,

A Counterparty has traded two deals on EOL in which their Trader was logged 
in as the wrong entity.  Correct Counterparty is TransCanada Energy Financial 
Products Limited.  The entity they traded under (and are not allowed to do 
Financial deals under) is TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc.  Can you 
have someone create an Assignment Agreement to move these to the correct 
entity?  The deal numbers are QF1574.1 (EOL #668266), and QF2534.1 (EOL 
#670690), both traded on December 7, 2000.  Enron entity is Enron Canada Corp.

Thanks,
Joe
