Rami -

I understand your concern; however, it is possible that we will discuss 
matters which are not public and which may not become public in relation to 
the information that will actually appear on your site.  The agreement 
specifically exempts from coverage anything that is within the public domain 
or becomes public.  Therefore, if any portion or all of the information we 
discuss becomes public, Forestweb does not have to be concerned about 
confidentiality requirements.  Otherwise, to the extent there is non-public 
information we provide, Forestweb would continue to have an obligation of 
confidentiality as to that information.

Please let me know if we need to further discuss the NDA.

Mark
Senior Counsel, ENA

Mark,
I reviewed the NDA
Question:
You are going to provide us with certain information. We are going to 
put it on our public website. Consequently it will be viewed by many 
other persons.

How can we agree not to disclose the information?
That is contrary to our fundamental intent.
