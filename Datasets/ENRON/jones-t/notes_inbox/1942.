HI Tana 

Here is the Amendment Agreement containg the additional "online" wording 
agreed for the ECTRIC ISDA  that  Barclays want included in the ENA Isda. I 
hope this is O.K. If you need anything else please call. Will also  enter the 
new ISDA in data base ASAP.

Thanks


Matt Dawson

Subject: Barclays Guarantee and requested Amendment Agreement

 Hi  Justin,

Just to let you know the Guarantee arrived from Houston this morning. I have 
sent it on to Leigh. Also she requested that we amend the other Existing ISDA 
Master Agreement Barclays has with Enron North America, dated 13 Jan 1994 to 
include the Part 5(h) and(o)  wording dealing with  Procedures for entering 
into Transactions(Online and others), and also the Part 6 wording dealing 
with Additional Provisions for Commodity Derivatives Transactions.

I attatch her proposed amendment agreement. The wording of the clauses is 
identical to that which was agreed in the ECTRIC  Master that has just been 
signed, although the numbering of Part 5 (o) differs in the recent Isda with 
ECTRIC. Barclays cannot trade with ENA until the Isda has been amended.  Are 
we able to accommodate the   agreement?
