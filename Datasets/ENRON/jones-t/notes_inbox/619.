Dale

The Credit Derivatives group has requested that they have the additional 
reference entities added to EOL so that they can offer them out as additional 
US Bankruptcy swaps.  Dave Forster has asked that we pass this task over to 
you and your group as these are US products.  All that I can see that needs 
to be done is for each reference entity to be set up as a new index and 
approved by US legal.

Please let me know if you require any further details and if I can be of any 
further assistance
