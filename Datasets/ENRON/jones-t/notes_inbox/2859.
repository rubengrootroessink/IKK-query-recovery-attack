Tana:

Please prepare a bilateral NDA (based upon the Enron Net Works form) between 
EnronCredit.com Limited and Oracle Corporation.  Delete any references re the 
EOL web site from the form and revise the term of the confidentiality 
obligation to 2 years from the date of disclosure of the Confidential 
Information.  Forward the NDA to George Zivic when it is ready to go out.  
George would like to distribute to Oracle today if possible.  He needs an 
executed agreement in place for a Monday meeting.
