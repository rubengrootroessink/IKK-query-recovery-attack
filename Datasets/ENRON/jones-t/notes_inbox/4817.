We would like an NDA for the following counterparty:

Agilon Technologies, Inc.
Attn:  Mr. Paul S. Galant
14180 Dallas Parkway
Dallas, TX  75240
gpreston@agilon.com

Nature of business - Enron Net Works L.L.C. is hoping to have Agilon perform 
Transaction Hub Service functions for EOL.  Agilon has software that would 
fit nicely on top of EOL and help our trading counterparts more easily 
download and create their own trading reports as a result of their 
transacting with EOL.

Please email the NDA to me and you can send the hard copy out directly to Mr 
Galant.

No know legal contact at Agilon yet.

Muchas Gracias Herrin Jones!
