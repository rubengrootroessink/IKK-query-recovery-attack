You sent a confidential envelope to John on Monday, April 17, 2000.  John is 
now working in the Houston Office.  He is temporarily in Boardroom EB 3320.  
I wanted to know if it was all right to forwarding the envelope you sent to 
him with tonight's courier package or can I forward this to someone else in 
the Calgary office.  Rob Milnthorp is the new President and CEO of Enron 
Canada and John McKay is the Trading Director.  Please let me know.

Angela
