I just spoke to Mike Garred and John Raineri w/The New Power Company.  Per 
this conv. it appears that ENA has master agreements in place to trade 
financial and physical gas.  I directed him to Shari Stack, a lawyer in the 
power group, to discuss getting a master agreement in place with EPMI to 
trade physical power.  They are aware that Credit is working on getting them 
some headroom, and as soon as they counterparty comes out of Credit, we'll 
get them approved to trade (pending resolution of physical power approval 
from Shari). 

If Credit could verbally let me know when they are approved I'd appreciate 
it, so I'll know to look for them.  I will be traveling to Calgary Tuesday, 
so I may be incommunicado while the plane's in flight, so that could possibly 
hold things up.

Here I am again ---

The products that the customer desires is:  all types (financial/physical) 
for gas and power.  What do you think?

Thanks,
Griff

Guys,

I received a call from Mike Garred, admin for The New Power Company, wanting 
to confirm that his company is properly set up in EOL ---- everything is fine 
from our end.  What does this customer need to do to get credit?

Thanks,
Griff
