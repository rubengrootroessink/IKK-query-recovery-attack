Attached is a credit worksheet requested by Barry Tycholiz and Howard 
Sangwine with Enron Canada.

Please draft an ISDA agreement.

Howard, a sugestion to help get his deal done; If a 3 to 6 month transaction 
is done, instead of 2 years,  the price movement will not be as great, and 
the counterparty will most likely not have to post an L/C as the exposure 
should fit under the credit line.
