Hi Tana,

Robert McGrory is Manager Regulatory & Legal Services for Enron Australia Pty 
Ltd.  I report to and assist both Rob and David Minns in our small but very 
functional legal department.  Please feel free to introduce yourself to him - 
I will ask him to do likewise.  He returns from annual; leave on Tuesday 12 
December 2000.

If you have any further questions I can assist you with please do not 
hesitate to ask.

Regards,

Alison Keogh
Legal Assistant
