    Tana,

    Thanks for the message.  I have printed and signed the clean version of 
Rev4 of the NDA (attached are redlined
and clean versions of Rev4 - which is the same as Rev3 plus the 
nonsolicitation language to which Mark and I
agreed).  I am going to fax it to you right now.

    My direct fax number is 720.493.6270.

    Thanks again,

    Steve
