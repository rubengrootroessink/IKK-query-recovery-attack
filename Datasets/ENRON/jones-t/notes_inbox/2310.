The product long description below will fall under the new product type US 
East Power Physical Index.  Credit has approved copying the profiles for the 
new product type from the following:

US East Power Phy Fwd Firm

The only difference is the physical forward is based on a fixed price and the 
physical index is based on an index price.

Tana,  when you talk to Leslie, please ask if we will apply the same 
contracts as for the new product type above.

As usual, we need this ASAP.  

Thanks.

Lisa
