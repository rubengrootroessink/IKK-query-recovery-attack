Tana:

I have approved the changes to the revised document at the very bottom of 
this e-mail, with one alteration:  In the new language in Section 10, replace 
"Oracle's" with "a party's".  Since this document is password protected, I 
couldn't change it myself.

Please revise the document as per all of the changes marked in Jane's 
revisions and prepare an execution copy.

Thanks,

Leslie

Hello Leslie,  Please see the revised CDA attached.  I made one change to
Section 10 which is required by Oracle if we are to agree to your arbitration
clause.    Please call me if you would like to discuss this. Thank you!
