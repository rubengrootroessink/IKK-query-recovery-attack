My pleasure and thank you!!!

Do you know the size of your bike, and, a stupid question for you, do you
have to have special shoes for it (clips)?

My guy friend is well!!  We had dinner on Friday and went to a Mardi Gras
party in the Heights on Saturday.  We had a lot of fun, and, I even behaved
myself!!!  It was VERY difficult!!

Let me know a night this week that I could come by and do a test drive.

Thanks again.

Offer still good.  How goes things with the new beau?  Also, thanks for the
cooked meats.  They were delicious!

Morning, Glory,

Hope you are doing well and had a good weekend.

I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still
good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no
big deal.  Promise!

Patti
