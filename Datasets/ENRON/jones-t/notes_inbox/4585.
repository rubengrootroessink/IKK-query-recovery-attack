 We are pleased to inform you that, once again, the Exchange will act as th=
e=20
official sponsor of the Mets/Yankees interleague series, which will be two=
=20
sets of games, with the first  three games being held from Friday, June 15,=
=20
through Sunday, June 17, at Shea Stadium (with the Friday and Sunday games=
=20
being night games and the Saturday game being an afternoon game); and the=
=20
second set of games on Friday, July 6, through Sunday, July 8, (Friday is a=
=20
night game, the other two are afternoon games) this year at Yankee Stadium.

 As part of its sponsorship, the Exchange will once again receive a limited=
=20
number of tickets to the series, which will be made available to members on=
 a=20
first-come, first-served basis for their personal use and may not be resold=
=20
or redistributed.  Most of these tickets are expected to be in the upper de=
ck=20
and outfield.

 Upon notification that the allocation has been made, members are expected =
to=20
pick up their tickets in person on a timely basis, or provide a Federal=20
Express number and address to which the tickets should be sent to their=20
attention and for their signature.  It is the member=01,s responsibility to=
=20
provide a working number at which they can easily be reached or a reliable=
=20
message taken on their behalf.  It is unlikely that more than two attempts=
=20
will be made to reach any individual.  Any tickets that are not picked up o=
n=20
a timely basis shall be redistributed.

 The Exchange will most likely not know until two weeks before each series=
=20
the exact distribution of tickets for each game so, if you would like ticke=
ts=20
to the series, you are encouraged to include your first, second, and third=
=20
choices on the form below and fax it back to (212) 301-4700, e-mail it to=
=20
publications@nymex.com, or drop it off in the corporate communications area=
=20
on the 15th floor.  If you have any questions, please contact Linda=20
Mieszkowski at (212) 299-2777.

 After May 23, all requests made by Exchange staff and clerks will be=20
considered on a  first-come, first-served basis, so we urge all members to=
=20
reserve tickets prior to that date.
