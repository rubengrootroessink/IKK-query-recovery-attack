Larry -

I apologize if the document was not attached.  I did, however, check the 
e-mail to Ed and confirmed it was attached.  Below is the version I 
forwarded.  If there is a problem opening the attached or the attached not 
showing up, please call Tana Jones at 713-853-3399.   She will be able to 
address the problem.

I will be traveling on business for the next couple of days, but will be back 
in the office on Wednesday.

Erol Benjenk, who is the Director of Business Development at GSX, shared with 
me an e-mail regarding the NDA Enron would like us to sign before we have the 
meeting scheduled for April 18.  For some reason, the NDA was not attached; 
and I would like our lawyers to review it.  Could you please send a copy 
directly to me at lschorsch@gsx.com?  I am the CEO of GSX.  Best regards.
