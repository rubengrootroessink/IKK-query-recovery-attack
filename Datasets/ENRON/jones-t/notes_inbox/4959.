Dear Bob

Please find enclosed a few rough additions to the section we discussed a few
days ago.

My amendments are on the 'letter of credit' 4(f)

and access to tape recordings with a third party 4(h)

I am not a lawyer so these will require better legal language but I hope you
can gather my intentions.
I look forward to receiving your comments and suggestions in due course

Unfortunately I am away from the office  Thurs 31st  May and Frid 1st June
but if you need me my mobile phone no is 07979 703477
Kind rgards
Ian
