Stephen -

Since we keep missing each other, I wanted to drop you a note about the 
comments TradeSpark made to the Enron NDA.

As to the comments:

Paragraph 1 - The changes are acceptable.

Paragraph 3 - The rationale for this deletion needs to be provided.  I cannot 
see why this change was made or is necessary.

Paragraph 5 - This deletion is unacceptable to Enron.

When you get a chance, please call me to further discuss Paragraph 3.

Thanks.

Mark
