RE: IRS Gives Exchange Favorable Private Letter Ruling on Demutualization=
=20
Transaction

The Internal Revenue Service yesterday gave the Exchange a favorable privat=
e=20
letter ruling notifying the Exchange that there would be no tax consequence=
s=20
to it or any of its members as a result of its demutualization.

This ruling was the final approval required for the demutualization of the=
=20
Exchange to take effect.  The plan was previously approved by the Securitie=
s=20
and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and a=20
97.5% majority of the Exchange members.

The demutualization plan, which calls for the equity in the Exchange to=20
remain with the seat-owners of its NYMEX Division, will make the Exchange t=
he=20
first in New York to convert from a not-for-profit membership structure to =
a=20
for-profit organization.

Yesterday=01,s approval is the final step in repositioning the Exchange as =
a=20
21st century business enterprise that will create and pursue profitable new=
=20
opportunities, react rapidly and decisively in an increasingly competitive=
=20
marketplace, and explore interest by outside investors. The Exchange expect=
s=20
to announce an effective date for the transaction shortly.

Once the demutualization is effective, the Exchange, a not-for-profit=20
membership corporation under New York law, will be reorganized as a=20
for-profit membership corporation under Delaware law and will be renamed Ne=
w=20
York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.  A new stock-holding company named NYMEX=20
Holdings, Inc., will be formed to own all of the economic interests and mos=
t=20
of the voting control in the for-profit membership corporation.  Each=20
existing NYMEX Division membership will be converted into one share of comm=
on=20
stock in NYMEX Holdings, representing equity in the overall organization, a=
nd=20
one membership in the Exchange representing trading privileges.

The common stock and trading privileges will not be separable until a=20
majority of stockholders vote to permit separate trading of the common stoc=
k=20
and trading rights.
