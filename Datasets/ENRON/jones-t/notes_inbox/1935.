California
For many families, December, with its long break from school, means=20
skiing. What better way to bring the family together for the=20
holidays than with a skiing or snowboarding vacation? California's
Lake Tahoe region offers snow galore and lodgings for every budget.=20

bewildering array of downhill resorts in the Tahoe area.=20

Los Angeles
If escaping the cold is your idea of the perfect holiday getaway,=20
consider sunny Los Angeles--the wonderfully surreal sight of Santa=20
and his reindeer suspended high above Rodeo Drive is worth the=20
price of airfare. Get your shopping done under warm blue skies and=20
forget the cold back home. Celebrate Christmas Southern-California=20
style by viewing the annual Christmas Boat Parade of Lights. And=20
speaking of parades, be sure to stick around to see the annual New=20
Year's Day Tournament of Roses Parade, the colorful kick-off to the=20
Rose Bowl football game.=20

Bahamas
Another fantastic warm-weather getaway destination is the Bahamas.=20
True to its British heritage, you'll find that Christmas and=20
Hanukkah are relatively low-key, non-commercial events on the=20
islands. The big party here starts the day after Christmas, with a=20
unique celebration known as Junkanoo. Parades, music, masks, and=20
costumes are all part of this exuberant week long festival (thought=20
to be derived from slave celebrations in the 1700s). Your family=20
will be sure to enjoy this event, when the islands really=20
cut loose.=20

Washington, D.C.
Our nation's capital, with its historic sights and scores of=20
museums, is a fantastic place to visit any time of year. But it's=20
especially magnificent in December when holiday decorations are out=20
in all their glory. Don't miss the President lighting the national=20
Christmas tree, accompanied by carolers, a nativity scene, and a=20
giant Yule log. Another impressive holiday sight (one you'll have=20
to arrive early for!) is a candle-lit tour of the White House. For=20
three days after Christmas, the President opens up his home for an=20
evening tour of his holiday decorations.=20

***DESTINATION GUIDES***

New York City
Few cities get into the holiday spirit like New York City. Kicking=20
off the season with its classic Thanksgiving parade, the city goes=20
on to host the lighting of the world's largest menorah and the=20
famous Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. And of course the City's=20
Times Square is practically synonymous with New Year's Eve. Stores=20
such FAO Schwarz, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Tiffany's get into the=20
spirit with lavish window and in-store displays--you'd be hard=20
pressed to find a better city for Christmas shopping.=20
http://travelocity1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H2247185751X871307

Jerusalem
An entirely different holiday experience can be found in Jerusalem,=20
a city held sacred by followers of three major religions. Less=20
touristed in December than Bethlehem, Jerusalem maintains an air of=20
dignity and solemnity it's had since King David walked its streets.=20
Home to such holy attractions as the birthplace of John the=20
Baptist, the Via Dolorosa, and the El Aksa Mosque, Jerusalem is a=20
great place to get in touch with the real meaning of the holidays.=20
