Attached is a worksheet amending the collateral thresholds for our ISDA with 
Seneca.  We are also asking for a guaranty in exchange for increasing their 
line, so the guaranty will be new.  These are all the changes we are asking 
for from the counterparty at this time.

We have an extensive amount of exposure to this counterparty and this 
amendment/guaranty is at the top of our list.  The counterparty contact - 
Calvin Friedrich has asked that we e-mail him the draft documents.  His 
e-mail is cfriedrich@senecaresources.com

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

John
