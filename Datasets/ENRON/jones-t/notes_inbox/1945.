Hello all,

Recently, two entities that have executed Master Agreements with ENA merged.  
On July 9, 2000, Falcon Creek Resources, Inc., a Deleware Corporation merged 
with and into Sapient Energy Corp under the name of Sapient Energy Corp., a 
corporation organised and existing under the laws of the state of Delaware.

As we have executed Master Agreements with both entities, we should probably 
assign all of the deals confirmed under one contract to the other contract, 
terminate that other contract, and amend the credit terms of the remaining 
contract.

Termination
Contract we would like to keep: Existing Falcon Creek  Resources, Inc. Master 
Agreement
Contract we would like to terminate: Existing Sapient Energy Corporation 
Master Agreement


Assignment
Deals confirmed under the existing Sapient Energy Corporation contract that 
should be moved to the existing Falcon Creek Resources, Inc. Master Agreement:

NU3667.1
NU3667.2
NB1613.1
NZ7421.2

Amendment
The existing financial covenants of the Falcon Creek contract are acceptable 
as they were originally written.  I believe the only credit change needed 
would be to note that any reference to Falcon Creek should hence be 
recognised as Sapient Energy Corp.  I would appreciate some feedback on this.

Could we prepare a single document that would accomplish all of this or 
should we prepare two.  If we did prepare two documents, one would be an 
assignment/termination agreement and the other would be an amendment letter 
to the existing contract.  Let me know.

Thanks
brant
