Tom -

Attached are revised and clean versions of the Beta Agreement for Coral.  I 
placed a call to Coral to confirm that I have the proper entity listed, but 
have not yet heard from Ms. Reynaud.

Also, in making the revisions, you will note that I have kept the concept of 
the Electronic Agreements.  This has been retained so that it is clear, as 
stated in Paragraph 1 (to which Coral had no objections), that any use of a 
production version of the system will be subject to "Electronic Agreements." 
The BETA does not tie to these documents anymore, which is the point I 
believe Coral had.

Please take a look over the attached.  If you should have any questions or 
need anything further, please let me know.
