Tana-

I see that ENA is a contemplated counterparty for Japanese weather 
derivatives.  There are both legal and tax issues that require 
consideration.  

I am unsure if Susan Musch has had the opportunity to review the tax issues, 
therefore I have copied her on this note.

With regard to Japanese legal issues, there are certain matters that must be 
dealt with in the GTCs, if entering into transactions between ENA and 
Japanese counterparties are being considered, including issues of an 
underlying legitimate business purpose to avoid gambling restrictions etc.

Please inform me with whom I should be in contact to ensure that these issues 
are appropriately handled.

Thanks,

John
