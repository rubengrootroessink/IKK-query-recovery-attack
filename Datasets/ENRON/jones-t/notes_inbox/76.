Tana,
Sheri has asked me to send you the following information in order to prepare 
a termination agreement for the following EOL deal.  On Monday, April 10th, 
the day the transaction occurred, Enron had network issues that caused some 
external connection issues. During this time, the customer accidently hit the 
same product twice . I verified that there was 2 exact transactions by the 
noted counterparty.

 We were not aware that our trader let them out of the second transaction 
until late afternoon or else we would of mandated an OTC transaction to net 
out the second EOL transaction. Please call me with any questions.
Thanks!
Jennifer
