Three things - 1. there is no message in your last email.  Are you in cahoots 
with Peter and just messing with my mind?
2. Ed Sacks advised that they have been trading under the ENA master out of 
Calgary so I think that is probaly the best approach here. 
3. do you have a sample of the language required to be inserted into a 
confirm which would be a fixed/floating swap in Ontario denominated in Cdn $ 
per MWh

Tana - Thank you for your prompt response.  Given that we have precedents 
between Enron and Southern do you think it would be a simple process to get a 
separate ISDA in place between Enron Canada and a Southern entity or do you 
think it would be easier to amend the existing to add the necessary 
provisions, add the provisions into the confirmation, or replace the existing 
with a Multicurrency Agreement?

We have an ISDA Master Agreement (Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction) in 
place with between ENA and Southern Company Energy Marketing L.P.  I am a 
little concerned if Canada wants to trade under this pursuant to the Services 
Agreement.  Being a Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction form, it does not have 
tax and currency provisions that would enable us to do a cross border trade.  
If you would like to do trades under this, we might want to consider amending 
it to add the necessary provisions, adding the provisions into the 
confirmation, or replacing it with a Multicurrency Agreement.

Southern Company or Southern Energy North America, Inc. or another trading 
arm of Southern Company.  The reason I ask is because Southern wants to do 
some deals with us in Ontario and I wanted to know if we have already 
negotiated ISDAs with them.  

thanks
