Tana,
I wanted to check back with you regarding Ken Zito at United Fuels.  There 
should be an LOI in the works for him.  He has called several times looking 
into its status.  Is someone looking into this in your absence?  If so, just 
point me in the right direction and I'll follow up with them.

Thanks,

Dan
