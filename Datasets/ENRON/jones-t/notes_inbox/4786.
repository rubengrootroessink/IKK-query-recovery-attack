Jake -

The Cargill changes are acceptable except for (1) the deletion of the 
non-solicitation provisions and (2) the change back to Minnesota law.  The 
non-solicitation provision is a business call and relates to the disclosures 
being made and individuals involved in the project.  If Cargill will have 
contact with key EOL IT personnel, the non-solicitation should be part of the 
agreement.  As to the change of law, we cannot accept Minnesota and must have 
New York as this is a neutral forum.
