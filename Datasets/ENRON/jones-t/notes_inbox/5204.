John -

In discussing a bit further with our business people the basis for the NDA, I 
understand it is solely in relation to the disclosure of financial 
information to Enron for access to EnronOnline.  Accordingly, I have inserted 
the necessary topic for disclosure, redefined "Project" to be "Discussions" 
and deleted the provisions of Paragraph 19 as to the accuracy and validity of 
the confidential information.  Since Enron will be relying on your financials 
to make a credit based decision, it makes no sense for the language of 
Paragraph 19 to be in the agreement.

Please review the attached.  If acceptable, please have two originals signed 
and forward one via fax to my attention.  We will arrange for 
countersignature.  The originals should also be forwarded for 
countersignature and subsequent distribution for file retention.

Thanks for your continued assistance and patience.

Thanks.

These changes are acceptable.   Once you have the project discription,
please send me a final version and I'll coordinate with Tim Smith in our
Houston offices to get two originals signed.

John -

Following-up on our conversation of Friday, I have attached a copy of your
proposed NDA marked to reflect Enron's comments.  I have left the
description of the "Project" blank for now as I am waiting confirmation
from our business personnel of the exact language they would prefer to use.
In the meantime, please take a look at the attached and let me know your
thoughts.

Thanks.
