I am working them on finalizing some contracts.  I will notify everyone of 
limits when we are ready to approve for credit.

Guys,

I received a call from Mike Garred, admin for The New Power Company, wanting 
to confirm that his company is properly set up in EOL ---- everything is fine 
from our end.  What does this customer need to do to get credit?

Thanks,
Griff
