TrizecHahn Office Properties has notified Enron Net Works that there will be 
a chilled water shutdown for the Allen Center Complex (One Allen Center, Two 
Allen Center and Three Allen Center) this weekend, as well as a power 
shutdown in Two Allen Center.  The chilled water shutdown is required to 
repair a leak in the chilled water distribution system.  Both shutdowns will 
begin at 6:00 PM this Friday, February 23 and end at approximately 6:00 AM 
Saturday morning.

The entire server environment in Three Allen Center will be taken down during 
this time in order to prevent thermal shutdowns of the servers.  There will

Center, Three Allen Center, and all International offices connected to the 
Enron Network via Three Allen Center.  There will also be a total disruption 
of telephone service in Two Allen Center and Three Allen Center.

People in Two Allen Center and Three Allen Center will not be able to log in 
to the network, check e-mail, etc.  Anyone dialing in via VPN to check e-mail
