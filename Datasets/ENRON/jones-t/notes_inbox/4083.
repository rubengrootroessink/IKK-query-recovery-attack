Mark/Tana:

Forwarded is the NDA with Global Crossing, which is agreed for signature.

Tana, could you please prepare and arrange for execution.  Call me if you

Thanks,

Peter,
Attached is an updated version of the Enron/Global Crossing NDA that
identifies the appropriate Global Crossing entity.  It has been cleared for
signature by our in-house counsel.  If Enron is also okay with the NDA,
please accept the changes and fax a signed copy to my attention for
signature by Global Crossing.  My fax number is 310-499-7514.  Feel free to
give me a call with any questions or comments.  I look forward to meeting
with you shortly.
Regards,
Hank
