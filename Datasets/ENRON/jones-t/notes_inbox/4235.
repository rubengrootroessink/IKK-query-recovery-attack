Would you be willing to host 8 persons for Church Gourmet on May 19?  We have 
more participants than we have seats at host houses.  I'd even let you pick 
some of your people if you like!  The theme is Cajun  - Henry has compiled 
and tested the recipes from the Treebeard's Cookbook.

Let me know soon - It would be a great way to show off your new house!

Thanks

Alicia
