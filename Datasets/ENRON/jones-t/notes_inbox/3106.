Sheri,

Trent returned my call today and he is going to email the software needed to 
download to run the system.  We have to call them for every guest id issued.  
The products currently offered are emissions and coal.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Sheri -

Please see the below.  It looks as thought this site will only be used by the 
coal group, but I will confirm this with Wayne.  

We will need to have access in order to view the definitions and confirm the 
agreements.

Thanks for your assistance.
