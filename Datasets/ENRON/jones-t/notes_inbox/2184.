The committee has started working on the first phase of the Technology Plan 
which is to develop an intranet web page for ENA Legal.   Phase I of the plan 
is designed to populate the web page with static information such as 
organization chart, telephone and location numbers, databases, links, etc.  
We would greatly appreciate your help identifying all databases currently 
used by Legal that we can centralize in the web page.  Listed below are only 
a few of the databases I know about.  Please review this list and let me know 
if any of these database should not be centralized in the web page, or if 
your group utilizes other databases not listed below, please provide me with 
the name, location and owner of the database.

The group is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday, October 25, so if you 
could reply to me by Tuesday, October 24 it would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks.
Nony Flores
