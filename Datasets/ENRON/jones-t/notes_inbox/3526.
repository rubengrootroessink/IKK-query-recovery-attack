I need to get a Broker Client LOI for United Fuels

Price: $250 K
Products: US Crude and Products
Term: 1 year

I need this yesterday as I promised and didn't get it to him  ( I owe you big 
time, how about an EnronOnline yo-yo to repay you).  I know you are in Canada 
so can you coordinate with Mark Greenberg.  Please CC Dan Diamond on any 
correspondence with United. Thanks
