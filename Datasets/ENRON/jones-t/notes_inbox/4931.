Miss Tana ---
Is this app almost through Legal?  The customer is anxious to get on board 
--- this has been an extremely difficult process so far.
Thanks, Tana, and have a wonderful holiday weekend.
Griff

Ladies,

What's the status on this registration?  The customer is eager to receive 
transaction status (calls fairly often so I would call that "eager").

Thanks,
Griff
