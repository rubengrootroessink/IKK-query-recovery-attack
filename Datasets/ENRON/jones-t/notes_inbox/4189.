I have just reviewed comments from our counsel, Deborah Lofton. She will be
getting in touch with you today to review our comments and hopefully reach
closure for signature prior to Rex et al meeting with us tomorrow
afternoon.

I've copied Debbie on this email. She can also be reached at her office at
610-341-8129.

Mr. Lang:

Rex Shelby asked that I try to get the confidentiality agreement executed
today, if at all possible.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, and would
rather not pass this off to another attorney in our group if I can avoid
it.  I understand that your legal department has comments to our form; if
you could please send those to my attention, I would appreciate it.
