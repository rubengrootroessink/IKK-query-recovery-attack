Thanks Tana.  
1. Not sure that the tel number you have included for me will work.  It may 
be safer just to use the following, which is my direct line: 011 
81-3-5219-4553.
2. Unless Alan or Mark thinks we need to add John V to the list for Japan so 
that there is someone in the same time zone, it may be simpler just to have 
me down for Japan.  John will no doubt get very busy on his own stuff now and 
probably doesn't want to have any ongoing formal role.

Also, can I have the list again after it has been finalized.

Thanks.
Jane

		 Subject: Online Legal Contacts

In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online 
team, Mark Haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we 
will be providing to the Online team.  Before we send this out, I have been 
asked to send the list to each of you for your input.  Please let me or 
Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we 
need to make to the list.
