Hi tana

We have recently negotiated and signed an Isda with Barclays Bank ,(ECTRIC 
being the Enron Entity) which included some additional clauses in the 
Schedule( regarding Enron online trading) which Barclays want to include in 
the already existing ISDA  between ENA and Barclays. The details and The 
suggested Amendment  Agreement are included below. Please could you take a 
look at this  wording.The clauses are identical to those that we have argeed 
in the latest Isda.

Good to speak to you this afternoon and I will let you know how Edmund is 
doing.

Regards

Matt D

Subject: Barclays Guarantee and requested Amendment Agreement

 Hi  Justin,

Just to let you know the Guarantee arrived from Houston this morning. I have 
sent it on to Leigh. Also she requested that we amend the other Existing ISDA 
Master Agreement Barclays has with Enron North America, dated 13 Jan 1994 to 
include the Part 5(h) and(o)  wording dealing with  Procedures for entering 
into Transactions(Online and others), and also the Part 6 wording dealing 
with Additional Provisions for Commodity Derivatives Transactions.

I attatch her proposed amendment agreement. The wording of the clauses is 
identical to that which was agreed in the ECTRIC  Master that has just been 
signed, although the numbering of Part 5 (o) differs in the recent Isda with 
ECTRIC. Barclays cannot trade with ENA until the Isda has been amended.  Are 
we able to accommodate the   agreement?
