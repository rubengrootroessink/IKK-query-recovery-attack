of Enron Research and will be discussing the importance of Enron Research and 
quantitative modeling.  

This Friday, July 14 at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, Ken Lay returns to eSpeak 
for an Office of the Chairman "open mike" session. 

As always, if you cannot make the event, visit the eSpeak site in advance and 
pre-submit your questions.


Did you know that, since its debut, eMeet has been visited over 2,000 times?  
We know you all have ideas or questions about Enron, and chances are they 
won't be addressed if you keep them to yourselves.  Why not put them in eMeet 
and see what sort of feedback you get?
