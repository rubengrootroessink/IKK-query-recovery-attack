Hello Robert,

Here are the results of the due diligence on our end. If we ever decide to 
start trading on exchange or for physical delivery we will have to review the 
advice again. Ultimately I focussed on the products mentioned (ie the one 
month look alikes tied to the NYBOT and LIFFE). Please note that I have 
included more countries than in our origianl list. All the countries below 
have been approved with the exception of Italy(we are currently in the 
process of obtaining approval for such products from the Italian regulator). 
If you have any further concerns or questions please do not hesitate to 
contact me. Again, apologies for any delay.
