The only US counterparty that I recognize is Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical 
Corporation.  We have only done one deal with them.  The deal has expired and 
the contract we used for this deal was a letter agreement that has also 
expired.

Let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks,
Melissa

Herewith revised approval list.  

Tana will revert with an update on US counterparties some of which will need 
to be switched to read-only.

Thanks,

Edmund
