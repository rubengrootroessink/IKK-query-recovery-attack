These are all Enron Online deals.  Evidently, the Coral traders are logging 
into EOL incorrectly.  We have one other deal that Joe Hunter emailed you 
previously.  I am uncertain whether or not the Coral traders can be prevented 
from logging in as Coral Energy Resources.

Why do we have so many deals from Coral that need to be assigned?
