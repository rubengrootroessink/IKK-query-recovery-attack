Susan, let's do this.  Why don't you print a set of the various certificates 
and let me do a quick review.  Then we can have them moved to the form bank.  
Also, I would like you to work on a form bank index.  Stop by and let's 
discuss how the index should look.  Thanks.  Mary

Shouldn't these forms be placed in the atty.fms bank so all members of the 
swap team can get access to them...
