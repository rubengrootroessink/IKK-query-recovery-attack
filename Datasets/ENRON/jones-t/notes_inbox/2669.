Tana,

Can you help Pat?  If not, let me know and I'll see what I can do from this 
end.  I've checked our records and we don't have an NDA with this 
counterparty.

Thanks!

Marie

Hi Marie-

How are things in Houston??

I need your help again if possible.  I am looking for a copy of an NDA 
between Enron and TIBCO.  TIBCO is a company that provided software to run 
EOL and we are trying to generate some other business development 
opportunities through EBS.  What we are trying to understand is if the NDA is 
global and covers all subs and affiliates.

Let me know if you can dig this up or if I should bother someone else.

Thank you,

Pat
