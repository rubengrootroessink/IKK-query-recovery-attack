Shankman was pushing something with a Citibank sub about 3 months ago.  I 
think we were waiting on information from them.  

Russell/Brant - please call their contact and request credit information on 
the Citibank sub.  Let John Arnold know where we stand after your 
discussion.  Loop in Paul for any credit analysis associated with hedge 
funds.  

Keep me apprised as well.

Bill

Subject: ISDA with Citibank Subsidiary

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.
