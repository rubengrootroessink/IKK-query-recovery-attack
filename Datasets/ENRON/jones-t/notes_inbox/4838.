Tana-

We have a few counterparties that have been in the work queue for a while.  
When you get a chance, would you mind taking a look at the counterparties 
listed below:

Cascades Inc.
Capital Paper Recycling, Inc.
Storm Mountain Publishing Company
Jeffrey Acquisition Group
Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd.
NLK Consultants Inc.
Plateau Forest Products, Inc.
Southwest Paper Stock Inc.

We also need to get together and go through the work queue again for a few 
old counterparties I still see on the list.  Give me a call when you get a 
chance and we can run through that.

Thanks Tana!
