Tana,
Can we please send a new addendum to the Intelligence Press Contract 
extending the exact contract another 6 months.  The current addendum expires 
on April 30, 2001.  The addendum goes to Dexter Steis at 
dexter@intelligencepress.com.  Dexter's phone number is 713-318-8848.

Please let me know if you need further information.

Thank you.
Julie
