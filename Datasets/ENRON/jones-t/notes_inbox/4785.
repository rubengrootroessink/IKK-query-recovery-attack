Bob -

I believe what we sent them was a form document reflecting the changes we 
proposed to Paragraph 4(e) and others in relation to the liability issue for 
the collateral (e.g., when that liability ends).  If APB is comfortable with 
the concept, the idea is to do an amendment document that addresses the 
changes in the applicable paragraphs.

Please confirm acceptance of the changes to the appropriate paragraphs with 
Chris and then I will work on the necessary amendment document.  I do not 
believe it is necessary to sign another agreement.

Bob:

Please find below our comments regarding the modified BETA.  Joe noticed our
proprietary changes were not included, we have added those and submit this
version to you for your approval.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,
Chris

Chris,

The changes are fine. I have not made any changes re Enron's new language. I
like the softened "Broker Verification" language.  However, this new BETA
was modified on their standard BETA and did NOT reflect the additional
changes we negotiated in the BETA we previously signed.  I have added all of
that language which appears in reline form.

Joe

Please review this draft of a Proposed Amendment to the BETA with EOL.  This
is their first attempt to soften the language within the agreement!

Let me know what you think1

Chris,

Here is some language for the amendment I proposed.  Let me know if it
works conceptually and we will incorporate into your document.
