		 Subject: Division/Tradename audit

Attached is a report listing all Master Contracts or 'Executed' contracts 
with the counterparty's provided by Bill Hare classified as either "Division" 
or "Tradename" within the Global Counterparty ("GCP") Database for ENA 
Physical Gas & ENA Financial (those Financial agreements in the Financial - 
North America Global Maintenance Group). Differences in Counterparty names 
(difference between those in the database & what is listed on the contract or 
on appropriated contract duplication) are shown in red. This does not 
necessarily mean that the name is incorrect; the Global Counterparty Group 
may have additional information or documentation supporting the difference 
that has not made it into the contract file.

Bill, can someone from your group review these differences & provide 
documentation where available so that we may complete our contract files?

As I understand it (Bill please verify), according to the business rules 
built into the GCP Database, those counterparties established as a Division 
or Tradename must be linked to a CP record classified as "Headquarter". 
Therefore, these records are included on exposure reports. However, if a 
counterparty name is a Division or Tradename & classified as "New - Needs 
DnB" or potentially misclassified as "Headquarter", then the business rules 
requiring that the record link up to the actual Headquarter entity within the 
GCP Database do not impact the record set-up (Bill, is this a potential 
scenario). Furthermore; these records, because they do not link up to a 
Headquarter & because credit recognizes them as "Division" or "Tradename", 
will not be included in any exposure reports (Debbie, is this correct). Thus, 
this then becomes the potential 'crack' where Enron could have unreported 
exposure issues. As such, is there a list anywhere of known Divisions or 
Tradenames that we could cross-reference against the GCP Database?

Please let me know if additional information is needed on the attached report 
or if there is anything further that I can help with.
Thank you, 
Cyndie




Also, thank you Bridgette Anderson, Anthony Campos, Susan Elledge, Sharon 
Gonzales, and Marlene Hilliard for all of your help in researching these 
agreements.
