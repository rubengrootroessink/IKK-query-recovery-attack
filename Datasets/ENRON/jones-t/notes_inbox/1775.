David:

Attached please find an ETA letter I have prepared for American National 
Power.  There is only revision to the standard terms of the ETA -- I revised 
Section 4.1(a) to make the limitation on consequential damages bilateral 
(excluding ANP's indemnity obligations under Section 4.1(b).

Please let me know if it's okay to prepare a final execution version.

Leslie
