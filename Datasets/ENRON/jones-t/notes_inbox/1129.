I need to hear back from anyone whose group may be trading with this 
counterparty.  Here's my issue.

We have been negotiating an amendment to the Password Application with this 
counterparty.  The absolutely refuse to see a GTC.  I don't know if any of 
you are trading gas, crude or power with them, but if you are, do you have a 
master, or would the counterparty see a GTC.  I'm trying to figure out what 
we have before we talk to them.

Thanks!
