John -

Following-up on our conversation of Friday, I have attached a copy of your 
proposed NDA marked to reflect Enron's comments.  I have left the description 
of the "Project" blank for now as I am waiting confirmation from our business 
personnel of the exact language they would prefer to use.  In the meantime, 
please take a look at the attached and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.
