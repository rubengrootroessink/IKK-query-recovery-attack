Ken

What is Ajilon's full legal name? For instance, Ajilon Technoloigies Company 
or Ajilon Corporation, etc.
The legal name is necessary for this document.

- Thanks

John,

Is there any additional information regarding the NDA name change that would
need to be provided beyond what has already been identified?

Thanks,

Ken

   We may have some confusion here as the company name should be:

   Ajilon LLC
   Attn:  Gary Preston

   I am unable to find any internal reference to a "Paul S. Galant" and
   Agilon
   Technologies is a different company.

   Tana

   We would like an NDA for the following counterparty:

   Agilon Technologies, Inc.
   Attn:  Mr. Paul S. Galant
   14180 Dallas Parkway
   Dallas, TX  75240
   gpreston@agilon.com

   Nature of business - Enron Net Works L.L.C. is hoping to have Agilon
   perform Transaction Hub Service functions for EOL.  Agilon has software
   that would fit nicely on top of EOL and help our trading counterparts
   more
   easily download and create their own trading reports as a result of
   their
   transacting with EOL.

   Please email the NDA to me and you can send the hard copy out directly
   to
   Mr Galant.

   No know legal contact at Agilon yet.

   Muchas Gracias Herrin Jones!

   Johan
