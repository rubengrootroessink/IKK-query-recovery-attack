No I was not.  It was my understanding that Carol wanted to talk to me about 
the contract to verify that she had addressed all of the issues which needed 
to be changed before the Master Physical Gas Contract  would be used for on 
line transactions.  Those issues revolved around PG&E being the sole 
confirming party, and default language being tied to specific Canadian driven 
pricing points.  Carol indicated that she wanted to talk to me but other 
events took priority.

Weren't you working on this issue with Carol before she went on maternity 
leave?

I need to hear back from anyone whose group may be trading with this 
counterparty.  Here's my issue.

We have been negotiating an amendment to the Password Application with this 
counterparty.  The absolutely refuse to see a GTC.  I don't know if any of 
you are trading gas, crude or power with them, but if you are, do you have a 
master, or would the counterparty see a GTC.  I'm trying to figure out what 
we have before we talk to them.

Thanks!
