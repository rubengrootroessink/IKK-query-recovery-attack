Griff, I've updated the profile for both Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to 
reflect a 24-month tenor.  Tana is out so I'm not sure exactly when this will 
go through.

Thanks for your note; I've enjoyed working with you too!  Yes, I'll be 
working as a geologist but also with an element of project management over 
two large offshore field complexes as well as a pseudo-team leader over some 
lesser experienced geologists and geophysicists.  It should be interesting!

Take care.

Walter

I talked to Stephanie Sever yesterday and she said that this was back in your 
court.  When will the US gas and power products get revised from one month to 
24?  I'll be out of the office tomorrow (Friday, the 4th), so let Kathy Moore 
know the status and she'll update the ticket on this customer.

Walter, good luck to you.  Are you going back to the geology area?

Thanks for being such a great person to work with, Walter.
Griff

Griff, we'll go 24 months on both this counterparty as well as on Nevada 
Power.  I'll include this in today's approval spreadsheet.  Thanks!
