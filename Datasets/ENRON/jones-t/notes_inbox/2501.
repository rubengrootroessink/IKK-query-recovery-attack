Hi Anthony,

Can you do me a favour and take a look into this ISDA. The traders in our 
Oslo office have done a weather deal with Koch Energy Trading Inc.  The 
counterparty mentioned they had an ISDA in place with ECTRIC. We are trading 
as ECTRIC.   But maybe the CP was confused and thought it was ECTRIC instead 
of ENA.

The trader here said she plans to do many more future trades with Koch, and 
has been asking if we can amend the ENA ISDA to cover Oslo.

If you can just confirm what you've got, whats covered etc and if possible 
send through a copy and I can liaise with Oslo and our legal dept to get them 
covered.

Thanks

Matthew

Matt,

I spoke to Matthew Dawson, and he said there is an old ISDA out there, with 
an effective & contract date of 23 May 1994 with ECT.
It was apparently negotiated in Houston, and the contact there is Tana Jones.

There is no copy here in London, but Matt said he would ask Tana, if we could 
see one.

Regards
Stephen  (Ext:34716)
