Ann -

Mike asked me to e-mail and confirm our approval of the NDA changes you 
made.  I am in agreement with the last draft forwarded and can agree to 
Delaware law as the controlling law.

Please finalize the agreement at your convenience and forward it to my 
attention or to the attention of Tana Jones.  We will run two originals, have 
them signed and forwarded to your attention for counter-signature by Cargill.

Thanks for your patience and time.  Please call me if you need anything 
further.

Mark
