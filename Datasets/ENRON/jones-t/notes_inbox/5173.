Good morning ,
I can confirm that the documents are acceptable and have signed two copies
that have been posted to Bob for his attention and countersignature.
However ,I did enquire as to whether under Exhibit A , Specified Products It
would be possible to include  'European Coal Products'  on the list. Can
this please be amended ?

I have also faxed copies to both Bob and Mark to cover the situation in the
meantime.
If you could please fax a copy of the document on 020 7827 2987 after your
signature and return my copy in the post ,that would be appreciated.

I believe Natsource LLC NewYork are resolving the issue regarding the LOC's
,but hope that the text of Bob email of yesterday ( contrary to Marks
comments ) still applies and we can start the execution status straight
away.

As far as we are aware the counterparts list has been agreed.

With regard to payment of the fee ,please send an invoice with payment
instructions for my attention and this will be made immediately.

Thank you for you help and assistance,
Kind regards
Ian Goldsmith

Ian -

Attached for Natsource's signing are the final versions of the BETA and Fee
Agreement.  One you have confirmed these are acceptable, please have an
authorized rep. sign two originals of each document, have a copy of  each
agreement faxed to my attention or to Tana Jones (for countersignature by
Enron) and have both sets of originals forwarded to me or Tana Jones for
countersignature by Enron.

I will ensure that one set of originals are returned to your attention.

Also, please be sure to forward the revised letter of credit reflecting
that it stands for both Natsource and Natsource Tullett Europe as we cannot
issue a password or allow access until this agreement is received.
Further, please ensure that payment of the fee is made.  If wiring
instructions are needed, I will be happy to obtain them for you and forward
for your use.

Thanks.  Please let me know if there is anything further that you should
need.
