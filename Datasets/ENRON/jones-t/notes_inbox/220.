Yes, all physical gas deals are defined as "Transactions" under our physical 
master.

So, what is it.  You guys planned to do all the fun stuff the two days before 
I get there?  Thanks, I appreciate that.  Hopefully, I'll be able to get from 
the airport to my place without needing to call you, but I can't guarnatee it!

I am preparing an assignment of two physical gas trades that were incorrectly 
done online with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and ENA and assigning 
them to CIBC World Markets plc and ECC (ECC has a physical master with this 
counterparty, ENA doesn't).  I am adding a statement to the effect that these 
Transactions shall constitute "Transactions" under the ECC Master Agreement 
and want to confirm that "Transactions" is defined as such under your Master 
Agreement.  Can you confirm that for me.  Much thanks!

Too bad you won't be here for the party.  It's always a good one.  Also, 
Sunday is Astroworld day for Enron employees, but you probably won't get here 
early enough to do that either...

Hey, if you run into any problems, my home # is (713) 529-1038.  Don't be shy 
about calling me if you need any help with anything!  I mean it!
