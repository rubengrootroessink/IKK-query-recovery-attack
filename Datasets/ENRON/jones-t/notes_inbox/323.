Tana 

I do not seem to have received the documentation referred to in my e-mail 
below.  I should be grateful if you would e-mail the execution versions both 
to me and Michael Khajeh-Noori so that we can mirror the documentation for 
the purposes of negotiating a new ISDA with Kellogg's UK entity.  
Alternatively, if it is not possible to e-mail them, please fax them to me (+ 
44 20 7783 8171).

If you  have any questions, please let me know.

In the meantime, many thanks for your help.

Regards

Deepak

I am looking for the ISDA Schedule, Paragraph 11 to the Credit Support Annex 
and the Enron and Kellog guarantees.  If at all possible, it would be ideal 
if you could e-mail me the execution versions of these docs.  Alternatively, 
please fax them (my fax no. is +44 20 7783 4539).

Many thanks for your help.

Regards

Deepak

The Kellogg ISDA Agreement has been signed, but it is somewhat long.  Would 
you like me to fax it to you (if so, what is your fax no.?) or would you like 
me to fedex it to you?
