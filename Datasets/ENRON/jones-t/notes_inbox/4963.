>A newly discovered chapter in the Book of Genesis has provided the answer
to
>"Where do pets come from?"
>
>Adam and Eve said, "Lord, when we were in the garden, you walked with us
>every day. Now we do not see you anymore. We are lonesome here and it is
>difficult for us to remember how much you love us."
>
>And God said, "No problem! I will create a companion for you that will be
>with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you, so that
>you will love me even when you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish or
>childish or unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you
>are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourselves."
>
>And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam and Eve.
>And it was a good animal.
>And God was pleased.
>And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and Eve and he wagged his
>tail.
>
>And Adam said, "Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom
>and I cannot think of a name for this new animal."
>
>And God said, "No problem. Because I have created this new animal to be a
>reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own
name,
>and you will call him DOG."
>
>And Dog lived with Adam and Eve and was a companion to them and Loved
>them. And they were comforted.
>And God was pleased.
>And Dog was content and wagged his tail.
>
>After a while, it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said,
>"Lord, Adam and Eve have become filled with pride. They strut and preen
like
>peacocks and they believe they are worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed
>taught them that they are loved, but perhaps too well."
>
>And God said, "No problem! I will create for them a companion who will be
>with them forever and who will see them as they are. The companion will
>remind them of their limitations, so they will know that they are not
always
>worthy of adoration."
>
>And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam and Eve.
>And Cat would not obey them.
>And when Adam and Eve gazed into Cat's eyes, they were reminded that
>they were not the supreme beings.
>And Adam and Eve learned humility.
>And they were greatly improved.
>And God was pleased.
>And Dog was happy.
>And Cat didn't give a darn one way or the other.
