Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered 
in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane 
McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that 
Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. 

Please advise. Thanks.
