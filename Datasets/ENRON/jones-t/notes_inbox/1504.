I would like to clear up a confusing situation with Ameren which is currently 
taking place: 

On 8/29, Ameren Service Company ("ASC") they asked us to take them off EOL, 
apparently because they now want to trade in EOL under the name "Ameren 
Energy Inc. as agent". 

On 8/29, Legal said OK to taking ASC off EOL and said further that AEI's 
approval to trade on EOL was "on-hold" until Legal checked out the agency 
aspect. Despite this - AEI appears to have been trading on EOL since 8/16 and 
the confirmations we have been receiving back have been marked up by them. 
They are trying to change the name on the confirmations to AEI acting as 
agent for various entities.  I instructed Stephanie Sever yesterday to make 
sure that AEI either acting for itself OR acting as agent does not have 
access to EOL. This needs to stay the case until Legal directs otherwise. 

Just so everyone is aware, Leslie Hansen spoke with Ameren several weeks ago 
and told them that they would need to sign a special Consent Form as well as 
a modified ETA before AEI could act as an agent on EOL. The forms were 
emailed to them on 8/22 and to my knowledge, they have not been returned to 
us.  I have left messages for the Ameren's attorney to call me but she has 
not done so yet.  In any case, until they return the requested documents, 
they cannot trade on EOL. 

With regard to Ameren Service Company, today they appear to want to be back 
on EOL. That is fine so long as it is clear that they are doing so under the 
documentation that they signed originally. 

If anyone has questions, please call me on ext. 39477

Thank you,

Shari
