Justin,

We have a norwegian municipality that is interested in trading a CTD option.  
We have the older version of confirmation that we used for the CTD with Rock 
Garden, which is attached below.  We would like to send the CP a copy of our 
template during this week, however was wondering if this is something we 
should revise to match our HDD and AVT 2 page confirm + GTC or update in any 
way.



Please advise.

Thank you
Yumi
