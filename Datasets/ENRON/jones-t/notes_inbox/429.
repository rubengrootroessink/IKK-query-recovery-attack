David,

After our conversation this morning I spoke with Tana regarding Koch 
Hydrocarbon and she still has some unresolved issues that she needs to 
discuss with you before she will approve them.  We have calls coming in from 
our trader, Larry Gagliardi as well as the Koch trader, to find out the 
status of having this counterparty set up for online trading.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465
