Subject: Executing Brokers


	

Dave

We are trying to add executing brokers to MoneyPenny (Thunderball).  I got a 
list from the traders, but need some help with full names.  Some of these are 
OTC and clearing brokers, but we need the full names of their executing 
branch.  They are:

Pariba
O'Conner
United
SCS
Mann
Carr
Arb Oil
Win Futures
Smith Barney
Prudential
Rafferty
OMT
Diamon
Anaconda (sp?)
Trafalgar
Horizon
TAC

If you could fill in the full names ASAP so I can have them added to Global I 
would appreciate it.

Matt
