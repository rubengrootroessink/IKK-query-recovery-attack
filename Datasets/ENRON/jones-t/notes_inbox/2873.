Subject: Amendment request: Irving

This morning I had a conversation with the management of Irving Pulp & Paper, 
Limited.  They have asked us to review the executed Master Agreement, put in 
place for pulp and paper hedging, for possible energy commodity trading.  The 
original contract was assigned to ENA from ECC.  Could someone please prepare 
an amendment per the following request:

currency = USD
MAC = for Irving it should be unilateral
Independant Amount = for Irving it should be $500M.  Also can we include LC: 
IMDC/TOR/S/313954, issued by the Bank of Montreal for $1,080,000, expiring 
Jul 31, 2001 as an additional amount.  This trade was provided as a specific 
term of an individual trade.  I have tried to pull both of the individual 
confirmations outstanding but I have had no luck.  Trade numbers of these 
deals are:  ns1968 and n09878.


Contact and Address Information:

Mark Bettle

300 Union Street

Let me know if I can be of any futher assistance.

thanks
