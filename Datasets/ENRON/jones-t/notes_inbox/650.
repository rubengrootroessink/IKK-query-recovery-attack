I'm thinking he's not interested because he wants double the collateral 
threshold!!

Subject: Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership

I had a conversation with Ed Staub over at Duke today, and he now wants to 
get an agreement in place between Duke and ENA.  I mentioned to him our 
agreement between ENA and ECC that would allow us to trade both entities 
under the same master, and he was not interested in trading in that manner, 
he wants separate agreements in place with both companies, obviously, 
mirroring the terms of the master we are putting in place with ECC, just 
changing it for any cross-border issues.  I told him I would run it by our 
Credit Dept.
