Carol -

Pursuant to our conversation, attached are clean versions of the BETA and Fee 
Agreement for signature by Natsource.  

I have made the following revisions from the documents forwarded on 3/6:

BETA - Paragraph 4(c) - the addition of the words ", which acceptance is 
accessible by the Broker" in the second sentence.

 Paragraph 7(a) - modified to delete the concept of acceptance of the BETA by 
clicking on the appropriate spaces and added the words "Broker's first use of 
the user ID and Password to access the Website"


Fee Agreement  - Cleaned up the wording in the second full paragraph from 
"for" to "form".

Please let me know if there is anything further.  If not, please have 
Natsource sign two originals of each agreement and forward them to me for 
counter-signature by Enron.

Thanks.
