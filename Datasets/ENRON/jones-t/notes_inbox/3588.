Ladies - 
I would like to get a vote on which date would work best for the training 
class in April. We have a conference room where a PC cart would work nicely 
for us. The monitor is a large screen for easy viewing. You might want to 
select 2 dates in case your first choice is taken. 

Which of these dates works best:  April 9, 11, 12, 13 (Mon, Wed - Fri) ?  
 Also, would 11 AM - 1:30 PM be enough time?  Lunch will be provided. 

I have approved all the security forms received so far so you should have 
view access to GCP in plenty of time. Look forward to hearing from you! 

Marilyn
