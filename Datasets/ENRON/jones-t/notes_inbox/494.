Tana,

I am looking at the Enron job site again.? Check out  #0000104141.? Isn't 
this like the one that got us started talking about me  working at Enron?? 
Let me know.? I don't think it is in the same  department, is it??
?
I am disappointed about the event coor. job, but guess it just  wasn't meant 
to be.? Actually, I am feeling pretty yuk about the whole job  thing!!? Have 
any good words of wisdom???
