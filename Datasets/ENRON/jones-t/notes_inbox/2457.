LAW OF CAT MOTION - A cat will move in a straight line, unless?
there is a really good reason to change direction.?

FIRST LAW OF CAT ENERGY CONSERVATION - Cats know that?

room must contain a cat within the earliest possible nanosecond.?

furniture is directly proportional to the cost of the furniture.?
