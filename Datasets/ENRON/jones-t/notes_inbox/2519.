Of course.  Do you two want to be there for the early show or I could just
meet you there later?

Also, you can sign up on the internet for the early bird show.  I don't
think you can pay when you get there, except if you go at 10 a.m.

I'm interested!  Would it be OK to invite one of my new business people
from London, she doesn't know anyone in Houston yet?

Miss Tana,

Are you interested in going to the Nutcracker Market this Saturday morning
and being there for the early bird special (8 a.m.)??  It costs $25 to get
in early, but that covers $10 admission, $5 parking, coffee and
refreshments.  Otherwise, you can go at 10 a.m., pay $10 to get in with the
rest of the crowd and $5 for parking.  I think I am going to plan to be
there around 7:40-7:45.  Let me know if you are interested.

Patti
