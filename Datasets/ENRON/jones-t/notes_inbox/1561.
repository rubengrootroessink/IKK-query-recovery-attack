Enron's preferred provider contract for administrative and office temporary 
labor with Pro Staff expires at the end of the year.  

We are currently reviewing Enron's options in the area of sourcing 
administrative and office temporary labor to provide the best service to 
Enron's user community and capture the greatest value for Enron.  As part of 
the process, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be provided to selected 
vendors in September with a target date for selection in early November.  

The potential outcomes of the RFP process may range from selection of a 
preferred provider through use of an integrator to provide centralized 
reporting, centralized billing, and overall reduced internal administrative 
burden and costs.

Team members representing a cross section of the users of this service will 
provide requirements, evaluate vendor responses and communicate with their 
functional and Business Unit constitituents throughout this process. 

We request your feedback on specific needs or vendors you think should be 
considered in this process to one of the Team members below or Diane Eckels, 
Project Leader by Monday, September 11th.  Your opinions are appreciated!
