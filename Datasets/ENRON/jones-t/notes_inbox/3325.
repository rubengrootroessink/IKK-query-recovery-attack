Griff, we'll open up this CP for financial power products as indicated 
below.  Tenor will be 12 months.  I'll include it on my approval spreadsheet 
for today; thanks!

Yes - That is fine.  Do we need to allocate a certain amount of our EOL line 
to financial products????

I see we have a master with this counterparty that covers all products.  Is 
there any problem in opening this counterparty up for financial power 
products on EOL?  They are currently open for US East and West Power, 
physical only.  Please advise as appropriate; thanks.
