We do - Bilateral.  Very transaction specific to synfuels.  Feel free to look 
at it if you like.  The filing cabinet followed me to 3880b (right across 
from Gerald Nemec's office).

I think it may be possible that we have existing NDAs in place with the 
referenced counterparty.  The nature of our discussions that I am currently 
preparing an NDA for is the possible access to and use of a web-based 
transactions-support system for online and offline commodity trade (including 
derivative products).
