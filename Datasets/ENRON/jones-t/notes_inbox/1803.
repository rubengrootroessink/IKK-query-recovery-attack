I do not show anything in our database to indicate that a master agreement 
has been requested or sent.  The only document I am aware of is the Deemed 
ISDA you sent me below.  If Enron is going to enter into more transactions 
with this counterparty we should determine which office (ENA or Europe) is 
most likely to trade with this counterparty on an ongoing basis and have them 
spearhead the negotiations.  The other office would then mirror the master 
that ultimately gets executed.  Either way, credit would be the starting 
place for having a master prepared.  Please call if you have any questions.

Good morning, it's me again.  I looks like we're doing a deal with Barep for 
Oslo (I believe they do not yet have an ISDA in place with Barep).  Steven Vu 
is needing to know our status with the ISDA.  I know we're done deals with 
them and I have a confirm from a few weeks ago that has that verbage 
(attached), but when I checked in the Financial Agreements log, Barep is not 
on there and I don't want to assume anything.  Can you advise?  Thanks.

Scott:

How are we on getting an ISDA between ENA and BAREP?

I am looking forward to sending to you our draft of ISDA Master Agreement.

Best Regards.
