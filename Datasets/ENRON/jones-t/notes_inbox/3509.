Mark,

Please find the file I spoke of in my voice mail to you. We have 26 
counterparties awaiting approvals for Clickpaper.   

I am hopeful that you can assist us in processing these approvals prior to 
Tana's return next week.

Lyke Corporation dba Ripon Community Printers is a priority as they want to 
buy April product on-line today.  

Thanks very much for any help you can provide.
