Hi Tana-

I initially contacted Marie about locating the NDA we signed with TIBCO.  I 
am not sure when this was done, but it has been a while I'm sure since TIBCO 
provided the software for EOL.  I need to see if the NDA covers all 
subsidiaries and affiliates globally since we are discussing business 
development opportunities in Europe with them.

Let me know if you can assist with locating the TIBCO NDA.

Best Regards,

Pat Cini

Hi, Pat!

It's business as usual over here.  How about you?  Things going okay in 
London?  I may be coming to London after the first of the year to train my 
counterpart over there, once he/she is hired.

I checked our records and I don't see an NDA with TIBCO however, Tana Jones 
could have prepared it since she is the EOL contact.  Unfortunately, she is 
on vacation this week, but I'll check with her assistant and she if she knows 
anything or can direct me to the appropriate person.

Marie

Hi Marie-

How are things in Houston??

I need your help again if possible.  I am looking for a copy of an NDA 
between Enron and TIBCO.  TIBCO is a company that provided software to run 
EOL and we are trying to generate some other business development 
opportunities through EBS.  What we are trying to understand is if the NDA is 
global and covers all subs and affiliates.

Let me know if you can dig this up or if I should bother someone else.

Thank you,

Pat
