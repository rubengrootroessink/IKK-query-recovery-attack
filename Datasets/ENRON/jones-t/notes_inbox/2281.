We have no wholesale power contracts with any on the list.  We have an 
expired one-off with LTV Steel Company, Inc., which must be a sub of the one 
listed.

More steel counterparties to review.  Just let me know if any are power 
counterparties.  This list may duplicate the other list I sent to you.

Attached are some of the new steel counterparties.  I need to give EOL 
responses by Friday for all these counterparties.  In addition, we should 
have more coming through, for a total of about 100-150 new counterparties we 
have to approve by Friday.  I will need your responses, if any, ASAP, as I 
still need to fill in Legal's approvals and return them.  Thanks!
