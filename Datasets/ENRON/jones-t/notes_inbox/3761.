Sharon,
As Canada is now executing these confirms, please get with Tana, or someone 
in her group, for an explanation of your questions.  Your questions all apply 
to standard procedures that the Legal group in Houston handles.  I did, 
though, make a mistake on Cash Collateral, you are correct there is no cash 
collateral in Canada. Please disregard that 'X' for both counterparty's.  In 
regards to the complete name of Slater Steel, as I explain in the comments of 
the worksheet, a previous transaction was executed with a credit annex 
attached to the confirm.  Once again, Tana or someone in legal, can explain 
to you the database they have that would give you all this information.

Thanks,
Russell

Russell, sorry, I should have reviewed the entire credit sheet before 
e-mailing you earlier, but I have a few more questions:

1. What is the complete name of Slater Steel?
2. Who is their guarantor?
3. What does "NW" before the C$188MM under "Guarantor") mean?
4. Cash Collateral??
5. What are the 3rd Party debt threshold amounts (Events of Default) for each 
of Slater's Guarantor and Enron Corp.?
6. Is Enron Corp.'s MAC debt rating BBB-?
7. Why is the Counterparty "X'd" under the MAC if there is a guarantor?

I think that are all of the questions I have for now.  Please advise.

Please note, however, that I will be away from the office next week.  Please 
forward your comments to Linda Sietzema if you don't get them to me by today.

Thanks,
Sharon
