I do not have access to the dbase..is it an option when submitting a SRRS 
request?!

GCP await the hard copy of the executed/under negotiation report to confirm 
master dates.  We also rely on the daily emails from Susan that indicate when 
a new master has been signed.  However, in these two cases, Peggy H in Canada 
is thinking the dates are different from what was originally setup.

Do you have access to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can 
look these dates up?

Tana,

Can you please confirm for me what the financial master agreement dates are 
for Utilicorp United Inc (GCP shows 6-21-00) and Dynegy Canada Inc (GCP shows 
6-16-95)?  

Canada currently has several confirmations that are being held until we can 
resolve what the dates are.


Bernice
