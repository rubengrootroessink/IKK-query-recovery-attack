Well, what do you think?  We hope your elevator rides have been a bit more 
interesting these last few days.

The TV programming you've been watching in the elevators is Enron's latest 
effort to leverage cutting edge technology and present new and interesting 
ways to communicate.  We are committed to improving communications and we 
hope you are finding ETV informative and entertaining.

In the coming weeks, we will continue to add programming including new 
videotape segments, live broadcast TV and electronic announcements.  
Improving communications, though, is a two-way commitment.  We want to know 
what you think about ETV and welcome your suggestions for content.  What 
would you like to see?  Which channels do you want to watch?

If you have comments or suggestions, including questions on how to have 
announcements created for ETV, please send them to ETV@enron.com
