Oh, my gosh!!!!  I was just looking at CNN on the Internet and there was Kofi 
Annan and I think (although I'm not certain) I saw Yao standing right behind 
him!  Have you heard anything about Yao becoming Kofi's right-hand man?  If 
so, I bet this is why he has been too busy to contact his old friends.

Marie,

Obviously, you are not "in the know".  The word on the Enron streets is that 
Yao is brokering the peace in Bosnia, and that is why he is too busy to call 
his old friends!
