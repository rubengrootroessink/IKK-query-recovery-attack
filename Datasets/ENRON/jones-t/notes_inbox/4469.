Hi Tana -

I am trying to get my Lotus Notes accounted installed so that I can read your 
link.  The IT person asked if I could have you look for some information to 
configure my account.  If you could please right click on the DB icon and 
under the tab Basics, copy the following information and forward it to me.  
This would help a lot.  The information I'm looking for is  Server:  and 
Filename:

Thanks!

Angela
