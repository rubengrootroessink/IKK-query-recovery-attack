Tana,

Please see the following: -->(Sara & Jason, you may not be able to view this 
link).  According to Information Risk Management the request was completed.  
I'll look at the group as listed in the Public Name and Address book, but all 
I can do if it is missing is submit another request.

Mike

Mike, I thought you were taking care of this for me.  What happened?

P.S. Does Samantha Boyd has full access to the database also?
