Tana, I'd try again - the commodity that I updated in profile manager was 
Glencore Commodities Limited (92858).  Maybe it just has to refresh in order 
for changes or new entries to be seen.  Please let me know if this still 
isn't what you see in your work queue.  Thanks!

WG

Re: Glencore Commodities Limited (cpy 92858)

The counterparty is my work queue is Glencore Ltd., (cpy26313) not the 
above.  Is this a mistake?
