Hi Tana,

I have nine EOL transactions which Dick Jenkins needs to have termination 
agreements done up on. The terminations arise from mutual agreement after 
some bad prices were traded each way. Please feel free to call me if you have 
any questions, or if there is any additional information you may need. Thanks!
