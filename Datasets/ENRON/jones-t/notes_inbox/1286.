Did you have a great time in Aspen??  I hope you did.

I have about narrowed my "all over the place" down to the townhouse because
of affordability and Sarah's approval.  It is kind of apartmenty, but, who
knows, I may be able to get a life!!!  Don't hold your breath!!  Actually,
it is sounding better and better all of the time.  I kind of get excited
thinking about not having so much to keep up with.  My 'plant life' will
decrease considerably, but how's about me coming to your place sometime to
dig in your dirt??  I will have some things that we could dig up if you are
interested.

Thanks for your encouraging words regarding Enron.  I will continue to think
positively!!!

I just got in from Aspen.  This Sunday looks good for me for Carol's
birthday.  Is Holly going, she might like to...?

In terms of a townhome, I think that would be nice, also Garden Oaks.  It
seems like you are kinda all over the place, though, and you might want to
be careful making "emotional" home buying decisions...

As far as not hearing back from Enron.  I wouldn't think anything of it.
They told me they absolutely wanted me and then I didn't hear back from
them for two months.  Big companies have lots of layers to get anything
done.  Just keep plugging on...

Oh, I forgot to tell you something else:

Carol Gradziel turns 50 today, but on Sunday  evening, August 20, we were
going to do a surprise dinner at Buca di Beppo at  Buffalo Speedway and 59.
I would love for you to come. It will be  the running group, mostly
couples, and me and Carol. Everyone is supposed  to get there at 6:45 and
we (Monnie, Ralph, and I are picking Carol up to be  there by 7. If you
are not busy, try to come. Monnie and Ralph have  run with us, but they
are the realtors that Carol does most of her business with  and I have
known them for about 25 years.
