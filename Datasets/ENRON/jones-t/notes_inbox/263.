Shari,

Attached is an copy of the edited guaranty format that you had worked on a 
few weeks ago and that I discussed with you a few days ago.  If you recall I 
told you that this counterparty had originally given us a physical guaranty 
and you made "a few" changes to include derivative language.  They sent us 
the form back, can you review this a second time to see if you are 
comfortable with it as it is neceesary for a omnibus confirm that is being 
sent out with required credit language.

I have already noticed some errors in thier format, although I can bring your 
original makred up version to you as a guide.

Please let me know when you are available.

Thanks

Russell
