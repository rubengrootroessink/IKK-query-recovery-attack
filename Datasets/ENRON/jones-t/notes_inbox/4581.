Dear: enymexSM user


In a previous e-mail we forwarded for your review an enymexSM registration
information package. This consisted of both the enymexSM System User
Agreement and examples of "click-on screens" that users will view and
complete and agree to when they first log on to the enymexSM system. The
enymexSM System User Agreement must be signed and returned to Robert A.
Dagistino, Director of Customer Service, New York Mercantile Exchange, One
North End Avenue, New York, NY 10282.

In addition to the two documents previously sent, enymexSM trading companies
will be required to fill out a single Registration Form.  This form is now
available on the enymexSM website by clicking on to "How Do I Trade?" -
"Getting Started - Registration for enymexSM". We request that you complete
this registration form and submit it either on line or print out a copy and
fax it to:
(1) the clearing company you intend to use for the clearing of enymexSM
trading  and;
(2) the New York Mercantile Exchange, attention Robert  A. Dagistino at
212-301-4555

Any questions can be answered by contacting Robert A.  Dagistino via email
at rdagistino@nymex.com or via telephone at 212-299-2429, or if you wish you
may contact our Customer Service Call Center toll free at 1-866-enymexx
(369-6399) or email to custcare@nymex.com. Thank you.


Sincerely,
Robert A. Dagistino
Director of Customer Service
