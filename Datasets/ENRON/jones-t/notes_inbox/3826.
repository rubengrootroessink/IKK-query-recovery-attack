Samantha -

Back in February you kindly forwarded to Sylvia Barnes, a redlined Schedule 
to the ISDA Master (2.7.01) you were negotiating with IMC Canada Ltd.  EES is 
moving forward to put an ISDA in place with IMC's U.S. company.  Would you 
please forward the final version of the attachments to the ISDA, in order to 
assist us in preparing one for IMC, U.S.?

I appreciate your assistance, and call me with any questions.  Thanks, Karen
