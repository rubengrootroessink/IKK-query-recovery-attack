Craig -

I have looked over the attached document.  Based upon the draft we provided 
in January, Orbian has made a number of changes which are acceptable to me.  
Only the following present issues:

1.  Paragraphs 3(a), 3(b) and 6 - The original form of this agreement had 5 
years as the time period for protection and return of confidential 
information.  We had proposed 1 year and they have now come back with 3 
years.  The timing under other Enron NDA's is generally 2 years.  
Accordingly, this time period should be suggested for these paragraphs.

2.  Paragraph 3(d) - I had previously deleted the phrase "and each such copy 
shall be marked with the same proprietary notices that appear on the 
originals (if any)."  Orbian now wants to keep this phrase.  Since this 
presents an administrative burden which we do not support now, it makes 
little sense to maintain this with the agreement.  Accordingly, it should be 
deleted.

3.  Paragraph 7 - The added provisions of "and/or their Affiliates" should be 
deleted in two places.  The affiliates of the parties are not third party 
beneficiaries of this Agreement, nor signatories to the agreement.  
Accordingly, any action they may have against Enron would be outside of this 
Agreement.

Otherwise, the agreement looks fine.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

Mark,
Could you please review this Confidentiality Agreement.  Is there any chance 
that you could get it completed by the end of the week?  I will be meeting 
them soon and they need to have this agreement in place.

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Craig

You may also be interested in Orbian.  They are looking for ways to shed the 
risk they are incurring as they iossue something called Orbian credits.  
There may also be partnering sorts of opportunities but the potential 
poretfolio opps may be greater in the short run.  

Stop by if you want a quick review of who they are (from my less than stellar 
memory)
