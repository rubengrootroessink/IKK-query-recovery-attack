Anna, thanks for the fax/letter regarding the below.

I suggest that we request the following changes from GCP:

1) in-activate the account for Salzburger Stadtwerke AG (there are no deals 
booked against this company)

2) re-name Salzburger AG f_r Energiewirtschaft (SAFE) to Salzburg AG f_r 
Energie, Verkehr und Telekommunikation (there is one expired deal booked 
against this company)

Do you agree ?

Thanks !!

Annette
