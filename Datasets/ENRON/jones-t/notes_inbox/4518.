Bridgette:

So long as there is a copy of the notice in the appropriate files then I do 
not need to see it.  I would suggest sending a copy to Tana Jones in the 
financial trading group in the event there is a financial trading master.

Thanks, 

Jeff

Jeff,

I recieved a notification from CMS Field Services, Inc. indicating that 
effective 5/15/01 they will begin recording purchase, sale and derivative 
transactions for natural gas between our companies.  I have sent a copy to 
the fileroom, should I forward a copy to you also?  I spoke with one of the 
Adminative Assistants on the Trading floor and they thought that I should 
contact Legal.  Please advise.

Regards,

Bridgette Anderson
