Is this an incorporated entity? I assume its authority to trade a range of 
products has been checked out? In Australia this assumption can not be made 
for government  entities

Under our licencing requirements we need to make reasonable enquiries that a 
counterparty has (or is guaranted by someone who has) atleast USD6 million in 
assets. Can this assumption be made?

Tauton is ok for all products, except for financial products (it can do 
power).  David, when I talk about this I am never including credit 
derivatives unless Credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that 
this is a credit derivatives counterparty.
