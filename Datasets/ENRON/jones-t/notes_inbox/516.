Tana and Mark:

Susan Trevino is now running the reports for NYMEX limits.
If you have any questions,please contact her.
I will be here through the end of the week but thereafter will be in Portland.
If you have any questions, give me a shout.

Many thanks for your patience the last few months.

Best Regards,
