Tana,

I am currently working on an audit of the Risk Controls Group sanctioned by 
Enron North America.
As a part of this audit, one of my objectives is to become more familiar with 
the NYMEX Limits
set for traders.  Specifically I want to:
 1.   Ensure that the limits are correct
 2.  See appropriate action was taken to satisfy the request of the Trader
  (ie.  If a request was made today to raise the limits, approval from the 
NYMEX 
  should be obtained.
and 3. I'd like to see all the documentation taking place between 
trader-Legal-Nymex.
  -- Does legal call NYMEX, or e-mail them? Please indicate the specific 
documentation involved.

I realize that this is a bit vague, but I just wanted to give a heads up on 
what my basic objectives were.
I was hoping that you could point me in the right direction, or perhaps let 
me know someone in your group
from whom I can get further information.

I certainly appreciate all of your help.
If you have any questions I can be reached at x31684.



Sincerely,

Jack Ehrig
