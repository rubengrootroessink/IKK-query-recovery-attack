Tana - thank you for your messages.  I will advise Jan and Randy that in 
order for Tembec to do gas transactions under this ISDA, they weill need to 
provide us with a board resolution authorizing the same.  Do counterparties'  
typically prepare their own resolutions or do we provide them with a 
precedent?

Thanks
CJG
