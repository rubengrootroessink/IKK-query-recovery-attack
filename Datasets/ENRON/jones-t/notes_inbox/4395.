Hi Tana--

Rex would like to move forward with the Sun NDA using the exact language as 
the recent iPlanet NDA, except with "Sun Microsystems, Inc." instead of 
"iPlanet."

This is because the initial Sun discussions will be only with the business 
development people and there will be no engineers or software developers in 
the room, so the residuals clause is OK as Sun likes it.

For now, this new NDA could take the place of any Sun NDA in progress.

Please let me know if you need any more information before sending this out.

Thanks,
Mark P.
