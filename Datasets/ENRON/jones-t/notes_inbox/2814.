Rahil:

Attached is an electronic version of the final FT Energy Agreement.  As we 
discussed, I will send down two hard-copies initialed by me and ready for 
execution.  I'll leave it to you to send out the executed agreements (with 
the Exhibits) to FT Energy.  Instruct them to execute both copies and return 
one originally executed copy to you.  When you have a final executed 
agreement , please send me a COPY.


Thanks,

Leslie

Leslie,

Please give me a call when you read through the revised version of the 
document we sent them.  Ideally, we should be able to get all the issues 
ironed out today and send on a signed copy to them by tomorrow AM, if 
possible.

Thanks in advance,
Rahil

Rahil,

Attached is a revised copy of the contract you sent. As you'll see, the
changes are relatively minor. If the contract is OK with you as is, print
and sign it, and send us a copy and we'll move on this for the gas indexes.
I would suggest a start date of Monday Dec. 13 and an extension of the
termination to Feb. 15, 2001. If you have questions, give me a call.

Any progress on the power side?
