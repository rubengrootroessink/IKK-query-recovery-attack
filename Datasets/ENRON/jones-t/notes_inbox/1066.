Hi Tana,

I was checking to see if the confidentiality agreement has been sent out. 
Also I needed to clarify the process on this. When we say we are sending them 
a draft is it a copy that can be signed by them if they are agreeable to the 
language. If it is not we need to send them something that they can sign if 
they agree with the language. It needs to go out within the next day or so. I 
guess they need faster than I thought. Also the name of the person it needs 
to be sent to is Jack Cogen not Jack Hogan. Thanks a lot for all your help.

Savita
