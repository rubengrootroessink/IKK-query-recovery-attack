Susan/Tana,

We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering 
the trade was ENA and the entity entering the trade was EPMI Long Term Hedge 
(Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI 
Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since 
this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is 
just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or 
ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect.

Thanks,
Joe
