Hi Marc,

Tana Jones from our legal department  just called me and said that before I 
sent Wesley Fredricks information over to her, Andrew O Connor returned her 
phone call and is now expecting the document from us. You may receive an 
email from her to try to sort this out. Thanks a lot.

Savita
