Dear Tana,
?
Raquel wrote that her?resume attachment did not make  it to Alicia but that 
she had sent it again last night. Would you mind letting  her know if you did 
not get the info? Her address is raquel@po.utexas.edu.
?
Still hoping to see your house today while it's empty.  
?
Hope all goes well with the plbg. problem. 
?
Caroline is living in our house while we are gone. You're  welcome to come 
swim. The house should be all locked up but w/o  alarm.
?
See you after June 20 if not today.
?
Dorry
