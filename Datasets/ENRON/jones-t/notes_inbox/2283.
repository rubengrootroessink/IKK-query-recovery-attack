Subject: Re: NDA agreement

Per our conversation, my name is Tana Jones and I am a paralegal here in 
Houston Legal.  I am your first point of contact when you need to get an NDA 
out to a counterparty.  I work with Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group.  
She will negotiate any comments to the NDA's or review forms of NDA's 
provided by counterparties.  We can also assist you with other types of 
contracts you might need.  My # is x33399 and Leslie's is x36121.

To draft an NDA I will need the following information:

1.  What form of NDA do you want.  We have 2 forms, one where only Enron is 
providing confidential information, and a bilateral agreement where both 
parties are providing confidential information.  If we have a situation where 
we truly are the only one providing confidential information we prefer to use 
the one-way form, it is drafted much more in our favor.
2.  What is the project or nature of your business with the cusomer?
3.  The counterparty's full legal name.
4.  Counterparty's address.
5.  Contact name at the counterparty.
6.  How you would like the NDA sent to the counterparty.  If you would like 
to to fax it, please provide the fax and phone number.  If you would like me 
to email the agreement, I'll need an email address.  If you would like to 
send it yourself, I will forward it to you.
7.  If you have a deadline for execution, please let us know.

I look forward to working with you!

Hello Tana - please could you help Bruce out or point him in the right 
direction - I just spoke with him and the agreement would need to be under 
Texan law, so our standard form is not suitable.

Many thanks

Michael

Michael,

I work in EnronCredit in Houston.  Adam Tyrell suggested I contact you about 
getting a template non-disclosure agreement to send to a client (at their 
request).  Could you please send me something today if we have a standard 
form? 

Thanks,  Bruce
