I am in London right now and have been visiting with Debbie Nicholls (who is 
responsible for Documentation for EGM - financial transactions in  London) 
and would like to give her an example of the memo the legal department sends 
out that list the executed master agreements and I would also like to show 
her an example of the notification the legal department sends out when a new 
master is signed.  Is there a problem in doing this since she is not with ENA 
but with EGM here in the London office.  They document their trades under the 
legal entity Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. Acting by 
It's Agent Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited.

Thanks,
Jeff
