On the ISDA replacement front, just a reminder that we want to put Morgan 
Stanley Capital Group at the forefront, we have an old Energy Price Swap 
Agreement in place with them, and then there's always our favorite, the old 
AIG "Master Master", now with Sempra, that raises a whole host of other 
issues...you were going to talk to Bill about that one...

Do you want me to put them on the list for the Legal/Credit meeting as a 
reminder?
