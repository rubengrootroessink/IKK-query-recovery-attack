Attached please find a revised Confidentiality Agreement that should reflect 
the substance of our conversation this morning.  Please note that this 
red-line compares the last version I sent you against my revised version 
(which incorporates those of your proposed revisions that I noted were okay 
with us.)  As I mentioned, I will need to fax a copy of the NDA to London for 
execution, so we would like to resolve all outstanding issues today to ensure 
that we have an NDA in place for Wednesday's meetings.

Please call me at your earliest convenience with any additional comments or 
concerns.  If the agreement as revised is satisfactory, I will finalize and 
have it executed by EnronCredit and then fax to you as per your instructions 
for execution.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen
