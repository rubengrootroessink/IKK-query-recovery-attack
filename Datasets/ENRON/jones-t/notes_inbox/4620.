Dana -

Thanks for your comments.  As to the name, that is taken care of.  As to 
Paragraph 2, I believe the language merely requires that the fact that 
disclosure of the Confidential Information (CI) has been made, that a review 
of the CI is underway or that discussions between the parties are underway 
(including the status of these discussions) are the only things prohibited by 
this provision.  It does not say that the existence of the agreement cannot 
be disclosed.  If there is any particular part that you find objectionable, 
let's talk about it as this is a provision that is fairly standard for Enron 
and carries some importance.

  This agreement should be in the name of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
Company.

We want to strike item #2.  The language provides that we will not disclose
the "existence" of the confidentiality agreement.  Normally, we only agree
not to disclose the confidential information.

If these changes are acceptable, we will be ready to arrange a meeting.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me.

At the request of Stephen Abbanat, I am attaching our proposed form of
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   We would appreciate it if you could please
verify whether "CMS Energy-Panhandle Pipe Line Companies" is the correct
legal name of your company.  If you have any comments or questions, please

vacation the rest of this week.
