Ms. Jones,
?
Job ID#0000103522, here I come!!!
?
I just sent IT via e-mail to Gretchen Jennings.? Wish me  luck.? 
?
The more I read the job functions and requirements, the more I  like it.? It 
is so much of what I have been doing, but I would have more  CONTROL..? Might 
even get a little respect!!!
?
I am THE one, oh, yeah, I AM THE ONE!!!!!
?
Thanks again for helping me.? I will continue to check  the website.? I did 
see another one, #103640, that is a possibility, and  #103659.? Did you ever 
hear anything from the people that you sent my  resume to the first time 
around?? I will be glad to get their phone numbers  and start calling...
?
