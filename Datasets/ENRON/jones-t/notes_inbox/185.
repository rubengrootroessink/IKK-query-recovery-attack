Your life has become very confusing with this whole house purchase issue!  
Dorry said you had put a contract on a new house on Banks and were excited!

Will you still be in your old house on May 13?  I'm not sure I can find a 
substitute host at this point - but if you are really desparate, I'll try.

Andrea Preisinger/Burton is a good bet to loan you a grill.  Ask her when you 
call.

Good luck with your house.  Henry and I might start moving this weekend!
