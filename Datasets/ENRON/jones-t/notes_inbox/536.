hello all,

We have been asked by this customer to review certain credit language 
included within three confirmations for accuracy and possible amendment.  I 
have reviewed the terms and they are not exactly consistant perhaps with what 
was agreed to in principle.  Therefore, I am requesting three new 
confirmations be executed that effectively replace the original confirmations 
and send them to the customer.  Let me know if I can explain further.

TAG ND4986.1

Please amend the independant amount figure to specify $216,000 instead of 
$220,000.


TAG NE0432.1

Please insert independant amount language into the confirm.  The independant 
dollar amount should specify $8,500.


TAG NE4771.1

Please amend the independant amount figure to specify $39,000 instead of 
$47,500.

Thanks
Brant
