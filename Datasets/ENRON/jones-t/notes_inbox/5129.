Anne,

Per our last conversation, we confirm approval of the NDA changes that were 
made.  As well, we can agree to Delaware law as the controlling law.  Please 
run two originals, have them signed and forwarded to Mark Greenberg's 
attention.

Thank you for your patience and time.  Please call me directly with any 
questions.

Mike Bridges
