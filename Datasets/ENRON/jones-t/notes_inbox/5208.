Descriptions

Per our earlier discussions, I am attaching the language we would like added 
to the definition of Index in the long descriptions for all US physical and 
financial pulp, paper and lumber products.  If you have any questions, please 
give Mark or me a call.

 << File: Pulp, Paper, Lumber - Corrections to Published Prices.doc >> 

Justin, as an FYI, is this something you might want to add to your European 
products as well?
