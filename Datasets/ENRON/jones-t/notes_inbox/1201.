Tana,

It looks like there are changes on this against the online ETA which are not 
redlined. Do you have any other information about these changes? (I'd like to 
avoid having to do a line-by-line comparison.

Thanks,

Dave

Attached is a copy of the amended ETA that Carol sent you in early July.  
Please let me know if the changes meet with your approval.
