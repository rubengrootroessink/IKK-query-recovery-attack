Amy -

Attached for your review are a blacklined and final version of the NDA.  The 
blacklined version includes AMR's last set of revisions (with the exception 
of Paragraph 3, which is marked to be consistent with my last e-mail).  The 
final version incorporates all changes and is ready for signature by AMR.  If 
these are acceptable, please have the final version printed and two originals 
signed.  A copy of one signed original should be faxed to me in the morning 
so that I can obtain a countersignature by Enron and forward a copy of same 
to your attention.  The two originals should follow and will be countersigned 
by Enron upon receipt.  One fully signed original will be returned to your 
attention.

Thanks for the continued cooperation.  If there is anything further that is 
needed, please let me know.

Jill -

The changes proposed are fine, except in Paragraph 3.  I believe the second
sentence of the paragraph should remain, but should read "If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, you or
your Representative are, in the opinion of your counsel, compelled to
disclose the Confidential Information or else stand liable for contempt or
suffer other censure or significant penalty, you may disclose only such of
the Confidential Information to the party compelling disclosure as is
required by law."

If this is acceptable, we can move forward with the agreement tomorrow.

Ms. Bannes -

A copy of the AMR non-disclosure agreement was forwarded to my attention to
review in anticipation of a meeting to take place tomorrow between our
companies.  I have reviewed the form provided and have numerous comments
related to bringing the agreement into the form generally acceptable to
Enron.  Instead of revising your form, I have provided Enron's standard
form to you for review.  The general concepts are the same, however, you
will note:

1.  the attached contained provisions relating to arbitration as the means
of settling disputes between the parties
2.  the laws of New York are applicable (neutral site to both parties), and
3.  there is no requirement of marking information as confidential as this
places an undue burden on Enron to police this practice.

Please review the attached at your earliest convenience and let me know
your thoughts.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation with this matter.
