You might want to touch base with David Portz about Green Mountain with whom 
EPMI has a confidentiality agreement re EPMI's possible provision of a host 
of services.  Since EOL will getting even more information to protect and 
Green Mountain has specifically asked that no New Power affiliate get any of 
their information it might be a good idea for EPMI and EOL each to know what 
the other is contemplating.

An NDA for EOL, this time it would protect the counterparty so we can receive 
copies of their financial statements.
