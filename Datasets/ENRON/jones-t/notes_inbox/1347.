Delene Travella at FUNB said she was dealing with Tanna (spelling?) Jones
in Houston.  Thanks for your help on this.

Kind regards,

Clare

Many thanks.  Kind regards,

Edmund,

I wondered whether you had been able to make any progress internally with
the issues I raised in my e-mail of 13th July (attached below).  If I can
be of help by speaking to anyone in Houston directly please let me know.

Many thanks,

Clare

Edmund,

I was hoping you might be able to assist me in relation to the ISDA we are
negotiating with First Union National Bank (FUNB).  I have spoken to Delene
Travella at FUNB and the position is as follows:

1. FUNB only have one outstanding trade (a Credit default swap) which was
entered into recently.  This is with Enron North America Corp.  The
confirmation was sent by Elaine Bannerman-Sowah at Enron.

2. FUNB have been negotiating an ISDA over the last year with Tanna  (sp?)
Jones in Houston but progress has been slow (I understand they have had had
difficulties getting comments from Houston).  The counterparty for this
negotiation is Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

They want to finalise the terms of the ECTRIC negotiation before commencing
on a negotiation for EnronCredit.com and as there is an outstanding trade
with Enron North America Corp they would prefer to put an ISDA in place
with them before negotiating EnronCredit.com.  They are not aware that
there is any pending business with EnronCredit.com.

Would you be able to confirm what the position is regarding the masters
that should now be being negotiated and perhaps if we could try and push
Houston to expedite the outstanding negotiation from Houston we could move
on to the EnronCredit.com negotiation more rapidly?  They are not really
prepared to consider the drafts until the position is clarified.  Let me
know if I can be of assistance by speaking to anyone directly regarding
this.  I am out of the office from today until next Thursday but James
Clarry would be able to help in my absence.

Many thanks,

Clare
