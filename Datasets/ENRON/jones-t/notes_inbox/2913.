Kay:

Attached please find a revised NDA as per our discussion this morning.  I was 
unable to mark this document or generate a red-line, so unfortunately I'm 
only able to send you a clean copy.  The version attached is the earlier 
version I sent you with the following changes:  

1.  Section 2 was revised to delete lenders and to add the last sentence as 
per your revisions below.
2.  Section 5 was revised as per your revisions attached below.
3.  Section 6 was revised to clarify that compilations, etc. must contain 
info of the receiving Party or a third Party in addition to the Confidential 
Information.
4.  Section 10 was revised to provide that confidential information will be 
protected for 3 years from the Effective Date.

If the revised NDA is acceptable, I will finalize and have it executed and 
then forwarded as per you instructions for execution by i2. 

Regards,

Leslie Hansen

Gillian,
I have reviewed Enroncredit's requested changes to the NDA.  Most are fine.
In response to some, I have added or changed some language.  The only real
significant issue that I could see was the length of the protection period.
The absolute minimum i2 will agree to is 3 years.  Please review my changes
in the attached document.  I would be happy to discuss any of these and can
be reached at the numbers below.
Thanks for your help and your consideration.
