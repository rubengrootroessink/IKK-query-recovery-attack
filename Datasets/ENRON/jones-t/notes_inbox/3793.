Subject: RE: Amendment to FT Energy License Agreement

Tana,
We need to add another amendment to extend the contract between EnronOnline 
and FT Energy another 3 months.  The current amendment to the Dec. 13, 2000 
original contract expires on March 31, 2001.  The new amendment should expire 
on June 30, 2001.

The amendment should be sent to:
Michele Markey
Financial Times
3333 Walnut Street
Boulder, CO 80301-2515

Tel:  720-548-5568
Fax: 720-548-5003
mmarkey@ftenergy.com

Michele also wanted to make sure that she had a street address to send it 
back to us (I suppose to your location?)

Thanks Tana.
