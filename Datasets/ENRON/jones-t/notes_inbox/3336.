To all -

If you have not already viewed the TradeSpark website, please do so at your 
earliest convenience.  I am trying to move forward with negotiations on the 
access agreement and need to be assured that I have all Enron comments prior 
to doing so.  My goal for finalizing the document is Friday of this week.

Thanks for your support and assistance.

We now have a computer set up so you can view the TradeSpark website.  It is 
located in a cubicle across from the C-1 conference room (on the side 
opposite of me, at EB3858D).  Since it has taken us so long to get access 
into this website, it is critical that each of you review your products 
descriptions of the website AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Can you each please confirm 
to me that you have completed your review and if you have any issues with the 
product descriptions please pass them on to Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline.

If for any reason you continue to have computer problems, please call Jason, 
our floor computer tech, ASAP.

Thanks for your prompt attention to this!

Tana, 

The Tradespark PC has been installed in EB3858D. I created a local account 
for all the lawyers to use to login, the userid is tradespark and the 
password is tradespark. Once they login, they will doubleclick on the 
tradespark icon on the desktop and will be at the tradespark login window. 
The userid should already be in place, but if not, it is netnrg3 and the 
password is espeed. That should get them into the tradespark system. Now, 
once Tradespark has come out with a version that is W2k compatible, we will 
install the application on each of their PC's for their convenience. Let me 
know if you need any further information. As always, I am here to help.

                                   Thanks,
       Jason
