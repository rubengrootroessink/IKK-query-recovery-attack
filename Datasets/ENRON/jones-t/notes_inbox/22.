Dear CompareRite Users:

For your attention

ENA Legal has purchase 40 standalone licenses of CompareRite 5.1 version for 
ENA Legal exclusive usage in 9/1997.   We have exceeded the 40 seats and the 
software is out of date.   We violated the agreement by accessing it through 
our LAN.   

To upgrade to 7.1 version, I would like to get an Enron site license for LAN 
access to accommodate all Enron users including ENA Legal.  Network version 
of CompareRite is $132 per ID first year and 15% of $132 for annual 
maintenance.    I try to keep # of users to its minimum so I can afford to 
pay the license from Legal Library budget.   Please respond to my email if 
you wish to have your name REMOVED from the CompareRite User List by Friday, 
4/7.   I would like to have the new license agreement signed based on a final 
head count soon.  

Nony:  Would you notify Terri Bachand and Frank Cascio?  I could not find 
them on Lotus Notes mail.

Thanks,
Sylvia Hu
