Attached please find a form of Consent and Acknowledgment that I would like 
Wabash to execute to evidence ACES' agency authority.  I would also like to 
see a copy of the Agency/Service Agreement between Wabash and ACES.  I still 
need to talk to Mark about whether further due diligence is necessary to 
determine the authority of a non-profit Indiana cooperative to engage in 
derivative trading.

Leslie
