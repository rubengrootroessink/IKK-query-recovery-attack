Jake -

The below response information is fine.  My only question relates to the type 
of information we will be disclosing.  It is whether or not we want to, 
instead of using the term "EnronOnline," use generic wording such as "object 
codes to Net Work's online commodity trading platform," since they may not be 
100% familiar with EOL.

Please let me and Tana know when the actual agreement has been provided so we 
can review it as necessary.

Mark,

As we discussed earlier attached please find a copy of an NDA request from 
Coca-Cola. (Exhibit 1).  We have reviewed it and modified it.  (Exhibit 2)  
We hope to return this to Coke by the end of the day so that they can begin 
processing their NDA first thing on Monday morning.  Please review these 
documents and let us know what you think at your earliest convenience.

Thank you very much.

Jake
