Can you look around for the fax of this NDA signed by the Counterparty.  Mark 
Greenberg will need to initial it and then send it down to Daniel Diamond and 
he will get an EnronOnline and Enron Net Works officer to sign it.  Once it 
is signed we will need to fax it to the counterparty.  I will forward Dan's 
email with the fax and phone number of the counterparty to you.

Thanks!
