Miss Tana,

Are you interested in going to the Nutcracker Market this Saturday morning
and being there for the early bird special (8 a.m.)??  It costs $25 to get
in early, but that covers $10 admission, $5 parking, coffee and
refreshments.  Otherwise, you can go at 10 a.m., pay $10 to get in with the
rest of the crowd and $5 for parking.  I think I am going to plan to be
there around 7:40-7:45.  Let me know if you are interested.

Patti
