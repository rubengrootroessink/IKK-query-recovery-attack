Tana,
I am sorry this has taken so long especially as much of my efforts to collate 
information have turned up little.  
The following is a list of the exchanges on which we trade:

International Petroleum Exchange

Amsterdam Power Exchange  N.V. (APX)

UK Pool

Spanish Pool(Mercadeo de electricidad - Omel)


I have the regulation books for the IPE let me know if you want a copy and I 
will arrange to have it copied and couriered however it is an etremely thick 
binder with numerous additional updates it may be better to visit the IPE  
website.  In relation to the Spanish Pool I have the documents that Enron 
Espana Energia SL and Enron Energie GmbH signed when they joined the Spanish 
Pool  however these are all in Spanish so will not provide much help it would 
be better to visit the website 'www.omel.es'  where you'll find the Rules of 
the Pool and the Contract of Adhesion in English.  With regard to the UK Pool 
there are twelve volumes each volume is on average 1,000 pages long the only 
person who has a copy of the rules is Paul Dawson here in London, if there is 
any particular area you were interested in looking at I would suggest 
contacting him on +44 207 783 5453. In relation to the Amsterdam Pool I have 
couriered a copy of the latest rules to you.

Please let me know if you require further information.

Many thanks and kind regards
Lorna
