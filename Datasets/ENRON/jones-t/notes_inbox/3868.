Steve,
Cindy is the correct name for the NDA.    Zip code should be 77056-5306 for
our street address.   Otherwise the info you've got is correct.   Thanks!
Debbie

Debbie,

I wanted to thank you again for taking the time to consider our
presentation yesterday.  I enjoyed speaking with your whole team.

As a follow-up to our conversation, I wanted to let you know that I will
be the point of contact for executing an NDA with Enron Net Works and
Enron Transportation Services.  I was planning to give the lawyers
Cynthia's name as the CMS company representative. Can you verify that
the following information is correct for legal purposes?

Cynthia C. Albert
CMS Energy - Panhandle Pipe Line Companies
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Information Systems
5444 Westheimer Road
Houston, TX 77210-4967

713-989-7334
tsmehta@cmsenergy.com

I can be reached at 510-813-4880 if you have comments or corrections.
Also, my email is stephen.abbanat@enron.com.

Best regards,
Steve
