Tana,
Wow, you are really on the ball.  Looks like we will have a great party. I 
will email
Matthias and Karin about the potatoe recipe and Stephen Long about the garlic 
bread
recipe.  Judy Weller's phone number is 713-524-7567. And Mark and I are 
willing to
bring whatever; Ulf might want help with the pork chops and chicken.  How are 
plans
with the grill going?  We can always bring ours if you know of someone with a 
truck we
could borrow.
Peace,
Beth
