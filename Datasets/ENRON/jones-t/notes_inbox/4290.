		 Subject: Dinner Reservations in San Antonio

Upon consultation with various members of the Swap Group, I am having Taffy 
make dinner reservations for 7:00 pm at La Fogata in San Antonio for 14 
people on Wednesday night.  This is not obligatory, so if you have other 
dinner plans, please do not feel under any pressure to join us, just let me 
know.  Of course, if any one comes up with a better place, I'm open to 
suggestions..., but at least we'll have something!
