Hi Tana,
I am not sure if a Christopher Defilippo from Dresdner has been in touch with 
you regarding internet access agreement with Dresdner on their "Pirhanna" 
dealing system.

If this is a straight fwd document, we wouldn't mind gaining access to their 
fx dealing website as a balance to UBS site.
If it is not straightforward, please disregard their request and lf you 
wouldn't mind letting me know so I can say thanks but no thanks to Dresdner 
online trading query.... As you can guess this is currently a  low-level 
priority .....
Thanks for your time,
Darren
