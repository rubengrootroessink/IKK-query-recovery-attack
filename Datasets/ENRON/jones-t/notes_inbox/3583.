Mark,

Thanks again for you quick help on the Totality NDA.  No word yet from them.  

Below is an NDA from Sabre Corporation, which I received today.   As you may 
know, Sabre is mostly known as a Global Distribution Services company (GDS), 
chiefly providing an electronic distribution channel for airline seats to 
travel agents and a growing group of internet purveyors.  ENW would like to 
explore ways to help Sabre possibly create a new ticket distribution 
platform, which may involve imparting the knowledge and systems we have used 
in the development of EOL.   I would characterize our discussions as 
exploratory.  See Supplement 1 or NDA for Sabre's characterization of 
undertaking.

My legal-wannabe eye says you may have issues with paragraph 5, 7 and 9.   
Let me know if I should provide you with anything further.  Brenda Crabtree's 
number is below.  I assume she is with Sabre's legal group.  They seem fairly 
intent on using their NDA.  

Thanks
-John
