Attached below is the Master Swap Credit Worksheet for Falconbridge Limited.  
Once again, this customer is one that Caroline Abramo is looking at doing 
business with.  Also, she is visiting with the companies during the next two 
weeks and wanted the companies to have drafts before then.  She would be able 
to help out with any contact info, etc.  

Give me a call if there are any questions regarding the Credit Worksheet.



Thanks again,

Veronica Espinoza
