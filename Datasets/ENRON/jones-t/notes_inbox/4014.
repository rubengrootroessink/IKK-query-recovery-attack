To the best of my knowledge none of the ENA affiliates that I receive 
agreements from has any agreement with Standard & Poor's.  These entities 
have several agreements with Citibank, but each is transaction specific and 
with one exception (an agreement with Enron Europe Limited relating to a 
power project in Turkey) protect only Enron information.

I'm sure you are aware of the agreement that EnronCredit.com has with 
Credit2B.com.

Mark,
Please review the attached letter of intent for S&P and Citibank.  The only 
intended binding aspects of the letter is the confidentiality agreement 
portion.  I would like to be able to sign it by Thursday. 

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Craig Chaney
Enron Credit
