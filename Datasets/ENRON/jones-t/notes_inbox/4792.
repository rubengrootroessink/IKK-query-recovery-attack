CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1. OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as accuratel=
y=20
as possible all futures and options gross positions as of close-of business=
=20
on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the estimated current gros=
s=20
positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.  The OPC must be=20
submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.   OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring optio=
n=20
with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject to=20
automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted=
=20
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its=
=20
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other=20
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic abandonme=
nt=20

A=20
form, please note the following:

(a) An E/A form must be submitted not later than 5:00 PM.
(b) Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which are=
=20

(c) If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a strike=
=20
price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position in a=
=20

some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for position=
=20
liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of expiration=
=20
and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your projected=20
position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of actual traded=
=20
volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel correction=
