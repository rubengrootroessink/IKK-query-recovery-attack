Mark,

I believe the company name listed is accurate.  My contact emailed to me
with a reply that verified the name and company listed are correct, with
the exception of the zip code.  I forwarded her reply to you.

I will also copy her on this email and ask her for a legal contact
number so you can verify this with their legal.  Debbie, would you send
Mark you legal contact's name and number. Mark's email is
mark.greenberg@enron.com.

thanks,
Steve
