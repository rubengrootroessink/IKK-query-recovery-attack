Sara, 

John Malowney sent me the following message late in the day Thursday.  I am 
out of the office Friday through next Wednesday.  Apparently a particularly 
aggressive customer thinks they can come to us and demand an instand ISDA 
tomorrow.  When John asked if we could do it, I said it will be almost 
impossible (not sure if credit has been done) but that I would pass it on to 
our superstar in the swap group and if anybody can do it Sara can.  The 
contact information is as set forth below.  ----cgy

John Cameron of Davis, Wright, & Tremaine (sp) (503) 778-5206, cell of (503)

so that BCS & ENA and do a COB based financial swap tomorrow morning.  Can 
you get this to him ASAP.  Call if you have any questions.   Thanks,  John
