Bridgette,

If you could look at today's PA list and populate accordingly.  As far as 
Pacific is concerned (96043239), we are waiting a response from Carol St. 
Clair to go ahead and execute our part (normal PA spreadsheet population and 
verbal communication confirmation to Tana Jones).  I have already contacted 
Tana and informed her the Global record is in place and is ready to submit to 
EOL.  If you need anything, please go ahead and page me.

Thank You,
Anthony
