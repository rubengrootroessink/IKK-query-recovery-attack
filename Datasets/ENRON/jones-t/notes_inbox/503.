It is easier to build two chimneys than to maintain one.
- Benjamin Franklin

How many times has the following happened to you:  you are listening to=20
someone=01,s idea about a "new" project, and you realize that it has alread=
y=20
been attempted two times.  As the previous incarnations were not quite up t=
o=20
par, someone has decided to call "do over" and make yet a third pass.

Frustrating, isn=01,t it? It probably makes you wonder why we didn=01,t do =
it=20
better the first time around.  Was it time constraints?  Resource=20
constraints?  Financial constraints?

Perhaps you have some examples of successful project implementations.  Here=
=20
is an opportunity for you to be a giant and hoist the rest of us up on your=
=20
shoulders.  Post your personal best practice tips in the "Best Practices"=
=20
category on eMeet.  This is your opportunity to make sure we do things the=
=20
right way the first time from now on.
