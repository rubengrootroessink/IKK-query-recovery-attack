Tana:

Attached is a marked version of the FLAG/Enron, which changes FLAG has 
agreed.  Please produce a clean version of the attached, put it on Enron 
letterhead and provide to me so that I may arrange to have it signed by an 
appropriate officer of ENW.

Please call if you have any further questions or comments.

Thank you,

Peter Feltman
