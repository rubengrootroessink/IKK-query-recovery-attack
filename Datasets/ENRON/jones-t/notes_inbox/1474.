Tana,

Leslie is on vacation, if you have a chance would you please follow up with 
Public Service of Colorado.  They were denied access to trade East Power 
Products due to legal reasons and would like a (brief) explanation.  I know 
you are busy but if you have chance please give them a call. Lance Titus 
303-308-6131.

Thank You,

Noel
