COMEX Division Floor Community

FROM: Michael Campanelli, Vice President, Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:
New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th=
e=20
Trade Management System (TMS) on COMEX

For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below, please ref=
er=20

http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/ntm_353.htm

Introduction
As you are aware, in the near future, the Exchange plans to merge the two=
=20
divisions onto one trade processing platform.  The COMEX Division will=20
replace its On-Line Trade Entry (OLTE) system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme=
nt=20
System (TMS).

While final details are being determined; certain procedural aspects of the=
=20
transition process can begin. Therefore, effective immediately, the followi=
ng=20
should be considered:



Single Sided Concept
The source document for TMS will be the trading card.  Floor staff will=20
collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da=
ta=20
Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades.  The trading card=
s=20
will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members (PCM=01,s); ins=
tead=20
they will be retained by the Exchange (THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS=20
IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX).  Each sell side will generate a buy side.  The=20
broker=01,s staff will be responsible for Account Assignment, Trade Checkou=
t and=20
Corrections (in addition, for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t=
he=20
execution time).



Implementation
In accordance with the implementation of TMS, members must begin to use new=
=20
trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input.



Implementation Schedule
The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur=
e.
WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL=
Y,=20
to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place.

This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation=
=20
procedures and enable the Exchange=01,s Trade Processing staff to review th=
e=20
handwriting/recordation techniques of the COMEX Division=01,s membership pr=
ior=20
to launch.  During this interim period, if necessary staff will contact=20
members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures.  In=
=20
addition, staff will begin to familiarize members=01, clerks with TMS=20
functionality.



Spread Processing
TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction.  To accomplis=
h=20
this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t=
he=20
trading card when he/she is the seller of the spread (see recordation=20
procedures noted below). This indication will inform data entry personnel t=
o=20
enter the entire spread (buy and sell components).  Opposite buy spreads (n=
ot=20
keyed by the Exchange) that are linked to a seller status will be generated=
=20
by the system.


NOTE: When submitting cards for data entry, the differential must be=20
indicated or it will be rejected.  If the differential is noted without=20
prices for either leg, the system will assign the appropriate market pricin=
g=20
to both legs based on the most recent price reports.  If the differential i=
s=20
noted along with the price of one of the legs, the system will assign an=20
appropriate price to the other leg.



Recordation Procedures
For the purpose of standardization within the community, the following=20
trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers:

ALPHA CODES ONLY
*TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes, therefore use only the=20
appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade=20
processing.

SPREADS (MULTIPLE LEG TRADES)
*Place the value of the spread (differential) in the bottom portion of each=
=20
entry line=01,s center field.  Circle the spread value. This will inform da=
ta=20
entry personnel that the trade is a spread (see e.g. 1).

NOTE: Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result=
=20
in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade.

*Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the=
=20
spread.  This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread (see e.=
g.=20
2).

*Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple=
=20
leg spread is involved; for example:  Butterflies; this will convey that al=
l=20
the components are part of one entity (see e.g. 3).

CABINET TRADES
*Place "CAB" or "C" in the premium column (see e.g. 4).

CONVERSIONS
*Place the option components on one line.  The futures component price must=
=20
be written on the next line, across the Strike and Premium columns (see e.g=
.=20
5).

MATCHED ORDERS
*Place "MO" in the price column (see e.g. 6).

Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive=
=20
the previous day=01,s settlement prices until the current day=01,s settleme=
nt=20
prices are determined and immediately applied.

EXCHANGE FOR PHYSICAL "EFP=01,S"
*Place "EFP" or "E" in the (SPD) box (bottom portion of each entry lines=20
center field) (see e.g. 7).

Crossing of Orders
Place a "Y" in the spread (SPD) box (see e.g. 8 line A), except when crossi=
ng=20
an EFP, at which time the letters "EFP" must be indicated instead.  (see e.=
g.=20
8 line B).  Additionally, it will not be necessary to denote a "Y" for cros=
s=20
trades that require the recordation of a differential.

Note:  The clearing information related to a short code that is data entere=
d=20
by the Exchange will only apply to the sell portion of the cross trade.  Th=
e=20
buy side will require subsequent allocation in a typical manner.

Strip Trades
Place the beginning and ending months in the month columns of successive=20
trade lines, with the average price indicated in the price column.  Write=
=20
*STRIP* adjacent to the bracketed trade data to highlight the trade type fo=
r=20
data entry personnel. (see e.g. 9).

Note: The reccommended recordation procedures for various additional types =
of=20
trades are shown in examples 10 through 20.

Short Codes
When it is possible the account area on the card should be used to indicate=
=20
the appropriate short code.  The Exchange will data enter the sellers short=
=20
code and the corresponding account assignment information will be generated=
.

Note: When a short code is provided as part of spread sellers sell leg=20
information, the allocation will be applied to both the sell leg and the bu=
y=20
leg.  If the buy is intended for the same customer but a different clearing=
=20
member, a reallocation will be necessary.



Trading Months
1st occurrence - month symbol
2nd occurrence - circled month symbol
Beyond 2nd occurrence - month symbol plus the last digit of the appropriate=
=20
year.

Trading Card Submission Requirements
Cards must be submitted within 15 minutes of the time of execution of the=
=20
first trade (buy or sell) recorded on the card.  For example a trade execut=
ed=20
at 10:15 a.m. must be submitted no later than 10:30 a.m. Submission=20
performance will be monitored by the Exchange and those brokers deemed=20
non-diligent will be subject to disciplinary action.

Note: Cards that include trades executed during either the close or=20
post-close, must be submitted within 5 minutes of the bell marking the end =
of=20
each period.

Trading Ring Change Submission Procedure
Cards must be submitted to the ring in which the trades appearing on them=
=20
were executed.  Therefore, in cases when a broker intends to leave one ring=
=20
to trade in another, prior to leaving if he/she has a partially completed=
=20
card it must be submitted in the ring he/she is departing.



Trading in a Multiple Commodity Ring
Trades that are recorded on a trading card that differ from the commodity=
=20
indicated on the heading of the card, should include the commodity name, fo=
r=20
example: ALUMINUM, written adjacent to the trade details on the same entry=
=20
line (see e.g. 21).

Audit Trail Timing
Every trade whether buy or sell, must have an accurate trade time.  There i=
s=20
no change to the audit trail timing methodology.  Just as is current=20
practice, the execution times indicated by the broker on his/her trading=20
cards will continue to be compared to the Exchange Times and Sales as well =
as=20
the opposite broker=01,s execution times.

Questions?????? If you have questions regarding the new trading card=20
procedures please call Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David Sherma=
n=20
at (212) 299-2061.

THE EXCHANGE WILL BE CONDUCTING PROCEDURAL DIFFERENCES CLASSES IN THE NEAR=
=20
FUTURE. ATTENDANCE WILL BE MANDATORY FOR BOTH BROKERS AND THEIR CLERKS. A=
=20
SCHEDULE WILL BE FORTHCOMING.
