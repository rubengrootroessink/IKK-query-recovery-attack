Tana, Ed has decided to open them up for financial trading after all with a 
prompt-month tenor.  I'll include this in today's approval spreadsheet.  
Theresa has already been notified.

Tina & Ed,

I received a call from AES NewEnergy, Inc. this morning regarding trading 
financials in US East Power.  They are interested in trading the Balance of 
Day, a recently new product offered by power group.

Please let me know if they are in a position to trade this product.

Thank you both...

T. Mandola
