Sale (expires 12/31/01) Global #96046617

No records

As there are no Global records for "Koch Hydrocarbons Company", there are no 
transactions in Sitara.

Please note that I do not have access to any of the old HPL maintenance 
groups, Enron Canada, or Enron London.

HOWEVER:
I ran a separate query in Tagg and found transactions under both short 
names.  Spreadsheets are attached with transaction information.

For Koch Hydrocarbon Co. (Short name: KOCHHYDROCO)


For Koch Hydrocarbon Company (Short name: KOCHHYDCOM)



Please let me know if there is anything I can do.
