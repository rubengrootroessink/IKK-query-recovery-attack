Hi Everyone

I apologize for all the e-mails going back and forth but hopefully we can put 
this one to rest soon.  London Credit have approved this CP for financial 
metals and I need to confirm if they are approved from a legal perspective as 
well.  I spoke to Justin Boyd (London legal) and he asked that I clear this 
with Houston Legal before setting them up.  

In addition, I want to see if Houston Credit/Legal will be reviewing this 
counterparty for US products as well.  Please let me know as soon as you can.

Thank You

Imelda Frayre
