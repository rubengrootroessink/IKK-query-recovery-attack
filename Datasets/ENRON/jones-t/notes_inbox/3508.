There is a system issue that came up today with the Internal Product Types.  
In the review process, if you set the Internal Product Types to "None", 
counterparties are still able to read the products.   To prevent this from 
happening on future reviews, I recommend the following:

New Counterparties
I will pull the counterparty into Datamanager and set the profile to "Read" 
for everything and delete the Internal and ZZ Product Types
Credit should continue to review for the specific commodity requested for 
Trade 
Legal/Contracts should only review the product types that Credit has selected 
for Trade.  The remaining product types are already set to Read with the 
exception of the Internal and ZZ Product Types.

Amended Counterparties
Initial group will amend product types - excluding the Internal and ZZ 
product types
Other groups updating the work queue - Please make sure to exclude the 
Internal and ZZ product types in your review.

This is short term - Once we release the new version of Profile Manager - 
Internal Product Types will not be included in your reviews. 

We appreciate your cooperation with this request.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.
