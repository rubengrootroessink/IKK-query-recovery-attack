Attached below is the Credit Worksheet for Astra Power.  The counterparty is 
very anxious to have the Master executed, as it would enable them to trade 
financially on EOL.  The contact on the worksheet has been my contact thus 
far; call her if you need any further company info.  If you have any 
questions, give me a call at x6-6002.




Thanks again,

Veronica Espinoza
