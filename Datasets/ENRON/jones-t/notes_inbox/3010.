Will it help if I call these folks directly?  Who is the contact person?  I 
am supposed to update lotus notes daily and this is greatly impeding my 
responsibilites.  Also, the folks from the trading floor keep calling me 
about updates because they do not see any updates on these files.

Yes, you do not have access to Lotus Notes, because I have been hung out to 
dry.  They don't have time to keep up with our demands for access, so they 
want me to do this, and they have sent me instructions and are working on 
getting me the level of access to change approvals, but I'm not there yet.  
All things will come...

I still do not have complete access to lotus notes -- I can review the 
brokerage agreements but cannot make edits.  Does anyone know who I can call 
about this?!!!!!

In the meantime, Samantha, can you please note therein that re: JP Morgan, I 
left messages by phone again today for Kathleen McCirmack, their attorney of 
record for the Electronic Order Agreement with ENA.  This deal is high 
priority so please update notes as soon as you get this message.

Finally, Sam and Stephanie, the files for Robertson Stephens and Bear Sterns 
are not at my desk.  Please doublecheck to see who has them.
