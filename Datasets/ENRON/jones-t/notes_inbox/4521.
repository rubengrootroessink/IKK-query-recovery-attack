Ok Ladies - after a bit of reconfiguring, I've tinkered with the guest lists 
and come up with the following assignments.  Henry and I are flattered to 
have been invited several places, but can only be in one place at a time....  
You will need to re-assign food as necessary to accomodate the shifting 
guests.   Patty Stone and Susan Teich are out of town until the end of next 
week, so we can't involve them in the great human shuffle.  I hope this is my 
final answer.

Thanks so much Alicia, for trying to resolve this.  I just feel terrible
that you and Henry might have to move to another party.
That is a total bummer!!   Plus, Henry was going to be my asst. when we
cook the flaming dessert.
I say "come on and we'll just make this work".  If it's a nice night, we'll
hit the patio.
Many thanks,
Lisa
