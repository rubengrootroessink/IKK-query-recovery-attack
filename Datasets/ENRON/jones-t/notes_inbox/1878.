I do not believe that I have seen or had executed the RBC Schedule or Master 
Agreement.  I had prepared the Master Agreement, so if RBC did not do this, I 
have one ready to go.  However, if RBC has executed the schedule, I will need 
to get a copy and have Peter execute it.  Otherwise, Tana can you e-mail a 
clean execution copy of the schedule to me and I will have Peter execute it 
and send it to Rick to get RBC's execution.  We executed the confirms on 
Friday afternoon and faxed them to Larry Joe Hunter on the Enron North 
America confirm desk.  He will attend to sending them to the counterparties 
for execution.
