We had to fax it to the UK for execution.  Tana Jones will follow up with you 
re the status.

Tana:

Please follow up with Steve re when he should expect an execution copy.

Please confirm that your fax number is 212-819-0171.  (The phone number I
had for you was wrong, so I don't want to rely on this fax number either.)

Send the execution copy to me.  Faxed signature pages are fine.

Steve:

All of your proposed changes are acceptable.  I'm finalizing the document
as per the attached and will have it sent to you for execution after I have
had it executed on my end.  To whom should I send the execution document?
In the interests of time, I suggest that we exchange fax copies.

Regards,
