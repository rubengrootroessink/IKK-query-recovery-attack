Subject: Need Information for Audit

In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin 
funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of 
all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the 
products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any 
rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should 
include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy 
commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.

Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.  
Much thanks!
