Leslie,

We have reviewed the modifications to the ETA  and so has Tom Moran. We all 
agree that we can proceed with it.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Leonardo Pacheco

Dave:

Attached please find an ETA letter agreement I have prepared for Western 
Area  Power Administration.  This one has been peculiar.  They are a 
government agency and insisted on the inclusion of Section 3 as mandatory.  
In order to deal with the provisions of Section 3(a), this counterparty will 
be set up with a 30-day tenor limit.  I will instruct both credit and the EOL 
team to turn this counterparty off from further trading in August if we have 
not received confirmation prior to the end of that month that the 
counterparty has obtained necessary funding for its Sept. 01- Sept. 02 fiscal 
year.

Please call me if you have any questions or comments.

Leslie
