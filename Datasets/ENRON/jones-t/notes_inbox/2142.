Don't bother - just let someone else sign - they are EBS ex employees.

I checked w/the Corp. Secretary's office, and they were unaware that Rex and 
Dave  were appointed as MD's, so the corporate paralegal is getting the board 
resolution passed adding them on, as well as adding Mark Palmer as a VP.
