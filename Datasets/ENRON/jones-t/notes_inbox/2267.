I have no negative information on any of these proposed counterparties.

Attached are some of the new steel counterparties.  I need to give EOL 
responses by Friday for all these counterparties.  In addition, we should 
have more coming through, for a total of about 100-150 new counterparties we 
have to approve by Friday.  I will need your responses, if any, ASAP, as I 
still need to fill in Legal's approvals and return them.  Thanks!
