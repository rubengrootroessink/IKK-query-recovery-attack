Eric LeDain confirmed with Linda that the ISDA had been sent back to Samantha 
on March 13th.  I am not sure if Samantha since sent it to the counterparty.

Thanks
Russell

We are trying to track down the signed documents for this counterparty.  Our 
notes reflect that Samantha Boyd sent them up to Peter for execution on 
3/9/01 with instructions to send them back to Samantha Boyd when executed.  
My understanding is that they were signed in Canada and returned to Samantha, 
but they have not yet shown up here.  If you sent them fedex and can track 
them via a tracking number can you see if you can find them.  They appear to 
have done some unauthorized trades w/o having the master signed and this has 
now become a really high priority.

Thanks!
