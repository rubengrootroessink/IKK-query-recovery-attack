FYI, here is my email address.  If you like, you can copy it into your 
directory for future use.   I am also located in the ECT address book, under 
Legal Temp 1.  I realize it is difficult to find my information on the 
system; I am not located in peoplefinder.  If you should need further 
information, feel free to call me at 5-3317.  Thanks, Keegan
