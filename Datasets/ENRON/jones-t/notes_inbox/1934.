Just realized I never replied to you. Sorry.

The client he is referring to use to trade with us at Tiger. He is setting up 
his own hedge fund with the backing of a larger fund. I know who it is, but 
it is confidential at this point. We are negotiating documentation for the 
backer at this point in time and hence why Paul said we have docs in the 
works.

I'll fill you in with more details as I get them.

Per,

What's the deal he's talking about?  I also do not think we could put ENA and 
Enron Metals Ltd. trades under the same master.  When you have a mingute give 
me a ring.

We were advised that a swap document is in the works through Per Sekse Enron 
New York. We would like this document to cover all products and Enron Metals 
Ltd. ---not just North America.

My guess--- we trade with most of Per Sekse funds and this issue should be 
clarified
