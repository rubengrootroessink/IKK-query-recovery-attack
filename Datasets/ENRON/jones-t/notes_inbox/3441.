Speaking of Canadian eligible contract participants...I was told from an 
originator in Canada that per someone in Enron Canada's legal department, 
Canadian contract participants are not held to the same standards as US (i.e. 
they are not required to have minimum assets &/or equity etc.).  Is this 
true???  Please advise and forward to me the eligible contract participant 
information we discussed at the happy-hour last wednesday.

Thanks
WEndy
