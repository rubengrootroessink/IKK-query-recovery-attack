The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an 
Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other 
Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the 
entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!
