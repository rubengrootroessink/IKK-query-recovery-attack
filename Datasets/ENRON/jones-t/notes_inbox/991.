 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, 
we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with 
primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and 
regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as 
primary contacts for the operating companies:

  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere

  EES: Harry Kingerski

  ENA: Jim Steffes

 In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these 
individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his 
responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report 
to Steve Kean in that capacity.

 There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact 
between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of 
Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are 
looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a 
"go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies.
