Hi,? I wanted to check with you about the  A/C in your garage.? 
?
Here is where I am:? Remember that house  that Peter told us about???? The 
little one near Jackson Hill near Memorial  Park???? I haven't forgotten 
about it, even though it is small.? I am  now looking at it as a good 
investment, especially looking at what is going up  around there.? Anyway, if 
I were to buy it, it has central air and I  wouldn't need to buy a window 
unit for my other house because I would be leaving  in the next month.? Or, 
maybe I would, if it ended up taking longer than a  month to sell my present 
lot.? Some real estate friends are looking at the  little house today and 
will give me their very honest opinion this  afternoon.?
?
Tell me I am crazy, it is o.k.? I know it  already!!? I so desperately need 
change in my life.? But, Sarah is  falling apart about it because she thinks 
I am moving her into the  ghettos!!? Poor kid, she cries when I mention it.? 
There are 2 brand  new homes going up across the street from the little house 
and the lot with the  little house has a gorgeous big oak tree in it.? 
Sounding sicker by the  minute??
?
On the employment front, I still want to talk to  your folks, but I can't 
change jobs and then try to get financing approved for a  house.? I wanted to 
tell you at breakfast the other day but we had an  audience that I went to 
see a head hunter and she told me that I had been at my  job too long.? Knew 
that!? She also mentioned to me that she was  looking for another counselor 
in her office that she could train and that would  one day want equity in the 
company because she doesn't want to work  forever!!? She started in the 
business from the bottom and now has more  business than she can handle.? I 
have been thinking about it.? She is  also very adamant about me taking the 
Birkman tests.? Any  comments??
?
Will you be going to the Enron Field  tonight?? There will be a lot of 
excited people there.
?
Think about all of the above and let me know  your thoughts.? Thanks for 
listening.
???
