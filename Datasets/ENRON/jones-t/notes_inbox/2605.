Louise,

I was under the misimpression that EnronOnline LLC would have employees, and, 
as such, that Robert would need to be an officer.   Since that is not the 
case, there is no such need.  Sorry for the confusion!

Thanks. 

Michelle

I had an odd request come in today for Robert to become an officer of 
EnronOnline LLC.  EnronOnline LLC should not be used for anything (eg we get 
employed by Net Works LLC) -  I don't understand why are we using EnronOnline 
LLC for HR purposes.  I have rejected the request until you get back to me as 
I am concerned we are using it when we should not.

Thanks

Louise
