Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS

Effective Sunday evening, October 8, 2000 (trade date October 9, 2000), the=
 =20
NYMEX ACCESS electronic trading system will begin  offering implied trading=
=20
functionality, pending approval of necessary rule changes by the Commodity=
=20
Futures Trading Commission.  This  feature will once again create "implied"=
 =20
bids and offers in all futures, intra-market calendar spread, and 1:1=20
inter-commodity spread markets based on orders in related markets.

Implied Orders in General
Implied bids and offers are generated by the system based on individual=20
contract or spread orders that have been entered into the system.  For=20
example, if someone places a spread order to buy heating oil and sell crude=
=20
oil at a set differential, the system will automatically seek the best offe=
r=20
to sell heating oil and the best bid on crude oil and create an implied bid=
=20
in heating oil and an implied offer in crude oil, based on the differential=
=20
to the other market.  To do this, the system examines the outright  orders=
=20
(orders directly entered into the system) and creates bids and offers  that=
=20
are implied by the combination of specific outright orders.  The system the=
n=20
creates the "implied" bid or offer and displays it as an order that may be=
=20
traded against.  If a trader trades against this implied order, then the=20
outright orders that combined to create the implied order will trade.

Two-Way Implication Between the Futures and the Spread Markets
Orders entered into a commodity=01,s outright futures market will combine t=
o=20
create implied spread orders both as calendar spreads and  1:1=20
inter-commodity spreads .  The reverse is also true, i.e., orders entered=
=20
into the calendar spread market or the 1:1 inter-commodity spread market ca=
n=20
combine with other futures orders to create implied futures orders.

Implied Spread Orders Generated from Other Spread Orders
Implied spread orders can be created from the combination of other spread=
=20
orders.  For example, two separate calendar spread orders, one to buy a=20
January contract and sell a February contract, and another to buy a Februar=
y=20
contract and sell a March contract, will create an implied order for a buy=
=20
January/sell March spread.  The system will also generate implied=20
inter-commodity spread orders from the combination of calendar spread order=
s=20
and other inter-commodity spread orders, and it will generate implied=20
calendar spread orders from the combination of inter-commodity spread order=
s=20
and other calendar spread orders.

Implied Order Creation and the Depth-of-Market
Implied orders will be displayed only if the implied order=01,s price is th=
e=20
best price in the market.  Consequently, a particular market=01,s best pric=
e=20
volume may be composed of outright volume, implied volume, or a combination=
=20
of outright and implied volume.  The depth-of-market view of a contract wil=
l =20
only show this combination of implied and outright volume at the contract=
=01,s=20
BEST bid and offer prices.  Implied orders with prices that are NOT at the=
=20
best price for a contract will NOT show in the depth-of-market view.

Please note that although the depth-of-market will not display volume from=
=20
implied orders at prices other than the best, if a sweep order (an order to=
=20
purchase a certain number of contracts within a predetermined price range) =
is=20
entered with a price that would trade through  the undisplayed implied orde=
r,=20
the implied order will be filled.

Color Scheme to Distinguish Between Outright and Implied Orders
If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to outright orders=
,=20
then the color  will be displayed in BLACK font.  If the volume of the best=
=20
bid or offer is due completely to implied orders, then the color  will be=
=20
displayed in RED font.  If the volume of the best bid or offer is a=20
combination, then the color  will be displayed in PURPLE font. (Warning: Do=
=20
not change the Bid or Ask Color price cells -- which is done in the <View>=
=20
<Preferences> <Attributes> screen --to the same colors that appear in the=
=20
Implied Prices (Full) and (Part) fields -- also located in the same <View>=
=20
<Preferences> <Attributes> screen.  If you do, you will not be able to view=
=20
the implied prices.)

Cross Orders Must Be Turned Off
The current version of the implied functionality requires that cross order=
=20
entry be turned off.  Therefore, there is no ability to directly enter a=20
cross order (a single order for a trade to be transacted for two customers=
=20
accounts by the same broker) into the NYMEX ACCESSc system (This=20
functionality is planned as a future enhancement).  Orders should be entere=
d=20
in the order received from the customers.  If you have two orders in hand=
=20
that would normally be entered as a cross order, you should enter the order=
=20
received first, wait ten seconds, and then enter the order received second.

Options Orders
This release does not support implied options orders in any options market.
