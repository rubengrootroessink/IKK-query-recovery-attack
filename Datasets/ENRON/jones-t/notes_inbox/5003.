I have 98% chance of complete cure!!!!!!  They are not going to take any 
lymph nodes at this time.  The surgeon said it didn't matter whether it was 
over my lymph nodes or not.  My surgery is outpatient on June 19th.  It was a 
"Clark's grade 2" out of a possible 5.  They are going to take more out of 
the one on my stomach also to make sure there are clean margins.  They took 
another mole off my arm but of course don't think it is a worry!
