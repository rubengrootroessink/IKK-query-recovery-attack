Tana,

I realize that I don't have all the information you need but we are talking 
to JP Chase are going to need an NDA such as the one you prepared for Dave 
Forster and the Royal Canandian Bank.  Our goal is to have the NDA out by the 
end of today and I just wanted to let you know so that you could locate the 
Word file, and have it ready to go when we do get the info.

I will forward you the legal name and legal address when they have sent them 
to us.  In the mean time, if you have any other questions please don't 
hesitate to ask.  

Thank you very much

Jake
