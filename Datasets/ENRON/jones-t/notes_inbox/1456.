Tana apologies. I check the list each morning and only respond if there is an 
issue. Both enitities are approved from a legal perspective. I have raised 
some questions Through EOL Product Control here as to why Straits Resources 
Ltd (a mining company) wants to trade power but they are legally competent to 
do so.

Subject: Counterparty Approval List for 8/24/00

I have two Australian counterparties on the referenced list, State 
Electricity Commission of Victoria and Straits Resources Limited, and I 
haven't heard from you, and I need to get that list out.  When you send your 
approval, can you be specific as to whether they are approval for Australian 
products only, or all products.  Thanks!
