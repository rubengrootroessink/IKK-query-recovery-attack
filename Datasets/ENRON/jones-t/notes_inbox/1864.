This is a reminder to join Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Joe Sutton at an 
all-employee meeting at 10 a.m. (Houston time) Tuesday, Oct. 3, in the Hyatt 
Regency Houston's Imperial Ballroom. They will review Enron's financial and 
operating highlights and discuss in more detail the strategy behind Enron Net 
Works and our wholesale marketing efforts.  The meeting will be streamed live 
on IP-TV to employees in Houston, Omaha, Portland, New York, Calgary, 
Toronto, London, Stockholm, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.  We will also broadcast 
the meeting via video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Rio de 
Janeiro, Buenos Aires, San Juan and Dubai.  

For this meeting, the IP-TV viewer has been made available on an Enron 
intranet site.  On this site, viewers will be able to see a video stream of 
the speakers as well as the slideshow presentation.  To watch the meeting on
