This is the same thing.  They had commented back making the unilateral a 
bi-lateral.  The below are my comments sent back to them by Peter.

Mark,

We emailed an Enron One Way NDA to Global Crossing, Ltd. 11/22/00 at the 
request of Peter Feltman.  Was there something the matter with that form or 
is this for something totally different?
