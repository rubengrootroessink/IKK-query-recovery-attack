Hong Kong Chinese New Year Carnival
Hong Kong was a British colony for 100 years until its return to=20
Chinese rule in 1997, but the handover to communist China doesn't=20
seem to have damped the city's raging consumerism one bit. Indeed,=20
bustling Hong Kong still has the best shopping in Asia. But the=20
city's Chinese roots go deep, which you'll see if you visit during=20
the traditional wintertime New Year carnival. During this weeklong=20
festival, Hong Kong residents close out the old and ring in the new=20
year with parades, fireworks, and more horseracing than you can shake=20

***DESTINATION GUIDES***

Melbourne
Neighboring Sydney may have the Olympics, but to hear locals tell it,=20
Melbourne has just about everything else. Melbourne was founded by=20
the English. But today the city boasts an incredibly diverse ethnic=20
mix, with immigrants from Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and other Asian=20
countries rubbing shoulders with a large contingent of European=20
exiles. You'll find shopping and culture rivaling--some say=20
exceeding--that of more-traveled Sydney. Throw in the world's best=20
botanical gardens and the planet's oldest zoo, and you've got a=20
can't-miss Australian destination. Read more.
http://travelocity1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H1866585973X808635

St. Maarten/St. Martin
Island lore tells us it happened as the result of a land-grab between=20
a drunken Dutchman and an equally inebriated Frenchman. Whatever the=20
cause, the result is that quirky St.Maarten/St. Martin is one-half=20
French and one-half Dutch--although both sides co-exist so peacefully=20
you can cross from one to the other and never know it. (The fact that=20
virtually everyone speaks English helps with this effect.) Today the=20
island is a beach lover's paradise: 37 square miles of land harbor 36=20
pristine sandy beaches. But shopping and nightlife are also first=20
class on this unique island, where you'll find the best elements of=20
the cultures of two European countries. Read More.

Vancouver
Few cities have changed as dramatically in the last 15 years as has=20
Vancouver, British Columbia. For years Vancouver was a rowdy mill=20
town too far from the rest of civilization to be much of a tourist=20
draw. But the area has been dramatically reborn as a thriving,=20
cosmopolitan city. The explosion of technology companies has had much=20
to with this. So have Canada's liberal immigration laws, which have=20
brought waves of entrepreneurial newcomers--mostly from China, but=20
from all other corners of the world as well. The result is that=20
today's Vancouver is a true melting pot, where signs advertising=20
"Chinese-Canadian food" are as common as maple leaves. And should you=20
tire of the city (you won't), the stunning natural beauty of British=20
Columbia is just minutes away. Read More.
