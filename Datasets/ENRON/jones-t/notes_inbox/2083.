Dear Tana,

Re Japanese counterparties generally, we are preparing a list of documents to 
be submitted at time of application for passwords, as well as a check box for 
use by EOL staff in considering applications to deal with the various general 
legal issues which have been raised.  (The idea is that anything which falls 
out of the boxes comes to me for separate consideration but we trying to do 
it to minimize this need.) 

Re Japanese counterparties which want to do weather, the safest approach for 
a would-be counter party which is not a bank, securities company or insurance 
company (or at least does not have these words in its name) is for the 
application to come back to me in Tokyo for consideration in the context of 
the laws which prohibit gambling and what we can do to protect ourselves.  

Thanks.

Jane McBride

Per our conversation while you were here, attached is a list of all the 
Japanese counterparties that have requested Password Applications from 
EnronOnline.  Let me know you thoughts about this, and, as we discussed, 
online due diligence with respect to Japanese counterparties.
