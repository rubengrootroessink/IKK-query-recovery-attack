Stephanie

Here is more information that you will probably need from Enron Canada Corp. 
for Benson Petroleum Ltd.

fax # 403-233-8304
financial officer :  Graham Barnes

I did put in a phone call to Graham at Benson and Steve Bjornson at Vermilion 
to let them both know that they would be receiving information from Enron 
Houston in the next day or so.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Shawn Anderson
