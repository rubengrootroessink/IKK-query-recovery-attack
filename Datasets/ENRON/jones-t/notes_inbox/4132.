Hi Rex -

Given your extension of your NY trip, I will attempt today to set up and
propose a meeting for you in the NY area this week.

Review of your NDA doc is in process - I'll let you know when we're ready
to execute or if there are any changes requested from our legal department.

- Ron

Hello Ron --

My trip to the East Coast this week will extend through Friday the 20th.
I know that this Friday was one of the dates that you were considering
for a visit to Houston, but it appears that it will not work on this
end.  I hope this does not affect your planning.

Next week (except for Friday the 27th) looks good.  Do any days next
week work for you and your team?  Thanks.

-- Rex
