 Hi Tana,

 We didn't change the name of this counterparty. It was setup and verified as 
such in 1996.
 
 Upon receipt of Legal documentation from the Counterparty, in this case, 
City of Sikeston, 
 the name of this Tradename / Division can be changed by the Global 
Counterparty Team - - 
 (Cheryl Johnson or Bernice Rodriguez).

 Rgds.

Why did we change the name for the Board of Municipal Utilities of Sikeston, 
Mo.?  That is the way the counterparty's financial statement reads as well as 
how the name is set up on their website?  I also spoke to their lawyer and he 
said that is how they transact.
