Joe, I was just going through my documentation on this matter and it appears 
that I am still missing a fully executed copy of the interest rate swap 
confirm between ECC and RBC.  Do you have any idea of that confirm's status?  
If you have it, could you fax it to me?  I have also never seen executed 
copies of the ENA-Chase confirms, which I wouldn't mind getting to put in my 
closing binders.

Thanks

Greg
