Tana, I am attempting to put together a "spark spread" with Energy West 
Resources (AKA Energy West).  EPMI has a master in place with Energy West 
Resources Inc. their current and correct business name.   I understand we 
have an ISDA in place with Energy West Incorporated who is one and the 
same.   In addition to credit concerns, is there any problem doing a 
financial transaction with Energy West Resources Inc. under the name on the 
ISDA of Energy West Incorporated ?
