Tana-

I'm not sure.  We definitely received an approval on Lyke Corporation (dba 
Ripon Printers) but I'm not sure if that was sent to you on a different list 
as well.  Daishowa and Cariboo have since been killed.  That may be why we 
missed this one counterparty.  But I suppose it's possible we missed that 
list entirely.  Either way, that one counterparty, The Record Herald, is the 
only one I show left in a legal reviewing status.

Thanks,

Nikki

I'm not showing I looked at this list at all.  Isn't that right?

There was one missed counterparty on this approval from credit.  Please 
review Record Herald Publishing Company from the approval below.

Thanks,

Nicole
