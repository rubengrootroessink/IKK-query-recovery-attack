Ladies,

You are both correct.  We do not include mention of a Master Agreement like 
Lakeside on our Executed Master Agreement List.

But thanks for the reminder.

I don't think it should go on the list so traders don't make a mistake and 
trade under it.  Is that what you usually do Susan?

do we leave one trade only docs off the monthly list so as to not confuse 
people?
