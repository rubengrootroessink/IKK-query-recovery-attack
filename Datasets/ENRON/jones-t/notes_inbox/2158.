We have copies of Aussie ISDAs, which ones do you need??
And, what other additional info is required??

The Australia office gave me a list of their masters and I have entered
them into the database.  We still don't have copies.  Further, I don't know
more than if it's executed and the date.   They need to flesh out the
additional information that is required.
