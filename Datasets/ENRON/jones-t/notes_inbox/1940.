One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God,
"Lord, I have a problem."

"What's the problem, Eve?"

"Lord, I know you created me and provided this
beautiful garden, and all of these wonderful animals, and
that hilarious comedic snake, but I'm just not happy."

"Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.

"Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples."

"Well, in that case, I have a solution.  I shall
create a man for you."

"What is a man?"

"A flawed creature, with many bad traits.  He will
lie, cheat and be vain. He will revel in childish things
like fighting and throwing a ball about. He will be witless,
so he will need your advice to think properly.  But I
will create him in such a way that he will satisfy
your physical needs."

"Sounds great," replies Eve, with one eyebrow raised.

"You may have this man on one condition."

"What is that, Lord?"

"Because he will be proud, arrogant and self-admiring, you
must let him believe that I made him first.  It will be our
little secret...you know, woman to woman."
