Tana,

I don't understand, what do you mean by "log in an email"?

Anyway, I got you message, and I got the World Series thing (although I had
already received

Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving, I can testify that it was
one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I've ever had (I not gonna tell them 
that,
I don't want them getting swell heads).

Ma said she had a great time in Houston, She was happy to see yourself, as 
well
as C & D.  I think she likes her special room in your house.

Your gonna be the first to see the new baby (woudn't it be wierd if the baby
gets botn on Jan 5th?)

Why didn't Craig show Ma his appartment?

What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben (he was almost
shocked)?

Are you coming for Xmas?

Gotta go for now.

Love ya.

Kyle
