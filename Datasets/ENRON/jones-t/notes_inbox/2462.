Please prepare our standard confidentiality agreement for the counterparty 
below.  Please deliver to Dick Robinson.  The agreement should read such that 
it will also be effective if we view the financials at their office (instead 
of receiving a hard copy of the statements).  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks!
