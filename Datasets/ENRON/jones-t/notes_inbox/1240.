Frank and Tom:

I believe the instructions below quoting EOL and Credit are incorrect.

If the credit status of a counterparty changes and they "click" to execute an 
online GTC, then our Global system should reflect the current online GTC and 
not the previous online GTC. 

Right?

Just an FYI. Per EOL & Credit, if we already have an Online GTC w/Collateral 
& the credit status of the counterparty is amended so that they no longer 
require collateral - - - - - there is no need to establish a new OnLine GTC. 
The OnLine GTC w/Collateral remains the preferred online GTC since a 
collateral agreement was previously in place. HOWEVER, the reverse DOES NOT 
hold true - - - - If credit status is amended so that the counterparty does 
require collateral - - - - a new GTC w/Collateral MUST BE established. Rule 
of thumb, collateral is better than no collateral if it has ever been 
required.

In summary, if you receive a GTC request for an OnLine GTC without collateral 
be sure to check available contracts for an Online GTC w/Collateral first. If 
one is already in place, DO NOT set-up a new GTC. Notify Deal Validation to 
use the OnLine GTC w/Collateral according to the above mentioned note.

Thank you!
Cyndie
