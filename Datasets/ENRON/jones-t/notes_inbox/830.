Tana -- Please call me about this. This sub-contractor of DMB&B (our ad 
agency) is doing some work for us through DMB&B.  I had sent them the 
confidentiality agreement that you had helped me create.  They have made some 
changes that need to be reviewed by our attorney.

Thanks

IMP legal would like to make the following changes to the confidentially 
agreement.

I really don't couldn't figure out what the issues were, but take a look.

Thanks.

Monica

Monica,

Further to our conversation yesterday, please find attached my suggested 
changes for the Confidentiality agreement. I have used strike-out to indicate 
the changes, and hope that this will satisfy Enron.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks and kind regards

Philip
