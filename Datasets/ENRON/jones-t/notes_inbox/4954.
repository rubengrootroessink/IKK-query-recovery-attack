Mark--Pursuant to our discussion, I can confirm that Prebon Marshall Yamane
(UK) Limited is an affiliate of Prebon Energy Inc. ("Prebon Energy").  The
Fee Agreement and the BETA between Prebon Energy and EnronOnline LLC define
"Broker" as Prebon Energy and its affiliates.  Consequently, we understand
and agree that Prebon Marshall Yamane (UK) Limited's access to the United
Kingdom and European Products on EOL will be subject to, and governed by,
the same Fee Agreement and BETA as is applicable to Prebon Energy's access
to the North American Products on EOL.  Please let me know if you have any
further questions.  

Regards.
