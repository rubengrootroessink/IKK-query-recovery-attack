Tana, the products listed below (as I understand) comprise the initial
products for the EOL roll-out.  It is unusual that ECTRIC, rather than ENA,
will be the Enron party, even with respect to transactions that will be
confirmed out of the U.S.  This is something Mark and I (as well as tax and
credit) have scrubbed at length and approved.


Enron principal counterparty for each: ECTRIC
Each product is a financially-settled swap (NO OPTIONS)

(1) Coffee swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(2) Coffee swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from
London)
(3) Coffee basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from
Houston)
(4) Sugar swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(5) Sugar swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from
London)
(6) Sugar basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from
Houston)
(7) Cocoa swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(8) Cocoa swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from
London)
(9) Cocoa basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from
Houston)

I will immediately look into whether there would be special restrictions
for swaps on coffee, sugar and cocoa with respect to Australian, Singapore
and Hong Kong counterparties (I think these are the three most likely non
U.S./European jurisdictions at this point)
