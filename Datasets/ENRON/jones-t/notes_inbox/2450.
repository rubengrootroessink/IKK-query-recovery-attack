Lee:

Dave Samuels asked me to review Sapient's form of NDA that you forwarded to 
him on 11/3.  Attached please find my requested changes to the NDA.  I have 
red-lined my comments against the version you sent Dave.  

I look forward to discussing the revised NDA with you at your earliest 
convenience.  If there are no requested changes, let me know and I will have 
a finalized version executed and sent to you.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen
