Leslie:

I enjoyed our chat a few minutes ago.  I am looking forward to working with 
you and Tana Jones on NDA's.

Here is the NDA that Nortel sent us a week or so ago.  At this point, it 
would probably be best if we worked off their form.  I am trying to set up a 
meeting with them on Wednesday afternoon, October 18, and I will need this 
NDA executed from our side before that meeting.  Please review it and let me 
know if you have comments or questions.

Thanks for your help.  What is Tana's e-mail address?  I couldn't find her in 
the system.  I'd like to CC her on our conversations.

Best regards,

Mike

Mike,

Attached is the Non-Disclosure Aggreement which needs to be signed.  Brian
Clarke asked me to set up a 2-hour conference call next week with you and
anyone else you would like to bring from Enron.  Please give me a call.
Thanks!
