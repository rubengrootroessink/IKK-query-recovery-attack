I can't believe with such a wonderful bandwidth trading agreement that we 
have, not to mention the lovely people we work with, that ISDAs are your 
first love.  As far as what THAT paralegal has to say, it seems to me that 
SOMEONE is getting scared that the new kids on the block might reach a 
monumental number of signed masters before her group does.  Anyway, she 
should not be worrying about the execution numbers, but should be concerned 
with giving attention to her "special projects", whatever they might be!

My compensation is directly affected by the success of EBS - go figure!  To 
be fair, I am also facilitating a significant number of ISDAs which of course 
are my first love.  If you are looking for unbiased, Bill may be your best 
bet as he is probably indifferent between ENA, EPMI, EBS, EES, etc as his 
compensation is affected by all of them!!

I could not believe my ears when I heard from Ms. Heard that you are working 
covertly behind the scenes to ensure a Broadband win to the signed master 
competition.   I would think that Credit would have no biased interest in the 
outcome of this race.  Could such slanderous allegations be true?
