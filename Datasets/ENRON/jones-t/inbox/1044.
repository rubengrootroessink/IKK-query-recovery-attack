Effective Wednesday, November 21, 2002, the two vans running from One North

cancelled.

The Battery Park City Authority (B.P.C.A.) is running free shuttle buses
Southbound leaving Chambers Street and Northbound leaving Bowling Green.
Information on these shuttle buses have been posted in the lobby and near
the elevators in the building.

The hours of operation are as follows:

Green
Weekdays	6:00 a.m. - 11:00 p.m.		6:14 a.m. - 11:14 p.m.

Sunday	7:00 a.m. - 11:00 p.m.		7:14 a.m. - 11:14 p.m.


These shuttle buses effectively replicate the coverage provided by the vans.
