Mark -

Pursuant to your voice mail message, attached is a copy of the NDA I prepared for VMAC with CL.  If you need a document of this nature for EOL, please let me know and our office can prepare it and forward it for your use.  The Legal Dept. prepares and forwards NDA's so that we can track them and ensure terms are legally acceptable.

Mark
