I spoke with John Weiss (630-836-5687) @ BP Exploration & Oil Inc. (cpid #668) and he informed me that effective October 1, 2001 they will be changing the name of the company. The new entity is going to be BP Products North America Inc. 

We will need to coordinate BP Products coming on EOL and BP Exploration being shut down.

From the legal standpoint, we have a master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc. and need to know how that will follow the new company.
