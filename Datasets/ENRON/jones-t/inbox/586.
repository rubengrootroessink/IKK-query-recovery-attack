Good morning wine lovers,

I am so excited about the following list of wines that I can hardly contain
myself.  It appears that all the hard work I am doing to procure the best
wines possible is beginning to be recognized by the Wine
Spectator.  Remember something, though: with reviews like these, the wines
listed below are EXTREMELY LIMITED.  I suggest calling me ASAP to reserve a
few bottles before they are just a memory.

    * Champagne Diebolt-Vallois Brut Blanc de Blanc 1995 (90 points,
Spectator) $61.50 each
    * Carillon Puligny-Montrachet Champs Canet 1999 (95 points, Spectator)

    * F & L Pillot Chassagne-Montrachet 1998 (90 points, Spectator) $57.50
each
    * F & L Pillot Puligny Montrachet Noyers Brets 1998 (91 points,

points, Spectator) $39.50 each
    * Zind Humbrecht Pinot D'Alsace 1999 (87 points, Tanzer) $27.50 each

new arrivals, please take a moment and visit us at www.christopherswine.com

We have our entire calendar of events posted.  You will notice that the
tastings are now scheduled for Thursday nights.  This is due to the ever
increasing amount of private parties we are now hosting.  Some of the
private parties we are hosting include office parties, bridal showers,
corporate meetings, seated, multi course dinners, and "Wine & Dash"
tastings for local pharmaceutical companies.  If you are interested in
booking your own event, give me a call.  We have plenty of space and lots
of great wines.  We even have our own catering company to complete the event.

Well, that's about it for this week.  Call soon, lots going on!!!

Your friend in wine,
Christopher
