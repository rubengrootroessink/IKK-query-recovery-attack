YOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK THIS OUT, IT IS A BLAST!!!
I have recently re-released some highly rated wines.  The following wines were reviewed by Parker in recent issues of his publication, THE WINE ADVOCATE.  Scores and availability are listed.  Call us as soon as you decide, these will move very fast:
Parker on the 1996 wines from Piedmont:
        "1996 has turned out to be a classic vintage along the lines as such years as 1989, 1978 & 1971.  Concentrated, long-lived, majestic wines that are firm and closed in their youth but blossom beautifully with aging are the rule when it comes to 1996 Barbaresco and Barolo." 
Brovia 1996 Barolo "Ca Mia" single vineyard Barolo $80 each (6 bottles available) 

And, from issue #119 of Parker's Wine Advocate: 
Abadia Retuerta 1996 Cuvee Palomar (from Spain, a blend of 50% Tempranillo & 50% Cabernet)  

                92+ points, $52 each, 9 bottles available 
Abadia Retuerta 1996 Cuvee Campanario (from Spain, 100%  Tempranillo) 

                93+ points, $58 each, 3 bottles available 
Remirez de Ganuza Rioja Old Vines Unfiltered (from Spain, mostly Tempranillo) 

                92 points, $62.50 each, 6 bottles available
As a quick note, I would like to add that I have been stashing some very amazing wines in our extremely cold storage area here at Christopher's since I opened.  Now that these wines are approaching their optimum drinking windows, I thought it a good time to begin showing them to all of you.  Thanks to the ratings by Parker, though, the wines I will be offering on this basis are very limited.  So please call me soon if you would like to partake of these well-cellared, highly rated wines.
That's it for this week.  We look forward to seeing all of you soon.
