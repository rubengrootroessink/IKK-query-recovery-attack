An Israeli friend recently informed me that the UK fought the Islamic terrorist attacks by burying the criminals with a pig.  Apparently the Islamic belief is that if ones' body is buried with a pig (because they are considered unclean) their soul will go to hell.  I did a little research into this subject matter and found it to be true. This got me thinking.  If we put a baby pig on every airline flight then all suicide terrorists would abort their missions as they would not want their souls to go to hell.  Additionally, if we drop-shipped, oh say, 100,000 pigs into Afghanistan I think our recon and assault efforts may be more successful.  Apparently Muslims dislike the very sight of pigs A LOT!  They are also adamantly opposed to alcohol, thus we spike their water supply with a few thousand gallons of cosmopolitans, get them shit-faced, and turn the pigs loose.  The  war would be over in a weekend.  ...Just a thought.
