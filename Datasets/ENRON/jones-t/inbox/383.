Tana,

Attached you will find the comments on the NDA from BoozAllen Hamilton.  Any chance we could get this spun back to them today?  

I provided you with the wrong email address for Eduardo yesterday -- the correct address is:

alvarez_eduardo@bah.com


Regards,
Ross

Eduardo,

Sal is out of the office today and tomorrow.  I am also an attorney for
Booz Allen and work with Sal in New York.

I have reviewed the NDA; my recommended revisions are enclosed.
