Hi Tana

I am putting on the Financial Trading Agreements database ISDAs that are currently under negotiation and have a couple of questions (sorry Matt is away today).

Where the Credit Contact is not listed under the arrows how do I add a new one? I have the same problem with an Enron entity - EFET LLC is not on there.

Hope you are surviving OK over there.

Regards
Anna
