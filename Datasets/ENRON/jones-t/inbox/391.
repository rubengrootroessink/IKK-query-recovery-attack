		RE:	Registration for the NYMEX ACCESS
 Internet-Based
Trading Platform
_________________________________________________________________

During the week of October 8-12, tables were set up on both the NYMEX  and
COMEX Division trading floors to distribute applications to members to
register as users of the new NYMEX ACCESS
 trading platform, which has been
internet-based since September 14. Many members have already completed these
applications and are approved.

The specific application requirements for registration differ according to
individual membership designations. The applications have been sorted
according to the following:

*	Previously approved NYMEX ACCESS
 users
*	Non-previously approved NYMEX ACCESS
 users who are seat owners
*	Non-previously approved NYMEX ACCESS
 users who are seat leasees

If you have not already obtained the appropriate application, you can do so
by contacting Bridget DelPlato in the membership department at 212-299-2375.
Any completed applications should be returned to the membership department
as well.

Members are encouraged to complete these applications in the event that
there is any interruption to the operation of the trading facility and a
decision is made to temporarily utilize the NYMEX ACCESS
 system as a
substitute.
