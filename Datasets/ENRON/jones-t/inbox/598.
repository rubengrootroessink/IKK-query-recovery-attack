I don't find a file for either one of these companies.  I also checked with Laine and she said she has no recollection of them either.  I will be more than glad to help you get NDAs in place with both of these companies if you wish.  Let me know if you would like me to help.  Thanks.

Mark,

Mark Greenberg asked me to check with you to see if Enron Corp. ever got Confidentiality Agreements in place with either True Exchange or BizBots?  Can you please let me know.  Thanks!
