RE: 		EXCHANGE EXTENDS ABBREVIATED TRADING HOURS INDEFINITELY

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would extend
the abbreviated trading hours currently in place indefinitely.

The Exchange board made this decision in light of continued commuting
concerns and the heavier-than-normal volumes experienced by the Exchange,
despite the reduced hours.

Trading hours are as follows:
