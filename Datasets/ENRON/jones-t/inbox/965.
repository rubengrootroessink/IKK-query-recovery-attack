Spoke to Carol and Tanya.  They suggested you use our standard credit support annex template.

Subject:	language for SoCal Margin Agreement
Importance:	High

Please send me ASAP a sample agreement that contains good language for the credit rating provision and the timing of the payment of the Margin Call.

I hope to have a proposed re-write to send to SoCal with our conversation tomorrow.

Thanks.

Sarah
