Bernice,

I apologize for the delay in responding to your comments to our Confidentiality agreement.  I have accepted most of your changes, with the only substantive exception being the term.  We would like the term to be one year from the date of disclosure.  If you would like to discuss this further, please give me a call.  If this form is acceptable to you, please let me know and we will have an execution copy forwarded to you.


Thanks, Anne

I forwarded the CA format to one of the EOL applicants on 8/9.  The company has some requested changes to the format.  Would you please let me know if the changes are acceptable.
