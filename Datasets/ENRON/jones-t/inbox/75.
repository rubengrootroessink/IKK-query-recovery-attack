Lance,

Can you have your install people mark with a yellow sticky or something where the analog lines for the PCs are located.  Much thanks!

Tana, 

The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

We will prepare 32 Thursday.
