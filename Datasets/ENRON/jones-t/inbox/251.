We are considering them to re-design our web site. Both The Adcetera Group and Organic Inc. are submitting proposals to work on the project and we need them to be under the same NDA. It would be great if you could e-mail the agreement. Pagogh Cho is our main contact and can distribute the agreements to the other people on the list. His e-mail address is pcho@adcetera.com. Thanks for your help.

Jennifer
