Per our conversation last week, please ensure that Mark Taylor and I are
your initial point of contact with respect to compliance with and/or
violations by Enron North America Corp. with respect to NYMEX position
limits.  Please fax Mark Taylor a copy of any correspondence with
respect to our position limits.  Your assistance with this will help us
monitor and maintain Enron's compliance with NYMEX rules. In addition,
if you are able to give us a call when you see an issue ahead, we may
well be able to resolve it before it becomes a problem.
