Please let me know where this NDA stands.  I want to get it out to 2Advanced this morning so they can look it over.

Thanks.

Please provide me with the necessary information on the company (e.g., contact name, address, etc.).  I'll make sure that we get the confidentiality agreement moving forward.

Thanks.
