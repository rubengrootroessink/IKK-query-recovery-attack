The attached file contains changes, prepared by Experian's attorneys, to the NDA we sent last week.  Their legal contact is Jeannine Ford.  Jeannine's email address is Jeannine.Ford@experian.com.  Please work directly with her to resolve outstanding issues.  

We are scheduled to meet with Experian Tuesday 11/6, to discuss the application of their data.  The NDA needs to be in place by that time.

Please contact me with any questions.

I'm sure you did not expect this, but our legal department has made some
suggested changes to your standard non disclosure agreement. They prepared them
in the form of an Addedum and I am attaching it for your review. Please call me
if we need to get the legal teams talking.
