Mary,

I believe that you have the original for our contract with Intercontinental Exchange. Can you please take care of making the following correction to that contract? If you do not have the contract, please let me know so I can make sure that I get this to the right person.

Thanks,
Judy

Dear Ms. Jean Mrha,

Your firm has an ETA with us.  On our original on page six the effective
date was left off.  Please insert 7-9-01 as this date on your original.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.
