Leslie,

I just spoke with the gas futures trader at TEA and he would like to trade on EnronOnline, but can't due to ISDA not being in place.  
I know  they trade on behalf of others, but is there anything we can to do accommodate them, in order to migrate their gas business to EOL ?

Thanks for you assistance.

T.
