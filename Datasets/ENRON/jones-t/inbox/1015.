Alan -

Attached is a form confidentiality agreement for your discussions with CommodityLogic (Tom Gros).  Since information being shared is fairly one-sided, the agreement is drawn to provide the most protection possible for CommodityLogic.  

I have also forwarded this to Geoffrey for his review and comment.

Let me know what comments, questions or concerns either of you may have.

Thanks.

Mark
