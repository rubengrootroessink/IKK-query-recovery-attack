Lorie -

Attached for your review is a first draft of a proposed LOI for Chisholm.  I have added provisions that mirror the items laid out in the product description information as these are the types of things that will be addressed in the final definitive agreements.

Please review at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.

Mark
