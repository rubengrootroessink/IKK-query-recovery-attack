Looks okay.  Are you going to e-mail me a clean set of docs so that I can
send them to Mahonia (we need to change all references from Sept. 27 to
Sept.28)?  The authorized signatory will apparently only be available there
in the morning.

     John

     Further to our discussions I have discussed the tax situation with the
     Directors of Mahonia Limited and they have advised that:

     Mahonia Limited has taken no tax or legal advice in connection with
     the
     transaction and is not represented in the US by US council.  However,
     the
     Directors believe that Mahonia Limited is only carrying on a trade or
     business in the island of Jersey and accordingly the applicable law is
     that
     of the island of Jersey and there is no withholding tax under Jersey
     Law.

     They are happy to provide the representations detailed in Annex A to
     the
     ENAC Swap and to complete the W8-ben form on the basis of their
     understanding as described above.

     Kind regards

     Yours sincerely
     For and on behalf of
     Mourant & Co. Secretaries Limited

     Julie Carter
