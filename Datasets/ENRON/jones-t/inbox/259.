Tanya/Jay,
I am forwarding to you documentation from Westport Resources Corporation regarding the merger with Belco Oil & Gas.  As you know, we have existing financial agreements with both companies, as identified below:

Belco Oil & Gas - Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated July 8, 1999, which has unlimited credit
Westport Oil & Gas Company, Inc. - ISDA Master Agreement dated March 17, 1998

The Counterparty wants to retain the Belco Master.  Please let me know what Credit wants to do.

Stephanie
