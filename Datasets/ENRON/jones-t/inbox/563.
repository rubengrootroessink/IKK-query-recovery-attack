Tana -

The language that we need for the subject matter of the NDA is ----   "discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving transactions generated by the EnronOnline platform."  

With this change, I believe the VMAC document for Marc is ready to go.

Thanks.

Mark

Mark,

Thanks for your comments. I agree with you on the new text. We will not need to release counterparty data in the future. Can you send the agreement out and let me know when it is out to give them a call. With the latest developments this has really become a priority because it can potentially free up cash.

I made the modifications to the VMAC document.  While I understand the business purpose, because we do not want EOL is not and we do not want it to be considered a clearing mechanism, we want to make sure document we prepare do not made these type of references.  As these discussions relate to the platform and the manner in which it operates, would you be comfortable with :  ... would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving transactions generated by the EnronOnline platform."  If this works, we can implement this language and get the agreement out.

Also, if we are going to discuss anything related to specific transactions with any counterparties or, alternatively, if discussions with VMAC progress to the point where it is contemplated that counterparty information may be released, please remember that this information is confidential and cannot be released to any third party by Enron without the express written consent of the counterparty.

Tana, 


It seems like the NDA was drafted for an alternative platform. I would appreciate if you could modify "EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information a possible transaction or other business relationship involving an alternative trading platform for certain Enron transactions"  

for something along the lines of :"EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving clearing or credit wrapping of EnronOnline transactions."

Thank you, 

Marc Eichmann

Mark, 

We will be discussing a clearing project with them. They would basically provide our customers on EnronOnline an alternative to trade through a cleared mechanism, at a fee to VMAC.

The contact name is 

J. Scott Perry - President & COO
VMAC
350 Fifth Avenue - The Empire State Building
Suite 5620
New York, New York 10118
Email: sperry@vmac.com

When do you think that we can have it sent? 

Marc

Marc -

Please provide me with a brief description of the project or work that is going to be discussed with VMAC and a contact name/e-mail address.  We will do the necessary conflict check and send the agreement to VMAC directly.

Thanks.

Marc,

Thanks for your prompt response. I currently need the same NDA modified for Enron Net Works. Thanks for your help.

Pursuant to your voice mail message, attached is a copy of the NDA I prepared for VMAC with CL.  If you need a document of this nature for EOL, please let me know and our office can prepare it and forward it for your use.  The Legal Dept. prepares and forwards NDA's so that we can track them and ensure terms are legally acceptable.

Mark
