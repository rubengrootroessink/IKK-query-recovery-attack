Tana, I have reviewed and revised the contract list you sent to me and attach my revision, blacklined to show the changes from the document you sent to me this morning.  There were a number of errors in the list as it pertained to Canada.  Of particular note is the inclusion in the list of a number of agreements with either Enron Oil Canada Ltd. (which was part of what is now EOG) or EOTT Canada.  As far as I am aware, Enron Corp. is no longer in any way affiliated or associated with either EOG or EOTT, having divested itself of any interest in either, and Enron Canada certainly has no knowledge of, involvement with or records pertaining to any of those agreements.  I do not believe that they should be included in any master netting agreement between BP and Enron.

In addition, it appears that they have listed the master physical gas agreement with ECC twice (I have deleted the first reference, being document number one) and they did not include the IT physical gas agreement with ECC, which I have added.

I hope this helps.

Thanks
Greg

Can you take a look at all the Canadian Agreements listed on this list provided to us by BP and verify whether these agreements exist in Canada?

Tana, the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier is the 3rd last agreement on their list [so I'm not sure what #1 on their list is].  I'm not sure what the 2nd and 3rd agreements on their list are either.

We do, however, have an Interruptible Agreement dated May 26/94 [not on their list] and a Firm (<31 Day) Gas P/S Agreement dated August 1/94 [which is, I think, #5 on their list] with Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. (now BP Canada Energy Company).  Do you want copies of these agreements?

I don't know what the other agreements are.

Sharon,

BP prepared a list of all the agreements they thought we had in place.  You might want to do a quick check and make sure that you are not missing any Canadian contracts they might have listed on this list.

THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE!
