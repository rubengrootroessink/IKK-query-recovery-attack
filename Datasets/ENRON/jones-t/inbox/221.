Tana -

Please see the below document.  It appears to be the version of the APB Europe BETA that we were looking for.  Please compare it to the APB Energy US agreement and let me know if they are consistent.

Thanks.

Mark

Bob,

Here is the revised BETA for Europe.  The changes reflect the revised
language that Mark originally provided to the original BETA with APB Energy,
Inc.  My understanding is that there has been no agreement yet on what the
fee should be; so, I have made no comment or change to that language at this
point, while you and Chris discuss this issue.

My understanding is that there should be only one letter of credit for all
APB entities.  Also keep in mind that before too long the letter of credit,
and the APB Energy, Inc. BETA and Fee Agreement, will need to be in the name
of APB Energy Intl. LLC, which will be the successor to the operations of
APB Energy, Inc. as a result of a business acquisitin we soon hope to
complete.

If you have questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Joe Wright

Joe,

Chris and I discussed next steps for the Broker Client agreements for
Europe.  We concluded that it would be best to proceed with finalizing
documents in anticipation of your acquisition in Europe.  Chris
indicated that you had amended the draft that Mark sent.  Could you
please send us the document for review?

Thanks
