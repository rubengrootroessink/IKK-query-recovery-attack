Dear Mark:

I will be away from the office next week, returning on Monday, October 29, 2001.   If you have execution copies of our agreement for EnronOnLine.  During that time, my colleague Steve Kessler is the Deutsche Bank attorney who will be looking after the execution of these papers, assisted by my assistant Annette Rosario.
Steve's no. is 212.469.8202; Annette's is 212.469.7332.
