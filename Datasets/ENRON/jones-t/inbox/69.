Tana,

Per my voice mail, I received a call from Gregg Thompson with Coast energy Canada, and US.  He has several questions regarding the base contract that they have with Enron, and EnronOnline.  For example, if their users logged into EOL under Coast Canada, and transacted on an US product, what underlying agreement would be governed?  From my conversation with Gregg, I believe that they are trying to figure out  what contract applies to what entity, when transacted on EOL.  If you could give them a call they would really appreciate it.  Thanks for your time.



He can be reached at 281-274-7690
Thanks
TARA
