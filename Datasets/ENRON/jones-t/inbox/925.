Subject:	Master Netting Agreement- AEP Companies

We are trying to get a Master Netting Agreement in place tomorrow with various AEP companies.  ECTRIC has several trading agreements in place with AEP entities.  We need someone in London to verify that we are referencing the ECTRIC agreements correctly in the Master Netting Agreement.  I am faxing the first two pages of the Master Netting Agreement to Edmund's attention at fax number 011-44 20-7783-8667.  Can one of you please take a look at this in the morning and verify that the information referenced in the agreement is correct since we do not have a copy of your agreements.

Much thanks!
