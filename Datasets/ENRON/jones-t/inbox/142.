Dear Ms Saarnilahti and Mr Lehtinen

I understand that Nordea has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with our affiliate Enron North America Corp.  Our understanding is that this ISDA is subject to a confidentiality provision.   I should be grateful if you could confirm to my colleague Tana Jones that a copy of the Enron North America Corp. ISDA can be released to me.  This will enable us to use that ISDA as a base for putting in place an ISDA between Nordea and Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited.

If you would like to discuss this please feel free to call me on 44 207 783 2487.
regards
Janet Wood
