A fabulous good morning wine lovers,
Well, it is that time of year again.  I hope all of you have been watching =
your food intake like I have, because I certainly intend to eat my fair sha=
re of the Thanksgiving feast!!!  And that brings me to the most asked quest=
ion from last weekend, "Hey, Christopher, with all this great wine, what wi=
ll YOU be drinking on Thanksgiving?"  Before I reveal my T-day sampler case=
, I wanted to let you know what types of food we will pairing these wines w=
ith.  We usually start with some type of shellfish, some mild, some spicy. =
 For my family and friends who don't do shellfish, we also offer some tradi=
tional stuff such as the best stuffed eggs I have ever tasted (thanks to Ma=
rtha, don't you know), and assorted cheeses and crackers.  Then comes the m=
ain course: TUR-DUC-KEN (always from our friends at La Boucherie), with all=
 the 'fixins': jalepeno cornbread stuffing, traditional stuffing with sage,=
 and a pile of different veggies.  Naturally, dessert is prepared, but we u=
sually stick to pretty simple, fairly tame ones, like pumpkin pie or pumpki=
n something.  This is where the Riesling from the sampler case comes in.  I=
t is also amazing with the shellfish.  To make this meal a smashing success=
, I have selected the following sampler case of 12 bottles:
