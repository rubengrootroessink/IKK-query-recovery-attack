Mary Cook wants me to put together a list of people's home ph, cell no's/pagers, in case we need to call in help during the holidays.  Can you provide me with your info in case we get surprised and have to set up additonal data rooms.

Much thanks!

Lance,

I just spoke to Mary Cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today.  Is that doable?

		Lance,

		Can you have your install people mark with a yellow sticky or something where the analog lines for the PCs are located.  Much thanks!

					Tana, 

					The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

					We will prepare 32 Thursday.
