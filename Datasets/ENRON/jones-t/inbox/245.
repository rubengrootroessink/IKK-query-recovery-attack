Tana Jones,
Re: yours of October 2, 2001

Thank you for your email.

I have included you and Mark Taylor as carbon copy contacts for position
limit matters.

As per our procedures, our "initial" contact will continue to be the person
who signed and certified the Application for Exemptions for Enron North
America Corp.. We will, however, send copies to you at the same time the
original letter is sent.

Anthony V. Densieski
