Remember that the power and gas amendments look on their face to be identical documents, and you have to read very closely to see that they are indeed different.  Are we sure that we are not looking at 2 different docs--a gas one and a power one--and concluding that they are the same and therefore that we are missing one?

Documentum just called back.  They said they manually reviewed everything that has not yet been scanned into the system and cannot find any Agreements or Amendments for New Power Company.

I have checked with Karen Cordova since her initials are on the document to see if possibly she had any extra documents, and she does not.  I doubt we will be able to get an executed copy of this Amendment.
