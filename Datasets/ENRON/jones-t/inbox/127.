I may have asked you about the below, but I do not recall.  Do you have any information about this counterparty?

I am taking over for Janet Wallis in the Texas region. We have been working with Austin Energy to get them online with EnronOnline. I understand there may be an issue with the contract. Can you update me on the problems? I would like to get them online soon.
Thanks.
