Paul -
 
Attached is a redlined version of the  agreement.  I have basically accepted all of Williams' comments, but felt  the agreement needed to be cleaned-up a bit.  The changes are all generic  in nature and should be easily accepted by Williams.  If this is the case,  please work with Tana Jones (x33399) to have the agreement properly initialed by  Legal before signed by Tom.  If no other changes are made, I am advising  Tana to initial this document on my behalf so that Tom can sign.
 
If you should need me tomorrow (later today) please  call me on my cell at 713-444-8234.
 
Mark

Mark,
 
Attached is the redline Beta agreement from  Williams.  Tom agreed to change the non-disclosure period to six  months.  We are trying to turn this around quickly so the users can test  InvoiceLogic beginning Friday.  
 
thanks

 Paul,  
         I  received your last version of the contract from Gary Binney. After comparing the  document to the redline that I sent you I see that several of our suggestedc  hanges were not addressed. If you do not agree to the changes please respond  with the reasons so. I have prepared a new redline version of the document,i  ncorporating some of your changes.  Just trying to make it easy for us all  to tell what has changed from the original agreement. It would be helpful if you  when you respond you send redline comments, if possible. 
        Please review  and then respond to me with your comments. Thanks.
