We signed the document on Friday last week and sent it to them.  It will need to be forwarded to there office in Norway for signature.  Once we have a signed copy we will forward you a copy and request that you give them execute status on the specified products.

Hi Bob

I was wondering if you had copies of the signed BETA agreement for Norwegian Energy Brokers AS and First Energy Brokers AS. If you could let me know, it would be most appreciated.

Many thanks and best regards
