Good morning wine lovers,
I was so excited to receive the following wines last week, that I came in on Sunday to put this sampler together.  In this fabulous case of 12 bottles, you will find some of the most exciting, unbelievably well-priced Cabernets, Merlots and Chardonnays that I have tasted in years.  By the way, in case anyone has forgotten, the holidays are coming.  And, if your family and friends are like mine, you will need lots of great wines for the Thanksgiving dinner.  These wines will go so well with your turkey day!!!  Regardless of your main course of choice, get one of these cases (or more if you like) and enjoy the great email price while they last.

OUR GREATEST VALUE SAMPLER CASE TO DATE (2 BTLS OF EACH): 

Baron Foulon Chardonnay Loire Valley 2000 (New Zealand wine maker, French vineyard, delicious) 87 points $12.50 each 
Baron Foulon Merlot 1999 (elegant, ripe, wonderful fruit) 87 points $12.50 each 
Baron Foulon Cabernet 1998 (amazing vintage, well structured, spicy) 87 points $12.50 each 
L'Enclave des Papes Cabernet 2000 (surprising depth, mature fruit components) 87 points $12.50 each 
Vina Sardasol Merlot Crianza 1997 (WOW, mint, spice eucalyptus, wild berries) 87 points $15.00 each 
Vina Sardasol Cabernet Crianza 1995 (how did they get so much flavor at this price?!) 88 points $15.00 each 

Normally this case is a steal at $160.00.
