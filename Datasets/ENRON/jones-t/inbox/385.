I am meeting with Eduardo at 9:30am on Monday, so is there any way someone can look at it today.  I am fine with it being finalized on Monday morning before my meeting, but if there is a problem with their revised language -- need to address that today.  Please let me know.

Thanks
Ross

Not unless it's critical.  All the attorneys are out at an offsite today.  Can this wait til Monday or is this critical?

Tana,

Attached you will find the comments on the NDA from BoozAllen Hamilton.  Any chance we could get this spun back to them today?  

I provided you with the wrong email address for Eduardo yesterday -- the correct address is:

alvarez_eduardo@bah.com


Regards,
Ross
