NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS A MODIFIED
PROPRIETARY FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM


At its meeting on December 27, 2001, the NYMEX Board of Directors determined
to extend, with certain modifications, the current Proprietary Fee Reduction
Program ("Program") through December 2002.

Effective trade date January 2, 2002, Member Firms and individual members
who own seats will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 6 cents per
round turn (3 cents per trade side).

Individual members who lease their seats, or hold a membership under an ABC
Agreement, will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 1.25 cents per
round turn (.625 cents per trade side).

Clearing Members who clear Member Firm trades should adjust their billing
systems accordingly.

Clearing Members clearing floor members' accounts should NOT adjust their
billing systems for such individual members.  NYMEX issues payments directly
to individual members based upon their trading activity.

Floor members who execute Type 3 trades are asked to pay special attention
to NYMEX Rule 6.18 (B) (ii), requiring the executing member to report the
alpha code (badge symbol) of the receiving member on PTS.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact M. Dawn
Lowe or Donna Talamo at (212) 299-2370.
