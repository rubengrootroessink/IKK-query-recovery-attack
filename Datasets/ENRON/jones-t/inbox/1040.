Tana,

In trying to complete my assignment on the NETCO Adoption Agreements, I have found that 11 Gas, 6 Power and 6 Financial Adoption Agreements remain outstanding.  Before "bothering" the people assigned to complete the Adoption Agreements, I would appreciate your checking your records to determine the following:

1.	Was the particular Master noted on the attached spreadsheet in fact identified and/or found and given to someone?
2.	If the Master was identified/found, was it reassigned to another person than that named on the attached spreadsheet.

Thanks for your help in getting this all figured out.

Steve
