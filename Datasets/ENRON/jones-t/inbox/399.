Tana -

Below is the final approval from Deutche Bank to move forward with the ETA amendment.  Also below is the latest version of the ETA amendment letter which needs to be finalized and prepared for signature by Enron and DB.  Please move forward with completing this.  Thanks.

If you should have any questions or need anything, let me know.

Dear Mark:

We are good to go based on the latest draft  of the above amendment letter.  Would you kindly prepare execution copies for us.
I would ask that the attention party be Commodities and that the greeting be simply "Ladies and Gentlemen."

Also we will need two signature lines.

Best and thanks!

Alex

Alex -

Attached is a revised version of the amendment letter for the Electronic
Trading Agreement.  I have added the proposed language regarding
punitive damages as a new subsection to Section 4.

Please take a look at the attached and advise accordingly.  If this is
acceptable, I will finalize the agreement, get it signed and have it
forwarded to you for counter-signature by DB.

Thanks for the assistane.  Glad to hear that you and your co-workers are
okay in the wake of recent events.

Mark
