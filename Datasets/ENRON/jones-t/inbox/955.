Good morning wine lovers,
Some of you may remember the sampler case from several weeks ago that contained a couple of wines from the following producer.  The Malbec that was featured generated such a positive response that I decided to try the entire line-up from this highly rated yet small production winery from Argentina.  One taste of this group and I knew we had a winner!!!  Without letting the importer know just how much I loved these wines, I began to negotiate the prices in hopes of offering a case of 12 to all of you for a price that could not be matched.  The final pricing was so good that I bought dozens of cases of each wine.  To give you an idea of what I am talking about, the Reservas from this winery normally run about $18.50 each, while the regular bottlings run in the neighborhood of $15.  The normal case price, therefore would hit a price tag of more than $200!!!  Wait until you see what kind of magic I performed on these fabulous wines:

SERIOUS South American Value Sampler (2 btls each):  
Finca Flichman Cabernet Mendoza Argentina 1999 (full bodied, concentrated fruit) 87 points  
Finca Flichman Malbec Mendoza Argentina 1998 (intense color, maximum Malbec expression) 87 points  
Finca Flichman Syrah Mendoza Argentina 1999 (vigorous raspberry, well structured & tannic) 88 points  
Finca Flichman Cabernet RESERVA 1997 (numerous awards as one of Argentina's best) 88 points  
Finca Flichman Malbec RESERVA 1999 (serious complexity, plum, soft tannin, amazing finish) 89 points  
Finca Flichman Syrah RESERVA 1998 (black in color, spicy, jammy, quite passionate style) 90 points  

As I stated above, this case of wine could run over $200 without my negotiating skills.
THIS WEEK ONLY, STEAL A FEW CASES FOR ONLY $143 PLUS TAX EACH.
