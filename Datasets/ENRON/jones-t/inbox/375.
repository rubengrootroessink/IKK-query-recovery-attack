Here are the changes necessary to complete the agreements in a manner that
mirrors APB's documents.  Please let me know if you have any questions or
concerns with these changes.

Thanks,

my redline comments.  all my changes make the NEB agreements consistent with
the APB agreements.

Joe:

The one item that does not mesh with our agreement is the payment terms
outlined in the Fee Agreement document.  If you remember, we pay this fee on
a quarterly basis.  I have already called Bob and informed him we would be
changing this section to mirror the agreement for APB.  The only difference
is the price!

Thanks,
Chris
