I am working on a financial contract audit and could not find any records in the Financial Lotus Notes Tracking system for the following counterparties.  I was able to pull and make copies of the executed agreements from your legal files last week and I am sending them to the file room to be scanned into Livelink and properly filed.
 
Since the Financial tracking system is one of our means of verifying information, would you please populate this information in it?  If any of these counterparties are not active, I will need to know that information also.
