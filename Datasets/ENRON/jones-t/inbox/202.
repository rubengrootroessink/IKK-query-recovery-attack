                           READ ALL THE WAY TO THE END-THERE'S A TRICK TO IT. 

                           Finally a Barbie I can relate to.    At long last, here are some NEW 
                           Barbie dolls to coincide with her and OUR aging gracefully. These 
                           are a bit more realistic... 

                           1. Bifocals Barbie.     Comes with her own set of blended-lens 
                           fashion frames 
                           in six wild colors (half-frames too!), neck chain, and large-print 
                           editions   of  Vogue and Martha Stewart Living. 

                           2. Hot Flash Barbie.      Press Barbie's bellybutton and watch her 
                           face  turn 
                           beet red while tiny drops of perspiration appear on her forehead. 
                           Comes with handheld fan and tiny tissues. 

                           3. Facial Hair Barbie.     As Barbie's hormone levels shift, see her 
                           whiskers 
                           grow.   Available with teensy tweezers and magnifying mirror. 

                           4. Flabby Arms Barbie.     Hide Barbie's droopy triceps with these 
                           new,roomier-sleeved gowns.   Good news on the tummy front, 
                           two-MuMus with tummy-support panels are included. 

                           5. Bunion Barbie.    Years of disco dancing in stiletto heels have 
                           definitely 
                           taken their toll on Barbie's dainty arched feet. Soothe her sores with 
                           the 
                           pumice stone and plasters, then slip on soft terry mules. 

                           6. No-More-Wrinkles Barbie.     Erase those pesky crow's-feet and 
                           lip lines 
                           with a tube of Skin Sparkle-Spackle, from Barbie's own line of 
                           exclusive 
                           age-blasting cosmetics. 

                           7. Soccer Mom Barbie.     All that experience as a cheerleader is 
                           really paying 
                           off as Barbie dusts off her old high school megaphone to root for 
                           Babs and 
                           Ken, Jr.    Comes with minivan in robin-egg blue or white and cooler 
                           filled with 
                           doughnut holes and fruit punch. 

                           8. Mid-life Crisis Barbie.      It's time to ditch Ken. Barbie needs a 
                           change, 
                           and Alonzo (her personal trainer) is just what the doctor ordered, 
                           along with 
                           Prozac. They're hopping in her new red Miata and heading for the 
                           Napa 
                           Valley to open a B&B.     Includes a real tape of "Breaking Up Is 
                           Hard to Do." 

                           9. Divorced Barbie.     Sells for$ 199.99.   Comes with Ken's house, 
                           Ken's car, 
                           and Ken's boat. 

                           10. Recovery Barbie.     Too many parties have finally caught up 
                           with the 
                           ultimate party girl.    Now she does Twelve Steps instead of dance 
                           steps.   Clean 
                           and  sober, she's going to meetings religiously.   Comes with a little 
                           copy of 
                           The Big Book and a six-pack of Diet Coke. 

                           11. Post-Menopausal Barbie.     This Barbie wets her pants when 
                           she sneezes, 
                           forgets where she puts things, and cries a lot.     She is sick and 
                           tired of Ken 
                           sitting on the couch watching the tube, clicking through the 
                           channels.     Comes 
                           with Depends and Kleenex. As a bonus this year, the book "Getting 
                           In Touch with Your Inner Self" is included. 
  

                          The one I got said that if you forward to 11 people a very funny; video comes on your screen.   Who knows?  I just thought it was cute.
