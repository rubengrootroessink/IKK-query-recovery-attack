Neither BP nor Dynegy agreements have executed amendments.  There do not appear to be any guarantees on the BP file.  I am going to fax to you the guarantees (and amendments) that are in the Dynegy file.

We don't have masters with any of the following entities:

Amerada Hess Corporation
Hess Energy Services Company, LLC
Hess Energy Trading Company (UK) Limited
Hess Energy Trading Company LLC

We do, however, have a CLOSED file for Amerada Hess Canada Ltd.  It was closed in 1998 and is offsite.  I don't know if the contract was fully executed or not.

No, only executed amendments.

If the amendments are not executed, do you still want them?

Here's set of any master agreements I need ASAP.  

I didn't mention it on the earlier ones, but for all of these, if any of the agreements have been amended, I will need any amendments, as well as any guarantees.  Much thanks!
