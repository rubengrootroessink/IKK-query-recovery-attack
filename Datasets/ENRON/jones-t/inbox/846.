Hi Tana

I am entering my first ISDA on the database and have a couple of questions and because the database is your baby I thought it best to ask you.

Branches: does that mean Enron branches and/or counterparty branches?
Restrictions: does that mean whether we have included for example FX and Currency provisions?

Kind regards,
Anna Fox
