Tana -

Attached is our Channel Marketing Letter that we are using for EOL software initiatives - previsously referred to as Project Offline.  The attached is specific for Deloitte Consulting and has been reviewed and approved by me.  

So that we can maintain a complete file (including computer files), I am forwarding this to you to update (i.e., correct date), print, have me initial and have it signed by Brad Richter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

mark
