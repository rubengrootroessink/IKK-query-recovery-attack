Joe/Diane,

We urgently need to receive copies of the ISDA's for the following counterparties (with ECTRIC):

Paul Hartmann AG
Sodra Skogsagama Ek

Please let me know when you will be able to send these to me.  We are very minimally staffed over here (as I'm sure you are as well) and really need your assistance.  Thanks.  Jenny.
