Alex -

Attached is a revised version of the amendment letter for the Electronic Trading Agreement.  I have added the proposed language regarding punitive damages as a new subsection to Section 4.  

Please take a look at the attached and advise accordingly.  If this is acceptable, I will finalize the agreement, get it signed and have it forwarded to you for counter-signature by DB.

Thanks for the assistane.  Glad to hear that you and your co-workers are okay in the wake of recent events.

Mark
