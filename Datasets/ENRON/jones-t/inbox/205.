The Counterparty System indicates that Louis Dreyfus Energy Corp. CP#84 and CP #31950 were made inactive.  There is no reference to any other counterparty in the way of a merger, amalgamation etc.
 
Can you verify this information because we have an active contract in Global between Louis Dreyfus Energy Corp and CMI K#95000446.
 
Thanks for all your help.
