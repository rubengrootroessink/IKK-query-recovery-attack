I will be helping work the tables downstairs for Mark Haedicke's BEAR (Be A Resource) project which benefits neglected and abused children through Child Protective Services during the following times:

Monday		November 5	11:00 - 1:00 p.m.
Thursday	November 8	11:00 - 1:00 p.m.

I will also take a few minutes after that time to eat something.
