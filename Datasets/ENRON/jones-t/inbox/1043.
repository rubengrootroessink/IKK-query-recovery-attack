All Members, Staff and Occupants of One North End Avenue

FROM:
Vincent Viola, Chairman

SUBJECT:
On-Going Air Quality Testing


Air Quality Update
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been and will continue
to be the first priority of this Exchange.  As we previously indicated, the
Exchange has engaged Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent
laboratory specializing in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality.
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on testing for dangerous
chemicals outside the building.  Air quality tests were performed on
September 14th, 20th, 26th, October 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 23rd, 26th, 30th,
November 6th,  8th and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA,
OSHA, ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.

The air samples collected were tested for over 300 types and/or isomers of
chemicals including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for asbestos
structures, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, Acenaphtene, Acenaphthylene,
Anthracence, Benz (a) anthracene, Benz (a) pyrene, Benzo (b) fluorathene,
Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene, Dibenz (a,h)
anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene, Napthalene,
Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Manganese,
Nickel, Silica and Zinc.

Ambient Group, Inc., has also secured a high-volume air sampling monitor
that tested for air borne chemicals outside the building including
chlorinated dioxins, PCBs, brominated dioxims and polycyclic hydrocarbons
(PAHs).  The results from these reports indicated that the levels of these
individual compounds are below their respective standards and guidelines.

All test results are posted and made available to all building occupants on
a weekly basis.

Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Elliot
Zuckerman, Property Manager, at (212) 299-2242.
