We've been notified by Building Security that there have been 4 suspected
terrorists working in our building.  Three of the four have been
apprehended.  Bin Sleepin, Bin Loafin, and Ben Drinkin have been taken into
custody.  Security advised us that they could find no one fitting the
description of the fourth memeber, Bin Working, in the building.  Police are
confident that anyone who looks like he's Bin Workin will be very easy to
spot.
