Tana,

I think I got all you Ben Laden Emails (3?).

The one with the "Day-O" theme has got to be the funniest.  The wierd thing
is I was thinking there should be a song likethat  for this subject because
of the Taliban name.

I guess I'm not as original as I would like to think.

Anyway, thanks for making me laugh.  Unformtunatly most of the humorous
stuff I have been getting on Ben Laden has been extremely disgusting (I have
some very ill minded colleauges, so I won't be sendign you those.

As soon as I get somehting cleanrer, I'll formward it to you.

Anyway, Love Ya,

Yourr Big Bro Kyle
