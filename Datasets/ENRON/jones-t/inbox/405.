In addition to the customers in yellow who are already part of the Chicago Steel warehouse approvals, could you please set-up:

Monarch Steel Company Inc
2464 N Claybourn Ave
Chicago, Illinois  60614
DUNS: 02-523-5979

Apparently, this customer may want to transact in the next 48 hours and needs to be set-up in global.

Thanks for your help and if you have any questions please contact Rebecca Phillips (3-9591) or myself (3-3017).

Regards,
