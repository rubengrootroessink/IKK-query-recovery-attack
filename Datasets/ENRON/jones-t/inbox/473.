I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.

I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill.

	No idea. EGM doesn't exist.

Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't?

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick
