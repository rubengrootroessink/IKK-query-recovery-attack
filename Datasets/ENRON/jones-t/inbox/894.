I have now reviewed the documents and discussed them with my client. It is now proposed that the Broker be Tradition Financial Services Limited of 109-117 Middlesex Street, London E1 7JF, England. The necessary changes should be made to the documents to reflect this.In the first full paragraph on the second page of the Fee Agreement in the second line "annual" should be deleted and "at the annual rate of" should be inserted after "fee". In addition, in the same line,"North American Gas" should be deleted and there should be substituted "the products specified in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof".
I look forward to hearing from you that the above is agreed. 
Kind regards. 
Geoffrey

Alan/Geoffrey - 
Below you will find a BETA and Fee Agreement for TFS, Inc. in relation 
to certain European products.  These agreements reflect that TFS, Inc. 
be the Broker and thus, need to be signed by the appropriate officer of 
TFS, Inc.  Once they have been signed (and the accurate address for TFS, 
Inc. completed in the BETA), they should be returned to my attention for 
countersignature by Enron. 
Please let me know if either of you should have any questions or need 
anything further with regard to this matter. 
Mark
