Subject:	Bidder Rooms

We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:

Team A:  Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone
              Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993 
              
	There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies

Team B:  Main Conference Room 32c2
               Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof 

             Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies

Team C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone.
              Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.

                         Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.


           I just met at noon with Lance Jameson who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  Lance thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.

We have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, Lance. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment.
