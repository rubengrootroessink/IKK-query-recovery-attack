Stephanie -

Based upon the below message, I have made the necessary update to the agreement and have attached the final version (the file for which can be found in Tana's O drive).  Please print the necessary originals, have me initial and forward for signature to the proper Enron Credit officer.  Then we can forward the originals to Ms. Ford at the below address.

Thanks.

Mark

Dear Mark,

The changes that you've incorporated into the non-disclosure are acceptable.

If you could make one final change in the signature block to change
"Experian" to "Experian Information Solutions, Inc.", then you can forward
the originals to my attention at the following address:

				Jeannine A. Ford
				Manager, Contracts
				Experian Information Solutions, Inc.
				505 City Parkway West, 10th Floor
				Orange, CA.  92868

Thank you very much for making the requesting additions.

Respectfully yours,


Jeannine A. Ford
Manager, Contracts
Experian Information Solutions, Inc.

Jeannine -

I have have been asked to work with you directly on completing a
non-disclosure agreement between Experian and Enron Credit, Inc.

As you can see from the below message, I have been provided with your
Addendum to the Confidentiality Agreement.  Based upon this document, I
have made the appropriate changes to the original agreement forwarded so
that all terms are contained in one agreement.  I have attached a
redlined version of the agreement below for your review.

I have not incorporated portions of your suggested changes to Paragraph
1 (a portion of the last sentence) or Paragraph 8 (now 18)(the lenght of
the confidentiality obligations).  Otherwise, all modifications have
been incorporated.

Please review the attached at your convenience and let me know your
thoughts.  If this draft meets with your approval, please let me know
and I will forward originals for Experian's signature.

Tana:

The attached file contains changes, prepared by Experian's attorneys, to
the NDA we sent last week.  Their legal contact is Jeannine Ford.
Jeannine's email address is Jeannine.Ford@experian.com.  Please work
directly with her to resolve outstanding issues.

We are scheduled to meet with Experian Tuesday 11/6, to discuss the
application of their data.  The NDA needs to be in place by that time.

Please contact me with any questions.

I'm sure you did not expect this, but our legal department has made some
suggested changes to your standard non disclosure agreement. They
prepared them
in the form of an Addedum and I am attaching it for your review. Please
call me
if we need to get the legal teams talking.
