I spoke with Pablo this morning and he received and is reviewing the ISDA. 
Apparently though, the address we have for him is an old one, and it was forwarded on.

The address should be:
Apoquindo 3200
Piso 8
Santiago CHILE 6760343

Tana,
Just wondering if you ever received the credit worksheet for this counterparty. This is the company that Lee Jackson in NGLs is so eager to get online.

Thanks,
