Not much going on.  I'm still trying to get Documentum to do a demonstration 
for me.  I keep getting general marketing people, even though I tell them I'm 
interested only in derivatives software, and to get a derivative person to 
call me.  I haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet.  Then the 
fellow was a little condescending with me about price, like I can't afford 
their services.  When I first spoke to them I told them to check the Enron 
web page to get more information about our company but it doesn't appear that 
they've done their homework.  They're about to lose my business.

In the end I think Mark is agreeing with me that we're going to design our 
own software.  I still like IPI a lot, but they're only one component of the 
project.  The Confirm Desk is still really interested in getting some 
software, and between the two groups it might make buying software for 
document creation more attractive.
