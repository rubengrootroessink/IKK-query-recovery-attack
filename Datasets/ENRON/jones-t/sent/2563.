Per email from Leslie Hansen, one of our power attorneys, counterparty cannot 
transact US physical power.  On the financial side, we just got an ISDA 
Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for 
all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).  We will only 
consider those on a case by case basis.  Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in 
the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require 
any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a 
"governmental".  No Argentina gas for any non-Argentina counterparties.  All 
other US products appear to be OK.

Tana:

This CP is not authorized to trade physical US power products.  I will leave 
it to you to determine if it should be granted access to any other 
commodities.

Imelda

You will need to ask the US group whether this gives rise to any 
issues....ask Leslie Hansen

Thanks.
