The date our annual exemption expires in approval letter the NYMEX sends us 
when they approve our exemptions.  Because we have so many commodities we are 
applying for now, and the form is quite lengthy, it took the NYMEX quite a 
while last year to approve our requests, which moved the date back to July 26 
(last year our renewals were due the 1st week of July).  So we've got a lttle 
more time to work on it.  I will probably start notifying the various group's 
that provide information for the exemptions request sometime around the 
middle or toward the end of May.

When I was looking at last year's data, I noticed that the due date on last 
year's NYMEX financials was the end of June.  Did the due date get moved back 
to July?  Please let me know as soon as possible.


Thanks

I am still the person who does the NYMEX filings.  They are due the end of 
July, so we should probably target them to be done a little earlier, since we 
always seem to need more time.
