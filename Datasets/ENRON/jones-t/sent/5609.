I just got off the phone with Margaret Lester, a contract administrator at 
Dynegy, and Harlan Murphy, an attorney she works with.  There was some 
misinformation communicated to them about EOL, and I told them the only way 
we would trade online with them was under the existing master, not under the 
online GTCs, we wanted the bankruptcy protection the master affords.  They 
want to replace the old ERMS Master with an ISDA and I told them we would be 
happy to generate the master.  Can I get some credit from you so I can turn 
around a master quickly, or we will have to work off their form, which will 
then become an ISDA comparison which will be a lot more work in the long run.

Much thanks as usual for your prompt help!
