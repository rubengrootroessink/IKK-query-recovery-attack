I just got in from Aspen.  This Sunday looks good for me for Carol's 
birthday.  Is Holly going, she might like to...?

In terms of a townhome, I think that would be nice, also Garden Oaks.  It 
seems like you are kinda all over the place, though, and you might want to be 
careful making "emotional" home buying decisions...

As far as not hearing back from Enron.  I wouldn't think anything of it.  
They told me they absolutely wanted me and then I didn't hear back from them 
for two months.  Big companies have lots of layers to get anything done.  
Just keep plugging on...

Oh, I forgot to tell you something else:?  
?
Carol Gradziel turns 50 today, but on Sunday  evening, August 20, we were 
going to do a surprise dinner at Buca di Beppo at  Buffalo Speedway and 59.? 
I would love for you to come.? It will be  the running group, mostly couples, 
and me and Carol.? Everyone is supposed  to get there at 6:45 and we (Monnie, 
Ralph, and I are picking Carol up to be  there by 7.? If you are not busy, 
try to come.? Monnie and Ralph have  run with us, but they are the realtors 
that Carol does most of her business with  and I have known them for about 25 
years.?
