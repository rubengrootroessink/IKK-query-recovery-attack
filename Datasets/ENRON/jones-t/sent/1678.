Holly would be a good one to invite.  She and Carol are real good friends.  
Lucinda really doesn't know Carol all that well, so I think I'd skip her.  
Holly's work # is (281) 364-5207.

P.S.  I thought about asking Holly and Lucinda, but didn't know if they
would be interested or not because of most of the people being the running
group.  I would love it if they came.  Would you like to invite them, or, if
you will give me their numbers, I would be glad to invite them.

Thank you.

I just got in from Aspen.  This Sunday looks good for me for Carol's
birthday.  Is Holly going, she might like to...?

In terms of a townhome, I think that would be nice, also Garden Oaks.  It
seems like you are kinda all over the place, though, and you might want to
be careful making "emotional" home buying decisions...

As far as not hearing back from Enron.  I wouldn't think anything of it.
They told me they absolutely wanted me and then I didn't hear back from
them for two months.  Big companies have lots of layers to get anything
done.  Just keep plugging on...

Oh, I forgot to tell you something else:

Carol Gradziel turns 50 today, but on Sunday  evening, August 20, we were
going to do a surprise dinner at Buca di Beppo at  Buffalo Speedway and 59.
I would love for you to come. It will be  the running group, mostly
couples, and me and Carol. Everyone is supposed  to get there at 6:45 and
we (Monnie, Ralph, and I are picking Carol up to be  there by 7. If you
are not busy, try to come. Monnie and Ralph have  run with us, but they
are the realtors that Carol does most of her business with  and I have
known them for about 25 years.
