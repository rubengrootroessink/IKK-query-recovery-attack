Why is an attorney doing secretarial work, much less paralegal work?  Also, 
she is primarily a litigator, and we have found that litigators don't know 
anything about contracts, securing collateral, corporate law, etc.

If we want a litigator, I understand that one of the old time 20 year 
Liddell, Sapp litigation paralegals has finally gotten to a place where she's 
ready to leave...
