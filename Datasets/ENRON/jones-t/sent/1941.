I have a database where I maintain my online approval, and my the basis for 
my approvals/declines.  If you want to review counterparties we have 
previously approved/disapproved and why, or want to go in and to see what I 
approved on a specific counterparty, this would be the place to go.  Would 
you like me to get you access?
