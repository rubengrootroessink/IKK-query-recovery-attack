Just a reminder that if you change any of the resolutions contained in our 
Swap Resolutions Notebook, you need to update the Index, and substitute the 
revised resolutions into each of the Swap Group's persons Notebooks.  These 
would include for any of the trading companies, the resolutions that approve 
what we trade (which also includes who can sign the appropriate documents), 
as well as the brokerage approval resolutions.  It does not include the 
Confirmation signatories.
