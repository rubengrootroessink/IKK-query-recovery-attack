Justy,

We are going to be trading with Deutsche Bank out of their New York and 
London branch offices online.  Per my conv. w/the online team, we going to 
have to have them come in thru both Houston and London as a counterparty (we 
haven't solved multibranch customers online).  With Edmund out, I need 
someone to email me your Electronic Trading Agreement and Password 
Application so we can send them to the lawyer we are negotiating the ISDA 
Master with.  Can you have someone there send me the docs.

Much thanks...
