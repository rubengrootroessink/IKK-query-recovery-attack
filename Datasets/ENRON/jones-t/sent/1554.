David,

A clarification...

On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they 
should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other 
products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally 
and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a 
correct interpretation?

Tana, thanks for expediting this Tana. The list for Australian weather is 
fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral 
requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we 
do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These 
are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not 
linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading 
Australian power and weather.

Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and 
weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to 
trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to 
check this one out further.

Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.  From the 
US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for 
power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES.

Attached below is a list of Australian and Japanese counterparties for the 
Australian and Japanese weather launch.  As they are actually launching these 
products this afternoon, your immediate attention would be GREATLY 
appreciated.  Let me know of any potential conflicts ( other than the obvious 
lack of time) and I will do what ever possible to help.

Thanks for your extraordinary efforts!!!!!!

Frank
