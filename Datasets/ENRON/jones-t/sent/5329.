Dave,

Per your conversation with Mark last week, it appears the Confirmation Desk 
people are still waiting for the "oops trade" language.

We never received any language from any EOL individual.  We have not 
discussed revision language for EOL deals with Legal or EOL.

Subject: EOL revision language

Kevin,

Is there some specific revision language that we've been given by the EOL 
group for use with revised EOL deals?

Legal is claiming that we should have received something long ago from 
someone on the EOL side, but I don't recall ever getting anything.

Thanks,
Joe
