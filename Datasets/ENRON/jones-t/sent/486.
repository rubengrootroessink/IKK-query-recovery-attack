Peter,

Mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine.  
Actually, he liked your termination and release better than the language we 
have in our form, so we're changing our form.  You are the man!

I checked the New York law when I drafted the termination so you're ok 
there.  

I'll be out all next week, my Mom's coming into town for the Thanksgiving 
holidays.  If you need to get hold of me my assistant will have my cell phone 
number (since it's NYMEX bid week and both Mark and I will be out, I have to 
be reachable.  Mark will have an international cell phone with him, he's 
sailing in the Caribbean, so if you need to get hold of him for any reason, 
Taffy will have the number).

Let me know if I can be of further help today!
