Dear Justin

Marly asked me to respond to you.

As you know, the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many
companies. Therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word
ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to
prevent others from using the word ONLINE.

Given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON (which
covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities),
I'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably
unnecessary. However, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service,
that should be registered.

I hope the above is clear.

Jonathan Day

Can one of you give me a quick call to discuss . I'm @ X37047. Thanks.

I believe we are to some extent already protected with "Enron" proceeded
with
anything, but EnronOnline(TM) , etc. just affords us more protection.  I
assume
this is akin to why McDonald's trademarks "Mc"Everything?

Paul,

Can you please give me a call to discuss trademarking?

i.e. Are we covered if we proceed a word with "Enron"?  e.g.: EnronEAuction.

If we are covered, then was it necessary to register EnronOnline?

Thanks,

Dave
