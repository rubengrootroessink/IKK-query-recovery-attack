Shari,

The correct S&P rating is BBB- and as Pat mentioned, we DO want to include as 
part of the definition of Material Adverse Change if the counterparty ceases 
to be rated.  Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya-

I am sure that you noticed in the attachment that Shari has the trigger at 
BBB and not BBB-.  In addition, do we want to add language in that section 
that says an Event of Default also occurs if they are no longer rated by S&P?

Regards,

Pat

Further to our meeting this past Monday, attached please find a proposal for 
a Material Adverse Change Clause as an Additional Event of Default in the 
ISDA Master Agreement. 



Any comments or suggestions would be welcome. 

Many thanks, 

Shari
