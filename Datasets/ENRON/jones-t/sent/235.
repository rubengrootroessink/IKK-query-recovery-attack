Scott,

Can you pass on Mary Solmonson's memo to the appropriate London lawyer 
responsible for Norway power contracts.  Mary is the head of Global Contracts 
here in Houston, and Phillipe Travis works for Mary, and just went over to 
London to work on getting systems in place for Global Contracts in London.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: Norwegian Contracts

Philippe has uncovered a group of contracts in Norwegian that are not 
translated in English at all.  Here is his note :

Norwegian Power Contracts have not been translated into English.  This has 
not been an issue for the Power Deal Clearing and Documentation Group because 
Ellen Wallumrod is from Norway.  She is able to make 'confirms' in her native 
tongue.  However, this is an issue from Global Contracts because no one can 
speak Norwegian! 
I have spoken with translation companies regarding translation fees.  It is 
very costly to have all of the contracts translated.  There are perhaps a 
dozen contracts.  Should legal cover the translation expenses?  Ian believes 
that only parts of the contract need to be translated.  But, how do I know 
which parts need to be translated?  And, with Auditors in mind, shouldn't we 
have English copies on hand?






Do we need to have a complete English version ?

If not, would it be acceptable to translate only certain paragraphs ?

Should we (Global Contracts) target building a multi-lingual staff for the 
future - esp. in London office ?

Got any ideas or opinions ?
