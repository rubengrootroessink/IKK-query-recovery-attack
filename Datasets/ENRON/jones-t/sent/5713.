It sounds like he knows you should be included in the loop.  I should get a 
copy (I hope!) so we'll see if that's true!

He has done conflicts check in the past and sent executed agreements. Do you 
want  to ask him to send a copy or shall I?  I find nothing with or 
pertaining to Petronas in the agreements that I have.

Does Matt Lee, our lawyer in the Singapore office, know he needs to file NDAs

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.
