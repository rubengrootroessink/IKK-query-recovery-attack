In response to a RUSH request from Frank:

FINANCIAL TRADING:  El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. is approved to trade 
all financial products under with the existing El Paso Energy Marketing 
Company (now known as El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company) Master Agreement 
dated as of 04/20/95.  Such Master Agreement and the Transactions thereunder 
we assigned to El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P, pursuant to an Assignment of 
Agreements dated as of 12/1/99.

Confirmation Desk:  with respect to weather confirmations, they should 
continue to follow the existing format of the El Paso Energy Marketing 
Company weather trades (changing the name, of course).

We are in the process of replacing the old "ERMS Style" Master Agreement with 
an ISDA Master Agreement and will notify you when the new agreement is 
executed.

PHYSICAL TRADING:  Approved for all products.  Global Contracts:  talk to 
Stacy Dickson about which contracts to use (EL Paso, Sonat or GTC).

EMERGING PRODUCTS.  Approved for all products.

POWER:  Not approved for trading.  All power trading should continue under 
the old El Paso Power Services Company entity until we receive documentation 
that evidences the approval of the assignment of their power  license.
