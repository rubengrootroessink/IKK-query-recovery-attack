We have two new lawyers that have joined our Group today:  Francisco 
Pinto-Leite and Frank Sayre.  They will need access to the Financial Trading 
Agreement Database.  In addition, I am still waiting to hear that Cheryl 
Nelson has been granted access to the Financial Trading Database.  Can you 
let me know what the scoop is...?

Also, I left you a message this morning about my new database for online 
documents...when can we expect a roll out of that?  People keep sending me 
documents and I have no place to record them...

Thanks, as usual for your help!

Can you please delete access to the financial trading agreement database to 
the following people:

Anita Fam
Brenda Whitehead
Elizabeth Sager
Jason Peters
Stephanie Sever
Christian Yoder
Lorraine Filomeno
Shari Stack
Susan Flynn
Lisa Lees

Two people need to have their access changed from Legal Dept., to Credit 
Dept. (therefore they can make Credit comments, not Legal comments):  Tom 
Moran and Veronica Espinoza.

Also, please add a lawyer in our Group to the database with full edit 
access:  Cheryl Nelson.

Thanks!
