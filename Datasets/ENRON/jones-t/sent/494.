Thanks for the article.  I will distribute it to our group and Credit.  With 
Online Trading quieting down a bit, Mark and I are finally focusing on 
"Project Fishkin" (as we call it).  I am already getting a new database 
developed, the jurisdictional database, to keep track of swap laws around the 
world.  We hope to finalize our recommendations soon, and get the project up 
to Haedicke for his approval.

Of course, Online trading goes live today to our customers, so there's not 
telling what problems may crop up.  I'm crossing my fingers for a quiet day!

Hope your holidays went well.  My mom came down from New York, and it was 
colder in Houston than it was at home!
