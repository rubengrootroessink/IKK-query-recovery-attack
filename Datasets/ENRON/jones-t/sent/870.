Per my conversation a minute ago with the Koch lawyer in Kansas, Tye Darland, 
"Koch Hydrocarbons, Inc." is a bad name.  The correct legal name for this 
counterparty should be the same as it is set up in our Master Swap Agreement 
database:  "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon 
Company Division".  I have called the Koch trader, James "Doug" Peters 
(713/544-5938, ext. 5602) , and asked him to resubmit the Password 
Application with the name corrected.  Please show this correction in your 
records as well.
