TO:
All NYMEX and COMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:

! Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved changes =
to=20
NYMEX and COMEX Clearing Association rules, which have also been filed with=
=20
the CFTC, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may depos=
it=20
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

! Specifically, the rule changes, which are attached below, permit the use =
of=20
letters of credit, certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by=
=20
customers to meet their margin requirements. The rule changes provide for=
=20
consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX=20
Divisions.

! Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit=20
(LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

! Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a =01&pass-through=018 basis =
on both=20
divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able=
=20
to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. =
It=20
should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, a=
s=20
detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets m=
ay=20
not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin=
=20
obligations with the clearinghouse.

! Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing=20
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable=20
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim=
e=20
on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customer=
s=20
to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member=
s=20
on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the=
=20
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter=
=20
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve=
=20
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;=
=20
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o=
ne=20
issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market=20
value.

! Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse=
=20
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted=
=20
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at =
no=20
more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

! Effective Date. These rule changes will go into effect on June 1, 2001.

! Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit.  A follow-up Notice to=
=20
Clearing Members will be distributed shortly that will include a form=20
prepared by NYMEX that will serve as the authorized  uniform form for=20
irrevocable letters of credit for use on a pass-through basis at the Exchan=
ge=20
.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)=

(b) the net liquidating value in a customer's account over the initial marg=
in=20

for open NYMEX Division positions, or conforming to the requirements of Rul=
e=20
4.01(E)(2) for open COMEX Division positions, or, for open positions on=20

customer's margin to equal or exceed the then prevailing initial margin=20
requirement.

 (F) Withdrawals of margin from a customer's account may only be permitted =
by=20

=20
are equal to or in excess of the then prevailing initial margin required of=

the applicable open positions at the time of said withdrawal request.

(G) The customer's response to a margin call issued by a Member Firm must b=
e=20
timely and complete. A Member Firm may call, at any time, for margins above=
=20
and beyond the minimums required by the Exchange. A Member Firm may liquida=
te=20
any or all positions maintained by a customer for failure to meet a margin=
=20
call. The customer will be liable for any loss or deficiency resulting=20
therefrom.

 (H) The margin requirements established by the Board or its designee may=

may be made applicable to all open trades as well as new trades.

 (I) Arbitrage

(1) For the purposes of Exchange margin requirements, an arbitrage position=
=20

=20
which futures contract is offset by a futures contract to sell or to purcha=
se=20
a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different delivery=
=20
month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject to the=20
rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage position=
,=20
each contract long and short must be carried by the same member firm for th=
e=20
same account.

(2) The Board of Directors, by resolution, may identify those futures=20
contracts, that are executable on and/or subject to the rules of a differen=
t=20
exchange, which shall be deemed to qualify as part of an arbitrage position=
.

(3) The Board of Directors or its designee may set levels of margin for=20
arbitrage positions at a rate less than applicable to outright positions;=
=20
