Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of 
these descriptions.  They are being forwarded to our business people now for 
review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday 
being a federal holiday here).  I don't know what problems this is going to 
cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business 
input on these descriptions.   Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster 
to this effect.
