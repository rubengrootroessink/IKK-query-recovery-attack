Harry,

Since physical steel is a new online product, I need to know from you wheth=
er=20
you are aware of any reason why any existing counterparty should not be abl=
e=20
to trade physical steel.  From your perspective, I would consider whether=
=20
there is any legal reason barring a counterparty incorporated out of the US=
=20
from buying physical steel, or whether you are aware of any current=20
litigation, payment disputes or other similar legal reasons which would=20
prevent an existing counterparty from trading physical steel.

Also, on a going forward basis, is there any legal impediments for any new=
=20
counterparties trading physical steel?
