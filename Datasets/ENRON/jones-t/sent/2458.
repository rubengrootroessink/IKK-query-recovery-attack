At the request of Mark Taylor, can you get Sara Shackleton and Brent Hendry 
passwords too so they can review the Dynegydirect GTC's.  P.S.  Do we have 
any particular deadline for getting them approved?  

Thanks!

Sheri:

I deleted the passwords you sent me -- I don't want to have them since they 
grant execution status.  Instead, can you please set me, Dan Hyvl, and Tana 
Jones up as a sub-user with read-only access to all products.

Thanks,

Leslie
