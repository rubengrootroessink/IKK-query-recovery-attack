At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of 
Interest.  In addition, although we feel our current discussions are covered 
by the Non-Disclosure Agreement between our affiliate Enron Europe Limited 
and GFI Group, Inc., we would like to enter into a Non-Disclosure Agreement 
directly between GFI and EnronOnline and Enron Net Works due to the ongoing 
nature of our discussions.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
sign the enclosed documents and return them to me via fax (713) 646-3490.  I 
will have them executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions, 
please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.
