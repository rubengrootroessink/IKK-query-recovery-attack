Please find attached referenced lists.  It is not clear to me yet how we are 
going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to 
look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.  Also, there were no 
counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached.

I haven't said it in a while...but no European power for US counterparties...
