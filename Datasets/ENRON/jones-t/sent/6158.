As a follow-up to a recent discussion with Tana Jones concerning counterparty 
divisions, a meeting is being setup for Monday, April 30, from 1:00 PM thru 
3:00 PM, to discuss counterparty naming conventions for Divisions, DBA's,  
Agencies and the requirements of downstream systems.  A few examples of 
encountered naming variations are as follows:
 1) Koch Industries versus Koch Industries, a division of Koch Corporation
 2)  Doing Business As, Koch Industries versus Koch Industries Inc. 
 3) Hess Energy Trading (UK) Limited versus Hess Energy Trading (UK) Limited, 
as agent for Hess Energy Trading LLC
 4) Legal structure change i.e. a counterparty changes from a corporation to 
LLC 

A few of the questions or issues surrounding counterparty name variations are 
as follows:
 1) Counterparties that are shared between Enron companies 
 2) Duplicate counterparties 
 3) Confirmations needs
 4) Credit roll-up
 5) Contract needs
 6) Netting Issues
 
I have attempted to describe the most common of situations encountered 
involving naming conventions but if any further consideration or 
clarification is needed in regard to this matter, please feel free to add to 
the above examples/ issues list or telephone me at ext.39249.

Julissa Marron, ext. 5836 will send out the meeting invitation with the room 
location.

Bill
