Subject: Notice to Brokers re: Name Change

We are getting calls from our brokers and the NYMEX telling us the brokers 
still have not received notification of our name change.  This is causing 
problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.  Per my voicemail 
several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the 
brokers,  they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.   When will 
you be able to get this notice our of our name change?
