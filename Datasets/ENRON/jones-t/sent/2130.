I received a faxed copy of the Customer Registration Form, Password 
Application and Letter Agreement amending the ETA.  I expect the originals to 
follow tomorrow.  I will have copies walked down to Lisa since the customer 
is eager to start trading.  I will follow with the originals in the usual 
course of business.
