At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching a clean and blacklined 
draft of the Schedule and Credit Support Annex to the referenced ISDA Master 
Agreement.  Can you please provide or confirm the following information:  (1) 
since the Counterparty is Australian, I have added the Counterparty's ACN 
Number to the document.  Can you please provide that number to us.  (2) Can 
you take a look at the definition of "Obligors" in the Credit Support Annex 
and let us know if it references the correct Obligors under the Loan 
Agreement.

Since I will not be in the office this afternoon, can you please call Sara at 
(713) 853-5620 or Stephanie Panus at (713) 345-3249 with your comments.  
Thanks for your attention herewith.
