US Legal would have no problem doing business with a Connecticut limited 
liability company (subject, of course, to Credit approval).  There are some 
legal considerations with respect to certain products.  In order to trade any 
financial products the counterparty would have to meet the U.S. "eligible 
swap participant" standards (which sets certain asset and net worth levels) 
and to trade U.S. power they would need to have a FERC license.  Otherwise, 
we have no problem with limited liability companies.

In Justin's absence, please could you let me know if we would be able to 
consider an application from a Limited Liability Company organized under the 
laws of the State of Connecticut, USA?  If possible, could you provide me 
with an answer on this today or latest tomorrow as this customer is coming in 
to the office on Thursday?  The history behind this customer is that the 
original company that Mr Papaeconomou wanted to trade under (NEWCO) was 
incorporated in Liberia.  As we do not have the relevant documentation to 
support trading from Liberia we rejected his application.  This would be a 
good customer for Andy James (Seafreight) to get online and Mr Papaeconomou 
is obviously very keen to obtain execute access as soon as possible through a 
viable company.

Thanks

Dear Mrs. Gardiner,

Thank you very much for your message dated November 6, 2000.  Given the
present legal constraints concerning companies incorporated in Liberia,
would EnronOnline consider an application by a Limited Liability Company
organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut?  If yes would you
please provide the relevant documentation for such entity?

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Lambros Papaeconomou, Director
New York Freight Exchange, Inc.

PS.  I will be in London on Thursday November 9 and have an appointment to
meet with Andy James of Enron Shipping at 3PM.  Should you be available
before or after my appointment, I would very much appreciate to meet you in
person and further discuss the requirements for opening a trading account
with EnronOnline (beyond the company jurisdiction requirement which I hope
would now be solved!)
