Yes, I would like to have access.  Please ask Mike to email me once he's

Thank you.

FYI,

I have a database where I keep track of my online approvals/declines and 
reasons why (if there are any!).  I don't know to what extent Frank ever 
looked at it, but you might find it helpful.  It is called "ENA Legal Online 
Trading Agreements" database.  If you're interested, I'll ask Mike Neves to 
get you access.
