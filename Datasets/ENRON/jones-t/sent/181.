Alan Aronowitz is working on a presentation he has to give in Singapore on 
Global Energy Derivatives, and wanted to put a little blurb in of some kind 
about weather.  He wanted to see if he could get a copy of the presentation 
you and Mike Corbally gave at the ISDA seminar to see if there were any 
slides that might be helpful for his presentation.  Do you have a copy I can 
provide him?  Thanks!
