Attached is the latest version of the counterparty/product type matrix.  The 
matrix consist of four colour coded counterparty sections.

Section 1 (white) is the fully approved list from credit with limits noted. 
Section 2 (green) is a second approved list from credit which does not have 
limits noted, yet (credit work in progress). 
Section 3 (blue) consist of counterparties included in the external marketing 
company mailshot, but have not been reviewed by credit, legal, or tax. 
Section 4 (orange) includes counterparties received from the originators & 
marketers that will be manually mailed on Sept 13, but have not yet been 
reviewed by credit, legal, or tax.

The product types at the top (row 10) of the matrix have been updated also to 
the "final" upload version.  Some product types have been deleted and some 
have been added.  The product types that have been added are highlighted in 
yellow.

All of the counterparties on this matrix will be mailed a brochure on 
September 13.  (High credit risk counterparties from section 4 will be pulled 
if we receive notice immediately)  This should be the final pre-launch 
counterparty matrix and will serve as the goal for pre approved 
authorisation.  The counterparty system upload will occur within the next few 
days.  Any approvals/adjustments  received after this upload will require 
manual entries through the GUI by product control.

We understand that this has been a long process with many changes.  This 
matrix has been refined since the initial distribution to Tax, Credit and 
Legal on July 30, 1999.  I apologize for the tough task.

The goal now is to obtain sign off on this pre launch matrix ASAP: 

Credit should provide the limits for Section 2, review Sections 3 & 4 to 
ensure adherence to the Enron Credit Policy  and work closely with Legal and 
Global on providing a Master Agreement matrix

Tax should review the additions to the matrix to ensure that the profile does 
not breach any tax laws or create a tax exposure and work with Global resolve 
the issue of country of incorporation

Legal should fill in the matrix to ensure that there are no legal or 
regulatory impediments to trade and work closely with Legal and Global on 
providing a Master agreement matrix

I will be co-ordinating with Jeff Hodge (US Legal); Justin Boyd (UK Legal); 
Debbie Brackett (Global Credit); Janine Juggins (UK Tax); Connie Sutton 
(Global)  and Stephen Douglas (US Tax) tomorrow to see what it will take to 
finish this task off.  Please call me with any questions at X30397. 

Thank you for the work you have done to date and for all that is yet to be 
completed.

Bob
