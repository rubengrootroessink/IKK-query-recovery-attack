I revised the language in the "Description of Transaction" section and where 
the fee is and just wanted to make sure you were Ok before I sent it to your 
customer.  I've already drafted my email, I just need your OK.

Tana,
Energy commodities is too broad.  You are correct, please limit it to say 
U.S. Crude and U.S. Refined Products.

Thanks,

Dan

Attached is the proposed form of LOI.  Please let me know if it meets with 
your approval, and I will email it to the customer.  I kept the language in 
the term sheet in the back pretty broad as it references "energy 
commodities".  Your language re "US crude and products" wasn't clear to me.  
Perhaps you meant US crude and crude derivative/refined products?  Will 
energy commodities work, or do want to limit it to crude products and charge 
more for other products?

I need this yesterday as I promised and didn't get it to him  ( I owe you big

correspondence with United. Thanks
