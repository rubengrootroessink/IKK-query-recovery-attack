 Here is what I have pulled based on the areas I currently have access. If 
you are looking for Financial contracts on a commodity not listed let me know 
& I will track down who can pull it for you. Sorry this took me so long.

After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the 
products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received 
it.  With Mary out I don't know who to contact to get it, can you help me 
with this?  Also, would it be possible to get a list of the global contract 
numbers for our financial masters?  Thanks!
