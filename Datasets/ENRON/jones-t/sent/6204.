ISO9.com and ANSI Establish Reselling Agreement for the ISO 9000:2000 
Standards 
New York, NY and Oakland, CA, December 11, 2000 - ISO9.com and the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) have announced an agreement regarding 
U.S. distribution of the ISO 9000 series of quality management system 
standards, including the soon to be published ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 
standards. ISO9.com sells electronic versions of the Standards on the 
Internet at http://store.iso9.com. The new version of ISO 9000 will be 
available on December 15.

"Distribution of the ISO 9000 standards is an important step for our 
organization," said Glenn Kohner, Founder and CTO of ISO9.com. "Customers on 
the Internet expect instant delivery of information. Users on our site are 
learning about Internet ISO 9000. It's only natural that they would want 
access to the actual Standards."

There are two ways to procure the ISO 9000 standards from ISO9.com. The 
Standards, which a company is required to own to be in compliance, will be 
offered both independently and bundled with the ISO9.com application. With 
the integrated version, companies will be able to view the Standard alongside 
their QMS, in a seamless format. 
"ISO9.com is one of ANSI's more unique value added resellers in that it has 
actually integrated the ISO 9001:2000 standard into its application," 
commented Bob Feghali, ANSI vice president of business development and chief 
information officer. "We are committed to fast action in the delivery of the 
new ISO 9000 revisions; partnering with ISO9.com will greatly assist ANSI in 
our ability to insure a widespread distribution of the complete ISO 9000 
family of standards."
