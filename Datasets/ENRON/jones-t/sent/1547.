I have attached the referenced spreadsheet, changing my product approvals to 
add the new product list that Stephanie sent me (instead of th eold list 
Credit sent me).  One of the new products appears to be Austrian physical 
power.  Like the other European based physical power products, it should not 
be opened for the US based credit counterparties to trade, so I will not be 
marking it out on a going forward basis, I will just expect it to be shut 
down for the US based counerparties (unless I tell you otherwise on a 
particular one).  Is that OK with you.

Also, for Sempra, they will be coming by again on the 7/21 list (Credit 
opened them up for all financial power).  I had already opened them up for 
all financial products except weather, so it shouldn't affect my approval.
