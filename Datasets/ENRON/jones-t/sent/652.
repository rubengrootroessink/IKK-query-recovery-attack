Why won't they let you go to the Corp. conference?  It's too bad, this new 
resort across the was from the Hyatt Hill Country where we stayed that last 
time it supposed to be even nicer.  Bummer!  It appears the ECT one is 
probably always going to be at the Woodlands Resort, which is real boring...
