1.  Whenever we supersede and replace one Enron guaranty with another, we are 
supposed to have the "supersede and replace" language in the new guaranty.  
Is there some reason why it's not in there, and if we can't get it in at this 
late date, how are we going to make sure we don't have two live Enron 
guarantees out with the counterparty?

2.  Is there some reason one the state of Oregon is bolded in the guaranty?
