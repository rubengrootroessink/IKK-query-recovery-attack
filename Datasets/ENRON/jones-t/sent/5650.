Can you get Peter Keohane and Greg Johnston, two attorneys in our Calgary 
office, edit access to the Master Swap Agreement database.  Please let me 
know when they have access.  Thanks!

If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the 
comments between Legal & Credit.  We do not give this level of access to 
non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information 
for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away 
our negotiating positions!).  If you would like this level of access, let me 
know and I will put in a request.  This level of access will also give you 
edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.
