At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching my list of North America 
"utility" counterparties.  My given task when I compiled this list was to 
identify "utilities" and determine if there was a reason we should not 
approve online trading for the counterparty.  We originally denied approval 
for all utilities unless we had a Master Agreement in place or an overriding 
commercial reason to transact.  We are now taking the position that investor 
owned utilities (IOUs) and related corporate entities should be approved for 
trading.  However, we will not approve online trading for governmentals or 
cooperatives when we do not have a master in place, so those counterparties 
identified as such do not need to be included in your review.  Obviously, if 
you are aware of a municipal or cooperative I failed to detect, please let us 
know.  In addition, your review does not need to extend to the Canadian 
counterparties.  We will run those by Canadian counsel.

Please review the list to help us identify the IOUs.  You may ignore the 
"Approved for Trading" column.

For your information, the list was compiled from information provided from 
our Credit Department, from the Company's financial statements which I 
obtained from EDGAR, from the Company's web site, from 
www.utilityconnection.com, or from web searches of the Company when I could 
not locate  information from any of the other sources.

Please give us a call tomorrow to discuss briefly.
