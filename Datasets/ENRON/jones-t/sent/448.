The following is reported today in one of the daily bankruptcy news services I
receive. I thought you might be interested in keeping up with Forcenergy's
bankruptcy case which appears to be headed toward confirmation with more than 
a
few hiccups along the way.

Forcenergy Wins Court OK Of Plan Disclosure Statement
Forcenergy Inc. on Oct. 22 won
bankruptcy court approval of the disclosure statement
related to its plan of reorganization.
Doug Walter of Andrews & Kurth, counsel to the
oil & gas producer, said that Judge Thomas M. Brahney III
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Orleans said he
would approve the disclosure statement after numerous
objections were resolved prior to last Friday?s hearing.
A final order has not been signed, but Judge
Brahney indicated his intent to sign the order at the hearing,
Walter added.
Walter said that Forcenergy hopes to begin
soliciting votes on the reorganization plan on Nov. 3.
Solicitation materials are currently being drafted.
Judge Brahney has scheduled a plan confirmation
hearing for Dec. 13.
As reported, the disclosure statement was amended
after the creditors? committee, while supporting the plan,
found the disclosure statement to be lacking information in
a number of areas. The document was amended to clarify
a few of the secured claims that will be paid in full in cash,
rather than over time.
The creditors noted that the plan proposes a
distribution to equity shareholders in an amount close to
50% of the current value of their interests, while unsecured
creditors will only receive close to 60% of the value of their
claims.
Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations Inc., Baker
Petrolite Corp. and Western Atlas International Inc. had
asserted in a Sept. 15 objection that the plan violated the
absolute priority rule and was thus not confirmable.
The Baker Hughes group also took issue with the
plan for lumping all lien creditors into one class. "The
Proposed Plan wholly fails to address the issue that the
various lien creditors have liens against properties which
may vary greatly in value," the Baker Hughes group said.
It added that the plan is thus not confirmable as the secured
claimants are not properly classified into separate classes
According to Walter, the disclosure statement was
revised to allow for four different treatments of around $34
million in miscellaneous secured claims.
Liens designated sub-class A, claims senior to
other secured claims, will be paid out in full in cash. Sub-class
B liens, those outside Louisiana, will be asked to
accept 85 cents on the dollar for their claims. Sub-class C
liens, those that attach in Louisiana, will be asked to accept
80 cents on the dollar for their claims. And, finally, all
other liens, those in sub-class D, may be challenged.
If sub-class D liens are found to be legitimate, they
will be paid in cash in full over time, or their collateral will
be returned to them. However, Forcenergy says it will not
return any collateral constituting a mineral lease.
As reported, Forcenergy?s plan of reorganization
is expected to provide holders of allowed general unsecured
claims with a 62% recovery through the distribution of
23.04 million shares of new common stock on a pro rata
basis.
On Sept. 22 the hearing on the adequacy of the
disclosure statement began. It was then continued until
Oct. 15, and then again to Oct. 22, in order to give the
company time to supplement the document and address the
objections.   --end--
