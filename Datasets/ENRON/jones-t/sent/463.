Below are my comments to the Legal/Financial transactions only on the latest 
counterparty list:

1.  CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Co.- no Column L, cannot do basis 
transactions, that is floating, weather trades should all be approved, Column 
CF should be out, basis is floating, fixed price transactions only
2.  Elf Trading S.A.-should be approved for weather, why no weather?
3.  Lehman Brothers Commercial Corp.-weather should not be approved
4.  Power Authority of the State of New York-seems to be missing from list.  
What happened?
5.  Richardson Products II, Ltd.-please note, we just got in the signed ISDA 
Master Agreement this week
6.  UBS AG - approved for interest rate and currency only-should be 
restricted for all other products
7.  Abitibi Consolidated-please note, we got the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in this week
8.  Cross Timbers Energy Services-missed no weather
9.  EIL Petroleum-missed no weather
10.  Trafigura AG - Column DZ, US weather CDD swap is ok, Column EB, HDD 
weather swap is ok
11.  Emerson Electric Co. - switching to approved for all products, it is not 
a utility.

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, I have been and am continuing to review 
our list of utilities with Sara Shackleton, outside counsel and the 
regulatory people.  I don't know when I will get you a revised list, but I 
hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading.
