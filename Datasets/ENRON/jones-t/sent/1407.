FYI,

Connie Sutton is no longer the Contracts Manager, she has taken a position 
with Enron Networks.  Please remove her from all Financial Contract 
distribution and please replace her with the new manager Linda S. Bryan.  
Linda is in the process of moving, so I cannot provide her EB location, but 
she is at ex. 3-3538.  These changes are to made effective immediately!

Thank You all for your attention,
Anthony
