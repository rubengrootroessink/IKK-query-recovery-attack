Rick Tucker at Pan Canadian (he used to be at PG&E) called and has been 
speaking to Willie Harrell on the Confirm Desk, and I believe Willie spoke to 
Mark about this issue yesterday, but it appears to be unresolved and I think 
Mark was going to talk to you about it.

Pan Canadian is doing EOL trades, and wants to know why he keeps getting the 
online confirms w/the GTC's attached since the way the system is set up he 
technically is already agreeing to the GTC's online.  He feels he is having 
to look at a lot of unnecessary paper.

Rick will be out of the office Friday and Monday, but was hoping you could 
give him a call Tuesday to discuss this issue.  His phone # is 713/331-5049.

FYI, we do not have a master in place with Pan Canadian Energy Services.
