In response to your email, an amendment to the referenced executed ISDA 
Master was sent by Susan Bailey to the Counterparty on 11/23/99.  With 
respect to the credit, this amendment provides for an increase in the 
Counterparty Exposure Threshold from U.S. $3,000,000 to U.S. $5,000,000, and 
amends one of the MAC provisions for Counterparty by increasing 
Counterparty's Net Worth from CAD$85,000,000 to CAD$150,000,000.  Certain 
other changes are being made to agreement including amending certain of the 
the LC provisions, as well other changes to legal terms that will incorporate 
our recent form changes.  THIS AMENDMENT HAS NOT BEEN EXECUTED.

Other credit in the agreement not being amended includes 3rd party debt 
default for Counterparty of CAD$5,000,000 and U.S. $50,000,000 with respect 
to Enron Corp., an Exposure Threshold for ECT Canada of $10,000,000, and a 
MAC for ECT Canada tied to a drop in Enron Corp.'s Credit Rating below "BBB-" 
from S&P.  The other MAC for Counterparty that is not being changed is if 
Counterparty's ratio of its Funded Debt to Net Worth is more than 1 to 1.

I hope that helps...let me know if you need more info or if you need me to 
fax these documents to you.
