Per our conversation, attached is the form of ISDA Agreement, with Enron 
guaranty attached to it.  As we discussed, Cadwalader will issue an 
enforceability opinion with respect to the Enron Corp. guaranty, so we need 
to provide them with an opinion with respect to Enron Corp. general corporate 
matters.

Thanks for your help!
