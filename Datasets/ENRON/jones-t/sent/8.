Linda and I had a good visit Sunday for about six hours.  We had a nice lunch 
at an outdoor cafe, went shopping in the Village, and then went back to my 
house for a chat.  Linda had pictures of Jenny.  She is a beautiful 14 year 
old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was 
voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and 
Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed 
for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient.  
Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.  But 
she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought 
her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life. 

I'm getting ready to leave for New Orleans tomorrow for our Legal 
Conference.  We have dinner reservations at Emeril's for 9:00 tomorrow night 
and we're all a bit excited about that.  Then Thursday night is our big night 
out at a blues club.

This email was a good idea.  Linda got my address and I hope to be chatting 
with her more than every two years!  I'll be in touch when I get back.   All 
my love,
