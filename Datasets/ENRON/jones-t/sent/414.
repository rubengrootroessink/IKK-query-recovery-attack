I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board 
resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, 
and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a 
Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none 
of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in 
getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you 
usually do?
