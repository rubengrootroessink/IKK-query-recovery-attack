Hi Tana,

We did have it set up in the system without "Inc." but I got a request from 
the settlements group to add "Inc." to the name.  I personally verified it 
with the counterparty, and changed the record in GCP.  Lexis-Nexis shows that 
it was incorporated in California in 1984 as Pacific Forest Resources, Inc.  
Yes, please fax the articles to 713 646 5797, so I can get this clarified 
once and for all.  

Thanks,

Cheryl x33103

Re: Pacific Forest Resources

Unless this is another company or they have changed their name subsequent to 
the execution of the ISDA Master in 1998, we have an ISDA Master in place 
with this counterparty and have a copy of their Articles of Incorporation in 
the file, and there is no "Inc." at the end of this company's name.  If you 
would like me to send you a company of the company's Articles of 
Incorporation I will be happy to do so.
