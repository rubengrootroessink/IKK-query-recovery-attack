With respect to the "amends":

Calpine Power:  was already open for financial-no change to that approval

Utilicorp.:  I originally had Enron sales only for power, but Leslie is now 
telling me to open them for all power.

Constellation:  I originally had them shut down for financial, so I am 
opening them up.  I originally had them shut down for power and they should 
stay shut down.
