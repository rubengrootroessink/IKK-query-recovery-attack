I am just confirming with each of you that I will be opening up The Toa 
Reinsurance Company Limited, a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list to 
trade all physical and financial products, including Australian and Japanese 
weather, which seems to be the products they are truly interested in 
trading.  Let me know if you have any problems with that immediately.
