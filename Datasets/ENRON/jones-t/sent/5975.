TFS was sent out but has not came back in signed.  I was out yesterday, so 
Spectron has not gone out.  I have that on my list to do today.

Tana,
Can I just get a status report on the NDA that you've sent out for me.  I 
want to verify that Spectron and TFS have not executed the NDA yet.

Thanks,

Dan
