I do not know the answer to your question.  I suggest you talk to Credit.  
Financial does indeed have a master with Weyerhaueser Company Limited.  I 
have no idea what we trade physical under or what other Weyerhaueser  
companies we may have business with.

Karen et al.,

To begin with, I contacted Legal (Tana Jones) in reference to Weyerhaeuser 
Company listed on the Clickpaper Credit Response 090700, and left her a 
voicemail message since she was not available.  She has not yet responded.

Since then, I have been in contact with Global Counterparty and they have 
advised me that the CP#11319 Weyerhaeuser Company (the CP reported on 
Clickpaper 090700) is the parent to CP#81012 Weyerhaeuser Company Limited 
(the CP that we currently have an executed contract ). 

Based on similar issues in the past, and supported by Mary Solomonson's 
agreement with the Legal department, the Global Contracts group will not 
provide a response until Legal clarifies the issue.  Accordingly, we will not 
include the current Global Contract number given to CP#81012 Weyerhaeuser 
Company Limited unless and until Legal approves the contract for Weyerhaeuser 
Company.

Regards,
Bridgette
