Then, I'll stick with what I told the EOL team.  If they really want to trade 
power they will have to get us a contact and we'll talk to them to see why 
they think they can trade power.  Otherwise, it stays as a "no".

According to all the FERC lists Leslie left me - they are nowhere to be 
found. I have checked all 6 lists lists twice.

I originally had the referenced counterparty opened for power.  Are we sure 
it is not a FERC approved marketer?
