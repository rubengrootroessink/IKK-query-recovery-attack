Frank:

We have recently rethought our treatment of some of our Western 
counterparties.  Originally, if a Western CP traded power in the West under 
the WSPP Agreement, we permitted the CP to enter into Enron Sales only for 
Eastern power pursuant to the on-line GTCs.  However, we have decided that 
certain of such CPs should not be permitted to trade Eastern power at all.  
Accordingly, please revise the profile for the CPs listed below so that they 
cannot buy or sell Eastern power products via EOL:

Arizona Public Service Company
Avista Corporation - Washington Water Power Division
British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation
California Department of Water Resources
City of Redding
Colorado Springs Utilities
Idaho Power Company
Los Angeles Department of Water & Power
Nevada Power Company
Northern California Power Agency
Pacificorp
Public Service Company of Colorado
Public Service Company of New Mexico
Sacremento Municipal Utility District
Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
Seattle City Light
Sierra Pacific Power Company
St. Joseph Light & Power Co.
Tucson Electric Power Company

If any of these CPs have previously traded any Eastern power products, please 
let me know at your earliest convenience so that I can address this issue.

Please note that this change should not affect the ability of these CPs to 
trade Western power products.

Thanks:

Leslie
