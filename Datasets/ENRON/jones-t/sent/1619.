Yes, I would still like to do a movie.  We are running 2 hours and 15
minutes in the morning so I don't know what time I will be finished.  What
is your plan for running?

I don't need to spend a lot of time looking at the house, I just want you to
have a look.  I would get to do all new landscaping so I am thinking about
digging up plants at my house and putting them in pots before my property is
sold.

You for sure can't do it right after work??

I need to run to the bank.  I will be right back.

Sure.  Maybe after running we could get cleaned up and go take a look.  Do
you still want to go to the movies?

Good Day,

I want you to go with me to look at this house I  have been checking out in
the Woodland Heights. It is a re-do, gutted and  cleaned up, and ready to
be moved in to asap. Are you working late  tonight, and, if not, would you
be up for me coming by just for a quick  trip??? You may have plans, and,
if you do, could I grab you tomorrow for  a quick look? I am putting a
'for sale by owner' sign in my yard  today!!!

Let me know
