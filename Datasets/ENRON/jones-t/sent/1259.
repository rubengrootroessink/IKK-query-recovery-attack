I reviewed the counterparties in our Financial Trading Database and located 
17 who cannot enter into financial power transactions and cross-checked that 
list against my Online Trading Counterparty List and located the 6 
counterparties below have been opened to trade online and who cannot trade 
financial power and/or who have some type of restriction in place on the type 
of financial power transactions they can enter into:

1.  The Bakersfield Californian - can only do newsprint swaps and options
2.  CMS Marketing, Services and Trading - can enter into financial power 
transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps, basis swaps, 
swing swaps and options
3.  Phibro, Inc. - can only do natural gas, crude oil or oil product energy 
prices swap, put & call options.  Per my discussions with Tom, this 
counterparty is coming through on tonight's list as an amended counterparty 
because they want to do financial power.  They have a really old form of 
agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial 
transactions.  I spoke to Mark Taylor about this and he said if they want to 
do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an 
ISDA.  I am going to talk to Credit about this.  They will definitely not be 
able to trade financial power by Monday...
4.  PXRE Corporation - weather only
5.  Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation - weather only
6.  Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited - weather only
