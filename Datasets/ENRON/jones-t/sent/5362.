Yes, there will be different legal/jurisdictional issues.  I'm going to have 
to run this by an attorney familiar w/Japan.  I'll get back to you...

Tana,

I am assembling infomation for an NDA with a company in Japan (Itochu).  Is 
there anything special that I need to know about when the NDA is more 
international?  

Thanks
