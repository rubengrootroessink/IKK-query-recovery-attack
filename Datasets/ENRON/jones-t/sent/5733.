Tana,

Yesterday, Deutsche Bank faxed me a "Derivatives Novation Letter" assigning 
the
BT trades to Deutsche Bank-London Branch, as of February 23, 2001.  Attached 
to
the novation letter is a 23 page deal by deal list of all novated deals (why 
they
can't just say "all outstanding deals", I don't know).   Should I fax this up 
to you?

Diane

Subject: Bankers Trust/Deutsche Bank

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
and master sit.
