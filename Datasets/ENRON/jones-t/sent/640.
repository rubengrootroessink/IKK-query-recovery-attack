I don't know where we stand on reviewing the derivatives situation for the 
referenced counterparty, but Frank Davis with EOL just called and the 
counterparty is applying for a password, so he wanted to refresh his memory 
why we wouldn't open them up for derivatives trading.  I told him that we 
were just looking at their situation last week, and to give your name & # to 
the counterparty if they question why they can't trades derivatives.  It 
isn't clear to me that we're ready to change our opinion on them yet.
