Hi Tana,

This email is in response to my earlier voice mail regarding two NDAs to be 
sent out today.  Here's what I think may be the pertinent information:

Continental Airlines - Cargo
1600 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002
United States 
Attn:  Mr. Ed O'Meara


Eagle Global Logistics
15350 Vickery Dr
Houston, TX 77032
Attn:  Mr. Stephen J. Carattini

Content might say something about not mentioning any details about talking to 
Enron about air cargo commoditization with any other company or to the press, 
etc. until we give them express written permission.  

I'm sure I forgot something relevant.  Just give me a call at 5-9323.
