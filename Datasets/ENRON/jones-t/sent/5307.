Can you please delete access to the financial trading agreement database to 
the following people:

Anita Fam
Brenda Whitehead
Elizabeth Sager
Jason Peters
Stephanie Sever
Christian Yoder
Lorraine Filomeno
Shari Stack
Susan Flynn
Lisa Lees

Two people need to have their access changed from Legal Dept., to Credit 
Dept. (therefore they can make Credit comments, not Legal comments):  Tom 
Moran and Veronica Espinoza.

Also, please add a lawyer in our Group to the database with full edit 
access:  Cheryl Nelson.

Thanks!
