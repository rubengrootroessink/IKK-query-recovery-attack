It was good seeing you.  Thanks for dinner.  Shawna and I were waiting for 
your call about a coffee (she even said she'd buy!), but I guess we missed 
you for this trip.  She sends her regards!

I harassed Justy about his movie career.  He told me he was the body double 
for Russell Crowe.  I asked him whether he and/or his horse had hired agents 
yet (depending on who was getting better reviews!) 

Keep me posted on the house.  It looked great!
