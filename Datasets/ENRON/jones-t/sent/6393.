Louis,

I went to fill in all that stuff, but they want to much personal information 
(like my address and phone number which I don't like to give out) and they 
won't accept the referral without it.

Can I expect any kind of payback from my contractor for giving him such a
high rating?

Tana when you have a  chance could you do me a favor and go to
www.contractor.com and do a search for  contractor by name then enter my
name and then my company name will come up and  then click on the link to
rate this contractor. Then fill out the form and rate  your favorite
contractor and of course you must give me high  marks.

How are you  doing?

Louis
