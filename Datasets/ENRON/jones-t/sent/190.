Attached is the proposed draft of the ISDA.  I think two substantive issues 
we are going out with are adding arbitration and not deleting "Affiliates" 
from the setoff section (which we agreed to in the original).  With all the 
bankruptcies going on right now Carol feels that we should at least make a 
stab at keeping Affiliates in.

Let me know if the draft is OK to send out.
