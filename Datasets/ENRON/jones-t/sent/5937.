I've gotten some calls from the business people who want to trade with two 
counterparties right away.  One is Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, which 
is on the list for the 19th, and the other is Mobil Oil Corporation Supply & 
Distribution which is on the list of the 20th.  Can you please make sure the 
individuals in Global Contracts responsible for these counterparties update 
them today.

Our business people would be most appreciative!
