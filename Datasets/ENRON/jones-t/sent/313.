Attached are the revised descriptions for SO2 and NOX.  Jeff Hodge signed off 
on the Canada description and said it looked fine in its current form.  I 
will be faxing you this evening our comments to Natural Gas.  You should have 
received weather by separate email from Shari Stack.  Coal should be coming 
shortly, paper is being looked at by the business people and we will have it 
to you on Tuesday.  The person responsible for power is out of the office, 
but will be back in town on Tuesday, and we will get you her comments then.   
Thank you for your kind patience.

Please find attached for your further handling the revised, legally approved

Please advise if I may be of further assistance.
