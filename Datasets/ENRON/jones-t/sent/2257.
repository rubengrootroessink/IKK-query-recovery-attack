PSE&G just called and want to trade natural gas online and want to make sure 
that they can trade it under the GISB.  They want to amend the ETA to that 
effect.  I'm not sure how we want to handle this.  Get Stacy/Jeff's approval 
that their gas trades can go under the GISB, and then amend the ETA?  The 
woman who called is Denise Pocius at (973) 430-8181.
