John - We have not received the NDA from Jeff Gulliot.  I spoke with our
attorney who indicated technically Enron cannot pass PurchasePooling
information
on to Interliant without being in violation of the proposed NDA.  He will
modify
the NDA to permit information to be passed to/from Interliant freely.  I
recommend checking with your council, but our attorney recommended each of
you
sign NDA's.  You may reach Curtis Fox at 914 640 9000 x268 or at
curtis_fox@interliant.com.
