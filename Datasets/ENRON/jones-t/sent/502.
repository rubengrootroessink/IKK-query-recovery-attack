I asked  Richard Ramirez if there was a business contact and he said he 
didn't know, but he was going to get back to me.   I think in his job in Fuel 
and Energy Risk Management, he is probably the business contact.  He probably 
makes the decisions about fuel purchases and derivatives hedging.  He also 
wanted to get a power enabling agreement in place.  I spoke to Liz Sager and 
she said we already had a power trade on the books and except for authority 
issues, there was no reason not to do financial energy.

As far as sending my Lotus Notes comment, I just did that manually.  I spoke 
to the Lotus Notes people before I went on vacation, and among other changes, 
they are going to try and fix it so we can just click on the email address 
and it will notify people to see Lotus Notes.  Of course, the only groups 
that will have access to the comment sections of Lotus Notes (for 
confidentiality purposes) will continue to be Legal and Credit.

But we are going to open everything but the comments and "priority" screens 
to any interested business people.  I'm going to move the "restrictions" bar 
right after the name so when the business people look the first thing they 
will see will be any restrictions.

Then, I'm going to add a drop down for online trading, approved or not, and 
then a comment screen (that only Legal and Credit can see) so we will have 
some notes about why we approved them or not (some of us are getting old and 
can't remember things!).
