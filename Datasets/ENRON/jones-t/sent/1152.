Theresa Smith forwarded your comments to the NDA to me.  I ran them by Mark 
Taylor, an attorney in our Legal Dept., and am attaching a clean and 
blacklined draft reflecting the changes we were able to make.

If your lawyer needs to talk to Mark directly his phone no. is (713) 
853-7459.  I am a paralegal in his group and if you would like to get in 
touch with me my phone no. is (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing 
from you.
