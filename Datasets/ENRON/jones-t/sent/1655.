On the referenced list, Credit shows River Trading Company as an amended 
counterparty, but I didn't have them at all so I treated them like a new 
counterparty.

On the 8/8/00 List, Braintree is a division, and I would like it to read:  
City of Braintree, Massachusetts Electric Light Department.
the name on Spinnaker is wrong, Credit will be correcting it to read 
Spinnaker Exploration Company L.L.C.
