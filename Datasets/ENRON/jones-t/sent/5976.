What do you think about Russell's request for a confirm here?  I think this 
is really confusing for our Canadian team.  There must be requirements for 
the LC if it's an upfront LC, we would need a zero threshold.  I just don't 
think this is very straight forward for these poor Candadian girls to figure 
out.  What do you think?
