With respect to your inquiry as to whether there was any assignment executed 
with respect to the assignment of the Howard trades to TXU, I looked in the 
file and it appears that Susan Bailey in our Group prepared an Assignment and 
Termination Agreement which she passed on the Brant Reves in Credit on 1/6/00 
for handling.  There is no record of this assignment ever being executed in 
our records.
