You crack me up!  Your baby report made me laugh!  Keep me posted on how the 
kids are doing.  I enjoy your stories.

All my home improvements are about done.  I've finally put in central air, 
repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, 
including a fountain in the backyard.  It looks like a new house!  The final 
job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it.  
I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in 
a construction site.

I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be 
at it again for another winter.  I thought I had most of their holes for 
getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & 
heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll 
probably have to go through it again this winter.  I vow to prevail!

Keep in touch...!
