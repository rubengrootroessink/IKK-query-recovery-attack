As some of you may be aware, there have been substantial revisions to the 
U.S. Tax Code which will require revising the tax language in our swap 
agreements.  I will be providing Steve Douglas in the Tax Dept. copies of the 
current tax language in our swap agreements and will coordinate with him 
revisions to the forms.  I'll keep you posted when the changes occur.
