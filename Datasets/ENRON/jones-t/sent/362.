Taffy, can you work with Nicola to get this conf. call set up with London, in 
Suzanne's absence.  Thanks!

Tana,

Thanks for getting back to me.  Would it be possible for our IT department to 
call you just before 11.00 a.m. (Central time) to get the call set up.  
Apparently, IT here call you and you put the call through to your video 
conference room.  I would ask Suzanne Adams who I have been dealing with to 
sort this out but I understand that she is going to be out of the office that 
day.  

Any problems, please let me know.

Thanks for your help.

Nicola
