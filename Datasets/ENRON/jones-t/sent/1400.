John, you can take Shari Stack off these emails.  She is a lawyer working on 
the physical power agreements, our group works on the financial trading 
agreements.  Carol St. Clair is the lawyer working on this master (I'm a 
paralegal).  Thanks.

I believe this means only that we are not closing a deal today.  I would
