I'll make sure I'm at my desk.

Attached below is the Argentine customer list for EnronOnline.  My 
understanding is that we will launch EnronOnline in Argentina within the next 
couple of weeks.  With this in mind, I think we will have to shoot for the 
end of next week (October 13) to have customer profiles completed.  Please 
let Lisa Lees know of any conflicts or issues that arise.

Thanks!

Frank

Frank,

It seems now that we are going to proceed with Argentina. Therefore, I am 
attaching the customer list. I am not sure if you already have it.

Thanks!
