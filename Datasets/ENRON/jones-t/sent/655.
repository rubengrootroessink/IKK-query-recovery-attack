When you have a minute, I've been inputting data all week and have 
fixes/upgrades we need to the database.  In particular, the EOL people are 
about to introduce a new product any time time now, and I need that sort the 
shows "Approved, approved with limits, not approved" to work so I won't have 
to look at each of 1500 entries to determine what limits are in place.  When 
you arrive Monday can you let me know how long it will take you to have that 
sort working.  Then, maybe we can get together and discuss other changes we 
need to make.

Much thanks!
