Julian,

The "Confirmation" will be the actual written Confirmation, which confirms in 
writing the terms of the deal agreed to on the phone.  I don't know if what 
they're looking for is a form of Confirmation (not deal specific) of what a 
Confirmation might look like if they did a trade, or if you actually have 
done or are proposing a particular trade and need to see the Confirmation 
filled in with the proposed deal terms.  I left Roni Cappadonna with Duke a 
voicemail asking her which specifically she was looking for.  As soon as I 
hear from her I'll get her what she needs.  If you have any more questions, 
email me back, or call.  I'm at your service!
