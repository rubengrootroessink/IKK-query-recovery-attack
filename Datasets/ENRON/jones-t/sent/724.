Mark and I were discussing my potential purchase of a car, and were looking 
at some web sites, and thought we would pass on the following car buying web 
sites:

www.edmunds.com (tells you what prices to pay for cars, safety records)

www.consumer.org (Consumer Reports Magazine Web Site, more to car safety, 
repair records)

www.carclub.com (if you go to "research advice", then click on "crash test 
results" they have some info on SUV crash tests.  Since y'all don't have as 
many SUV's on the road in England you may not know that some of them have 
failed the crash tests big time, and that also because their point of gravity 
is up higher they tend to rollover (or "tump" as we say here in Texas) when 
you make a sharp turn (like to avoid an accident).

Anyway, we were a little concerned about your safety...
