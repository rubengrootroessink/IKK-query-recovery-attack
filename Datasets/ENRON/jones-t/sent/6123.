Tana,

As per conversation, attached are two forms of letter that we have used in 
the past when requesting legal advise from local counsel.  The long form is 
the letter that Alan and Sara worked on with Allen & Overy back in 1996.  The 
short form is the letter that Mike Robison has used when dealing directly 
with local counsel requesting advise in connection with physical trading 
matters.  I hope this is helpful.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks.
Nony
