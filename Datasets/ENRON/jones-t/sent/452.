Just a note, you know, we more or less made the same changes to the 
Industrial Master that we made to the ISDA.  If you are using that form at 
all you should update it to include our changes.  I think Paul mentioned in 
his presentation at the seminar that you were using the Industrial as the 
basis form for Norway.  Anyway, if that is the case, we may need to look at 
that form.

See, you're always in my thoughts!  Missed you at the seminar.  I hope we'll 
see you at one of these soon!
