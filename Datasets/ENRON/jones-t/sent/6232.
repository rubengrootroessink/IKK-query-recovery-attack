Sheri,

I need to know the nature of the discussions we will be having with this 
company so I know how to word the decription in the agreement.  Also, usually 
I email the agreements directly to the counterparty, so unless he will be 
delivering this in another manner, I will need an email address.

Tana,

John Pavetto asked if you could prepare a standard NDA for the following 
company:

Ajilon, L.L.C.
16225 Park Ten Place
Suite 620
Houston, TX  77084
Attn.:  Ken Keefer

Ken Keefer is not sure who will sign on behalf of Ajilon.  David Berberian 
(Managing Director) will sign for Net Works.  

John has a meeting with them the week of May 14.  Please let me know if you 
need any additional info.  

Thanks!
Sheri
