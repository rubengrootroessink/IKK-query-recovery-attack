		 Subject: ISDA Credit Worksheet

Please begin using the new ISDA credit worksheet template attached for all 
credit sent to the financial trading legal team.  I have added sections for 
elegible swap participant and specified entity.  If you have any questions as 
to how these new areas (or any of the old areas) are to be filled in, I will 
be happy to walk you through it.

Thanks,
Tanya
