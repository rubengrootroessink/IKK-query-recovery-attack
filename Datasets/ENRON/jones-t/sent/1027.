The way this came about, Sheila has a customer that was creating a new 
internal and, initially she contacted Sara and it was Sara's understanding 
that they were in the tranportation business, not trading, and wanted to use 
the word "exchange" in their company name, and did we, as the CFTC experts, 
know any reason why they shouldn't (I also understand it was Julia that 
mentioned to Sheila she might have an issue there).  After my email went out, 
Sheila came around with the press release they were drafting, and it sure 
sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the 
exchange and less toward the tranportation.  They used words like "online 
clearinghouse" and the like!  So I told Sheila maybe she'd better contact Ken 
Raisler directly since it seemed like she had a real problem there.  I 
haven't spoken to her to find out what came out of it.
