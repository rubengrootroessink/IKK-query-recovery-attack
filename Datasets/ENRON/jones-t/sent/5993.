Tana,

Per my voice mail to you this week, I have obtained the information which
you requested regarding Amerada Hess Corporation's ability to trade on Enron
On-Line.

Amerada Hess Corporation would like to trade gas and power, financial and
physical, in the United States and Canada.

We would also like to trade options for gas and power.

Could you run the necessary reports and contact me with our current ability
to trade On-Line?  Also, if we do not presently have the ability to trade
the above, could you inform me as to the steps which need to be taken in
order to trade?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Dana M. Dellacona
