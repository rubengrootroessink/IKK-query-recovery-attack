The page out of the book we were sent last year says "Treaty Withholding Tax 
Rates" , and under it is says "The following are US withholding tax rates for 
dividend, interest and royalty payments from the United States to residents 
of various treaty countries.  Then below there it has a list which shows the 
Country, Dividends %, Interest%, Patent and Know-how Royalties.

What type of income is potentially subject to w/h tax?  I assume you're 
looking for the interest w/h tax rates.

Jeff,

We are also usually sent a page from some tax book that show the rate of 
withholding for each of the treaty countries.  Their rate of withholding will 
impact which form we may or may not need.  Can you send it to me?  Thanks!
