How should I respond to soybeans?  It is on the list of commodities we might 
trade.

Tana,
I'm with Risk Assessment and Control and I'm currently not trading in the 
account.  (It is an old account that was opened before I started at Enron.  I 
haven't traded in it because Enron appears to trade in everything! )  
However, since I have you,  I am currently considering buying some options in 
soybeans. Would this be against Enron policy?  
Thanks,
Frank

Thanks for your response.  Yes, I I do need to know two things.  First, the 
group you are in, and then second, what products you are trading out of the 
account.  The Enron Trading Policy prohibits employees from trading in any of 
the products the company trades in.

Thanks!

Tana,
Pursuant to an email from Mark Taylor, I am notifying you that I have a 
financial interest in a Commodity Futures Account.
Let me know if there is any additional information your require.
Thanks,
