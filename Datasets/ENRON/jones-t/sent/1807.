Per the emails below, it appears you are looking for the Legal and Privacy 
Statement.  Mark T. said Leslie just revised it for the online team.  Leslie 
is on vacation until the 9th, but I think attached below may be the latest 
draft.  It is located in her "Online" subdirectory, under "Phase 2".

Thanks, but we already have the electronic copies of ETA/PA referenced. What 
we currently need is a word version of the Legal and Privacy Statement. Could 
you send?

Thanks, Alan

Dale,

Alan Aronowitz gave me your name as someone to get in touch with who might 
have an electronic copy of the EOL registration documents.  As I explained in 
my voice mail today, CommodityLogic, an Enron company, is setting up a web 
site that will require users to register to use the site.  We were hoping to 
leverage the work that EOL has already done in this area.

If you have the legal documents and/or registration documents could you 
please forward them to me as soon as possible.  We want to add these things 
to our web site (after we change the text to fit our needs) which is going 
live Friday - so as far in advance as you can get them to us the better.  If 
you do not have the documents could you please let me know or forward this 
note (cc'ing me) to the person you think may have them.

Thanks for your help.

Todd
