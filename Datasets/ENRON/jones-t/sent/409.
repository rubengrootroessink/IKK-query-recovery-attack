What's the scoop on the TXU negotiation?  Brant says we're in a strong 
negotiation position with them right now, because they've acquired Howard's 
book and need our consent, and also have to post an expensive LC with us to 
take in those Howard trades.  He wants to know if he should use our leverage 
here to get that ISDA Master in place.
