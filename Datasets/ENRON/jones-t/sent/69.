Nella,

Your message about the Canadian forms inspired me to visit with Mark.  We 
were in the middle of updating the Canadian forms, and Mark just gave me a 
few final changes, and as soon as I make those I'll email them up to you.  
Actually we have two Canadian forms, the ISDA and the "Industrial".
