I've been booked up lately for various things (mainly people's new babies and 
home improvement tasks).  I've been wondering where you disappeared to.  Do 
you want to do something this weekend.  There are a few new chick flicks I 
wouldn't mind seeing...

Ms. Jones,

I know you are working hard, but I needed to just check in and see how you
are.

Also, I just talked to Gale Ford, massage lady, and she said she will be
working on Sat., March 3 in the afternoon.  I know weekdays are hard for you
to make appointments and surely you are in need of a massage by now!!!!

Let me know how you are when you come up for air!!

  Patti
