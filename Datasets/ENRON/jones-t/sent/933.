On this Statoil Trade, I guess this is a physical trade done with ENA.  Can 
you do one of those handy dandy little sheets you do for me so I can attach 
them to my assignment.

I am forever in your debt...

Good Afternoon Tana,

StatOil Energy has performed a deal that they would now like reassigned under 
a new counterparty name - StatOil Energy Services Inc.  I explained to Kara 
Mucha (StatOil contact) that the trades done on EOL were firm and in order to 
actually have this done, an assignment needed to be drafted by legal etc.    

I am forwarding the details on a deal performed on 3/28/00 that needs to be 
reassigned.   Bob Bowen in confirmations explained that we should perform an 
over the counter trade just exactly the opposite  to cancel out the trade and 
then perform the trade over the counter with the right counterparty name.  
However in verifying with our Product Control Group, they suggested I forward 
this information on to you.  

Trade Details:
132184 - 03/28/00  09:47:36AM    Statoil Energy Trading, Inc.    
US Gas Phy Index Firm non-TX < or = 1Mo,

I hope that you will be able to assist or at least direct me in the right 
direction.  Should you need more clarification or have any questions (since I 
have kinda rambled on) please do not hesitate to call me at ext.36283.


Thank You,
Lorie Hernandez
