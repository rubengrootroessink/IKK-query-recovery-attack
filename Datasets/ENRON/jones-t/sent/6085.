To summarize and in response to our meeting last week:

1.   I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the 
Enron Net Works Team and my proposed form for the EnronOffline Team.  Please 
let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes 
you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team 
Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people 
you would like the list circulated to.

2.  All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed 
to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by 
email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company 
and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for 
EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I 
prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the 
dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so 
an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some 
other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).

3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to 
circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate 
the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed 
with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should 
also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, 
except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).

4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she 
has prepared that should be added to the list.

If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please 
call me at x33399.
