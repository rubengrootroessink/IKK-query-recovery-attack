Mike,

Could you add two new categories of products to the database for me.  That 
would include the "Yes, Yes with Limits, and No" buttons and also a comment 
screen for the new products.

The two new products are:  Credit Derivatives and Bandwidth

Thanks!

By the way, I can't figure out how to move the Portland masters off the 
master swap list.  I think I am going to need your help with that.
