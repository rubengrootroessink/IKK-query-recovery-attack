Tana,

Laurel Adams provided me your name to help us with the information regarding 
the legal contracts we are needing.  I am forwarding you the request that was 
originally sent to Laurel.  At this time, we would like to review the 
contracts that are listed below as part of our deal test.  As we need to 
complete our testing by Friday the 15th, we would like to review these 
contracts sometime today or tomorrow.  I apologize for the short notice; 
however, we received your name as the contact person yesterday.   Please let 
me know if can help us with this request.  If you have any questions or need 
additional information, please contact me at 3-1951.

Thank you, 

Carrie Richardson


Laurel,

We have been unsuccessful in getting the contract numbers in order to pull 
the contracts for the deals in our deal test.  We have talked with Bridgette 
Anderson and Anthony Campos in Global Contracts to obtain these numbers; 
however, we have had some difficulty.  What we are needing is the ISDA Master 
Agreement, not the system printout, for the dates listed for the following 
deals.


Deal #   Counterparty Name    Date
  
260828   Merrill Lynch International   6/14/00   
291515   Royal Bank of Canada    2/15/95
295931   Merrill Lynch International   6/14/00
300998   Citibank, N.A., New York    11/17/92
251012   Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  10/21/96
271926   BMO Nesbitt Burns    For this deal, the system printout of the ISDA 
Master that we received lists the status as          draft with no effective 
date.  Please provide us with an executed agreement for this deal.
310612   National Westminster Bank PLC   1/1/94

In order to wrap up our testing, please provide us with the above information 
by noon on Thursday.


If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at x31951.

Thank you,

Carrie Richardson
