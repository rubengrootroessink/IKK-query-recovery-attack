Should we reject this from this onset or do you think it is OK?

Hi Tana--

This is an NDA Loudcloud sent to us. They are a potential vendor.
Can we sign this or do we need to send them one of ours?

Thanks,
Mark Palmer

Mark,

Greetings.  I work with Dana Bouterie here at Loudcloud.  She suggested
I provide you with our mutual NDA.  As our discussions progress we want
to make sure we protect both parties.  The NDA is attached below and can
be faxed back to me at 866-488-4646.  If you have any questions, please
do not hesitate to give me a call.

Best regards,
Kathy
