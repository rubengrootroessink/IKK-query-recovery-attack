At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed forms of Broker 
Electronic Transaction Agreement and Fee Agreement.   I understand from Bob 
Shults that we still need to define who the legal contracting party will be 
for APB Energy-Europe.  After you have had a chance to review the agreements, 
please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 
853-3399 with any questions or comments you might have.  We look forward to 
hearing from you.
