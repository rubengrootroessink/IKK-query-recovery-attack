Hi Tana, when I spoke to you last week regarding the FedEx bill charged to 
one of our customer (Lake Side Packers) you gave the company number which is 
great then you gave me a billing code.  Accounting has come back to me 
indicating that they need a cost centre.  The billing code number apparently 
does not mean anything to them.  Can you please forward me the cost centre to 
which this FedEx bill should be charged to.  Thank you in advance for your 
help.

Angela
