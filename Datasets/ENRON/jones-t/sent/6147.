Are you ok with this (they would not be listing, as agent for 3 listed 
utilities)?

I have checked with Kim Theriot and if no one has any objections, we would 
like to be consistent with the way we have handled agency situations 
previously.  Set the name  up in Global as Alliant Energy Corporate Services, 
Inc. , as authorized agent .  I will make a counterparty specific template 
that includes the rest of the legal name of the counterparty.  We have sent 
this format to other agency entities and it was accepted.

Please let me know when this has been done.  We will have to move records in 
the Enpower system because a new record was set up.

Thanks!
