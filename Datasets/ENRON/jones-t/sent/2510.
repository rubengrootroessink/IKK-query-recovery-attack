Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.  Mark says that even though 
we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still 
considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.  I think I might need to 
talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.

Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about 
pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether 
they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their 
lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their 
business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you 
about potential metals customers?

Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?

Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down 
Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?  Do you know when 
he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him?
