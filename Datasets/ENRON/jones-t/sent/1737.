		 Subject: Canadian form of subordination agreement

On an ISDA I am reviewing, credit has asked that all indebtedness of the 
Canadian counterparty to its affiliates be subordinated to us (in this case 
ECC).  Does anyone have access to a Canadian form of subordination 
agreement?  I imagine that a fairly bare-bones form would suffice.  Thanks --
