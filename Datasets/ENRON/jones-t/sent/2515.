On Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Credit wants to open them up for power, 
but Leslie's records are showing they are not a FERC approved marketer.  If 
we want to open them for power, we're going to need the name and phone number 
of someone at the counterparty so we can talk to them about their FERC status.

For HS Energy Services, no change to my prior approval, which would have them 
open for all financial except Australian power.  (Also, shutting down 
Argentina gas...)
