Hi Mark and Tana

I have been given your name by Justin Boyd as someone who can help me or 
point me in the right direction.

We need to raise a power of attorney to enable Amita Gosalia of Enron House 
to execute EnronOnline Password Applications for each of the above company.  
Please could you let me know if you can prepare such a document and also what 
if any additional information you require.  I have attached a copy of the 
Power of Attorney which we use in the UK for such authority for your 
information.



Unfortunately this is becoming quite urgent and any assistance you can give 
will be greatly appreciated.

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Thanks and regards
