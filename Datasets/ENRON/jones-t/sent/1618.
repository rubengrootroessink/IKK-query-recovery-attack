Sure.  Maybe after running we could get cleaned up and go take a look.  Do 
you still want to go to the movies?

Good Day,
?
I want you to go with me to look at this house I  have been checking out in 
the Woodland Heights.? It is a re-do, gutted and  cleaned up, and ready to be 
moved in to asap.? Are you working late  tonight, and, if not, would you be 
up for me coming by just for a quick  trip???? You may have plans, and, if 
you do, could I grab you tomorrow for  a quick look?? I am putting a 'for 
sale by owner' sign in my yard  today!!!
?
Let me know
?
