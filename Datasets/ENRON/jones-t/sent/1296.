You need to contact whoever it is you are speaking to at PPL and tell them we 
have never received a request to assign the financial deals, and if they 
would like to send us one we will take a look at it.

Hi Tana,
I didn't know if I forwarded this to you or not, but they are indeed marking 
up the financial deals
Would you like for me to forward them to you?

Thanks
David

David,

Make sure Tana knows that they are marking up the Financial Confirms.  The 
Physical signoff does us no good.

Joe

FYI...I had already been talking to Tana about this.
Since credit was working on it, I didn't provide a reply to you yet.

This is a consent to the physical business, not financial.  Stacy Dickson 
will sign off on this as soon as she gets Credit approval, which it appears 
she has not yet.

Susan,

Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above 
referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric 
Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.  
These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we 
have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you 
know anything.

Thanks,
Joe
