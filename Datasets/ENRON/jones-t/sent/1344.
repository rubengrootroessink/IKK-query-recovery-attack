What the NYMEX is trying to get at is their concern that the NYMEX consider=

I need some clarification in regards to this email.   ENA holds interest in=

the LV Cogeneration Limited Partnership, both directly and through its=20

As part of the financing of the facility, ENA entered into a 10 year=20

Is this transaction of interest to you and do you need additional informati=
