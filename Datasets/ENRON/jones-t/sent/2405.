I checked w/Mark Taylor, and he can't approve me going to Calgary until he 
checks it with Mark Haedicke to see if it's OK, which he won't do until he 
gets back in town, which is in two weeks.  I hope that isn't going to cause 
any problems...

I actually received the last document I need to put otgether binders this 
week.  Linda and I will compile closing binders with all the relevant 
documents next week and send you one set for your files.  I will send copies 
of the RBC documents to Rick at the same time.

So, when are you going to come and enjoy our crisp weather?  Mark Taylor 
e-mailed me saying he thought it was a good idea for you to come up here to 
train Linda and Sharon.  It ain't Stampede, but at least Peter and I can 
return the hospitality.

Rick Borden at Macleod Dixon sent us a fax requesing copies of the documents 
on the prepay.  Can you send him a copy?  Also, when they're all together, 
can you send a copy to me for our files.  Thanks!
