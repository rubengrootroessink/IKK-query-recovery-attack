Is Ian a lawyer, paralegal or Credit person?  Also, Mark mentioned the London 
Legal has been restructured somehow, and he asked me to ask you if could you 
fax us an org chart that shows the structure...?

Great idea - here's our latest ISDA schedule (note the changes to law,

If you work with Ian, that would be grand
