All of the counterparties on today's list are ESP's, so I will approve them 
for all financial products.  If the aren't ESP's I would not approve them for 
financial products including Australian financial products.  Further, if they 
cannot meet the ESP test on their own, i.e., they are relying on a parent 
guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an ESP, I would approve them for 
all financial products, except Australian power (but they could trade weather 
per our earlier emails).
