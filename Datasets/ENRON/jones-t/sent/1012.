I've been a little distracted.  I've had a contract on a new house, and we 
had the inspections yesterday and everything looks good, so we're just moving 
forward for a May 5 closing.  Also, I have had short in an electric line that 
keeps shutting off all the electricity to my apartment and they've finally 
isolated it and it is somewhere underground in my garden!  Dalzenia has been 
in there digging my garden up, and I think Louis has found the problem in the 
electric line so I hope they are going to get it fixed today so Dalzenia can 
replant my garden...it's always something.

Anyway, I don't have a barbecue, so I will have to borrow one.  How do I go 
about doing that?
