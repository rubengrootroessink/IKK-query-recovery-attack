Linda & Sharon,

My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline 
is quite a beast of a customer.  Because of that I please ask that you direct 
any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two 
paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and 
Stephanie Panus at x53249.  

With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an 
attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the 
Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets.
