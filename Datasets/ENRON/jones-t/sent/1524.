Tana, Karen-
I am currently working on the ClickPaper.com project and am responsible for 
the Product Control Group.  Attached from Tom is a list of about 100 
customers that were on our initial mailout and need to go thru the approval 
process soon.  However, below is a list of 4 customers that we need to focus 
on immediately - we would like to approach these customers to do our first 
trades, therefore, I will need to immediately send them their user ids.  
Irving Pulp & Paper Limited
ConAgra Energy Services, Inc.
Inland Paperboard & Packaging, Inc.
Waste Management, Inc.

I appreciate your help in this matter.
Thanks,
Michelle
