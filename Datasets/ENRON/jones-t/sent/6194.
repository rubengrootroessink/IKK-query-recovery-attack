Sent for Bob Walker 


A group of us have decided to gather for dinner on the Wednesday night before 
the legal conference and wish to extend an invitation for you to join us for 
good food and fellowship and maybe a few drinks.  We have reservations for 
8:00 pm at Delores Del Rio, which is a small Italian restaurant on the 
river.  They have excellent food and live Jazz music.  Very small and quaint 
little place and away from the crush of the party places on the river.

I will need to give a final head count to the restaurant on Wednesday.  If 
you can join us, or know of anyone who would like to, please let me know and 
I will get directions, or we can all walk over from the hotel.  It is a very 
short walk.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Thanks,

Bob.
