Thanks for your email.

As you aleady appear to be aware, Enron Company Policy prohibits employees 
from tading any products the company trades.   As you may or may not be 
aware, the products the company trades has expanded beyond energy 
commodities, we trade interest rates & currencies, pulp & paper, weather, and 
metals.  I am sure this product base will continue to expand.  If you have 
any questions about trading a particular product, please call me at x33399 (I 
am a paralegal in the Legal Dept.), Mark Taylor, VP & General Counsel of 
Trading, at x37459, or Ted Murphy, Control, at x33324.
