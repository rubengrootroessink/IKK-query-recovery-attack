Sorry about not getting back to you sooner.  I am in Calgary this week.  
Stephanie and I met with Mark Taylor about this on Monday, and he said to go 
ahead and confirm this under the Houston master with Hess Energy Trading 
Company LLC.

Stephanie-

There are two deals from yesterday involving Hess Energy Trading Company UK 
Limited as agents for Hess Energy Trading Company LLC. Would this entity be 
covered under the Master Agreement with Hess Energy Trading Company LLC.

Thanks. Julie
