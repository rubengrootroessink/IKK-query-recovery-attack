EOL Team,

Please approve the above mentioned for online trading for financial oil and 
gas in the U.S. only.    

We have a Master Swap contract with these guys, and they are an ESP.  
However, their exposure is well above the contractual threshold ($6.5MM 
credit line versus $12MM exposure) and we are not collateralized for the 
amount of exposure above the credit line.  So, as a result, we want to 
approve them for online trading, but we actually do not want them to be able 
to complete any transactions.  The counterparty has requested approval, and 
Fred Lagrasta has asked that we approve them so they can get online and see 
the stacks.  Credit does not want them to complete trades, so we need to set 
a very low credit line for online trading so when the counterparty attempts 
to trade (if they attempt to trade), is turned down.

If this is not possible, please ket me know so I can get back with Fred and 
the counterparty.

Thanks,

John
