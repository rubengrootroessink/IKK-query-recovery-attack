Hi Tana,

Further to Karen Lambert's email below, could you please let me know what the 
status is with SaskEnergy?  Are they understanding the fact that their EOL 
transactions will fall under the Master Agreement's terms and conditions?

Let me know if I need to contact them.  Thanks,

Matilda

Yes, she is working with Tana Jones in Legal regarding New York 
jurisdictional issues (and others).  You might want to touch base with Tana 
in a few days while I am out.

Hi Karen,

Did you follow up with this counterparty yet?  If not, I'll look after it.  I 
just don't want both of us calling her.  Thanks.

Matilda

Subject: EOL Help Desk Question, CP ID 5177 SaskEnergy Incorporated, Global 
Contract 96013849

FYI -- The counterparty question below includes reference to a Canadian 
Physical Gas master contract for online trading.  I am not certain which 
other agreement they are questioning (online GTC? online ETA? other master 
contract?).  When I tried to contact the counterparty her voice mail states 
that Debbie is out of the office until March 6th.  At this point, I am unsure 
if this is a purely "Canada gas" question or if they have questions that 
cross-commodities and locations.  No specific action is needed by your 
group.  I just want to make sure you are aware of any Canadian contract 
issues.   (There is an open EOL Help Desk ticket pending until this question 
is resolved.)  Please let me know if you have any questions or new 
information that might help resolve this issue.

Thank you,
Karen
