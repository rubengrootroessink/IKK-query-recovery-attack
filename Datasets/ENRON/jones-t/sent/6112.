Bernice, here is the information on WAPA counterparties.  I will send you a 
specific request on each of these entities when I can get to it.  In the 
meantime, can you please change the name for WAPA phonenix to WAPA-Desert 
Southwest Region so that we do not have duplicate records and tell EOL about 
the changes.  Let me know if you have questions.  EOL is waiting for me to 
populate a contract for the new record that you set up for desert SW region 
and we need to get this resolved.

I work for Enron and am trying to determine (1) which of your offices are
members of the Western Systems Power Pool and (2) what the current names
are for your entitites.  I need the full legal name for each.  Below is a
list of the names I have in my database of names.  Can you please confirm
if these are current and/or if any names have been changed.  The WSPP
Administrator sent me the attachment, which indicates the Phoenix office
houses "Lower Colorado".  I'm not sure if this is accurate.  Thank you very
much for your help.

WAPA-Salt Lake City
WAPA-Desert Southwest Region
WAPA-Lower Missouri
WAPA-Pick-Sloan Missouri
WAPA-Rocky Mountain
WAPA-Sierra Nevada Region
WAPA-Upper Great Plain
WAPA-Billings Area
WAPA-Phoenix Area

Hello Rhonda,

I am attaching a Word document with all the WSPP member contacts for
"Western Area Power Administration(s)" - hopefully one of them is the one
you are looking for - if not, please let me know and I will try to find
out!
