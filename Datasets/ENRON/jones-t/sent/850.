We've received a personal invitation to a NYMEX  Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 
5:00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan.  The cause of this celebration 
is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract.  It would be nice if 
Shankman and John Arnold could attend.  Perhaps you can give them a personal 
invitation...
