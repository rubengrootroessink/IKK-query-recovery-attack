I have been given the name of your company by a consultant we have hired to 
advise us on sofware systems to manage our physical and financial 
confirmation process and ISDA Master Agreements.  I have also seen 
information on your company in the January 1999 issue of Risk Magazine.  I am 
a Senior Legal Specialist in the Legal Dept. and am looking at software 
systems that can help us manage our documentation needs.

If you are unfamiliar with our company,  Enron is the largest integrated 
marketer of energy in the United States.  We have a Web Page located at 
www.enron.com.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. is the marketing 
affiliate of our parent, Enron Corp.

I would like to obtain marketing material about the services you provide, and 
after I have a chance to look at the information, would like to talk to you 
or a representative from you company in some depth.  I am located in Houston, 
Texas and my phone number is (713) 853-3399.  Thank your for your attention 
herewith.
