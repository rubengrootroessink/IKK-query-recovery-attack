Tana,

Thanks for the redlined version. I have a number of concerns about this 
document. I'm not sure who is handling in Carol's absence?

- 2(g): If Offers are warranted by Enron, then what are we warranting? I'm 
not comfortable with this.
- 3(a): The Master Agreement does not control. The Long Descriptions need to 
override the Masters where required. This is common practice OTC.
- 3(d): I don't understand why we are amending this.
- 4(a): This is probably OK, but it doesn't sit right - would appreciate some 
legal comments.
- 5(c): Why are we changing this?
- 6(b): We do not do reciprocal assignments. If they don't like who we assign 
to, they can cease using the system.
- 6 (h): I think some words are missing here.

Dave

Tana,

It looks like there are changes on this against the online ETA which are not 
redlined. Do you have any other information about these changes? (I'd like to 
avoid having to do a line-by-line comparison.

Thanks,

Dave

Attached is a copy of the amended ETA that Carol sent you in early July.  
Please let me know if the changes meet with your approval.
