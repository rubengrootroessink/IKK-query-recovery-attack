On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed 
by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the 
President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or 
Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must 
ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not 
by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those 
above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction 
EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your 
group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you 
would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it 
up to me.
