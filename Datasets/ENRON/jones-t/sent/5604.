When do you think you could reply by, so I can get Sheri an ETA?

I will try - but cannot promise. I have some very urgent things on my plate 
right now.

I just got a call from Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline checking on the status 
of your reviews.  When each of you has completed the review of your products 
can you let me know, so we can sign off on that product.  Sheri is being 
pressured by our traders to get this up and is also getting daily calls from 
the President of Tradespark.  She would like to have everyone's sign off by 
Friday if possible.  Can you let me know whether this will present any 
problem.

Thanks!
