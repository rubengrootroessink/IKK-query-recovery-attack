RE:  Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing Members
__________________________________________________________

The expiration date for the January 2001 options contract for Gasoline-Crack 
(CGF1) and Heating Oil-Crack (CHF1) is Monday, December 18, 2000.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options 
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or 
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options 
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized 
representative present at their normal work station promptly at 5:30 p.m. 
until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.  All adjustments 
and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation 
prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making the 
expiration processing an extension of the afternoon trade resolution 
procedures.  All input to the NYMEX Clearing Department will conclude no 
later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Correction (299-2068 and 299-2169) 
personnel, as well as a representative of the Floor Committee will be 
available to assist with the processing of notices of Exercise and 
Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other questions or 
problems you may have.
