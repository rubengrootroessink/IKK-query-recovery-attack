Clem,

Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela.  Carolyn started 
working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in 
1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of Enron!).  
Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas 
Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key 
contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the 
primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB 
relationship for the law firm.

Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be 
around.  I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate 
Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and 
Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc.  I 
think she would be a great asset to your team and Enron.
