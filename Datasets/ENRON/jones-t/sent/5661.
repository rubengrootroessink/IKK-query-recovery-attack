Bud Ricketts called up and just wanted to get an email of the physical power 
agreement, I think because he wanted to make comments on the form on the 
computer so he could prepare a blackline draft.

Tana - Can you please let me know your query.  Bud Ricketts has had a draft 
physical power agreement since Sept. of last year. As you can see from the 
Lotus Notes entry- I called him yesterday to chase him as we have not gotten 
even a first set of comments from them.  Their Credit Guy is apparently the 
hold-up.

I am not sure what else needs to be done from our end. Please advise. 

Thanks!

Shari

Shari,

Tana came by and said to send Bud Ricketts (what a name) a copy of this 
Agreement but it looks like from the notes below you have already talked to 
him, etc.  Please advise.


Thanks,
Genia
