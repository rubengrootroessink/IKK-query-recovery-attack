Subject: Financial Training Meeting

We are planning a Financial Training meeting next Tuesday at lunch.  This is 
the first part of our training sessions on the Financial business. The 
training will be facilitated by Brent Hendry.    I wanted to see if there are 
any employees in your groups that would benefit from this training.  If so, 
please let me know how many people will attend by tomorrow afternoon (Friday) 
so that we can plan for proper seating as well as lunch.  Thanks!

Kim Theriot
