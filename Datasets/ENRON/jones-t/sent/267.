Tana,

the descriptions were written by the commercial groups themselves on the 
whole.  So There should not be any consern fromt he business.  What I was 
going to do is give the final descriptions after Legal and Regulatory 
amendments to them again for final OK.

Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of 
these descriptions.  They are being forwarded to our business people now for 
review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday 
being a federal holiday here).  I don't know what problems this is going to 
cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business 
input on these descriptions.   Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster 
to this effect.
