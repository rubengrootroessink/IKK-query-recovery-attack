John,

Sorry about taking so long to get back to you on this.  Re:  sample master 
agreements...we recently had a group meeting where we were discouraged to 
send out sample masters.  What appears to be happening is that a customer 
gets a sample master w/no credit, and then when we finally send them a real 
master w/credit, they are somewhat hacked off because the end up being 
incredibly longer once credit is added.

If possible, can we not talk to Credit about sending them a real master?  Let 
me know your thinking...

Tana, would you please e-mail a sample ISDA to Mr. Ray Cunningham of Exxon 
and let me know when you've done so.   Thanks again !!    John
