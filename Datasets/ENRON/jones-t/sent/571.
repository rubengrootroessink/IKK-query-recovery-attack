Congratulations, Enron employees!  Fortune magazine ranked Enron number 24 =

the "100 Best Companies to Work for in America," up from number 73 last=20
year.  Enron also is the only global energy company and one of four=20
Houston-based companies on the list.  Not only are we the most innovative=
=20
company in America, we continue to be recognized as a great place to work!

Fortune=01,s "100 Best Companies to Work for in America" list is primarily=
=20
employee-driven.   Selection is based mainly on responses received from=20
randomly selected employees from each participating company to 57 questions=

on a confidential Great Place to Work Index Trust survey.  We=01,d like to =
thank=20
each employee who filled out the survey.  In addition, Fortune evaluates=20
information taken from a detailed human resources questionnaire, a culture=
=20
audit and other materials submitted by the companies.=20

Because companies are getting better and better, the competition was fierce=
=20
this year, and Fortune had to drop 35 companies that appeared on last year=
=01,s=20
list.  So not only did Enron significantly move up on the list, we did so i=
n=20
spite of tough new competition.

Enron=01,s corporate culture and our world-class employees make Enron a gre=
at=20
place to work.  This recognition reflects our commitment to employees and=
=20
your integral participation in Enron=01,s success.  We want to thank the Vi=
sion=20

across the company.  Nowhere was this more evident than in the Chairman=01,=
s=20
Award.  We also thank all employees for your dedication, innovation,=20
enthusiasm and creative spirit.  The work you do every day makes Enron=20
successful and a great place to work.  We look forward to even greater=20
accomplishments in the New Year.
