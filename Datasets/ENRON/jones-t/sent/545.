Karen,

I don't know that I need to get these lists from you that reference the 
contract numbers.  I really don't know anything relative to contracts 
numbers.  What was helpful was your memo earlier that listed the rejected 
masters.  I took at look at it and then distributed it to the Legal EOL 
team.  Thanks!
