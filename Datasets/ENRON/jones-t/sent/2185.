I was just sitting here thinking, now that y'all are doing the financial 
confirms up there, your Confirmation Desk people need to be on the 
distribution list for our emails when we get signed masters in, so they know 
when they need to change from a non-master style of confirm, to a master 
style of confirm.  Who, pray tell, might your Confirmation Desk people be so 
we can add them...
