Just as I suspected.  I showed the attached email to Mark Taylor, and he says 
he still wants to send out confirms, so if Dynegy wants to just throw them 
out, that's their business, but keep sending them as you would in the normal 
course of business.

Stephanie,

We currently do a couple of deals per day through an Online trading system 
called DynegyDirect.  This is basically Dynegy's version of EOL.  We are 
sending Confirmations on these deals just as we do with all other deals done 
with Dynegy.  However, the CP is requesting that we not send these Confirms 
at all.  Our Traders click on the deal which is then legally binding.  Our 
back office personnel double-check our Trade Entry by going to DynegyDirect's 
web-site and checking the trade details.  Dynegy simply throws out our 
Confirmations once they determine it relates to a DynegyDirect deal.  I have 
told the CP that I would check with our legal dept about the status of 
sending Confirmations traded on DynegyDirect.

Let me know if you can get someone to comment on this.

thanks,
Joe

Dynegy is wanting to know if we can show "Dynegy Direct" on our confirms in 
the same way that we show "EOL".    Dynegy has two separate systems, one for 
Dynegy Direct and one for their 'daily' work, and because no confirms are 
signed and returned or sent out,  our confirms are confusing when they do not 
find them in their system.  Thanks.
