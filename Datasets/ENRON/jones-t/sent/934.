Marie and I were just looking at the activities list for the Legal Conference 
and noticed you were signed up to "relax at the resort".  Not to get you 
worked up or anything, but there is a huge outlet mall just outside San 
Antonio, and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found!  After 
all, it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were 
here, and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions.  (Not to 
belabor a dead horse, but again style watchers are telling us that the 
fashion for Spring and Summer for men will be knee length "pedal pushers".)

We look forward to seeing our favorite Englishman (delete this message after 
viewing, we don't want the other lads to get jealous!)
