You have been getting the excel spreadsheets on new counterparties now for 
several days, and at an agreed time I would like to include your approvals in 
with the rest of Legal's.  Right now I am still telling the EnronOnline 
people that they have to look to Australia for approvals.  Once we are in 
agreement about the parameters of my responses, and who your backup is, we 
can agree on a date when I will start responding for Australia too.  The 
theory will be that once I send you the email you will have 24 hours to 
respond or I will consider all the online products approved for Ausralian 
counterparties.  Because of the time change issue, I think we need to make 
the time my approval will go out 4:00 p.m. the next day (which will be your 
morning) from the transmittal of the list.
