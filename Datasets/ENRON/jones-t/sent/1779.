Oh guru of all things Canadian...

I'm working on comments to an ISDA that Hydro-Quebec sent us for an 
affiliate, HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc., which is a Delaware corporation.  
Is there anything special about Hydro-Quebec being the Guarantor, or just the 
usual considerations having a governmental entity as the guarantor?

By the way, I hope you're coming up for the Legal Conference.  There are many 
problems at Enron that need our help in getting sorted out, those kinds of 
problems that lots of margaritas seem to bring out!  I'm counting on you!
