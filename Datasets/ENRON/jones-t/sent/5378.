Teresa Mandola with the EnronOnline Team has received a call from the TVA.  
They would like to start trading physical power online with us immediately 
and would like to see a copy of the Enabling Agreement they have in place for 
power.  Can someone from the power team provide this to them.  Teresa's 
number is x39807.

Thanks!
