No, I haven't met Matt, in fact, I don't know much about him.  Is he here 
now?  For how long?  Thru the Legal Conference?  I would be happy to help in 
whatever way I can.  As you know, we've recently revised our forms, so this 
would be a good time to get him indoctrinated.

I will, of course, be sad to have you leave us.  You have been wonderful to 
work with from both a personal and professional standpoin.  Your baby's gain 
in your time is a loss to Enron, because are a most valued asset to our 
company.  I hope our lives will cross again some time!  Best wishes for your 
future, you deserve the best!
