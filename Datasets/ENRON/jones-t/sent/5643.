Yes, I compared their blackline below against the draft I originally sent 
out, and the only changes were to the counterparty name, "or its affiliates" 
language, and NY from Texas, the same changes showing in the blackline below.

Mark,

I have reviewed your standard form NDA and have noted two minor comments
thereon.  I have suggested the State of New York as a more neutral
jurisdiction and one that is widely used in commerical transactions, rather
than the State of Texas.  The other comments are self explanatory.

Please contact me should you have any concerns.
