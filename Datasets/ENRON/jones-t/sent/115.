Just wanted to drop you a note before I leave for Germany tomorrow.  I'm 
looking forward to the cooler weather.  I got some good bargains on post 
winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about 
buying a sweater!  I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one 
sitting!

My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90% 
done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer 
Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a 
while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like 
tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. 
plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little 
little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 
7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have 
to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink, 
yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before 
they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot 
of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over 
Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds 
and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a 
bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.  
I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis 
fountain.  He's just lovely!

Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's 
painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real 
pale pink.  I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can 
start cleaning up all the dust.  I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of 
the 4th of July holiday.

You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.  Have you been able to 
do anything?  I'm so glad I got to see your house.  Now when you talk about 
things I can picture what you're talking about.

Also, when I get back from Europe I'm going to get some cats again.  I'm 
looking forward to that.  I think I'm finally over mourning the demise of 
poor Willow.

Mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there 
because you were in Teeside a lot of the time.  I'm sorry he didn't get a 
chance to see your car.  I was trying to describe it to him and I don't think 
I gave it justice.

It was good talking to you the other day!  I'll give you a call when I get 
back.
