Have you heard anything back from Gas Natural with respect to getting their 
signed guarantees on the Comercializadora Metrogas  and Gas Natural Mexico 
trades?  I've been holding my Enron Guarantees as leverage in getting 
theirs.  We are at the period in the confirms where we need to exchange 
guarantees...
