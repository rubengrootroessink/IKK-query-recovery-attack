Attached are the referenced lists.  If the Credit Counterparty is "amended" I 
don't have any changes to what I've previously said about the counterparty 
unless I add "w/change" (which I didn't have any on these lists, so just keep 
the Legal approvals the same).   The only counterparty on the 12/22/99 list 
was a "read only" counterparty, so I didn't bother responding to that list.  
For physical power, again, even 'tho I'm not saying it, "no" for European 
based physical power products.
