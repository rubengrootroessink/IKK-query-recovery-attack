On the list for 9/19/00:
1.  On the counterparty styled "United States Department of Interior" only, 
Leslie is not permitting them to trade power, however, she will give them 
read access.
2.  Public Service Electric & Gas Co. - My notes show I already opened them 
for financial power

On the list for 9/21/00:  I am OK for shutting Aquila Energy Marketing 
Corporation down for financial, since they are now trading financial out of 
Utilicorp.  However, I didn't want to put "X's" in all those darn boxes, so I 
hope by my note only it will do the job.  I am also preparing an assignment 
of the online trades that I will send to the Confirm Desk when it is executed.
