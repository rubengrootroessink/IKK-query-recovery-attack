I sent you an earlier email about the blue files.  Now Erica has received 
back the three hole punch I ordered for you (so you could insert paper into 
the notebooks I have prepared for you), as well as a request for redweld 
manila folders (instead of the blue file folders we ordered for you).  Can 
you work out what supplies you want from us.  We are happy to order whatever 
you like, but the overseas mail charges are going to increase greatly what 
the supplies are worth.  Thanks.
