Dan,

I just wanted to let you know how to proceed on getting the agreement signed, 
since I will be out Monday and Tuesday.

Samantha Boyd is a new paralegal in our Group and she will coordinate getting 
it signed.  Her phone no. is 853-9188.  I understand you need it signed by 
Monday since you are meeting with Continental Tuesday.

As we discussed, we are incorporating EnronOnline LLC today.  As soon as we 
hear from Deb Korkmas (a paralegal that handles our corporate matters) that 
the company has been incorporated you can tell Continental that they can sign 
the agreement and return it to us via fax (have them fax it to Samantha's 
attention at fax:  (713) 646-3490).  Upon receipt of the fax Samantha will 
get it initialled by Mark Taylor and have it walked to either Louise Kitchen 
or Andy Zipper for signature (depending on who is in).  Either of them can 
sign for all 3 companies, Louise as Managing Director, Andy as Vice 
President.  After the agreement is fully executed Samantha will fax it to 
Rick Wagner at Continental (unless you give her instructions to the contrary).

If the counterparty wants to negotiate the agreement, they will have to talk 
to Mark directly.  His phone no. is 853-3399.
