Marie,

I think you are mistaken.  I was watching E, the Entertainment Channel, last 
night, and Joan Rivers was doing her best and worsed dressed review at 
Cannes.  I noticed this incredibly handsome and debonair man, dressed all in 
black from head to toe, a shy smile, with eyes hidden behind dark glasses, 
and a lovely beauty on each of his arms.  I thought, "could it be...might it 
be...?!".  And it was...it was truly he.  I'm sure of it!
