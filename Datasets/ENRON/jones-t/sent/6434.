Debbie Brackett and I met this week and reviewed the various Koch Hydrocarbon 
Company Divisions and have developed the following game plan to resolve the 
division issue with respect to this counterparty:

The following entities exist in GCP:

1.  Koch Hydrocarbon Co. (GCP #36680):  We would like this entity to remain 
OPEN and to be renamed "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch 
Hydrocarbon Company Division". 
2.  Koch Hydrocarbon Company (GCP #57853):  We would like all future trading 
with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appears to be one trade under this entity 
and this trade should me moved to GCP 36680.
3.  Koch Hydrocarbons Inc. (GCP #26197):  We would like all future trading 
with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appear to be no trades under this entity.

With respect to the current financial trading being done by Koch Industries, 
Inc. (GCP #126) (not under a master agreement), I spoke to the Legal 
Department at Koch and we will be entering into a side letter agreement with 
Koch that will put all financial trades done by Koch Industries, Inc. under 
the existing ISDA Master Agreement we have with Koch Industries, Inc. acting 
through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  I will let you all know when 
such side letter agreement has been executed.

As soon as GCP #36680 has been renamed we can re-submit them to EnronOnline 
and open them up for trading.
