I have a fax copy of the signed NDA from Itochu.  I am awaiting the paper 
versions.
Who should sign for Net Works?  I'll need the person's fax #.  We can 
exchange fax versions before
having the originals.

Regards,

--anthony

Anthony-san,

Today our legal department confirmed the contents of NDA finally.
Therefore we sent a fax to you at first.
And also, we sent a couple of NDAs by mail.

Please send us back one of NDAs signed by you by return.

Thanks and best regards,

PS) Now I am summarizing questionnaire about Clickpaper.
Thank you for your cooperation.
