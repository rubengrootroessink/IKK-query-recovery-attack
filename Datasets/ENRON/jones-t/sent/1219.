I was just speaking to Edmund Cooper about various swap matters, and he 
wanted me to ask the group to not make changes to his entries (for ECT 
International) in the Master Swap Agreement Database.  Someone went into one 
of his and added a note that the Trade Option Exemption was deleted when it 
wasn't.  If you think something is in error or needs to be added, please 
consult with him.  Thanks
