Tana,

Attached please find customer list (sent by EBS) for bandwidth trading on 
EOL. Please review it and send me your comments. We are planning on launching 
the products on May 1st.  Also, I am attaching the GTC that Cynthia Harkness 
from EBS put together.

Please let me know if you have any questions

Thank you!
