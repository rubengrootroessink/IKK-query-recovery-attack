Attached is the referenced list.  There are only 2 counterparties for 
approval on this list, and I have problems with each of them.

Virginia Electric and Power Company is coming through as an amendment to add 
financial power.  I still cannot open them up until we resolve directly with 
the company what issue, if any, there appears to be doing financial products 
with utilities under Virginia law.  Notes in our database reflect that this 
was an issue and they were creating a marketing sub to do the business.  I 
have a call into Credit to find out who their contact is, we will have to 
resolve this directly with them.

Again, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is coming through as a division of TXU Gas 
Company, and that needs to be made part of the name.
