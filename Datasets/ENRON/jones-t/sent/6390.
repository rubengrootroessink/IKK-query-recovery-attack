Sure, just use me as as reference for getting a job.  Let me know when you 
come into town.

Hi

I just found your e-mail and decided to see if you actually read
them.  Actually I also have a request.  I want to put your name down
as having talked to you about a job at ENRON.  This is for my
unemployment benefits.  They theoretically say they can call contacts
but they never have.  Anyway, anyone I talk to about whether a job
might be available in their company is appropriate.  I will put down
that there is nothing available for me, as I assume would be the
case.  It looks like I will get the job at Landmark.  I will probably
be coming down for training soon.  I'll keep you posted on when.

Kathy
