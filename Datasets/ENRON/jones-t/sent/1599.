Been a while since we have done one of these, but here's a new one.  This 
will need to be bilateral because they are going to divulge information about 
how they structure their business of supplying sports games over the internet.

Please let me know if this is acceptable with a reasonable amount of change 
or if we should send them our draft.

thanks
Dave
