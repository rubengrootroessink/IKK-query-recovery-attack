Attached please find the referenced lists.  On the list of 3/12/01a, I have 
not yet seen the list from Gobal Contracts with the corrected names, but I 
cannot believe Lyke Corporation (also called Ripon Community Printers) is a 
valid legal name.  We might want to get that sorted out before we start 
trading with them.
