Edmund,

Can you help us figure out who in London can help Anita execute her first 
ISDA, which also will include the usual Secretary's Certificates.  I don't 
know if you know, but Singapore doesn't need EEFT to sign as the arranger, 
ECTRIC can sign directly. Per the resolution, it needs to be a VP, President, 
Managing Director or Chairman.   It looks like the London based officers who 
could sign would be John Sherriff, Danny McCarty or John Lush (?), unless you 
are familiar with someone else who can sign for ECTRIC.  It looks like for 
the Secretary's Certificates, all the Secretaries are located here in 
Houston, so we should probably prepare them for the usual Kate Cole's 
signature.

Anita, you will need to have two signed copies, and initial both copies for 
signature, as also will your London Credit person.

Congrat Anita!  This is very exciting!

Hi Tana,

Thanks for your note ....which was totally helpful as usual.

This is the FIRST ISDA that we're executing here in Singapore so it's a Red 
Letter Day for us.  The process has been painfully slow mainly because of 
London Credit's reluctance to provide us with any credit terms unless the 
situation really demands for it.  We've got another one in the pipeline with 
one of the Shell affiliates though I'm not exactly holding my breath about 
it.  We'd sent them the draft last year and they've yet to revert despite us 
sending frequent reminders.  Not exactly on the top of their  list of things 
to do obviously!!!

Anyway - Caltex has executed the ISDA which we have in hand and what I would 
like to know is who is on the slate of signatories for ECTRIC.  Is there 
anyone in the London office who is authorised to sign the document otherwise 
we'll have ISDA couriered over to you in Houston.  If the document is to be 
executed in Houston, I'd be eternally  grateful if you could assist in 
getting the ISDA executed for us on ECTRIC's behalf as well as in obtaining 
the Secretary's signature for both certificates. I'll have my assistant 
Angeline coordinate with you on  the nitty gritties so that you'll know when 
to expect to receive the documents for execution.

Many thanks as always,
Anita

I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board 
resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, 
and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a 
Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none 
of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in 
getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you 
usually do?
