Are you drafting this NDA for us?  I have already prepared a draft based off 
your form, which adds not only Enron Net Works, but also EnronOnline as our 
counterparty.  In addition, we have a company policy that requires that we 
have arbitration in all of our agreement.  Our client over at EnronOnline, 
Dave Samuels, is sending our form to his customer.

Further to attached, Shmuel advises that Bridge's signed counterpart of 
attached is being faxed back to us this afternoon.  In my physical absence, I 
have asked Rose to initial for Net Works (Mark, hope this is ok; this is same 
agreement used for DealBench with changes noted below).  Bridge did not 
return signed its counterpart of DealBench agreement, asking this morning for 
a mutual NDA which we have accommodated.  Jeff suggested that since we had to 
revise the agreement, we streamline the Net Works effort by making it the 
Enron counterparty (Net Works and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (including 
DealBench) are covered by NDA).

Thanks for your help.

Attached please find another draft of confidentiality agreement revised to 
(i) change the DealBench counterparty to its parent, Enron Net Works LLC, and 
(ii) make the agreement mutual in respect of Bridge Confidential 
Information.  I understand that DealBench (which continues to be protected 
under this agreement) would like to disclose information this afternoon to 
Bridge.  Accordingly, please fax a signed Bridge counterpart as soon as 
possible to me at the fax number below and to Jeff Bartlett at 713/646-8576.  
We will fax to you a counterpart signed by Net Works.
