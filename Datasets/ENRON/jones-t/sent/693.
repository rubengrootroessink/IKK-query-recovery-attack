I am actually working on the pieces of the project, but the overall "system" 
still needs to be designed.  I've been working with our computer people to 
upgrade our master swap agreement database.  We will be capturing some 
additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the 
autoconfirm process.  Then, once we work out confidentiality issues relating 
to our comments section and different companies, we will be opening the 
database to all interested ENA employees.  

I've developed two new databases, we're currently working the kinks out of.   
First is our" jurisdictional database", which will summarize the swap laws as 
they relate to each country.  Our international business is growing and its 
becoming imperative that we get this up and going.  I've actually got the 
database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start 
briefing the country information soon.

Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been 
online trading.  I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the 
business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract 
information.  With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and 
on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties 
we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.   We 
have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.

The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal 
advice, etc.  This will be a cross product library (financial, physical, 
power, etc).  I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has 
in place to create ours.  The major complaint I have heard from some of them 
is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they 
want them.  So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.    Among 
other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition, 
all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from 
outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.  I think this 
Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being 
scanned into and kept.  I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the 
documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents 
available around the world.  So the setup for this might go quickly, although 
compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might 
be more of a problem.

The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all 
these various databases.  So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces 
before the overall system. 

Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this.
