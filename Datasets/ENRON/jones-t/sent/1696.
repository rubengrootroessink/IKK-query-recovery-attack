Each legal trading group here in Houston checks on a relevant counterparty's 
ability to trade its products.  So far the only physical trading area where a 
governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group 
where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained 
to trade power.  For financial trading we do have to inquire into the 
relevant governmental entities' authority to enter into derivative 
transactions.  In order to do that we look at statutory authority, any 
relevant local regulations, investment policities, etc., in addition to 
obtaining legal opinions on the subject, and with some counterparties hiring 
outside counsel to advise us.  For most governmental entities if we do not 
have an ISDA Master in place and have already done such due diligence, I will 
not be approving them to trade financial products.

As far as the financial test, for the US based counterparty list, I check 
with Credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the US 
eligible swap participant standards.  As I'm sure you know, for most plain 
vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of $10mm 
or a net worth of $1mm.  Pretty much, if I am turning down a counterparty to 
trade financial it will be because they do not meet the ESP test or they are 
a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.

If what you are telling me is that the Australian counterparties have to meet 
a $6mm asset test to trade any products, then I will add this to my daily 
inquiry to Credit and turn down Australian counterparties if they do not meet 
this test.  At your direction I will handle this in this manner.  How would 
you like me to proceed?

Is this an incorporated entity? I assume its authority to trade a range of 
products has been checked out? In Australia this assumption can not be made 
for government  entities

Under our licencing requirements we need to make reasonable enquiries that a 
counterparty has (or is guaranted by someone who has) atleast USD6 million in 
assets. Can this assumption be made?

Tauton is ok for all products, except for financial products (it can do 
power).  David, when I talk about this I am never including credit 
derivatives unless Credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that 
this is a credit derivatives counterparty.
