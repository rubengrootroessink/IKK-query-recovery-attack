As you can see below, some of the ETAs have been forwarded to Travis.  
Apparently, the others reside here, but only Frank knows where they are.  As 
he's on a plane back to the US right now, I'll have to get these to you guys 
tomorrow.

Thanks.

We do not have Australia, Bermuda, Chile, Japan & Peru - PCG Houston should 
be able to help with those.

Thanks

Travis needs to get copies of the ETA's below.  I don't know if there is 
someone here in Houston that can get them for him, or someone in London.  I 
usually would have called Edmund on this but he's out sick for awhile.  Can 
you track it down for us?  Thanks!
