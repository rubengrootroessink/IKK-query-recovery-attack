Mike,

Checking on the status of getting Stephanie Panus, a new paralegal in our 
Group, full edit access to the referenced database.

Also, we need to get some additional people full edit access:  Matt Dawson, 
who just started in London Legal, and David Minns, a lawyer in our Australia 
office.  Can you let me and each of these people know when they have access.

Thanks!
