I looked in the Lotus Notes database, and I didn't see anything about this.  
Unless Susan is working on this, I know nothing...

Susan/Tana,

I'm getting hounded by Credit to move some deals booked with Phoenix Dominion 
Energy LLC over to Dominion Field Services, Inc..  Are either of you aware of 
an Assignment Agreement reflecting this change?  Let me know if it's okay to 
do this.

Thanks,
Joe
