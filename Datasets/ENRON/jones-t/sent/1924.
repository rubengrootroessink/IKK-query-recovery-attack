This request has been completed.

Also, I spoke with a contact in IRM and they said that the best way for Jason 
to keep is access would be to maintain his NT and Notes accounts and have him 
set up his Laptop/Desktop with a Terminal Server client.  With this Terminal 
Server client he can access the Enron network as if he's in the office (a 
little/lot slower).  

To get Terminal Server:  from his Enron Corp desktop he should click 
"Start-Programs-Utilities-Make Terminal Server Client Disks"  -  Then of 
course he needs to install TS on his machine at A&K (or home).

Let me know if you/he has any questions.

Subject: "Other Agreements" in Lotus Notes

Per our conversation yesterday, we would like to open the "Other Agreements" 
information in the Financial Trading Agreement Database to members of the 
Interest Rate and Currency Desk.  If possible, we would also like them to see 
the comments screen.  The people who will need access are Laurel Adams, 
George Garcia, Sheila Glover, Kelly Templeton, Teresa Brogan.

As usual, we would like to get them access ASAP.  Can you keep me posted on 
their access.  Thanks!
