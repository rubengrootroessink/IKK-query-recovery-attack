If you have a complete list regarding the Enserch entities we wish to trade 
with, I can run it by Enserch and check on the legal names.  I think it would 
be helpful for our full distribution (Legal, Confirm and Others (settlements, 
Global Contracts, misc), if you would distribute a full list of the Enserch 
entities we wish to continue trading with and what business out of each 
entity.  I think this will stop people coming back and asking again and 
again.
