With respect to your email below,  I am already working with Bob Bowen on 
assigning the various Aquila trades.

On Amoco, I will need to get a list similar to the one Bob prepared for me 
for Aquila, showing the exact trades being assigned, deal no., whether they 
are physical or financial, trade date, start date , end date, etc.  If you 
get with Bob he can show you what he prepared for me for Aquila.  Once I get 
that I can prepare the assignment.  I will also need the name and phone 
number for the Amoco person I should be sending this assignment to.  I don't 
know who will have that, the Confirm Desk, Settlements, or EOL?  Once I get 
all this I can prepare that assignment.

Susan,

We have several EOL deals (Amoco Energy, Aquila Energy) in which the 
Counterparty's Trader has done Financial deals through their entity that 
usually only does Physical deals.  Mark Taylor and others had decided that we 
couldn't simply agree to change the name of the Counterparty but would need 
to Assign such Transactions to the correct entity (BP Amoco, Aquila Risk 
Mgt).  Do you know if someone in Legal is involved with assigning these or 
can we draft something down here?

Thanks,
Joe

Just FYI... several deals came across on my invoice for Amoco Energy Trading 
Corporation, but should be BP Amoco Corporation (BA 03400).
The deal numbers as follows:

N54185.1
N54970.1
N54977.1
N55023.1
N56595.1
N57893.1
N59629.1

I changed the invoice to reflect BP Amoco Corporation and wanted to notify 
you of the change.  If you have any questions regarding the above,
please call me at x3-7598.

Thanks!

Cynthia Gin
Financial Settlements
