I also noticed the ISDA memo, and was rooting around looking for the 
attachments that went with it, and couldn't find them.  There was also a few 
updates in a second memo there to some country opinions.  If and when Mark 
calls in I was going to ask him if he knows where the attachments went, 
because the one will cost $100 if we have to order it.
