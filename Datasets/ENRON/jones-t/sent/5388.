I checked the agreements and we can provide you with copies of both of these, 
so I am having them copies right now and will be faxing them to you this a.m.

 Hi Tana, as discussed, could you please take a look at the ENA  ISDA'S  
with   Credit Suisse First Boston dated 21 April 1999 and BP Amoco dated 9 
September1998. I understand you need to check that we ,as an Affiliate are 
allowed access. The latter is esp urgent because Denis needs( if possible) 
access to the terms for a call tomorrow at 10am London time. 

Apologies for the late notice

Matt
