Can you please change the name of the corporation from "Inc." to 
"Incorporated".  Thanks.

I'm with you on Montana.  I checked the files in the big file room, and it is 
a Montana corporation.

It should read Energy West Incorporated, but our info shows that they are 
headquartered and incorporated in Montana.  Please let me know if this 
differs from your perspective; thanks.

We have a master swap agreement in place with Energy West Incorporated, a 
CANADA corporation.  Your list shows "Inc." instead of "Incorporated", and 
that it is a US corporation.  Is this the same counterparty?
