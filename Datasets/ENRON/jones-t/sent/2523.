Matt,

Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for 
Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have 
(like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.):

Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals)
Weather Derivatives
Credit Derivatives

Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade 
any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?  I am going to 
attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products 
we trade.

Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in 
Singapore?  For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for 
no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required 
before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc.  



Thanks!
