Tana, the contact that told me he had a electronic copy for BEA Weblogic just 
dropped off a hard copy for me as he has not been able to locate the 
electronic copy.  If you can send me a fax number I can fax this to you.

Subject: ASAP-Preliminary List of Online Contracts

Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline 
contracts I have been made aware of.  There are a few I have open questions 
about  or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.  Can each of you 
please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be 
missing.  Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response 
promptly I would be most appreciative.
