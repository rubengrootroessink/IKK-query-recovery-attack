The attached GTC should not be used in relation to any financial product.  It 
reads as if it is to apply to physical lumber deals.  However, by copy of 
this memo to Tana, I ask that she verify that it has been an approved 
document for physical online lumber.

Mary,

Should the following document be attached to all lumber deals?  Recently, 
there was a clickpaper deal for lumber; the online GTC was attached to the 
confirmation.  But, a question on this document has since been raised.

Please advise.



Thanks,

Tiffany
