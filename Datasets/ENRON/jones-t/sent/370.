When you get back, I got a call from Koch about the Morgan "assignment".  As 
you recall, we are acting as agent on behalf of Morgan in connection with 
their commodity business.  Koch called me and they want to get a copy of the 
"assignment".  Since it wasn't an assignment, what should I provide them?  I 
don't know that I can provide them a copy of our Servicing Agreement.  What 
should I do?
