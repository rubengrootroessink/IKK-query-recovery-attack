Aquila wants to trade online under two names, Aquila Risk Management and 
Aquila Energy Marketing.  They have asked us to attach to their ETA, a 
listing, and copies, of all master agreements we have in place with those two 
counterparties, whether physical, financial, gas, power, etc.  Can you look 
those up for us and copy the relevant contracts?

Thanks for your help!
