The list of new phone numbers will be sent to my usual distribution for 
documentation, which includes Connie Sutton from Global Contracts.  As to 
what numbers they are replacing, they are replacing all the phone numbers we 
might have had across the board with this counterparty.  If you would like to 
see the numbers, obtain a copy of the notice from Connie Sutton.  As I just 
mailed it, it should get there in a few days.
