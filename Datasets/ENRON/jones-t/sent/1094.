Andrea,

The firm commitments I have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops.  That 
red pepper dip looks really good, I may make that.  Do you want to choose 
another one.  We're still waiting to hear back from some people, so I may 
have to adjust the amount depending on how things go.  Let me know your 
choice!
