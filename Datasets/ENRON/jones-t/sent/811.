Per my conversation with Credit, it appears there are two Northern States 
Power Companies.  We have already reviewed Northern States Power Company, a 
Minnesota corporation (cpy ID #265).  The counterparty that showed up on 
yesterday's list is Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation 
(cpy ID #161).  The Wisconsin corporation is a sub of the Minnesota 
corporation.

I don't know if this makes any difference in your approvals...
