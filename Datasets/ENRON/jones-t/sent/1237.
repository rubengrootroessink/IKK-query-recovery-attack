I asked Credit to put the referenced counterparty on the re-approval list for 
financial because momentarily we hope to get the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in from the Counterparty and if certain things don't happen when I open them 
up they will have a cow!!

1.  When I approve them to trade financial online we need to make sure they 
are coded for having the master swap agreement in place.  They are insistent 
that they do not see the GTC and that the confirms and procedures agreed to 
in the master apply.

2.  All US and Canadian financial transactions, whether online or offline, 
should roll up under the master.

As soon as we get the executed ISDA Master Agreement in I will send an email.

I thank you and I know Sara Shackleton thanks you...!!!
