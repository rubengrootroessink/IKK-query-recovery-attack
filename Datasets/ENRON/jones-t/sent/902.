On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is 
Carthage Energy.  Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but 
we are not there yet.

On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my 
previous approvals.  Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am 
opening them up for all financial and power.
