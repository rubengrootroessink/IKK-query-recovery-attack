I have been faxed a proposed form of assignment from El Paso with respect to 
certain trades transacted between 1/14 and 1/25 which they would like 
assigned to their affiliate, El Paso Energy Marketing Canada Inc.  I am 
having a messenger walk a copy down to each of you and need your direction as 
to whether we should consent to this assignment.
