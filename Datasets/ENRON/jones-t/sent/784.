Good Afternoon Tana;

     Can you provide me with some quick information?

 My traders entered into a transaction with the above group via London and I
need to scurry to get the ENRON CORP. PARENT GUARANTY AMENDED TO INCLUDE THIS
ENTITY (provided I have the correct name).

Do I have the correct entity name? Can we do AN AMENDMENT TODAY? I would like 
to
get it amended today so as not to have to break the trade?

In addition, if you could give me the Legal Contact Person in London for the
above named entity with phone and fax numbers it would be very helpful.

If you can assist, thanking you most kindly in advance. With kind regards.
