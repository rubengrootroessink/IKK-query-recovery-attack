With respect to the referenced lists, all the counterparties on these lists 
are amended counterparties and there are no changes to our earlier approvals.

FYI, Credit did not have Ionic Energy down as an amended counterparty, but 
per my conversation with Tom Moran, it was on the initial second list, and 
should be treated as an amended counterparty.
