Attached are the Multicurrency ISDA and applicable CSA forms in Word.  These 
documents are for your internal use in study, negotiating and the like.  I 
find it useful to be able to use search and find for concepts etc. in 
negotiating and understanding the guide and definitions.  These documents are 
not to be used externally, ie emailed as the "form," since we have a general 
rule that we always utilize printed versions of the form with our internal 
clients and external customers.




Cordially,
