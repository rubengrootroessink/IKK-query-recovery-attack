Tana,

Here is the info on the JP Morgan Chase NDA I discussed with you last week.

Just e-mail the NDA to me and I will forward it on.  Should you have any 
questions please don't hesitate to give me call.
Thanks

The agreement would be entered into by The Chase Manhattan Bank.  It is
expected that Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York will merge with and
into The Chase Manhattan Bank in October.  (Their respective holding
companies have already merged and operate under the name J.P. Morgan Chase
& Co.)  Chase's address is 270 Park Avenue, NY NY 10017.
