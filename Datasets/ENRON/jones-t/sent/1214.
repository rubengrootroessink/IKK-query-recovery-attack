Lorraine, Mike is wrong.  I never got the fax of the executed NDA.  May he 
could call his contact at the company and get them to send it to me?!

Tana - 

May I get a copy of this?  Our fax number is 713-646-2308 or my location is 
EB2642B.  Please advise on how you will send so I can be on the "look-out". 

Thanks!

Lorraine

Yahoo signed this nondisclsure agreement.  And fax'd it back to Tana Jones.  
Will you call Tana, make sure we executed the document and fax'd back to 
Yahoo, and get a copy for our files.  We also need to set-up and new file for 
Yahoo.

Thanks...
