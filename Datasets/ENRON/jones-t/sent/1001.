I just heard from Tenley that you and Steve have been in a pretty bad car 
wreck and are hospitalized in Florida.  My thoughts and prayers are with both 
of you.  She said you were checking your emails so I just wanted to get a 
note in to you, and when you feel better maybe we could have a little chat.

I miss you!
