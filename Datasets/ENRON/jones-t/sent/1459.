 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an 
ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In 
addition, we will need a Certificate of Incumbency.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
