Tana,
I guess we need to change the Enron legal entity from Enron Corp?
In our current model the transacting entity will be Enron North America 
(which is a Delaware corporation?)
Can you then arrange a suitable signature (Haedicke?)
Can we get this done by the end of Friday?

Thanks,
Richard

Richard, Craig told me you could review and sign this confidentiality 
agreement, naturally it might need a little editing.

John and Denis--

Here is the proposed confidentiality agreement.  I wasn't sure about the
exact name for you, so I just put in the generic "Enron".  Let me know if
this is okay.

Call me if you have any questions, and I'm looking forward to reaching an
agreement with you.

Thanks.
