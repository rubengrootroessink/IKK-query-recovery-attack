There is some misunderstanding.  I still have not received the fax of the 
NDA.  Did you have it to my attention, Tana Jones, at fax no. 713/636-3490?

We do not appear to have received your fax of the NDA.  Can you please fax
it to my attention at 713/646-3490 and I will distribute it to the members
of the Enron Team.  Thanks!
