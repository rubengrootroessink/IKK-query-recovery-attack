Blue Range Resources Corporation is an executed ISDA Master we have for ECT 
Canada that went into bankruptcy.  It shows up on my list because I'm working 
off the original list, but it is not a good Credit counterparty so it doesn't 
show up on Credit's approved counterparty list.  I just want to make sure 
that we don't send them any mailouts.
