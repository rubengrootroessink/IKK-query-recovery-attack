Who at the West Desk should I speak to?  We don't usually talk with the 
physical traders.

I do not know.  The master was worked as a follow-up to what Christian Yoder 
had started with PG&E, no input from the desk.  They wanted one contract for 
both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  I told the person at PG&E that we 
needed separate contracts and that I would only be able to help with the 
Enron North America contract.  The contact with Enron Canada was to be Peter 
Koehane.  I believe that Peter already had and Canadian version of the 
Enfolio in place.   Please ask someone at the West Desk if they trade under 
the contract.

Getting back to the original questions.  Do you trade with this counterparty 
and do you trade pursuant to a master or a GTC?
