I told Paul Radous, the Credit guy that you had already said that these guys 
could not trade physical power because they do not have a power marketing 
license.  It perhaps might be possible for them to purchase US power only.  
If they want to enter into power transactions he is going to need to get you 
a name and phone number of someone at Engage that you can talk to to get 
evidence of their power marketing license.

Stephanie/Tana,

Could you please expedite the following amendment the profiles of Engage 
Energy America LLC and Engage Energy Canada L.P. as soon as possible this 
morning.  Paul Radous is opening both of these entities up to trade all US 
East and West Phys Power products and I have made the changes in Profile 
Manager.

Thanks for your help !
