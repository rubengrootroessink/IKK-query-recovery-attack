Susan,

Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above 
referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric 
Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.  
These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we 
have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you 
know anything.

Thanks,
Joe
