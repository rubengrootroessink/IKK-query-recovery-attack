Suzanne,

Anthony is with the Global Contracts Group.  Can you coordinate with him the 
exact head count as we get closer.  Thanks!

Tana,

The Date looks good for everyone (those that have responded) I have been 
waiting to hear back from all of the invitees.  I will be in touch about the 
exact head count whenever I receive responses.

Sorry for the delay,
Anthony

lunch for us.

Thanks!
