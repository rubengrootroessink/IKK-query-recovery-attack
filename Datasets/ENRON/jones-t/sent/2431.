Calpine Power Services Company merged into Calpine Energy Services, L.P. eff 
11/1/00, with the survivor being Calpine Energy Services, L.P. Copies of the 
documents were hand carried to legal by Anthony Campos on 11/9. I believe he 
gave them to Lisa. I am not certain why you have not received them yet. 
Please check with her and then let me know if there is anything more I can 
do. Thanks! MC

So, back to my original question, is this a name change?

Is Calpine Energy Services, L.P. a name change from Calpine Power Services 
Company?  If it is I need to see the name change, because I have a financial 
master executed under Calpine Power Services.  Can you fax it to me at 
713/636-3490.  Thanks!
