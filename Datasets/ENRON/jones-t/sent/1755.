I am forwarding a copy of Leslie's email, as a sample for you.  I input 
Leslie's responses in my EOL Legal Database, so I can keep track, product by 
product, of what we said for a counterparty, and then our rationale behind 
it, in case we need to reconstruct why we said "no trading" at a later date.  
If it's an "amended" counterparty, she will tell be whether or not she is 
changing an earlier approval.  Further, I put Leslie's notes about any 
particular contract issue in the database, like "override letter", "online 
GTC", or whatever.  Again, it's our memory of what we approval, and I hope 
with thousands of approvals out there, I know I can't remember everthing.
