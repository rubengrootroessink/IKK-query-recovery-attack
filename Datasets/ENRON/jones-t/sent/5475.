I spoke to Stephanie Sever with the online team, and Aquila Risk Management 
is still open as a counterparty, so no problem there.  When we get the 
assignment in, just tell me, then we will need to open Aquila back up for 
financial trading (they currently have read status only) and shut down 
Utilicorp. for financial trading.

Tana:
I think that we are close to finalizing the Assignment Agreement under which 
the UtiliCorp Master and trades will be assigned back to Aquila Risk 
Management Corp.  Is ARMC still set up to trade online?  If not, what needs 
to be done?  If so, who do we notify concerning the effective date of the 
assignment?
