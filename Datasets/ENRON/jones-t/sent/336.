I just got around to reading the e-mail Shari sent us last week regarding t=
he=20
new MAC language, and had a quick point on the MAC paragraph.  The last=20
sentence doesn't seem to read quite right.  I copied the paragraph below,=
=20
highlighted the area and thought you might want to take a look at it before=
=20
it goes into any contracts.  Does "therefor" belong in there?

(ix) The occurrence of a Material Adverse Change (as hereinafter defined)=
=20
with respect to Party A or Party B.  "Material Adverse Change" means, (a)=
=20
with respect to Party A, its Credit Support Provider=01,s Credit Rating is =
rated=20
below "BBB" by S&P; or (b) with respect to Party B, [insert as appropriate]=

provided, however, that the foregoing occurrence shall not constitute an=20
Event of Default so long as in connection with or after such action or even=
t,=20
the party experiencing the Material Adverse Change (=01&X=018) provides (or=
