Its NOT a name change, the Two calpine companies are merging and the survivor 
company is Calpine Energy Services. Calpine Power record will be inactivated 
on the 1st of next month. Merger docs had been forwarded to you. If not give 
Cheryl Johnson a call and she can forward that.

For RAG......At the time I sent out the spreadsheet in order to meet the EOL 
deadline the GCP system showed the old name. Now the system had been updated 
by Cheryl to reflect the correct name. For further details, on that contact 
Karen Lambert since we have to send the spreadsheet out ASAP everyday to her, 
by a certain time, with the information as it appears in GCP.

P.S. Check in GCP System since thats the most updated information you can 
find. If a name change, merger or acquisition is in process, CHERYL JOHNSON 
or MARILYN COLBERT would know best why?

If we both agree that the counterparty should now be RAG Coal Sales of 
America, shouldn't your spreadsheet reflect that name?  I'm confused.

GCP does have the correct name on file. The company changed its name from 
Cyprus Amax Coal Corporation to RAG American Coal Sales Company and then to 
RAG Coal Sales of America. I had talked to the legal when I first found out 
and provided Cheryl Johnson in Global SAP, with all the name change 
documents. You may contact her at x33103 in order to request 
those........................Adnan

Can you check on the name of RAG American Coal Sales Company.  We have a note 
in our Financial Trading Agreement database that pursuant to a Certificate of 
Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, RAG American Coal Sales 
Company further changed its name to RAG Coal Sales of America, Inc. on 
4/6/2000.  Our file is missing so I cannot find the hard copy of the name 
change.  Thanks.
