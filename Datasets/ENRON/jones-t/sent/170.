Keep me posted on what you find out from this corporate search company.  I'd 
be interested to see what prices we can work out.  I am also going to contact 
Kate Cole and see if she uses anyone special.  If Enron Corp. does and they 
have negotiated any special rates, maybe we can piggyback off of it.  I'll 
keep you posted.

Megan
Hope you are well.
Try "Experion" which provides online and offline services. Search fees range
from about o35 to o135, and the info you receive varies depending on the
country concerned. Best thing is for you/Scott/? to speak direct to Mary
Keane at Experion on 0800 3280059.

Global counterparty is trying to locate online corporate search companies
that
can check company names in Europe and Canada.  In the U.S. we can access
this
information via Westmate in Westlaw.  Are either of you aware of any online
search company, or can you direct me to someone who may be aware of an
online
search company, for Canada and Europe?  If there are no online search
companies
available, is there a reasonably priced corporate search company that can
verify
this information for us?

I appreciate your help.
