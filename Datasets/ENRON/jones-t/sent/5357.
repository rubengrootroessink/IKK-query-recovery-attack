I have been authorized to open TVA to trade US power.  Accordingly, Tennessee 
Valley Authority is authorized to trade US power via EnronOnline pursuant to 
the on-line GTCs only.  Accordingly, TVA needs to receive an override letter 
in the form attached below.

Please call me with any questions or comments.

Tana,

Please let me know the status of Tennessee Valley Authority.  I understand 
the power desk is working with them once again and would like TVA to have the 
ability to trade on EnronOnline.  
I would like have them open for all US East Power.

Thanks for your assistance.

T.
