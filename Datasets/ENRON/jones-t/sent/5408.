Attached are approvals for January 12, 2001.  You'll note that several 
amended counterparties appear; in these cases ONLY THE CELLS HIGHLIGHTED IN 
YELLOW should be changed within the user profile for a given counterparty.  
Hopefully this will save some time both for credit as well as for product 
control.  As in the past, counterparties who are declined are crossed out 
across the profile.  New counterparties are highlighted as necessary.  

Please call if you have any questions; thanks.  

Walter
