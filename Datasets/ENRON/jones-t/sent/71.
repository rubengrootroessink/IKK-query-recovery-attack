Thanks for your email.  I don't want to state the obvious because you appear 
to already be in compliance, but just as a precaution, I want to make sure 
you are aware the ECT has a policy which prohibits it employees/traders from 
trading in anything the company trades in.  Any trading you do for your own 
account must comply with this policy.
