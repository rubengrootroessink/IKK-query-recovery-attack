John, I've been out of the office for two days and just got in.   I take it 
that Cowlitz PUD is a governmental entity?  Our usual sample form does not 
have the governmental provisions.  I would think we would want to send them a 
sample with those provisions in there, because they would be rather surprised 
if they got a draft from us at some point and it had all these additional 
provisions in there.  Can you confirm for me that they are a 
governmental/quasi-governmental?  Also, have you requested credit from 
Credit?
