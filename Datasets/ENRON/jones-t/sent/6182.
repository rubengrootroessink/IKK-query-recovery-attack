I'll be there.  I didn't sign up for the organized activities.  I'll just be 
hanging out.  The Swap Group is having dinner Wednesday night, if you haven't 
already made plans do you want to join us, we're about 15 in number right now!

Hey Tana,

I haven't seen you on any activity list for the conference.  Will  you be 
attending?

Andrea
