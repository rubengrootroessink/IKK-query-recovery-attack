I spoke to Tanya and she said they only do energy trading through J. Aron, 
all the interest rate and currency trading is done through Goldman, so we 
don't need language re: that business.  Also, I ran it by her, and she does 
want the language in the credit rating section of the MAC about "not 
supported by third party credit enhancement."
