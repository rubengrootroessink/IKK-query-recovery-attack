702/259-2323.  But I went home sick.  I'll call you tomorrow?  Or if you
need help immediately, you can call Joe Boyle 9703/259-2311.

Thanks

Lisa

Lisa,

I was returning your phone call to Carol St. Clair about the agreement and
deleted the message by mistake before I got to your phone no.  Can you give
me a call at (713) 853-3399.  Thanks!
