Mark asked me to contact you to get a copy of one of the letters we sent to 
outside counsel requesting updates on their legal advice to deal with the 
online trading issues.  We have to get similar letters out to some of the 
South American countries and Carribean tax shelter islands.

Much thanks!  By the way, weren't you out for vacation?  Did you have a good 
time?
