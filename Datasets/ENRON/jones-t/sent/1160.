No wonder you couldn't find it!  Keep looking, 'cause I guess when you can

perfect!

Dear Ms. Francis:



Thank you for accepting my resume via e-mail for Job ID #0000103876.

perform require the same qualifications that are essential to the position
for which I am applying. My ability to learn quickly, apply good
problem-solving skills and work with minimal supervision could definitely
benefit Enron Energy Services Account Management Department.



I welcome a confidential call from your company. My office number is

Thank you.





Very sincerely,



Patti Young
