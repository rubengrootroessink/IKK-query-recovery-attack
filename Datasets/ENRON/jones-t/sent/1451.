Attached below is the product description for the new Nat Gas Phy Park and 
Loan product type.  Commercial is planning on launching this next Wednesday.  
I'm not sure if you would consider this just another Nat Gas phy product or 
if it requires special treatment.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!!!

Frank

My apologies for not including the attachment earlier.

Richard and I believe we have finalized the descriptions for these Products. 
Please find attached our suggested final version. Our projected roll-out date 
is next Wednesday, so I will commence the building process ASAP.

Item 1 - Agreed; see my Revision Marks.

Item 2 - How about listing the Contract Price as the difference between the 
Bid and Offer; see my Revision Marks.

Also, are you suggesting we change the Product Short Descriptions to what you 
have placed in bold? If so, then your Product Short description on the 
website will be redundant, and look like this:  

Chicago Phy Gas Park Chi Peoples 20Jun00-Jul00 USD/MM; 

and if you ever wanted to offer another Product based on a different Location 
it would be messy:

Chicago Phy Gas Park Mich Con 20Jun00-Jul00 USD/MM, 

so we would have to build another Product Type. I think that it's important 
to leave the Product Type generic (i.e. 'US Gas Phy Loan') which would allow 
you to transact on other locations (i.e. US Gas Phy Loan   Mich Con  20Jun00 
-Jul00 USD/MM; or US Gas Phy Loan   Demarc  20Jun00 -Jul00 USD/MM) and we can 
set those up quickly and easily.

I would really like to get these last issues finalized as quickly as 
possible. Building the Product Type is easy; chasing everyone down to get 
their part done is where I start running into time delays.

I have changed the Product description again, but I think that this will be 
the final change.  Please review the Product example worksheet for a detailed 
examples of how I think these products will work.  

Dale,

I have modified your long product description for both the Park and the Loan 
products.  Hunter and I have reviewed your description and we have the 
following comments:

1.  We should ensure that both "legs" of these transactions are firm.  
Currently only the "payback" portion of the transaction is labeled as firm.

2.  Do we need to state the Contract price is the difference between the 
sales and purchase price.  I will make my market based on these prices, but 
there are many other factors that will effect my actual bids/offers. 

Additonally, we are still waiting for product manager set-up on our 
computers; although, we have been approved for these products by security.  
Thanks


Richard
