I really don't know.  Maybe the icon, which is just a shortcut to the 
database, won't work because of outlook.  I haven't had this problem with any 
other people on outlook before.  You might want to talk to your computer 
person.  He can probably find the database the long way.  It is just a misc. 
Lotus Notes application.

Tana -

I am unable to access the link for the Financial Trade agreements Notes DB.  
I am wondering if my access problems are related to the fact that I have 
outlook and the file is searching for the notes.ini link.  I'd appreciate any 
assistance on this.
Thanks!

Angela
