Tana,

Two options were done with Tokyo Mitsubishi on October 22.  The terms are:  
ENA sells a CALL of 100,000 Barrels of Brent Crude at $23 with a $0.46 
premium;  ENA buys a CALL of 100,000 Barrels of Brent Crude at $24 with a 
$0.20 premium.  I understand that special language is being prepared for a 
trade done on October 15, and believe that the same language will need to 
apply on these options.  Please contact me should you need further 
information.

Thanks,

Chris Walker
