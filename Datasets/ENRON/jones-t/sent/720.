Attached please find the referenced list.  On the amended counterparties, 
Southwestern Public Service Company is the only one with a change, with Enron 
sells power only, and on the only new counterparty, Minnesota Power, we've 
got Enron selling power only also.  Again, no European power for U.S. 
counterparties until further notice.
