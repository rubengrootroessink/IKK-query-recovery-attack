I spoke to Peter Keohane while you were gone about that Canadian interest 
change question we asked him.  You'll see, he sent us both a fax with 
proposed changes to that section.

When you have a minute, let's chat about what Peter told me.  It wasn't a 
clear answer of what to do, so we need to decide which way we want to go on 
this.
