If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the 
comments between Legal & Credit.  We do not give this level of access to 
non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information 
for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away 
our negotiating positions!).  If you would like this level of access, let me 
know and I will put in a request.  This level of access will also give you 
edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.
