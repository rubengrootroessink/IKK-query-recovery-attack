Attached please find a proposed form of Termination Agreement for Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce.  Obviously, we need to still input the trades.

Peter,

It appears that our signers on the trading floor will be offsite in PRC 
meetings on Thursday.  I need to know ASAP when we plan on signing this 
because I am going to have to call around to find an officer that might be 
in.
