Tana,

I automatically shut down all for European physical power.

I'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with Frank, so just 
to reiterate a global shut down (like-no one does Credit Derivatives unless 
we really mean it), no non-European based counterparty (in all probability, 
no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade 
European physical power products.  They have licensing requirements similar 
to our FERC licensing.

Thanks!
