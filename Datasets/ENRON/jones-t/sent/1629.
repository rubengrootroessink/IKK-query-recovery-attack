Because they are a governmental entity, in order to do financial our lawyers 
would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes, legislative 
authority and possible legal opinions before they can trade financial.  So if 
they want to trade financial, get me a name and phone number, probably of one 
of their lawyers and we'll have to talk to them.

Great -- thanks.  If they want to do financial, would that be possible?

Just an heads up, they are open to trade physical power, which I expect is 
what they want to trade, but not financial.

Legal has signed off on the counterparty, so I expect it is being held up 
with the online team for some reason.
