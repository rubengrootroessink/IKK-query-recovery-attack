Why aren't you playing polo?  Has your horse accepted other film roles after 
your smashing success in Gladiator?

P.S.  Missed you at the seminar, it's just not the same when you're not 
there...!

Justy,

I don't think there is any problem with this.  But since Harry told me to run 
it by you, I am.  Could you sign off ASAP.  Thanks!

I do not know of any reason that they should not be able to transact UK oil 
and products. However, it would be best to also check with London on this 
request.
