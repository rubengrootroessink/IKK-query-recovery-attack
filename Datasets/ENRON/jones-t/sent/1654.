Attached are the referenced lists.  A few things to note:

On the 8/7/00 List:

Papier Masson, LTEE can transact all pulp and papers swaps, but not options 
(when we have them).

On the 8/8/00 List:

Globe Building Materials, Inc. has been shut down from trading financial 
since they are currently not an eligible swap participant ("ESP") in their 
own right.  However, getting a letter of credit in place would make them an 
ESP, and Credit has requested a letter of credit from them.  As soon as they 
receive the LC, Credit will pass the counterparty through again for 
re-approval.
