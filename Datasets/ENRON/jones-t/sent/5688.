I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the 
Interior.  I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt 
agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think 
more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals 
Management Service.
