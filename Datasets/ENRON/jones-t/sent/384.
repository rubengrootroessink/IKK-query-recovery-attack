Lovely note, crummy master.  It makes Belco look good!  I know Olin 
Corporation only because they had a plant near the summer camp I went to in 
North Carolina and there were days when the stench from the plant pervaded 
the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains where the camp was located.  That plant 
manufactured the plastic wrap that went around all those cigarettes they were 
making in North Carolina.  I kinda remember them being a plastics company 
back then.
