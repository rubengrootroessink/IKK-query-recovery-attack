At the request of Dan Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of Broker

with your approval, please execute the agreements and return them to me via

have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at 
(713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.
