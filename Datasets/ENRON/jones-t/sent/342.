If you find a product that does, keep me in the loop.  We're always looking 
for better ways to do things up here and unless Lexis/Nexis improves, I am 
currently not impressed with their product, compared to the old Information 
America, which was great before they bought it out and ruined it!  How are 
you doing?...you must be a little stressed with this Online project, as well 
as others...!
