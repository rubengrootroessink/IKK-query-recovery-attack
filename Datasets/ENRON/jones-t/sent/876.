As you may or may not be aware of, tomorrow is the drop dead date for 
approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty 
list.  Thinking through this product today and reading through my various 
emails from David Minns, I have come to the conclusion that there are no 
particular issues specifically relating to Australian financial power, and my 
thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved 
financial power product.  I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to 
me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.  What do you think?

The list I am working off of is the list generated for Credit Derivative 
approvals (which is the most somewhat current list of counterparties who have 
been issued passwords).
