Mark Taylor, the attorney I work for, has agreed to the changes you made, so 
if you would like to process the agreement on your side and fax the signed 
copy to me I will have it executed by an authorized officer here.  Thanks for 
your prompt review and have a nice Memorial Day holiday!

Tana,

Attached is a redline with a few changes to the letter.  These should all be
consistent with the substance you have.

Let me know if you or Mark wish to discuss.
