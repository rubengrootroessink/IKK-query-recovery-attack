I approved this counterparty with US EOL this morning to trade all coal 
including European coal.

Fine from my perspective.  Tana will let me know (please) if there are any 
problems [N.B. this product is currently a physically settled product]. 
Thanks, Edmund

Are you two ok with a US company being able to trade European Coal?  They 
currently can trade US Coal.

Lara

All

Following a request from Kirt Gengenbach of Duke Energy Merchants LLC to 
enable them to access the European coal products via EOL, I can confirm that 
Credit approve execute access for these products without collateral and tenor 
of 36 months.

Please arrange for them to have access ASAP and let me know when this has 
been done as the trader is waiting to do deals ?

Thanks 

Lee
