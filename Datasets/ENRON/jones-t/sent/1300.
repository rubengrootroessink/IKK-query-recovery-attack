To prepare an NDA for you I will need the following information:

1.  The correct legal name of the counterparty
2.  Whether the agreement is bilateral (both parties providing confidential 
information) or one-way (where only Enron is providing confidential 
information).  Our preference is to use the Enron protected party form since 
it is written more in our favor.
3.  The nature and/or use of the information being provided.
4.  The address of the counterparty
5.  The phone and fax number of the counterparty

Once I have all this I can prepare your NDA in short order.

Tana,

Please can you forward a copy of the EOL NDA to Alexandria Khalil at 
Outercurve Technologies (akhalil@outercurve.com).  Please can you advise when 
you have received a signed copy.

Thanks
