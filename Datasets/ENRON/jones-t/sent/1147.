What do the numbers "4" and "8" mean on your list?

Here's my list - NB for the credit products we will only give approvals if we 
are asked to look at specific counterparties for trading that product.  
Thanks, Edmund

Subject: country approvals

I have lots of blanks on my approvals on the attached list for several 
European products.  If you know any of the answers, can you please just hand 
write them in and fax them back to me, or email a more recent list you might 
that addresses the European approvals.  Much thanks.
