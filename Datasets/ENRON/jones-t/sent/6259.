I look forward to having you all as guests for an evening of Cajun cooking at 
my home on Saturday, May 19 at 7:00 pm.  Some of us (I won't name names!) are 
hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of African Uno!

Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and 
attached below are the recipes for the evening.  I will provide beer, wine 
and soft drinks.  In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go with 
the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.

Please let me know as soon as possible which recipe you would prefer to 
prepare.

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 to the Greenbriar exit (like you are going to Church)
2.  Make a right on Greenbriar
3.  Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first 
left possible onto a street called Milford
4.  Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the 
opposite direction)
5.  The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to the 
59 freeway)
6.  On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on 
the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks
7.  My phone number is (713) 529-1038
