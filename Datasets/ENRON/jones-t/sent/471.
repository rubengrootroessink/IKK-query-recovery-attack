In order to deal with the online trading program as well as other issues that 
repeatedly arise, we need to make some modifications to our Master Swap 
Agreement Database.

Foremost, we would like to open the Master Swap Agreement Database to any 
ECT, ECT Canada or ECT International employee that would like access to the 
information.  This would include employees in the London, Oslo, Singapore, 
Portland  and Buenos Aires offices.  The only information we need to continue 
to restrict is the Legal and Credit comment section (attorney-client 
privilege issues).  Access to this information would continue to be limited 
to Legal and Credit  In addition, it also very critical that only Legal and 
Credit have access to the Portland General masters.

Second, we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading 
issues.  Online trading will commence by the end of the month and we need to 
have this information and access available by that time.

In addition, we have remaining "kinks" in the database we need to resolve.

Can you let me know when you would be available to meet to discuss the 
changes.  Thanks for your help!
