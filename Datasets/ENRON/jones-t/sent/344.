Well, it turns out that Mark Elliott needs a revised draft of the UK ISDA 
incorporating our form changes since he needs to send it to Gibraltar counsel 
for the legal review he's working on for Gibraltar law.  So, I'll work with 
Mark to come up with the form and then pass it on to you and the London legal 
team for approval.
