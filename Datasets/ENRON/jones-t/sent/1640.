Sorry for the delay, I've been away from the office sick.  

In response to your note:

UK = fine
Sweden = fine  (need to check the authority of persons executing PAs and ETAs)
France = fine.  Need to check on the type of entity to ensure close-out 
netting is possible
Italy = restricted at the moment.  We have sought further advice.  Will 
update in due course.
Netherlands = swaps only at the moment for financials.  This may change.

We have not done any due diligence for physical transactions, so the above 
only relates to cash settled commodity derivatives.

Edmund

I've got  several European counterparties on my 8/3/00 ClickPaper Online 
List, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and France.  Are there any 
restrictions on trading financial pulp & paper in Europe?

Everything going well...?
