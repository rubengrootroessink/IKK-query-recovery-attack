Mark,

I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who 
your attorney should be on this deal.  I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, 
and left him a message to which he finally responded.  He is now expecting to 
see this CA.  I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney.  
I don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your 
direction as to how I should handle this.

I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone 
number is 713/853-3399.
