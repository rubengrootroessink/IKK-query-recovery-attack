Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.  From the 
US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for 
power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES.

Attached below is a list of Australian and Japanese counterparties for the 
Australian and Japanese weather launch.  As they are actually launching these 
products this afternoon, your immediate attention would be GREATLY 
appreciated.  Let me know of any potential conflicts ( other than the obvious 
lack of time) and I will do what ever possible to help.

Thanks for your extraordinary efforts!!!!!!

Frank
