I just got off the phone with Aquila's Kansas City attorney about online 
trading issues and he said he would like to get an ISDA Master in place with 
us.  He said the contact to negotiate is their Calgary attorney, Carissa 
Browning at (403) 543-7188.   I told him I would pass on the request to our 
Credit team.

Much thanks!
