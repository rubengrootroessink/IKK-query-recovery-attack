My copy had redlines.  I passed the comments on to Leslie Hansen, an attorney 
in our Group for review.

Bruce,
I finally got counsel to review the confidentiality agreement that you sent
me back on October 26.  I have attached the document complete with
counsel's changes.

Hopefully, the requested changes will not be of an extraordinary nature and
we will be able to move forward from here.

Please call me with any questions or issues.

Regards,

Randy S. Baker
