So far as much as I've been able to track, the Houston Confirmation Desk does 
not know about this Duke Confirm yet.  Don, can you contact Dale Neuner on 
the Confirmation Desk ASAP with the proposed deal terms so he can prepare the 
Confirm and get it sent over to Duke.  Thanks!

Tana, do you know what's the "Confirmation Letter" Duke is talking about in 
the e-mail below? They are requesting us to send it to them.

Good!  I hope this is the first of a number of transactions we enter into 
together.   Please have your people sending the ISDA back to our lawyers in 
Houston with Duke's signature so we then complete the loop.

Julian, would you please co-ordinate asap with our Houston staff to have them 
sending the confirmation to Roni at the fax number below?  Thanks.
