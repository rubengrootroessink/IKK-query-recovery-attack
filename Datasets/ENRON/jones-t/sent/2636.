		 Subject: Updated Executed Master Agreement List

Hi Tana,

Dianne Sieb in our office told me to ask if you could send me an updated list 
of all the Executed Master Agreements.  The list I have from the Financial 
Trading group isn't totally correct, and I need an up to date version.  Can 
you help me?

Please let me know.

Thanks
Stacey
