Just wanted to let you know I faxed the OMnet Agreement over to Susan Gill 
today about 3:30 pm our time.  I have the originals and asked her to tell me 
what address she wants me to send the originals to.  I didn't date the front 
page of the agreement because I didn't know what date you wanted them to be 
effective so I'll leave that to y'all to work out.  I'm working on getting 
the other documents signed and I guess I can get them all out in the same 
package, maybe tomorrow.   I'll visit with you tomorrow about what to do.
