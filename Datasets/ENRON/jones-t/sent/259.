Mark Taylor has asked me to forward to the relevant attorneys the following 
market descriptions.  Obviously, for you, the weather one is yours, I sent 
the pulp & paper to Sara.  We need to review the market descriptions from a 
legal perspective only.  Awais is trying to get them back by today.  Let me 
know if that will present a problem.   He still hasn't got the liquids ones 
written, he says we'll have those by Monday.  I am coordinating the 
responses, so please return any comments you might have to me for transmittal 
to Awais.

Thanks for your help!

Tana,

I am afraid there is more than one description.  Some are quite lengthy,  US 
West Power (11 Pages) and US Natural Gas (5 pages).  There is a quite urgent 
deadline to get these uploaded into the web pages and then integrated into 
the site by the end of this week.  So any comments you can provide ASAP would 
be much appreciated.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to phone, or email me.  Tel 
no: 44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Awais

Steven & Carol,

I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
will be trading on the system to give users some general information.

I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.

In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
below.

Canada Gas
LPG
NOx Emissions
Oil & Oil products
Plastics and Petrochemicals
Pulp & Paper
SO2 Emissions
US Coal
US Natural Gas
US East Power
US West Power
Weather Derivatives

I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  

Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
tomorrow.



If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Awais
