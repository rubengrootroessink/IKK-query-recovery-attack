Matt,

The only people that can have full view and edit capability are Legal and 
Credit (for legal/client confidentiality purposes).  Attached is the icon, 
which is just a shortcut link to the database and you can send that link to 
any Enron employee and they will have view access to all the information in 
the database except the legal and credit comments.  I will make a request to 
add the legal and credit people to get edit capability.  I think Denis 
O'Connell already had edit access, send him the link and let me know if he 
has edit access.  (you can just copy this link and add it to emails to 
people, however, I'm a little afraid it might not work from London, because 
it is just a shortcut, if it doesn't, you might need your computer people to 
create a shortcut link for y'all, let me know).

Link -->

Matt,

Back office should have access to insert confirmations comments.  Yumi Takei 
needs to be on the back office list (not the lawyers list) - Gail Hill and 
Carol Findlay also need to be added; you should also ask ask them whether any 
other back office staff need access to add coments.

Credit need to have edit access for inserting credit comments. 

Add Denis O'Connell and Paul Johnson to the lawyers list.

Note that I am the only person in London with delete capability.

Thanks, Edmund
