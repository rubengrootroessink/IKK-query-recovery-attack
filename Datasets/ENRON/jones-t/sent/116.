I spoke to Harry Musikas in NYMEX Compliance this afternoon and he gave me 
verbal approval of 500 contracts for COB spot month for the next year, 
pending final approval of Bernie Purta (big boss at NYMEX).  We won't get the 
letter for about a week to 2 weeks, but I wanted to let you know.  I spoke to 
Mike Swerzbin and told him the same thing.  I'll pass on the approval letter 
and my revised list as soon as we get his approval letter.
