Raquel Guzman, the lawyer for the referenced counterparty called again, and 
she is going on vacation next week and wants to get that ETA finalized so 
they can start trading when she's out.  She seems to feel the way the ETA is 
written that they are responsible for all unauthorized use of the password, 
including hackers into the system, and wants the language limited to use 
caused by their fault or negligence.  Can you call her at 215/684-6630.  
Thanks.
