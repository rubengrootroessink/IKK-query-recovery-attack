I heard back from the power lawyer and they do not appear to have a FERC 
license.  He is going to have to talk to her and clear this up.

Tana --- I talked to Jeff Mansfield this a.m. and he implied that they should 
be receiving a blessing for transacting power.   I'm not sure where he got 
that info, but it must not be true, huh?
Thanks, Griff

We approved these guys yesterday for gas.  Our power team is looking at them 
for power, but a message came down from legal that they will probably be shut 
down for power.  They are open for gas.

Brad,

Here's another one.  They come in groups you know.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last credit question for a bit.

How is the credit part coming on this company's app?  The latest Access data 
base entry appears to be October 23rd.

Thanks,
Griff
