Just a note to let you know that per my conversation with Tanya, after review 
by Brent, today I will be sending out am amendment to BMO allowing for the 
provision of Cash as Eligible Collateral under the ISDA.  When we get this in 
signed I will send my usual email out to the world explaining this amendment, 
but you may want to think about what procedures you will need to put in place 
to make sure this happens EVERY time we take collateral in (not to mention, 
we will also have to pay Canadian counsel to file releases as well , and this 
will cost us money too!  We don't want to have to do this too often.)  
Anything you want to tell me before I send this out today?!
