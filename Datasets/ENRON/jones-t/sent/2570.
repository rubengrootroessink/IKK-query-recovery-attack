My strategy on hand recounts, is that if if the opposition wants one, they'll 
have to do it themselves!

20 masters out or going out for signature does not make for SIGNED 
agreements!  As I stated before, I will be asking for a recount (not by Team 
Swap, of course)!

For those of you keeping track, Carrizo makes 475 master swap agreements.  
Conferring with Team Swap, we have at least 20 masters out or going out for 
sigature this week (including the 9 Merit Energy Partner masters).  Unlike 
the media in the Presidential Election, I hesitate to call this one an early 
win (especially after seeing the Board in Marie's office!), but I must say, 
Team Swap is looking strong.
