For this list of amends, my comments mean:

Cinergy-already had them open for financial & power, Credit's changes should 
have no impact on my prior approvals.
Dynegy Power Marketing-shut them down for financial (& Argentina gas)
Nui Energy Brokers-already had them open for all financial, OK with Credit's 
changes.
