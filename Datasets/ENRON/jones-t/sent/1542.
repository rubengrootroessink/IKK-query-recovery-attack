Hi Edmund,

I was told that you are still working on the due dilligence for selling 
metals to Japan.
MG would like to know how long it will take until we can trade metals with 
our Japanese friends as we will (hopefully) introduce a 
Phy. Al contract, CIF Japanese port basis. soon.
One of their guys will go to Japan soon to 'promote' it.

Any idea ?
Thanks.


Rgds

Diana
