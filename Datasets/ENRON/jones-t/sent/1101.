Attached are the recipes for the Church Gourmet Dinner.  I've got you down 
tor the pork chops (Alicia says  to make it a mix of pork and chicken).  All 
the recipes looked really good, so I thought you might want to look at them 
anyway.

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church
2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet.
3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray 
apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is 
"Ashby", make a right on Ashby.
4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 
1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the 
back yard.

My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look 
forward to seeing you there!
