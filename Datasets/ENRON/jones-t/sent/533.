Unless otherwise noted on a going forward basis... unless I specifically 
mention a physical product, all physical counterparties will be approved for 
all the products that Credit has approved them for.  If I have an exception, 
it will be noted, otherwise CONSIDER THAT THE RULE.  Most of the comments I 
will have relate to financial counterparties:

For Financial

I am not responding to Credits "declined" counterparties.

1. AEC Storage and Hub Services, a business unit of Alberta Energy Company 
Ltd.  BAD NAME.  There is an ISDA Master in place between ECC and Alberta 
Energy Company Ltd.  I will approve financial trading with this Counterparty 
if the Confirms go out under that name.
2.  Ashland Speciality Chemicals Company, a division of Ashland Inc.  We are 
currently negotiating a master with this counterparty.  We earlier sent out a 
draft under a division name, and the counterparty came back and told us to 
change the name to Ashland, Inc.  So, if we trade under the Ashland, Inc. 
name, I can approve it for financial trading.
3.  Bayer Inc., Rubber Division-BAD NAME.  I have already approved trading 
under Bayer Corporation.
4.  Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, L.P. - turning 
down to trade financial because we have already approved them for financial 
trading under Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
5.  Southwestern Energy Services Company-is a division of Southwestern Energy 
Company.  We have an ISDA Master in place with Southwestern Energy Company, 
which I will approve for financial trading under that name.
6.  Tenaska Marketing Canada, a division of TMV Corp.-already approved 
trading under TMV Corp.
7.  Trammochem, a division of Transammonia Inc. - BAD NAME.   I already 
approved them on the first list, and their master is in the name of 
Transammonia Inc., acting through it Division Trammochem.  FIX NAME!

For Power

1.  City of Riverside - per Leslie Hansen, they are permitted to trade  
pursuant to a GTC with collateral - subject to recieving override letter.
