Dear All

This is just a quick note to let you know that I will be leaving Enron next 
Friday to return to New Zealand in order to enjoy an extra summer and to 
study a bit more law.

I'll be around until Friday 6th August should you have anything specific you 
would like me to deal with, but Michael Slade will now be dealing with all of 
my files. Michael has joined us from Covington & Burling and can be contacted 
on 0171 970 7433 or at mslade@enron.co.uk.

Thanks to all of you for your assistance and advice over the past few years, 
it has been a pleasure working with you.

Kindest regards,
Sasha
