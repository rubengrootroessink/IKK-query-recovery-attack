I do not have an individual list.  It will have to got to all the employees 
in the cities, and or countries where we have trading offices, which is 
pretty much the list I had below.

Tana,

We have a recent group with all of ENA.  However, we do not have anything set 
up for trading affiliate offices or a way to determine that information.  
Please provide any names/addresses that are needed other than the ENA.

If you do give me names that are not already in a Notes address format, I 
will need you to provide them in an Excel spreadsheet with First Name, Last 
name, Social Security number and department to help resolve conflicts.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Erika

I need to send out the attached memo ASAP to all employees of Enron North 
America and its trading affiliate offices.  This includes Houston, Calgary, 
London, Denver, New York, Oslo, Singapore, Portland, Australia, Buenos Aires, 
and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates.  Can someone 
with your team get back to me ASAP so we can be clear about who we send this 
to.  Thanks!
