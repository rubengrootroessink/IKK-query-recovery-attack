Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...!

We were in the process of revising our form, so I just have to draft up an 
Canadian version of the sample ISDA master and get yoou a draft.  I'll try 
and get to it the next day or two.

Tana, I know we exchanged a couple of e-mails since the below about you 
providing to me the Canadian financial trading precedents described below, 
but I forget where it was left.  We do need to get these precedents to the 
counterparty as soon as possible and I apologize for not following up on it.  
As suggested, I need the actual base ISDA agreement, paragraph 13, credit 
support annex, etc. as well as the short form financial GTC but I do not need 
the municipal government schedule at this point.  Could you gather together 
these precedents and forward them directly to Chris Gaffney in Toronto?

Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Cheers

Greg

Subject: Canadian Precedent Form of ISDA

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

Greg
