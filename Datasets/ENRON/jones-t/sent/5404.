I spoke to Dave Samuels, and if you are having Harry Arora sign it, Dave 
thought that would be OK with Louise.  So we're on board.  Could you send me 
a copy when it's signed.

Thanks for your help!

Update.  Bridge has signed and faxed back to us the attached NDA.  We have 
not provided a signed counterpart and will not until we hear back from you.  
If the attached is not acceptable to Net Works, we can ask Bridge to sign the 
NDA again with DealBench as the Enron counterparty and you can have Bridge 
sign the appropriate NDA for Net Works.

I apologize for any inconvenience; we merely were trying to accommodate 
everyone's goals in a short time frame.

A couple of additional thoughts.  The mutual NDA covers Net Works and its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries (which includes EOL).  Equitable relief is more 
likely than arbitration to be the relief sought for breach of an NDA and 
equitable relief is covered by attached.  We appreciate the need to conform 
to policy; these thoughts are shared merely in an attempt to help streamline 
the process for this transaction.  Again, just let us know how you would like 
to proceed.  Regards, NJD

We have done as outlined in my e-mail; if this is not acceptable, we can ask 
Bridge to sign another agreement.  Bridge does want a mutual NDA and we need 
something this afternoon.  Please let us know.

Are you drafting this NDA for us?  I have already prepared a draft based off 
your form, which adds not only Enron Net Works, but also EnronOnline as our 
counterparty.  In addition, we have a company policy that requires that we 
have arbitration in all of our agreement.  Our client over at EnronOnline, 
Dave Samuels, is sending our form to his customer.

Further to attached, Shmuel advises that Bridge's signed counterpart of 
attached is being faxed back to us this afternoon.  In my physical absence, I 
have asked Rose to initial for Net Works (Mark, hope this is ok; this is same 
agreement used for DealBench with changes noted below).  Bridge did not 
return signed its counterpart of DealBench agreement, asking this morning for 
a mutual NDA which we have accommodated.  Jeff suggested that since we had to 
revise the agreement, we streamline the Net Works effort by making it the 
Enron counterparty (Net Works and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (including 
DealBench) are covered by NDA).

Thanks for your help.

Attached please find another draft of confidentiality agreement revised to 
(i) change the DealBench counterparty to its parent, Enron Net Works LLC, and 
(ii) make the agreement mutual in respect of Bridge Confidential 
Information.  I understand that DealBench (which continues to be protected 
under this agreement) would like to disclose information this afternoon to 
Bridge.  Accordingly, please fax a signed Bridge counterpart as soon as 
possible to me at the fax number below and to Jeff Bartlett at 713/646-8576.  
We will fax to you a counterpart signed by Net Works.
