I discussed this w/Frank, and wanted to make the other two of you aware,  
since this is a Bermuda corporation, they are only allowed to trade the US 
segment of bandwidth.  Since this is the only segment we are trading online 
yet, this isn't an issue.  But as we move forward and add more segments we 
are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been 
open for US, we need to consider if they can trade other country based 
segments as we add them in the future.
