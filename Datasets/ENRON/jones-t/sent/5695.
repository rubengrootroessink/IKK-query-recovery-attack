I just tried to call you, I couldn't get through.  What are you discussing 
with Carr?  Is this just for them to enter into an BETA, or something else?  
Also, do you want a bilateral agreement?  Who will be providing the 
confidential information?  It shouldn't take me too long to draft you and NDA 
once I get this info.  I'll email it to the counterparty and copy you in on 
the email.  Of course, we have to get it signed here in Houston, so time is 
of the essence...
