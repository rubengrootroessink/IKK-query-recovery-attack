		 Subject: Sorry to bug you

Every time I've come by your office this morning, you've been on the phone so 
I hate to bug you when I know you are swamped but are we going to be able to 
do any more of the ISDA stuff today?  I have a conference call at 3:30 this 
afternoon that will be 1-2 hours and then I am flying home tomorrow so will 
be leaving the office around noon tomorrow.
