Mr. Harrell,

Thanks for the lovely note about the execution rate.  When we had a big group 
meeting a few months ago we (Legal) were actually surprised by our success 
level at that time, but these numbers exceed our expectations.

Since you congratulated Credit, I took it upon myself to also email the 
message to Credit. too..
