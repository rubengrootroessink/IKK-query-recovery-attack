Corinna -

I have looked at the attached.  It is fine.  I will be printing two originals 
for Net Works' signature.  I'll have them sent down for signature so that 
they can then be sent to Microsoft.

JDP MOU


Mark,

Can you please review the changes made by Susan Chang at Microsoft to the SQL 
2000 SP1 JDP MOU for our Unify application.  Bob Ward is out of the office 
until June 4th, and this application is going into production on June 11th.  
We need to ensure the MOU is finalized and signed prior to going into 
production so that we can receive the appropriate support from Microsoft when 
we go live.

If you need to contact Susan her telephone number is 425-703-6394.  Her email 
is schang@microsoft.com.

Thanks for your immediate attention to this matter,
Corinna Bolender
Desk: 713-345-4388
Cell:   512-632-4285

Bob and Corinna,
Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
change.  Specifically:
an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
(though this hardly matters now considering the date).
The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
#4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
good addition.
#10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
customer.

If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
included.  Please print, sign and return.

Thanks!
JamMo!

Susan,
I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our
Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact
changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they
changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come
back and bite me later.  Roughly 4 or 5 sentenced.
Thanks for you help!
