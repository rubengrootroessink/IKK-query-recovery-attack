Tana, Carol and I agreed that the credit test for both parties would be S&P
AND Moody's, yet Moody's was not added in the amendment for Party B (Enron).
I have revised the amendment; in this form it is acceptable to Aron.  Please
prepare execution copies and send them to me at:

Goldman, Sachs & Co.
One New York Plaza
New York, NY  10004

Thank you.

Luanne,

I missed a few of Carol's changes so she asked me to resend the document.
Sorry!
