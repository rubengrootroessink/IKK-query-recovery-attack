What a happy coincidence about the book!  We'll have to share thoughts when 
we're done reading it.  The New York Times gave it a rave review, which made 
it so popular it was sold out for quite some time.

I've had to scold our buddy up there in the frozen north.  He's having to 
work on a master physical/financial netting agreement for a Canadian 
counterparty and has been calling me to ask basic ISDA questions that were 
covered in my class.  I told him if you two were paying more attention 
instead of clowning around so much...oh well, good thing I can't get him with 
a ruler up in Canada!  

Take care, and I'll look forward to chatting with you...
