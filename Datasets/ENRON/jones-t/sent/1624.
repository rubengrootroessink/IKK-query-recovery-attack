Bob,

John Viverito, an attorney from Houston who is temporarily in Japan setting 
up our Japanese trading office, is looking for the templates for 
confirmations for US weather and pulp and paper confirmations.  Can you send 
the confirmations to him.  Thanks!

John:

I will see what I can put together on this. 

I will likely be able to line up OTC and On-line confirmation examples for US 
weather (you, of course, can get Australian weather from David Minns) and 
pulp & paper derivatives only, as metals and lumber are brand new to Enron 
and are being developed as we speak.

Regards, Alan

Tana: Could arrange to have John sent by e-mail examples of the Houston 
over-the-counter and on-line confirmations for weather derivatives and pupl & 
paper?

Alan-

Sorry for not being more specific.  Please have our form confirmation 
documentation sent regarding these different commodities, so that we may 
establish a form file here in Tokyo.  It is also anticipated that our 
counterparties will be interested in reviewing the confirmations.  

Thanks,

John

John:

It is my understanding that the ISDA documentation previously provided to you 
and B&M is the documentation that we use for the other types of derivatives 
you mentioned. Of course, the transactional confirmations are customized to 
adopt the proper indices for the commodities being hedged.

All-

IBJ is interested in entering into a ISDA documentation with us for the 
purposes of  trading weather derivatives, pulp & paper derivatives, oil 
derivatives, lumber derivatives and metals.  Our credit department is now 
preparing a credit work sheet, so that the relevant credit language can be 
prepared.  I will contact B&M to discuss on Thursday.

Alan-

Please forward electronic copies of our standard documentation related to 
pulp & paper derivatives, oil derivatives, lumber derivatives and metals (to 
the extent there is any difference from what Marcus has already forwarded to 
B&M), for the purpose of developing such documentation for the Japanese 
market.  

Cheers,

John
