The resolution The Bakersfield Californian provided to us when we signed the 
ISDA Agreement with them limited the types transactions they were approved to 
do with us to "...newsprint commodity price swap and option transactions."   
In order for us to expand the type of business they can do under the ISDA 
Agreement we would need a new resolution from the Company expanding the types 
of products they are approved to do with us.
