I looked at the website and it looked great!  Alena's photo of Chris is 
really good.  She has quite the eye.  And Chris's photo of the kitties looks 
like it could be in a kitty calendar.  The photos of Daniel were really good, 
especially that close up.  He really is a handsome baby.  I am going to have 
to get one of those cameras so I can send Chris photos to post of the 
Website.  Maybe we can start the Jones family monthly magazine and publish 
stories, articles, etc.  one a month.  I can be the editor.  Chris can be the 
layout guy.  What do you think of that.  We could require every family member 
to send something in once a month!
