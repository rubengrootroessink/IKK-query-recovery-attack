In response to your email:

1.  The NYMEX did not have Dana Davis down as a user because he just 
completed and signed his application Wednesday evening and the NYMEX received 
the application by Fedex Thursday.  It will take several days for them to 
process his application.  Further, he still needs to attend their training 
session in NY (I hope this coming Wednesday) before he will be able to trade 
online.

2.  As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX 
ACCESS at a time.  I have a call into the NYMEX about this.  We get a 
terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no 
cost.  The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members 
and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease, 
cost free for the first 6 months.  After 6 months any cost associated with 
the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA.  I have a call into 
the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is.

3.  Bruce, per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the 
ability to change operator access to these terminals, changes in the terminal 
operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently 
Mark Haedicke and Kevin Hannon.  Any changes with respect to operators will 
have to be done by full application to the NYMEX, therefore, such process 
should continue to be done through the Legal Department.
