No ISDA for Mitsui Corp.  Below is the link which should enable you view 
access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  You can forward this 
email with the link to any member of your team and they will then have the 
link which will get them access to the database.

Above company has approached us re an ISDA with them, they have also told us 
that they have been negotiating ISDAs with Enron London and Enron Singapore 
for some time.

**************

Laurie/Nony,

I wonder if you can find out for me from the data base, what the status is 
with Mitsui Corp. ISDAs re all Enron companies?  

***************

Alan,

Mitsui Corp has hinted that it doesn't want to have separate ISDAs with 
separate Enron entities.  What is Enron's usual approach to this I wonder.  
Seems to me that from the customer's perspective, this makes sense.  I wonder 
what sort of internal issues this raises though.

**********************

Thanks all.

Jane
