Dear Legal Lady's

I would like to further reinstate my status of favorite Credit Person, I know 
as of late my status had been slipping and I must confess I have no one to 
blame but myself.  I want you to know that after a lot of deep thought and 
pondering of my potential status downgrade, I have resolved myself to pull 
from deep inside and work to maintain my status.  Although my mates in credit 
have provided some strong competition to remove me from favorite credit 
status, I am here to tell you that I am committed 150% to remain as your 
favorite credit person!!!!!

Yours Truly,
Russell


Now, that being said, my commitment is demonstrated by the submittance of the 
Sempra Energy Solutions Credit Worksheet.



Thanks again,
Russell
