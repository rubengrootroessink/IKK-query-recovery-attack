I don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most 
current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been 
gone.  I think Stacy has created  new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has 
revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the 
reps.  I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David 
Forster.  Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP 
issues.
