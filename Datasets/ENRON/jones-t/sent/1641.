Attached is the referenced list.  Please note the following:

James Hardie N.V. is a Netherlands counterparty.  They can enter into swap 
transactions only, no options.  As we expand the product list, we will have 
to note this.
Societe Industrielle de Transports Automobile:  I have them shut down for now 
until I speak to the London office tomorrow about bankruptcy/setoff issues in 
France.
