Someone must be cleaning out their office, because a notice of a 
restructuring from Black Stone Holdings Parnership mysteriously showed up on 
my desk, with no note.  I have no idea if Credit knows about this BECAUSE IT 
IS SO OLD!

The notice dated 4/19/99, says effective 7/1/98, Black Stone Holdings 
Partnership transferred all of its assets and liabilities to Black Stone 
Minerals Company L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership.

Let me know whether or not Credit knew about this already...if not, I'll send 
a copy down to you.  It was my understanding from way back when that they 
were no longer trading under the Blackstone financial master, so this may be 
moot.  If we are trading with them again, we never did get the corporate 
documents on the partnership from them and we may want to use this as an 
excuse to get them.
