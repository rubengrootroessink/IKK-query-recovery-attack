We are trying to locate the following agreements IMMEDIATELY for a RUSH 
project for Louise Kitchen and I understand Mark Holsworth prepared them fro 
the EnronOnline team.  Specifically we are looking for agreements with:

Agency.com
Octopi?
D'arcy, Masius, Benton & Bowles USA, Inc.  We have a copy of this signed by 
the counterparty, but not fully executed by Enron Corp.  If you have a fully 
executed copy in your files we would love to get one.  Otherwise, I have a 
xerox of the copy signed by them and we could send it up to you to get it 
signed by Enron Corp.

Much thanks for your help!
