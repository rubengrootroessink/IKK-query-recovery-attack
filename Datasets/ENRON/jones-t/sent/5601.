Here are the documents for Prebon and the order of what happened:

1. Tana sends to Prebon



2. Mark Greenberg incorporated Prebon questions into our LOI





3. Mike Bridges deletes one sentence and forwards to Prebon






4. Mike Bridges eliminates red lines of #3 above and sends for Prebon 
signature (we should receive this document with a signature).





Lets just make sure that #4 comes back and that it is consistent with #2 with 
the only difference being the elimination of the last sentence in paragraph 2.
