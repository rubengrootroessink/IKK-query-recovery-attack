If you were responding to this note earlier, Marilyn was asking if you wanted 
to receive copies of all the documentation.  If so, please provide your 
location.

Hi Tana - 
Cheryl Johnson has the document copies and will send you one. She is going to 
start distributing copies as she updates the system instead of waiting for 
the report sendout. If you want to be on the list, send her an email to be 
added.  Marilyn

I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to 
First Energy Trading Services Inc.  I do not have any documentation 
reflecting this merger.  Do you?
