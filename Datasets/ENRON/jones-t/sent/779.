Pan Canadian Energy Services has the following request:

For all EOL traded deals they do not want to recieve the Annex A that is 
attached to our Omnibus-EOL templates.  They claim that since they have 
already signed off on the GTC in order to trade on EOL, then they do not want 
to repeat any work and have to review an additional GTC when we send them a 
Confirmation.  Is it possible to exclude any Annex A (GTC) when we send an 
Omnibus Confirmation for trades done on EOL?

Legal contact @ PanCanadian is Rick Tucker @ 713-331-5049

Thanks,
Joe
