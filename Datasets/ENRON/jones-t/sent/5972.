Things are looking better.  We tracked down the documents and it appears that 
Samantha sent them to counterparty's outside counsel on 3/15/01.  I just 
spoke to Maureen Donley-Hoopes at outside counsel and asked her to fax me the 
signature pages of the ISDA and counterparty's guaranty to me ASAP.  Once we 
get those Russell will be a happy man and we can send a confirm out under the 
ISDA.  I'll let you know as soon as we get the fax in.
