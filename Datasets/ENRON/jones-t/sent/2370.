A fellow from Western Publishing Company called Anthony Camppos in Global 
Contracts and said something to the effect that that wanted to terminate the 
master with us and trade(s) thereunder.  He referenced Deal No. EK9839.1.  
I'm not sure by this note if the company is being liquidated or just this 
trades, but you might want to give them a call.  Jim McClymont at (308)
