Per the email below, this has been approved.  I had to revise the attached 
copy to fix the header and page break, so use the copy I sent you.  Thanks 
for your help!

Tana:

Please finalize the attached NDA so that we can send to the UK for execution 
as soon as possible.  When we've received an executed copy, we can send to 
Robert Harris at the number set forth below.  (If you have a better process 
in place, go for it.)  We just need to make sure we have a final signed NDA 
by the end of tomorrow in preparation for a Wed. morning meeting in NY.

When we have received an executed copy from Credit 2B, please be sure to let 
David Dupre know.

Thanks,

Leslie
