I could not find Susan's e-mail address in our system (go figure), so I 
thought I would impose on you to forward this message to her, please.  Ed 
Straub of Duke energy called today; they have signed the amendment and he was 
not sure to whom to send the original.  To make things simple I asked that he 
return it to me; I will keep the original and send a copy to Susan for your 
files.

Ed asked that we send to him an electronic copy of the amendment.   Would you 
please process that request?  His e-mail address is: 
"edstraub@duke-energy.com".

Please ask Susan to call me if any questions.  Thanks bunch; and hope you and 
all the ENA staff have a great holiday season!
