I looked in our financial agreement database and ECTRIC does not have a 
master in place with either of those entities.  London Legal sent a draft to 
Credit Lyonnais in March of 1999, but there appears to be no activity under 
that master.  Credit Lyonnais has a master styled "Credit Lyonnais New York 
Branch (AAA Program) with Enron North America, under which we trade interest 
rate, currencies & equities, and Toronto Dominion has master in place with 
Enron North America and one with Enron Gas and Petrochemicals Trading 
Limited, an English corp., and a subsidiary of ECTRIC (however, I do not have 
a copy and do not know if this is a limited purpose master or not), but 
nothing for either of these entities under ECTRIC.  I hope this is helpful.  
Let me know if I can be of further service

Tana / Paul,

 I am trying to check whether or not ECTRIC (US entity) has an ISDA agreement 
in place with Credit Lyonnais and Toronto Dominion (TD) (or Master Swap 
Agreement). 
Justin Boyd from Legal gave me your names as a starting point. We are 
currently negotiating a prepay transaction with Credit Lyonnais and TD and I 
need this information quite urgently 

Could you let me know if you are the right people to ask to?

Thank you for your assistance

Kind regards

Philippe Penet
