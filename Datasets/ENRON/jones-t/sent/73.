As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to 
your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the 
following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from 
time to time).   We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next 
week.   I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light 
of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark 
Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your 
attention.

 One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every 
financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.  
The Houston forms are currently located in a "read-only" directory.  We need 
to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they 
use the form.  Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use 
creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms 
evolve without  approval.

Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is 
when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap 
agreement they approve.  It counts as a form change, not a negotiation 
change, if you make it in every agreement.

Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily 
accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical 
component of the Fishkin Project).

Thanks for your attention to this.
