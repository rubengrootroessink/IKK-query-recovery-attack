Another Division

Mark,

Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a 
division.  My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these 
counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of 
the name.  Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as 
divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.  Do 
you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as 
divisions?  Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss 
divisions?  What to do?

CP/ID 94330, Cargill Ferrous International

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Best Rgds.

Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name?

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Samuel

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Any GCP adjustments will be highlighted in red.

Attn. GCP_London:
There's a new EOL Counterparty listed in the UK. Please respond.
