Steve, I don't know if we are duplicating your effort, but our ECT lawyers 
here were also concerned about business review of these product descriptions, 
so they have forwarded these descriptions on to their respective business 
groups for approval.  If we are duplicating your work, or doing something 
contrary to what we should be doing, please call me or Jeff and we will try 
to coordinate our responses.  Otherwise, we will continue the review we are 
doing.

Tana, Steven,  here are the last three descriptions



Steven I have a special favour to ask.  All the descriptions were written by 
the commercial groups and they are a bit scanty on regulatory in places.
The following descriptions need some attention which I would appreciate if 
someone from your dept could give. 

LPG  This is missing a complete section.  Is it possible to insert a couple 
of paragraphs here.
US Nat Gas A have written this anfroma alot of material I got fromt he 
group.  However I still feel the reg section is more of a historical 
recounter than a statement of the current environment.  The last paragraph 
mentions about the reg bodies for LDC's.  Is it possible to add a little bit 
more on the current reg bodies and regulations themselves.

Thanks

Awais

Sorry for the delay.

Here are the next four descriptions.



Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read.

My fax is 44 171 316 5420.

Awais,

I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective 
Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with 
the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?
