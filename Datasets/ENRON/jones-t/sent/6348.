Breakfast at 10:00 sounds great!  Wherever you want to go...also, I need to 
get my bike back from you, I might be doing some biking.  I've been thinking 
about you.  Hope all is going well.

Miss Tana,

Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I
thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available.

I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at
10, or whatever...

Let me know.

Patti
