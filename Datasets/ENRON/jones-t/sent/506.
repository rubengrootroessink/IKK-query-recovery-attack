Yes, I had already approved them for trading without any restrictions.  When 
I got the signed master in, it just meant that the confirmations now took a 
different path.

Something that yall will find helpful... I've been working with the Lotus 
Notes people in upgrading our current Master Swap Agreement database, and 
once its finalized we will be opening view access to anyone who wants it.  I 
am adding drop downs for "approved for online trading", so you will be able 
to confirm our approval, als, contract information which is currently 
provided on a monthly basis will now be available at all times.  I think 
other groups that rely on our contract information, Credit, Settlements, 
Global Contracts, EOL, dealmakers, or anyone else (at ECT or ECT Canada for 
confidentiality purposes) will now be able to be seeing what we're seeing in 
terms of the financial contacts.

I was told my prototype would be done by the end of the week, and then we'll 
have to test it, but hopefully this information will be available soon.  I 
hope this is helpful!
