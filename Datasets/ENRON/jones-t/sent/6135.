Just a note so we are all on the same page... I just had a superseded and 
replaced Enron Corp. guaranty that the counterparty returned to me, and I 
asked Clem to verify what he wanted me to do with the old original guaranty, 
and he said to send it back to him and he would have Cindy mark it 
"canceled".
