I don't know of any such beginnings of an ISDA.  It may have been with the
Fuel's Dept.  Sounds like your Doc person might do better with our
Lawyer--Bill Ernstafht 212 468-6118.

Yet another email.....
Hi Mike!
Our legal/documentations department tells me that we started putting
together an ISDA with NYPA over a year ago, but never completed it.  What
we need prior to any deals being executed is a legal opinion that contracts
are enforcable and statutory authority (I suppose this is compliments of
Orange County).  Can I have our documents person call you...or is someone
else there more appropriate
