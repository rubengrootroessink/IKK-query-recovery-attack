Congratulations on the first bandwith trades!

I understand we have done two trades today with the following bandwidth 
counterparties:

1.  Broadwing Communication Services Inc. - we have a Master Bandwidth 
Purchase and Sale Agreement executed April 27, 2000, effective as of March 
28, 2000.  It has just arrived in the bandwidth Legal Dept. and Marie Heard, 
the paralegal for bandwidth, will be getting the copy down to Global 
Contracts.

2.  The other party appears to be El Paso Energy Communications, and we have 
no master in place with this counterparty, so an online confirm with the GTC 
should be used here.

If you have any other questions let me know, and I'll try and help you or get 
someone who can!
