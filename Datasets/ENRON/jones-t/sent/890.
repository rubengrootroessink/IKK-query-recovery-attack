Mark,

I discussed this issue Friday with Paul, however, since it is an issue I am 
not entirely knowledgeable about, I think Paul should run this by you...

Tana,

As a follow up to Friday's discoveries, on the commodities side, it appears 
as though the agencies which regulate the commodity exchanges drive the rules 
regarding safeguarding of client accounts.  Other than 1) the US exchanges 
(which are all governed by the CFTC), and  2) the OMLX, and the IPE (which we 
have already addressed),  what are the other exchanges whose contracts we 
trade?  

Thanks
Paul
