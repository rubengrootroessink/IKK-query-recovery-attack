Rob:

I understand from speaking with Andy Zipper that he has invited you to submit 
a preferred form of NDA in light of your objections to the "overly broad" 
nature of our NDA.  Andy asked me to follow up with you to touch base and 
find out when we should expect to see an NDA.  

Thanks,

Leslie Hansen
