I confirmed that Powerex Corp. is the new name of British Columbia Power 
Exchange Corp.  Since there was just a name change, Powerex Corp. should have 
the same profile for US physical power as B.C. -- accordingly, Powerex Corp. 
is authorized to trade US West physical power only (NOT EAST power) pursuant 
to the WSPP Agreement.

Please let me know if you have any further questions about this counterparty.
