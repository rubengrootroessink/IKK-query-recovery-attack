Unbeknownst to me, it had been returned to me and was buried under stacks of

Tana:

What's the status of this ETA letter agreement.  I just got an e-mail from 
the Allegheny attorney, and she has apparently not received.  I'll forward 
you her e-mail if you wouldn't mind responding with the status.
