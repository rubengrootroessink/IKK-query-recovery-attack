I got the confirmation that you are signed up for Deriviatives I on Aug. 9 
and 10, so you don't need to worry about it.  I will be taking the class too!

We are trying to track you down an office.  Our floor is completely full 
right now, between permanent people and contract workers, so we're having to 
do some shifting.  They are getting ready to rebuild the floor, maybe build 
some more internal offices or make some smaller, because of the lack of 
space.  Something y'all can relate to there in London!
