Tana,

My cost centre code is 100336.

As to company number, I'm not sure what number you require, or where I can 
find it.  Any assistance you can give would be gratefully received.

Thanks, Edmund

In order to complete your access request, I need your company number and your 
6 digit sap cost center code.
