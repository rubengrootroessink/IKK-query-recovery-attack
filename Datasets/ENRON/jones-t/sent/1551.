Alan & Harry

Since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has 
a product on the pulp & paper website, it is my intention to only send the 
two of you their spreadsheets.  However, it appears the physical side of the 
business (except for power) never says no, so if you prefer, I won't send you 
the list.  It's up to you.  Let me know.

Tana - Attached is the file of customers who have been approved by Tom Moran 
in credit for Clickpaper.  Please review from a Legal standpoint and let us 
know which ones legal approves.

Camille, Jarrod - The file below is in O:/P&P/Clickpaper/PCG .  I think we 
should save these as we receive them back from all checks.  Also, Tom has 
declined TFS but we should have them set up w/ a Global Counterparty ID.  The 
company already set up in GCP as TFS is actually a Singapore company so I do 
not think it is the same one.  Please fax the registration to Mary Gosnell.  
We can then register TFS in Clickpaper w/ a "guest id".  You will also need 
to update Jarrod's daily registration report that he is preparing for the 
traders and check w/ Bob before sending back a "Reject" letter to these that 
Tom has declined - Bob may want to set up a "guest id" for them.

Let me know if you have questions.
Thanks,
Michelle
