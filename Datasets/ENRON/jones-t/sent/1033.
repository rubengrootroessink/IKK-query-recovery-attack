On the 4/25/00 list, Imperial Oil Resources Limited (cpy id 5193) was on the 
original approval list, but I had them as a U.S. counterparty instead of 
Canadian.  Credit now tells me they are Canadian, so I am a little concerned 
that I might have opened them for Credit Derivatives.  So if they are, shut 
them down since Canadian cpys can't do Credit Derivatives.  Of course, all 
counterparties should be shut down for Credit Derivatives now unless Credit 
tells us they are a Credit Derivatives cpy, and then I'll make a 
determination...but you know that...!
