As you requested, to clear up any confusion regarding the responsibilities of 
the paralegals in the financial trading group:

We have four paralegals, myself, Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd and Stephanie 
Panus.  Marie Heard is no longer is our group, she works for Enron 
Broadband.  Below are responsibilities of the paralegals in our group:

Tana Jones:  Primarily all EnronOnline issues.  (1) I am the primary Legal 
contact for counterparty approvals for all Legal Groups.  Individual contract 
problems should be sorted out with the relevant Legal group (i.e. physical 
gas, power, etc.) the same way as they would be resolved offline.  (2) As my 
time allows, I try and help on ISDA negotiations, so if you see a master with 
my name on, feel free to call me.

Day to Day Financial Contract Drafting and Questions:  Can be directed to any 
of Susan, Samantha, or Stephanie.

Copies of Executed Masters:  Call our assistant, Taffy Milligan at x57373, 
she can get you copies.

Merger/Name Changes:  Stephanie Panus

Executed Master List:  Susan Bailey

I hope this straightens things out!
