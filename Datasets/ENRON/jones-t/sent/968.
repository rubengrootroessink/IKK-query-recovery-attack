We do have it signed.  However, the Company's name was not correct in the 
agreement so I spoke to Wayne Greenberg and it said it was okay to go ahead 
and change the name on the C.A. he signed, and I just wanted to get a copy 
back from him initialled by the name change so we have a record of his 
agreement.
