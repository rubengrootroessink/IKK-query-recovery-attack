I left a message for Mike Neves this a.m. to see if we could get together 
this morning to check on things so we can open the database up.  Meanwhile, 
what the confirmation desk could do is forward me an email for them and 
anyone from settlement that may want access to this database.  I am going to 
have to email people the link to get in.
