As a followup:  This guys name is Mykhaylo Koshel and he is an outside 
consultant with the New Concept Group.  I've got a messenger going over to 
Allen Center to pick up a copy of the agreement with them.  I'll get a copy 
to you as soon as I get it.

There is a new contractor for Net Works, Mick Koshel, that we need to track 
down.  Could you see what you can find out and get copies of any Service 
Agreements?  Thanks.

Anne,

 I will revise the Memorandum to conform to Jay's changes.  Jay
mentions a new contractor, Mick Koshel.  Can you find out the details of his
agreement?

Peter
