I think my bicycle is 52 centimeters.  I hope you have a tire pump, because I 
don't and I haven't ridden the bike in about a year and I know the tires are 
totally flat.

Tana Lou,

I am back to bugging you about your bicycle.  Let me know when I can
schedule a test ride.

Patti

Offer still good.  How goes things with the new beau?  Also, thanks for the
cooked meats.  They were delicious!

Morning, Glory,

Hope you are doing well and had a good weekend.

I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still
good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no
big deal.  Promise!

Patti
