At the request of Mark Greenberg, I am forwarding to you the proposed 
Non-Disclosure Agreement between Pricewaterhouse (for CreditDimensions) and 
Enron Credit Limited.  Mark Greenberg has spoken to the counterparty and made 
a few changes to Pricewaterhouse's form.  If you have any questions about the 
transaction, the business person on the deal is Kim Detiveaux here in 
Houston.  Otherwise, we would appreciate your assistance in getting Richard 
Sage in London to execute this agreement.
