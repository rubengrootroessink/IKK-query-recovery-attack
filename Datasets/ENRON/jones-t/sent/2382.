Peter, I hate to say, but I had the same thought earlier this morning.  Is 
there not one thing we can do in this country without having a lawyer in the 
middle of it.  We've all lost our common sense and direction.

It sure makes for good TV, though!  I sat all last night flipping from news 
station to news station getting their spin on what's going on.  I can't say 
I've ever paid this much attention to a presidential election before.  I've 
been telling everybody your spin on the electoral college and the 3 party 
system.  That was a good thought.

Congratulations.  It is now official.  The media and trial lawyers officially 
govern the United Staes of America.  (I suppose it could be worse.  You could 
live in the Peoples Republic of Canada, or have some appendage to an armbag 
running the show.)
