Pat, remember a few days ago I was trying to track down this Argentina power 
deal with Duke.  You might want to get in touch with Federico.

Mark, FYI, also, I don't know if there are any problems with power out of 
Argentina.

Federico Cerisoli is in discussions with Duke's Argentina office about doing 
a power swap.  Why they need a waiver for this I can not guess since the deal 
will still be between a Duke entity and ECT(since EI does not have a swap 
entity yet).  Is the confidentiality provision so narrow that they cannot 
show the master to affiliates?  Do they want to show it to a non-affiliated 
entity?  Any questions on the structure of the proposed deal can be forwarded 
to Federico.  Let me know if this helps.

Brent,

I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke 
Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from 
us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can 
use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about 
the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI 
because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive 
anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me 
know.  Thanks!
