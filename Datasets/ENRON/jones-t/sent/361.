The mad cow disease must have extended to England's venerable sheep, thus 
causing a lack of worsted wool, hence, no new trousers which, I'm sure, is 
the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some 
time.

The men's fashion news here in the United States says that the current 
fashion in ladies pedal pushers (or knee length trousers) has now extended to 
the gents and is becoming quite the rage.  Fashion trends are quite slow in 
reaching the outbacks here in Texas, but I can see fashionable young swains 
in London and New York showing off their knees and ankles.  Has this trend 
crossed the Atlantic?!  Has Justin bought a pair in red?

We miss our Tim from Texas....stay in touch!
