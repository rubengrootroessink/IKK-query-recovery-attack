Hey guys,

I'm in the process of getting authorized to access files in the O drive, and 
need to confirm which folders are ones that I would need.  The one labeled 
Legal seems appropriate.  Also, I understood from Alan that there is a folder 
with scanned in ISDA Masters that I need.   The thing of it is that I don't 
know what's in any of the folders, so it's hard to figure which ones I should 
get authorized for.

If you guys could help me identify which ones they are, that would be great.

Thanks,

Limor
