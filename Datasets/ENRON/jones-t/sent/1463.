I thought that body looked pretty buff!  I should have known it was you.  So 
you got paid extra for the horse and the body double work!

I was chatting with Chapman yesterday, and he tells me the movie you were in 
is Gladiator.  This is major!  I had no idea you were in the biggest hit of 
the summer, and probably the year.  How will I know which barbarian is you?  
Can we see your face?  Does your horse have special markings so we can tell 
it's you?  I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!

This is quite exciting.  I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for 
you and/or your horse, depending on who gets better reviews?!)...
