I don't think I need new tires, unless I'm surprised.  You might want to buy 
an extra tire in case you get a flat.  I think I loaned Harry my old spare 
tire.  Anytime Saturday is fine...

I have a tire pump, but I could take it to Bikesport and have new ones put
on it and have it checked out.

What do you think?  Could I check it out on Saturday?

I think my bicycle is 52 centimeters.  I hope you have a tire pump, because
I don't and I haven't ridden the bike in about a year and I know the tires
are totally flat.

Tana Lou,

I am back to bugging you about your bicycle.  Let me know when I can
schedule a test ride.

Patti

Offer still good.  How goes things with the new beau?  Also, thanks for the
cooked meats.  They were delicious!

Morning, Glory,

Hope you are doing well and had a good weekend.

I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still
good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no
big deal.  Promise!

Patti
