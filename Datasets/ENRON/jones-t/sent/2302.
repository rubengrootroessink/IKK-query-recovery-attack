For Massachusetts Electric Company and Navajo Tribal Utility Authority:  
you'll notice they want to trade power and we're shutting them down.  Leslie 
has to call the counterparties and talk to them about their power status.  
They're not showing up on the FERC approved lists, so Leslie has to figure 
out how/if they can trade power.
