Tana,

I would appreciate it if you could facilitate this document through the 
required processes.  lelsie just needs to review the changes that London made 
and email her acceptance of the changes to Denis O'Connell in London

Thanks.

Leslie,
Craig Chaney tells me that you have been looking at these documents.
They need to be signed in the UK for tax reasons.
Can you therefore send confirmation to Denis that you are happy with them so 
he can initial them and I will then get them signed.

Many thanks,
Richard
