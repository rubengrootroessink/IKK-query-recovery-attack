I have two Australian counterparties on the referenced list, State 
Electricity Commission of Victoria and Straits Resources Limited, and I 
haven't heard from you, and I need to get that list out.  When you send your 
approval, can you be specific as to whether they are approval for Australian 
products only, or all products.  Thanks!
