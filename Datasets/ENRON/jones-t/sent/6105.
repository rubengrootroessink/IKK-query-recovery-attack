At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   I am not sure if we have the correct legal name 
of your company, so can you please verify that for me.  If you have any 
comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 
345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.
