Justy,

Re: the below, we shouldn't be signing passwords any more for ENA, so I 
wanted to confirm with you that I should only be preparing this resolution 
for EOL...?

These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the 
directors of the Company for signature and timing will depend on their 
availability for signature.  If Amita wants to start signing today, she can 
go ahead and start signing now and I'll make her appointment effective as of 
today.

Hi Tana

Thanks for quick response.

I'm happy for the unanimous consents of the directors and the 
attorneys-in-fact.  Please could you let me know when these have been signed 
and are effective.

Thanks for your help.

Regards
