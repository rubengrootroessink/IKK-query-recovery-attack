Attached is my proposed form of Guaranty to cover the US & UK business with 
Paribas.  Tanya, please note, per our discussion I have increased the 
guaranty amount to $50mm.  We have also added ECTRL to the Guaranty.

Please let me know if it meets with your approval and I will forward it to 
Paribas in NY.
