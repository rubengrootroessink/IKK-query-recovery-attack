Tana:

This is what I found.

5 - 5 drawer 67" high - 30 wide - Price $493.89 each - - - Total $2,469.45; 
and

5 - 5 drawer 67" high - 36 wide - Price $533.40 each - - - Total $2,667.00.

The 5 drawer 67x36 are not available in stock, delivery date will be June 
21st.  I'm still checking on the 2-drawers.  There are different sizes on the 
2-drawers, 30, 36 and 42" wide.  High is 28 3/8".
