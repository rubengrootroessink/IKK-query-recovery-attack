I can go either way on this.  I have a nice backyard but no barbecue and not 
enough tables.  But it sounded like you might prefer not to host, and I don't 
mind, I just am not setup to do a big group.  I used to have a nice folding 
table but it was stolen out of my garage.  If you host it I would be happy to 
help out, bring nice flowers, do the dishes, make the pepper dip...!
