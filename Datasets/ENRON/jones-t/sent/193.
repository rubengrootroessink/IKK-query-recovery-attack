Peter,

We revised the incumbency certificates for our U.S. master swap agreements to 
include the authority of the officer as well as the officer's incumbency.

I made the same changes to the Canadian form, but don't want to make any 
final changes to the Canadian form without your approval.  When you get a 
minute can you take a look at it and see if the change meets with your 
approval.

Nella, I am enclosing the current form of certificate as well as the revised 
one (which is #1 documents below).  Can you print them out for Peter.

Thanks!
