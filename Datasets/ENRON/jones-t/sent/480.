I checked our records and we do not have any Master Swap Agreement with 
either K&N Marketing or Kinder Morgan.  Perhaps Credit knows something about 
this.  In addition, we cannot approve any merger documents until we get 
copies of the merger documents filed with the relevant Secretary of State.  
Marilyn Colbert usually provides them to us.
