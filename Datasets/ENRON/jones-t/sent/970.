I have not received any feedback from Edmund or David regarding the email 
below.  Can you please respond as I am getting daily prompts for a response.  
MUCH THANKS!

For Matt, your email stated that you trade over the IPE & NYMEX.  What rules, 
besides the rules of those two exchanges, might apply to any on or off 
exchange trades you might enter into.  For instance, here in the U.S. energy 
commodity trades might be governed by the CFTC, where out equity options 
might be governed by the SEC.  Besides the exchanges your email reflected, 
what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might 
enter into?

Subject: Need Information for Audit

In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin 
funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of 
all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the 
products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any 
rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should 
include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy 
commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.

Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.  
Much thanks!
