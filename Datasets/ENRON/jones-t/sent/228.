Re:  Enron Corp.

 We have received a letter agreement from Bank of America setting forth the 
terms of the referenced merger as they relate to our ISDA Master Agreements 
currently in place with Enron Corp. and each of  Bank of America and 
NationsBank.  Credit and Legal have agreed to the terms set forth therein.
 
1. On July 5, 1999, NationsBank, N.A. ("NationsBank") changed its name to 
Bank of America, N.A.
2. On July 23, 1999, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association 
("BofA") merged with Bank of America,  N.A. and the surviving bank is named 
Bank of America, National Association.

Effective July 23, 1999, as a result of the merger, the following will 
occurr:  

1. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 8, 1995,  between Enron Corp. 
and  and NationsBank, N.A.  will remain in place.  Bank of America, National 
Association as successor by merger, shall be our counterparty.

2. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 4, 1994 and effective as of 
August 14, 1992,  between Enron Corp. and Bank of America National Savings 
and Trust Association  is terminated.  Any existing trades under this 
agreement shall be transferred to the ISDA  Agreement under number 1 above.

 A copy of the letter agreement will be distributed.
