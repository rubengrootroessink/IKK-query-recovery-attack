Hello Bob
Yes that's right - although it should all be done now, although I had a call 
saying they hadn't received the doc , although I did courier it round.
Unfortunately I am having to work from home today because of flooding in 
south of England - so I can't check the file - but will do so as soon as I 
get back to the office

Subject: GFI Non disclosure

I am working with Andy Zipper on the Broker Client application.  I talked to 
Colin Hefron at GFI and his attorney is apparently working with you on the 
Non Disclosure Agreement.  Please let me know the status so that I can move 
forward on discussions with GFI.  My number is 713 853-0397.
