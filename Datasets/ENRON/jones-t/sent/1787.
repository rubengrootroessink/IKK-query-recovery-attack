Melissa,

We've got a counterparty with a draft of a master where the counterparty has 
the rounding conventing for kilowatts at 6 decimal points.  Is that our 
standard convention?  Thanks for your help!

P.S.  I have passed your request for a copy of that assignment to my 
assistant Taffy Milligan.  She can get you copies of any documents in the 
future.
