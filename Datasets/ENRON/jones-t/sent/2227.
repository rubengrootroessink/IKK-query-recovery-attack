Euromoney stopped doing their great seminar a few years back.  We have not 
yet found any other seminar that equals it.  I'll keep my eyes posted, 
though.

Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered 
in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane 
McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that 
Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. 

Please advise. Thanks.
