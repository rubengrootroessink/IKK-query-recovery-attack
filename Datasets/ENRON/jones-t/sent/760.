Team,

It has been brought to my attention that a worksheet for the above referenced 
might not have sent in the first place.  So, I am attaching a worksheet, and 
as usual, if you have any questions, please call me.  I will more than happy 
to receive and if necessary, RETURN your call.

Thanks,

John
