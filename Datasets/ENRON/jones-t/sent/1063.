Taffy,

Can you take care of faxing him a copy of the ISDA and guarantees ASAP.  
Thanks!

I am looking for the ISDA Schedule, Paragraph 11 to the Credit Support Annex 
and the Enron and Kellog guarantees.  If at all possible, it would be ideal 
if you could e-mail me the execution versions of these docs.  Alternatively, 
please fax them (my fax no. is +44 20 7783 4539).

Many thanks for your help.

Regards

Deepak

The Kellogg ISDA Agreement has been signed, but it is somewhat long.  Would 
you like me to fax it to you (if so, what is your fax no.?) or would you like 
me to fedex it to you?
