I was a little dismayed after our lunch when you disclosed the number of 
broadband masters potentially close to signature. However, I was a little 
cheered up when I got back and checked with the Swap Group and found out we 
have 13 masters out for signatures right now.  It still may be hard to beat 
you at your going rate...but, all I have to say is we're still in the 
game...GO TEAM!!!
