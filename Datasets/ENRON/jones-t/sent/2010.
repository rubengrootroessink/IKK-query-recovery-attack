Per an email from Soma yesterday, Brian Hull wanted to transact out of their 
Toronto Branch, so I used their Toronto address in the agreement.  We do not 
have "transactions numbers" on our ISDA's.  I would take it if things proceed 
today, that we will date the agreement as of today, so the date of the 
agreement will be the only identifying information.  Toronto-Dominion will 
need to look at the notice information I put in the agreement and confirm 
that it is acceptable.  I pulled it from a recent agreeement they sent us.

Thanks

As per my voicemail, attached are the officer's certificates we will require.

Do you know what address TD Bank will be using on the ISDAs?  (presumably 
their Calgary Main Branch)  also, are there transaction numbers for each of 
the ISDAs yet so that we can fill in the blanks on the certificate and 
opinions (RE ISDA Agreement Master No. ?)

Thanks

Kevin
