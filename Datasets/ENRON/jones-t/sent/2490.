Tana,
I sent the CDA to our legal team and they had a few changes to make. Can
you make these changes and send it back?

Regards,
Dune

Dune, I've reviewed the NDA and all of their changes are acceptable, except:

--  The additions to the two sentences in Section 1 don't make sense as
written, so should be restated as follows:
Any written Confidential Information will be clearly labeled "Confidential
Information" or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential
Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party
to be confidential.  Any Confidential Information transmitted orally will be
clearly identified as such by the Party disclosing such information at the
time it is disclosed or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential
Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party
to be confidential.

--  We can't agree to the new language in Section 10.

Feel free to forward my comments to Enron if you would like.  I would have
revised the CDA accordingly, but they use a different redlining system than we
do.

Thanks.
