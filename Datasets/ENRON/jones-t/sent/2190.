We do not have an ISDA master in place with this cpy, however,  Susan Bailey 
and Sara Shackleton did send them a draft in August.  I would think unless 
ECTRIC is going to be a direct cpy to a master, Craig Young should contact 
Susan and Sara directly...?

My contact (hedging guy) talked to their steel purchasing guys who said that 
this is more of the type of thing that they are looking for (i.e. vs. scrap 
index from Nucor).  I am scheduled to see them on Tues Oct 31, the earliest 
date that we could meet.  Looks promising for now.
