I tracked down the culprit who worked on this master and it was Mark Taylor.  
I know he called Jon McKay and had a conversation with him about it and is 
looking at the master for particular issues in response to his conversation 
with Jon.

Tana,

I have a favour - Jon McKay of our office is wondering if you have any record 
of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction 
dealing with "credit sleeving"?

All we have here is a copy of an ISDA with them - not what he's looking for.

Thanks
Linda
