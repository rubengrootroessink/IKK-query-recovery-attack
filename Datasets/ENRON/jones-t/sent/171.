Per the memo below, we are looking for European and Canadian corporate search 
companies, and it occurred to me that you may already have someone you use.  
Do you have any recommendations?  Thanks for your help!

Global counterparty is trying to locate online corporate search companies 
that can check company names in Europe and Canada.  In the U.S. we can access 
this information via Westmate in Westlaw.  Are either of you aware of any 
online search company, or can you direct me to someone who may be aware of an 
online search company, for Canada and Europe?  If there are no online search 
companies available, is there a reasonably priced corporate search company 
that can verify this information for us?

I appreciate your help.
