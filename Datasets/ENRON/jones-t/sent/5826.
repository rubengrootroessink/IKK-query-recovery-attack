Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Note the outright margin 
level required for the February and March 2001 contracts, the April 2001 
contract, and all subsequent contracts differ.  Spreading between differently 
margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than between equally 
margined contracts.  Below are provided three spread scenarios where the legs 
of the spread are margined differently.

Scenario One
A spread consisting of one leg in either the February 2001 or March 2001 
contracts and another in the April 2001 contract will have its requirement 
(at the clearing member rates) calculated at $8,500 starting on Friday, 
January 19, 2001.

Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG (1 x $12,000) =    $12,000
One Short April 2001 NG   (1 x $6,000) =-   $6,000
Net Scan Risk    ($12,000-$6,000)=    $6,000
Spread Rate    (1x $2,500) =+   $2,500
Total Requirement     =    $8,500

Scenario Two
A spread consisting of one leg in either the February 2001 or March 2001 
contracts and another in any month following the April 2001 contract will 
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $9,500 
starting on Friday, January 19, 2001.

Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG (1 x $12,000) = $12,000
One Short May 2001 - January 2004 NG (1 x $5,000) =      -$5,000
Net Scan Risk    ($12,000-$5,000)= $7,000
Spread Rate    (1x $2,500) =      +$2,500
Total Requirement    =        $  9,500
Scenario Three
A spread consisting of one leg in the April 2001 contract and another in any 
month following the April 2001 contract will have its requirement (at the 
clearing member rates) calculated at $3,500 starting on Friday, January 19, 
2001.
Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long April 2001 NG          (1 x $6,000)    =        $  6,000
One Short May 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  5,000
Net Scan Risk                         ($6,000-$5,000)  =        $  1,000
Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
Total Requirement                                 =        $  3,500
