Are we missing any Japanese counterparties?

Dear Tana,

Since we last discussed the above, I think I have only formally approved one 
Japanese counterparty.  I am a bit concerned that something may be slipping 
through the system.  Alternatively, no companies other than those on the 
initial list have applied for passwords.  The metals people here came to see 
me about one company recently but I have not been asked for approval re that 
company formally yet.

Thanks.
