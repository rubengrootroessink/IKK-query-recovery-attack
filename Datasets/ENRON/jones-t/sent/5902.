Mike,

I attempted to give Edmund Manager access by doing one of those security 
requests today.  I don't know if you need to do anything or not here....

Dear Michael,

Following our conversation the other day I have spoken with Tana about 
allowing me delete capabilities on the database.  Tana has kindly consented 
to this so hopefully she has confirmed/will confirm this so that the 
necessary technological changes can be made from your end.

Many thanks, Edmund
