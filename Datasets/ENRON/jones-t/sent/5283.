Shawna and I are both sitting here so excited to get your note.  Are we 
available?  For Chapman?  Of course!!!  Shawna's answer is...both nights, 
many festive drinks!  We are only limited by the thought of choosing just one 
night over the other!  If we have to, we will.  We leave the choice to you, 
because we are available either night...

Guess where I am on Tuesday and Wednesday next week - any chance of getting 
together for a festive drink or even a festive coffee ???

Yours in eager anticipation

Jon
