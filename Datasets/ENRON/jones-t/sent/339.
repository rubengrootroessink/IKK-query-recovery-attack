Subject: MAC as an Additional Event of Default

John: Thanks for taking the time to read the email. I have not had many=20
responses!

There are two reasons why I drafted the clause in this way.=20

1) It tracks the "cure" modification clause for Credit Event Upon Merger (a=
nd=20
I think the cures for both clauses need to be consistent).

2) The wording is useful because it describes what the written demand is=20
asking for - i.e. "performance assurance".=20

Maybe there is a more elegant way of expressing #2 - maybe we just use "for=
"=20
rather than "therefor". I was not the original drafter of the CEUM provisio=
n=20
so I don't know why it was written this way but in any event, the concept o=
f=20
#2 needs to remain in clause in some fashion.=20

I will be out of the office from 9/22 to 10/3. Mark Taylor will be handling=
=20
matters in my absence so I will forward this onto him to decide.

Thanks,
=20

Subject: MAC as an Addtional Event of Default

I just got around to reading the e-mail Shari sent us last week regarding t=
he=20
new MAC language, and had a quick point on the MAC paragraph.  The last=20
sentence doesn't seem to read quite right.  I copied the paragraph below,=
=20
highlighted the area and thought you might want to take a look at it before=
=20
it goes into any contracts.  Does "therefor" belong in there?

(ix) The occurrence of a Material Adverse Change (as hereinafter defined)=
=20
with respect to Party A or Party B.  "Material Adverse Change" means, (a)=
=20
with respect to Party A, its Credit Support Provider=01,s Credit Rating is =
rated=20
below "BBB" by S&P; or (b) with respect to Party B, [insert as appropriate]=
,=20
provided, however, that the foregoing occurrence shall not constitute an=20
Event of Default so long as in connection with or after such action or even=
t,=20
the party experiencing the Material Adverse Change (=01&X=018) provides (or=
 causes=20
to be provided) to the other party (=01&Y=018) within two Local Business Da=

=20
to Y in its sole discretion.
