Tana, I have prepared a subset index from the larger one you prepared. This 
subset index will be attached as an exhibit to the due diligence memo that we 
are working on with Peter Mims. The subset index includes only those 
agreements that we deemed relevant to our due diligence review and does not 
include content licenses or posting agreements.  Could you please prepare a 
separate list that has only the content licenses in it?   Tthanks.  If you 
have any questions, please give me a call.
