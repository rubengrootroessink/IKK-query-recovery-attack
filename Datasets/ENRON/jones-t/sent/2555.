FYI, 

Bill Bradford in Credit had a conference call today with the Deutsche Bank 
Credit person and I think we have come to agreement on not adding any 
specified entities to the ISDA Master Agreement.  He also discussed  proposed 
credit limits for the three other Deutsche Bank masters we want to get in 
place (including EnronCredit.com).  I think we are done now and hope to get 
execution documents from them, since the documents are on their system.  Our 
intention is to then get Deutsche Bank to turn around 3 like masters, making 
any changes necessitated by change of law, and otherwise turn around the 
remaining masters quickly.  I'll keep you posted.

If you do add all the entities, does that mean that we would not need to put 
in place a separate agreement for ECCL?

With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as 
Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat 
hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured 
loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill 
Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this 
remaining issue.

With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was 
so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was 
sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan 
Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.

Tana - can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations 
of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity 
you are negotiating on behalf of.

Tks,
