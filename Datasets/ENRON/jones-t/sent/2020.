Per,

What's the deal he's talking about?  I also do not think we could put ENA and 
Enron Metals Ltd. trades under the same master.  When you have a mingute give 
me a ring.

We were advised that a swap document is in the works through Per Sekse Enron 
New York. We would like this document to cover all products and Enron Metals 
Ltd. ---not just North America.

My guess--- we trade with most of Per Sekse funds and this issue should be 
clarified
