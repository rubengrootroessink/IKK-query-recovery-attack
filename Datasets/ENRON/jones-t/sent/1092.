Nancy,

Below are the recipes for the party.  The only commitment I have so far is 
for the meat dish, so everything else is up for grabs.  Let me know which one 
you are making.

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church
2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet.
3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray 
apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is 
"Ashby", make a right on Ashby.
4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 
1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the 
back yard.

My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look 
forward to seeing you there!

Hi everyone:

I've attached the recipes for the May 13th Church Gourmet Dinner.  They are in
Word, but please let me know if you have problems with the attachments.  I can
convert them or fax them to you.  I have made notes on the recipes regarding
the advisability of doubling some of them for a party of more than 8 guests.

At the bottom of this email, you can still review Alicia's original
instructions and comments about the parties (and the guest lists as they stand
now).

My only thoughts about dividing up the recipes among your guests are:

1.  Remind everyone to bring a bottle of wine for the group.

2.  The dessert recipe should perhaps not be given to a single male as it
requires a springform pan (an item I'm guessing is not common to most bachelor
kitchens).

3.  The person(s) to bring the soup should also bring bread.

4.  Remind the people doing the main course to do a mixture of pork & chicken.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Penny
