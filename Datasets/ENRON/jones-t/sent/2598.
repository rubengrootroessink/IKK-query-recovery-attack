ENA does not have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  Enron Canada does have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation.  Could the trades be done under that master?

Also, below is an agent that should connect you to the Financial Trading 
Agreement database, where you can look up what master agreements we have in 
place.

Tana,

Can you let me know if ENA has an ISDA signed with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  I am looking at doing a financial swap against the Ontario IMO spot 
price with PG&E and was wondering if it could be done under and existing ISDA 
between PG&E and ENA with a C$ confirmation (exactly like the proposed 
Southern transaction).

Please contact Chris or myself with any questions.

thanx,


Jan Wilson
