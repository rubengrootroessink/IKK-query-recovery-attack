I left Bill Ernstaft a message.  Hopefully I'll hear back from him after 
lunch.

Janelle:  My Law people tell me we'll want to use the "Multi-Currency, Cross
Border" ISDA with the NYPA version of the Confirmation (that I sent to you).
In addition, they want New York law to govern not Texas law.  Re the
guaranty,  we want to send you our draft on that account for your review and
will do so this PM. Can Enron accommodate all this? Thanks, MIKE.

Hi Mike!
A parent guaranty is no problem.  I'm attaching a copy, so you know what it
looks like.
We have a standard "long form" confirm ourselves, that is used until an
ISDA is signed.  I attached a draft below so you could see it as well.
We typically send these standard confirms to all our customers, so it may
expedite things if NYPA doesn't have any aversion to this confirm.  What
are your typical procedures? Would you accept our confirm, or should I go
head and get our documentation people to get started looking over yours?
Was the annual report on the web site sufficient, or would you like me to
Fed-Ex one? Let me know what else can do.
Janelle
