Louis Fernandez was wonderful to work with.  His work was top notch, his 
subcontractors did a great job.  For instance, I put in central air and one 
of the old window units we took out was in the brick in  front of my house.  
I thought when the brick got repaired I would  have this mismatched brick box 
they would look ugly from the front.  Louis's brick guy was so good that you 
cannot even tell the brick was repaired.  Also, his sheetrock guy did a 
wonderful job.  You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.

Louis is also a good businessman.  He gives you a weekly bill spelling out 
the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing 
any supplies he was billing you for.  A lot of contractors are not good 
businessmen.  I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a 
job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the 
cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a 
lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his 
additional time or money on.  

To sum it up, I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you 
pay.
