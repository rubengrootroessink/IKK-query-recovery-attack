Mike,

Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now 
gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.  Is there some way for 
us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?  He is a 
lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the 
information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting 
him security access.  Can we get him access?

Tana:  Can Jason gain access to the database for the purpose of 
entering/reviewing comments?  Sara
