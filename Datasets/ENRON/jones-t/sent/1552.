Per my conversation with Frank, Utilicorp. was originally shut down for 
financial because it was on the original "utility" list, when we shut down 
all the utilities for financial until we did the due diligence.  Since then, 
we are opening the utilities up, so long as they are not governmental 
utilities.

Second, we have since got an ISDA master in place with Utilicorp. (and moved 
the Aquila trades under it).

Based on the above, I am opening up Utilcorp. for all financial products.
