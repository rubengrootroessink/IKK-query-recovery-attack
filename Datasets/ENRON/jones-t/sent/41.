Brent,

I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke 
Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from 
us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can 
use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about 
the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI 
because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive 
anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me 
know.  Thanks!
