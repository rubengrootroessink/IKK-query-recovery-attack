Savita,
The CA is fine.  Do you want me to sign the non-letterhead version and
forward to you, or would you prefer to telefax a signed letterhead version,
have me sign it, and fax it back?  Please let me know.  Thank you.
Marc

Hi Marc,

Tana Jones from our legal department  just called me and said that before I
sent Wesley Fredricks information over to her, Andrew O Connor returned her
phone call and is now expecting the document from us. You may receive an
email from her to try to sort this out. Thanks a lot.

Savita
