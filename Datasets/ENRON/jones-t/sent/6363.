Please plan on attending our next Credit/Legal seminar.  This seminar will be 
held Wednesday, May 23rd, from 2:00 - 3:30 p.m. in EB49c4 and will be a 
continuation of our discussions of the ISDA Master Agreement.  The topic for 
this session will be to first finish the last few items on the Credit Support 
Annex, then discuss the Credit Worksheet and High Risk Counterparties.  
Refreshments will be provided.  Please e-mail Becky Spencer, if you are 
unable to attend.
