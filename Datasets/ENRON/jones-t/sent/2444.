Subject: Out of Office Reminder

I will be out of the office Wednesday morning November 15, 2000, for a brief 
appointment.  If you require assistance with an EOL or ClickPaper-related 
contracts matter during that time, then you may contact Stacey Richardson.  
If I am out of the office and you are unable to reach Stacey, then please 
contact Linda Bryan.
