It was good to hear from you!

We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.  It's funny, because usually it's just 
me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or 
roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same 
joy in cooking it would be elsewise.

It was good having the girls down.  We played a new version of Uno called 
"African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging.  
It's not for the meek.  It was incredible what a good player Alena was.  She 
had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see 
why you can know everyone elses hands!).

I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.  I 
think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.  Then, also, 
he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going 
to fit baby stuff.  They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed 
his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small 
apartment.  So he's going to have to start looking for another place.  And 
his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over 
the baby.

I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the 
new baby.  You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.  The upstairs 
"guest suite" is pretty neat.  It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is 
pretty cozy.

As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I 
couldn't tell by his voice.  It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of 
us.  But, I guess, it's a start...

I've already made my XMAS plans.  I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight 
comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.  

It's good chatting with you.  Keep in touch!

Tana,

I don't understand, what do you mean by "log in an email"?

Anyway, I got you message, and I got the World Series thing (although I had
already received

Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving, I can testify that it was
one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I've ever had (I not gonna tell them 
that,
I don't want them getting swell heads).

Ma said she had a great time in Houston, She was happy to see yourself, as 
well
as C & D.  I think she likes her special room in your house.

Your gonna be the first to see the new baby (woudn't it be wierd if the baby
gets botn on Jan 5th?)

Why didn't Craig show Ma his appartment?

What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben (he was almost
shocked)?

Are you coming for Xmas?

Gotta go for now.

Love ya.

Kyle
