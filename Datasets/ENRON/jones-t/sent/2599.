I haven't done anything.  I was waiting for you to get back in to discuss 
this...

Tana:

Please let me know if you did anything with this or I will assign.  Since you 
were copied, I didn't know if you had a conversation with Tanya or Soma.  
Thanks.  Sara

I have attached a credit worksheet per Sara's request in order to amend the B 
of A master.  My understanding is that we intend to only amend the existing 
document for holding and use of collateral so that we may be able to 
rehypothecate collateral.  I have tried to construct the worksheet terms such 
that they reflect what is in the current document, but the old document terms 
should govern in the case of a discrepancy.  I will be out tomorrow, so 
please contact Bill with questions.

Thanks,
Tanya
