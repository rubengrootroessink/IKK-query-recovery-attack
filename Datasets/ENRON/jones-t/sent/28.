Just wanted to check on how the financials are going.  My goal is to get 
everything ready no later than the first week of June so I can problem solve 
before I have to file by June 11th.  When the financials are ready I need to 
get them certified by the highest accounting officer.  Last year that was 
Drew Lynch who signed as Vice President, Business Analysis and Reporting.  
Will he be signing again?
