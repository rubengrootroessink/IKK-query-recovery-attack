Per the email below, do you have any other legal advice with respect to 
trading issues we should address with Mexican counsel when we send out the 
updates below.  Please let me know ASAP, we hope to get our letter out Monday.

I believe we did the initial survey in 1996-97 in Mexico (Sara and I worked 
on it together), cobering financial and physical trading. I don't know if 
there have been any updates since that time. You should check with Steve Van 
Hooser, Sara Shackleton and Peggy Banczak. I do not have any issues to add to 
the original survey.

We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the 
online trading issue.  I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going 
to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original 
advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for 
advice?
