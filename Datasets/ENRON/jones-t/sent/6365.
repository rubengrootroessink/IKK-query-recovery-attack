Tana -

Did you have a chance to get to this yet?  I had an e-mail from Loudcloud

Tana -

Attached are the comments Loudcloud submitted to the NDA.  With the exception 
of the deletion of the arbitration provisions, the changes are acceptable and 
should be incorporated into a final agreement.  I have agreed to the 3 year 
term in exchange for the arbitration provisions.

Please let me know if you should have any questions.

Thanks.

Kate -

Thanks for the comments to the NDA.  All are acceptable except -

Paragraph 5 - Deletion of arbitration.

Paragraph 9 - Change from two years to three years.

Please advise if Loudcloud can live with arbitration and 2 years.  If not, 
please advise why not.

Thanks.

Mark,

I have recently received the NDA with Enron Networks and have attached a
blacklined copy which indicates my requested changes.

Please let me know if the attached is acceptable or if you have any
questions.  I look forward to receiving your reply shortly.

Regards,
