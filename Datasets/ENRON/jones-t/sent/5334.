I just got a call from Deutsche Bank a minute ago, and they got approval from 
Frankfurt and are overnighting the agreement to me for signature.  I'll keep 
you posted...

The wheels of DeutscheBank turn very slowly.  It appears their Credit guy 
didn't communicate our agreement regarding Specified Entities to his legal 
team, so Sara Shackleton said they are confirming that information before 
they send a revised draft.  Further, he said all changes have to be sent to 
Germany first for approval, so now we need to wait on Germany...!

We do have a Credit Support Annex in place.  Once we sign the ENA
agreement, we will make your requests to DB.

Tana,

Thanks for keeping us updated on the Deutsche negotiations.  If, as you
suggest, Deutsche can prepare a Master for the EnronCredit.com Limited
Master as the docs are on their system then this would be useful, and I
will
review and comment on those.  The one thing they will need to ensure as you
mentioned is that the Master Agreement is governed by English law.  In
addition, I  am not sure if you have put a CSA in place with Deutsche, but
if you have (presumably a Paragraph 13 under the NY law CSA?) we would need
the corresponding Paragraph 11 to the English Law CSA.

Many thanks again and we look forward to progressing this matter.

Kind regards,

Clare
