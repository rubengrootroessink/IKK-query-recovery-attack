Do you have the address for the counterparty?

Tana:

Can you please mail back an NDA with the following information within it:

Prospect: 
CMS Energy Marketing Services and Trading (Legal name)

Topic:
Using Enron's back office services to process their energy deal transactions.


This has nothing to do with EnronOnline.  Please do not include EnronOnline 
terminology in the NDA, as it will only delay this effort.  Thanks in advance 
for your timely response.
