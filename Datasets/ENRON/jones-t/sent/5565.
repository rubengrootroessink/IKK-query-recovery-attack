Attached is a revised NDA.  Please note, Mark Taylor changed your new 
language a bit.

Tana,

Thanks for your help.  We will hold off on sending one to Continental at this 
time.  Please have a lawyer initial the EGL NDA with the following changes:
? Their legal name is EGL, Inc.
? Remove EnronOnline
? Replace EnronOnline with more ambiguous terminology, should we choose to 
put the product on "a different platform or product or service offered by 
ENW."

I'd like to get this signed and sent out today.

Thanks,

Fred

Hi Tana,

This email is in response to my earlier voice mail regarding two NDAs to be 
sent out today.  Here's what I think may be the pertinent information:

Continental Airlines - Cargo
1600 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002
United States 
Attn:  Mr. Ed O'Meara


Eagle Global Logistics
15350 Vickery Dr
Houston, TX 77032
Attn:  Mr. Stephen J. Carattini

Content might say something about not mentioning any details about talking to 
Enron about air cargo commoditization with any other company or to the press, 
etc. until we give them express written permission.  

I'm sure I forgot something relevant.  Just give me a call at 5-9323.
