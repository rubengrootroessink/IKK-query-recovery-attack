Please see the attached spreadsheet with new additions in blue.  A couple of 
Enron entity names changes (Enron Australia Finance Pty limited to Enron

Swap BCI 7 have been renamed from previous UK prefix.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.  Please begin using the attached spreadsheet on
