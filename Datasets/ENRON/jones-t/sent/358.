How was your trip back?  I hear from Taffy you cut quite the figure in your 
cowboy duds, right down to having the right style of Wrangler jeans.  The 
grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin.  The bright lights 
of London must look dim after the shining lights of Houston.   Your visit 
seemed all too short.  We probably won't see you for a few years, but I 
really enjoyed our dinners and chats.

Stay out of trouble and make us proud!
