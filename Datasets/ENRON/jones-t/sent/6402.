Just something I noted as I got in to approve Edison Mission.  West power was 
also in the queue for approval.  We had previously had them approved for all 
power, and Credit had shut them down for power because Credit has been 
worried about their financial condition ala PG&E, but now is willing to open 
them up for all power.  I thought it was OK to open them up for all power 
since we had them open for all power before, but I just wanted to run it by 
you just in case...
