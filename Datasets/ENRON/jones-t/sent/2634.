Attached is the UK form of ISDA Schedule which should have the UK choice of 
law and arbitration language in it.  I send it with a caveat that this draft 
is 2 years old.  The London lawyers were gone by the time I got your call, so 
I couldn't check to see if they have revised this, so by copy of this to Matt 
Dawson, I am asking him to confirm that there is no substantive change in the 
choice of law or arbitration language.
