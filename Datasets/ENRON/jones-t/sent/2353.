Sounds to me like you don't need to worry about opening them up for power...!

Tana:

ANP Power Marketing Company is NOT a current counterparty and is not on my 
list of FERC approved sellers of power.  Thus, this counterparty is NOT 
authorized to trade US power.  (It sure sounds like a power marketer.  They 
are free to call me to discuss if they are FERC approved.)

The above counterparty should be coming on tonight's list.  We would like to 
open them for gas ASAP, and Credit is reviewing the financials now to give 
them some headroom on power.  If you could let me know ASAP whether you have 
any issues.
