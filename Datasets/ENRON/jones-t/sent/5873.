At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of 
Interest.   This LOI has been revised to cover US crude, refined products and 
coal and emissions.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute 
the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then 
have it executed by Enron Net Works.  If you have any comments or questions 
please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or Bob at (713) 
853-0397.
