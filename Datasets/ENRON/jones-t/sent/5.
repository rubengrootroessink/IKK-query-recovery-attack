I sent the UBS Letter to the confirm desk like a week ago, I forget who to, 
maybe  Bernice, since I kinda consider it an audit letter.  My note said the 
confirm desk can sign off on the letter since they were only asking us to 
confirm trade information.

The Teeside Confirm, I spoke to our tax guys this morning and they said they 
were really busy yesterday and hadn't had a chance to look at it...I'll call 
them again.
