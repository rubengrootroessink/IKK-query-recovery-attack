The person we are dealing with is very nice, Stephen Kessler, their lawyer 
out of New York.  He has been very helpful.  We just don't know how long it 
will take it to get processed once it leaves our shop.  Our intention is to 
fedex the ISDA out to Steve tonight.  The Enron Guaranty will take a little 
more time, so at his suggestion we will follow up with that later, so we can 
keep the ISDA moving.

Very bad news.  I'll call DB today and put pressure on the commercial people 
I  know.  Who is the commercial contact in Houston?  And could you please 
list the Enron entities that are expecting to get the ISDA mirrored.

Thanks anyway,

JS

Bad news.  We got the Deutsche Bank documents in and they weren't signed by 
them yet, and none of the supporting documentation was provided.  So, I think 
we are going to be on the longer side of the execution timetable vs. the 
shorter side...
