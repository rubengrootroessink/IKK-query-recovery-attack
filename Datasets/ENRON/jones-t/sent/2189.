There are a number of Argentina counterparties on this list that I will need 
your sign off on.  Brent said he things they will probably be OK to trade 
Argentina Gas, but to run it by you.  Can you let me know if you have any 
issues.

I am going to have to add you to the distribution for my daily lists too.  
Initially, we should have a rush of Argentina counterparties, but after 
awhile, it should dwindle.  The rule is, you have ONE DAY to respond  or I 
will consider you have no legal problems with a counterparty on the list.
