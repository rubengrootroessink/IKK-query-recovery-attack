Please note the following on the 6/5/00 list:

We are shutting down Aquila Risk Management Corporation for all financial 
trading effective today.  All financial trading should be done out of 
Utilicorp United Inc.  This counterparty was on the original approval list, 
and I previously had them shut down for financial trading.  Credit will put 
them on tonight's list, meanwhile, we need to open them up to trade all 
financial immediately.
