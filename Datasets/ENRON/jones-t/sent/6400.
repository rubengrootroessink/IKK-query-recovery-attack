Thanks for the email.  Looks like we're not bad in getting their confirms 
out.  After I hear from Justin I'll give them a call, hopefully tomorrow.

Hi Debbie.  

I left a message for Miriam - but to keep you in the loop - I have researched 
our deals done
with Glencore Commodities Limited for the last four months, finding that 
every deal was faxed
T+1 except two instances where a deal went out T+2, and the three deals from 
last Thursday 
which fax failed on Friday( I've signed and sent them this morning.). 

Also, considering the time difference, ENA may fax out a deal on T+1 after 
Europe
has gone home, so the counterparty will not see the confirm till the morning 
of T+2.  

Glencore should also get themselves set up with back office user access to 
EOL, so they
can peruse their deals while awaiting the confirm.  

I have also sent word to our legal department asking them to look into 
Glencore's
governing law status.  

I'll convey this to Miriam when I speak with her.
Thanks,
Diane

Subject: EOL Trades with Glencore Commodities Limited

Hi,

I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
(from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
issues she has with EOL.

Tel: 44 20 7412 3190

Regards,

Debbie
