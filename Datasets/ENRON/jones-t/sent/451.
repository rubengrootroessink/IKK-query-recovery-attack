Now that the cat is out of the bag I can tell you about the other big project 
I have been working on.  The press releases went out last week.  Mark Taylor 
was also the host of this year's ECT Legal Conference (which takes alot of 
work to put together!), which we just had on Thursday and Friday.  

You may have read in the papers about our new Enron Online, our new web based 
commodity trading system.  You can view it at www.EnronOnline.com.  Mark has 
been the lead attorney on that project which has been an enormous amount of 
work for him.  Besides being Mark's aide-de-camp on EOL generally, I have 
been working on the counterparty approval lists for the financial contracts, 
which has meant going through every counterparty we have to determine whether 
we should approve them for online trading.  As you can imagine, that has 
meant looking at thousands of counterparties, contracts and legal issues and 
trading restrictions.

As far as my "Fishkin" project (as Mark and I call it), I recently went to an 
internal class on Project Management and am redefining my project goals, 
objectives, etc.  We've found a few new software programs we've been looking 
at, some we found out Enron already has.    Mark and I are discussing what 
we've seen, defining and redefining what we want, and hope to finalize our 
thoughts soon.

 Mark and I are currently designing the swap jurisdictional database in a 
Lotus Notes format, and hope this week to get the computer people to design 
the software.  This would be my database of foreign derivative laws, ISDA 
opinions and the like.  We need that up and going desperately.   We, have 
been having to look alot at foreign laws for the online trading project as 
well as general trading questions lately, and it should be a slam dunk to put 
this database together and start loading the information.

So that's been what I've been up to, let me know your thoughts about EOL!

P.S.  Thanks for the article!
