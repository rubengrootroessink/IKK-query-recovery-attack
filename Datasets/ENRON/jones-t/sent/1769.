The wine tasting sounds great!   I haven't been to one in awhile.  It's 
always good to see Hollis too.  Keep me posted...

First,  Scott is having a wine tasting (Australian) this Wednesday at 
Galleria Ruggles.  I don't yet know the cost, but thought one or both of you 
might be interested in coming.  I am going this time, and I think Hollis is 
too.  Might be fun.  It is not a full dinner, just wines and appetizer type 
stuff.

Second;  Mark

Most Fridays I will need to pick up William from after care at school, 
requiring about a 5:30 departure for me.  Scott plans to oridnarily pick up 
every other day of the week.  If I have a big project etc. I will come back 
in with William.  However, I realize you generally want people available 
until 6 each day.  Hopefully, this will not cause too much trouble.  Mary
