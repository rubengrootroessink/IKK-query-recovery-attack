I was just about to call you when I got your email.  Holly called and she has 
a table to fill at an awards banquet (some women's professional group or 
something) and wants to know if you want to join us.  A bunch of her 
girlfriends are going, me, Lucinda, I think Carol....anyway, it's Saturday 
night at 7:00 pm.  She said it should be really boring (so I put it on my 
calendar as "boring awards banquet"), but with all the girls at one table 
we'll misbehave and have fun.  I hope you can join us.  Let me know and I'll 
reserve you a spot w/Holly.

The thing on your house and townhome sounds exciting.  When can I see it?!
