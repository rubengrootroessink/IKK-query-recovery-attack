I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you 
do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as 
you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a 
control measure we're OK.

The notice information looks fine.  I am a Director - don't know about 
signing the docs though...
thanks

Attached is the referenced agreement.  Let me know if the notice information 
is OK with you.  If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring 
it to you for countersignature.  Thinking about that, what's your title?  I'm 
not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority...
