I've got some changes to make to that assignment and then I'm ready to send 
it to them.  Do you have a contact for me to send it to?

Hi Tana, I noticed that the trades that we need to assign from Dynegy Power 
Marketing to Dynegy Marketing and Trade were all November trades.  The 
settlements group will be doing their download tonight for November 
business.  Do you think I can change these trades to the correct name today 
or should I wait until the assignment is fully signed.

Thanks,
Melissa
