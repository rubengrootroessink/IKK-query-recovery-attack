Sharon,

There are some hanky things going on in these confirms I don't like.  I've 
just spoken to Russell and I'm going to talk to a swap attorney and then get 
back to you.

Hey, Tana.  I just faxed you the new credit worksheet - it's totally 
different.

Sharon,

Per the email below, I looked in the financial trading agreement database and 
saw that Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our group prepared an Annex B for 
this counterparty in January of this year.  I would just confirm that the 
credit is the same and then use the same Annex B as before.  I am going to 
fax the credit worksheet that Credit send Stephanie in January so you can 
check the credit.  Below is the Annex B Stephanie prepared.

Sharon,
As Canada is now executing these confirms, please get with Tana, or someone 
in her group, for an explanation of your questions.  Your questions all apply 
to standard procedures that the Legal group in Houston handles.  I did, 
though, make a mistake on Cash Collateral, you are correct there is no cash 
collateral in Canada. Please disregard that 'X' for both counterparty's.  In 
regards to the complete name of Slater Steel, as I explain in the comments of 
the worksheet, a previous transaction was executed with a credit annex 
attached to the confirm.  Once again, Tana or someone in legal, can explain 
to you the database they have that would give you all this information.

Thanks,
Russell

Russell, sorry, I should have reviewed the entire credit sheet before 
e-mailing you earlier, but I have a few more questions:

1. What is the complete name of Slater Steel?
2. Who is their guarantor?
3. What does "NW" before the C$188MM under "Guarantor") mean?
4. Cash Collateral??
5. What are the 3rd Party debt threshold amounts (Events of Default) for each 
of Slater's Guarantor and Enron Corp.?
6. Is Enron Corp.'s MAC debt rating BBB-?
7. Why is the Counterparty "X'd" under the MAC if there is a guarantor?

I think that are all of the questions I have for now.  Please advise.

Please note, however, that I will be away from the office next week.  Please 
forward your comments to Linda Sietzema if you don't get them to me by today.

Thanks,
Sharon
