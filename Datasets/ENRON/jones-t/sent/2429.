Thanks! I think I can meet you on Friday and I did some research and found a

I'll leave you a check tomorrow.  Also, I'm taking Friday afternoon off to
meet the stove repair guy.  Can you meet me there to do house & yard clean
up day?

Hi Tana, did you get the money situation taken care of. Please let me know.
