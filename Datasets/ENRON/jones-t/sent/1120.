Well, actually Tanya, your statement below isn't a truly correct statement.  
We have not consented to the Statoil/J. Aron assignment (in principal yet, in 
actuality, no).  We are off about 19 trades and have sent the Statoil people 
a list of the disputed trades to resolve.  Once we are in agreement about the 
trades, I will add a paragraph to their form of assignment to the effect that 
the assigned trades (be they physical or financial) will go under the 
respective J. Aron master we have in place for that product.  Only then can 
we move the trades...

As we have consented to the assignment of the trades under the Statoil Energy 
Trading ISDA to JAron, could you tell me what the timeline will be for moving 
these transactions in TAGG/ERMS to JAron?

Thanks!
