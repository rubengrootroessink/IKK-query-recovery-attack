The Confirmation I'm wanting is the other form you gave us which under 
General Terms starts with "Notional Quantity per Determination Period". Do 
you have it? Thanks.

Thanks Tana. Do you also have the Confirmation (SWAP) form that said "EOLID"? 
I think that was the form we understood you to say was the "preferred" form. 
Thanks again.

The omnibus swap below, plus this Annex A make up the "omnibus" confirm.

Tana,

Here's a Draft I had in my personal file.  I thought this would be easier 
than deleting the coding from the system template
