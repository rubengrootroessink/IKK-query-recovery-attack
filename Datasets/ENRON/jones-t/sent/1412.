I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the ENA Legal Department, Financial Trading 
Group.  I wasn't put on as a reviewer for Mike Neves, but I wanted to tell 
you what a good job he has been doing for our group.

I am responsible for the databases in our group.  During the past year we 
have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group 
uses.  First, we have had a major upgrade to an existing database, the Master 
Swap Agreement Database (now called the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database).  This upgrade including adding a number of new items within the 
database, as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data 
maintained in the database, so the database could be opened company wide, 
while maintaining the secure legal information.  Second, in response to the 
online trading system, we needed to immediately create a database to keep 
track of the Legal Department's approvals of the online counterparties.  This 
need for this database came on quickly (as has everything associated with 
online trading!), and having that data available enabled us to quickly 
respond to our client, the online trading group.

Mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and 
helping create the new online database.  His quick turnaround, understanding 
of our needs, attention to detail (while at the same time remaining cheerful 
while we, as I'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines) has helped us 
meet the needs of our clients.

Mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed, and he is certainly a 
valuable asset to your team!
