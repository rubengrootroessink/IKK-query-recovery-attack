Thanks Justy, maybe you can just fax me a copy of your PA or ETA, so I can 
have a copy of the document when I speak to them.  My fax no. is 
713/646-3490.  Thanks!

Hi Tana

Thanks for the note.....!

I am looking for the original letter we signed with Glencore, but from my 
recollection, all we said to Gencore was that the choice of law under any 
master or other trading agreement between Enron and Glencore was unaffected 
by the choice of English law under the UK PA or ETA.  This of course is not 
quite the same as Glencore's view below!

Justin,

Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make 
sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to 
choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.

I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is 
one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the 
Atlantic.

By the way, I heard you had some really good news.  I'm so happy for you!

Tana - 

Please see the email below - can you please look into Glencore's
assertion that their EOL trades (vs. ENA) should be governed under English
law.  

Thanks,
Diane

Hi,

I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
(from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
issues she has with EOL.

Tel: 44 20 7412 3190

Regards,

Debbie
