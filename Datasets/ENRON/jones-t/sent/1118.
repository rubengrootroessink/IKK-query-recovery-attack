If we are replacing an existing Master Agreement with an ISDA Master 
Agreement, please change the status in the master swap agreement database 
from "Executed" to "Executed-Under Amendment".  Once a master is executed, 
"Executed" or "Executed-Under Amendment" should be the only two options you 
should ever choose.  If you change it to "Draft Sent", "Under Negotiation", 
etc., it wipes that counterparty's master from the list of executed masters.
