I spoke to the fellow at legalanywhere.com today.  He will only be in the 
office Mon. and Tues. of next week, so if possible, he would like to set up a 
demonstration with us together at your desk on the computer so he can work us 
through the software.  Let me know when a convenient time would be for you, 
maybe Tuesday sometime?
