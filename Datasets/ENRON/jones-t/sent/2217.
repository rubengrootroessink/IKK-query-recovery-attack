Re: Revised Crude Oil Options Expiration Date

It has come to the attention of the Exchange that some earlier publications 
may contain an incorrect option expiration date. Please be advised that the 
expiration date for the Crude Oil Options December 2000 contract month (LO 
Z00) has been revised to Tuesday, November 14, 2000.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact the Floor 
Departments Systems Area at (212) 299-2626.
