Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under a 
financial confirmation.  We will need the standard executed copy.  The 
confirmation requires that we deliver the Guaranty within 5 days.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
