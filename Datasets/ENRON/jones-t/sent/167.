Mark Taylor asked me to respond to your request about the OMLX  software.  I 
spoke to Mark Elliott in our London office who dealt directly with the OMLX.  
He said to contact Susan Gill at the OMLX, who we spoke to on the agreements, 
and she should be able to direct you to their software people.  Her number in 
London is 011 44 171 815 8510.  Let me know if I can be of further service.
