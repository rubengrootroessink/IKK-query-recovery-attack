I am sorry I am just getting back to you, but I had to check with my whole=
=20
legal team around the world, and I just heard back from the final critical=
=20
one.  We are OK with them trading the products below.  However, on physical=
=20
power, they can only trade west power.  Stephanie, will you need to open th=
em=20
up so they can trade immediately?

Lisa/Stephanie, could you please ensure that the trading profiles for each =
of=20
the three PG&E entities are changed below such that by tomorrow morning the=
y=20
will be able to transact once we restore their headroom once we enter it in=
to=20
the system?

Tana, are you OK with restoring the changes reflected below?  I'm thinking=
=20
that since they had this transact ability once before, that it should be OK=
. =20

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE WILL BE ANY PROBLEMS. =20

Thanks all!

Walter

populated with a $5million minimum for each of these cp=01,s.

I do not want to turn them on in Datamanager until tomorrow am.
