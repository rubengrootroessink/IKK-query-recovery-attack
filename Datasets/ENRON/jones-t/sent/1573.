Holly,

Having both of them included in the certificate will be fine.  Frequently, 
companies do not know who will be available to sign, so they list more than 
one signer.

Thank you, we will use your form to satisfy Schedule to Master Agreement,
Part 3 -evidence of authority and specimen signatures (OK?) BCS would like
either Doug or Stew Thomas to be able sign the ISDA, depending on who is
available at the time. I assume I can simply include both of their names,
titles and signatures in this Certificate. Is this OK?  Thanks for your
help.
