Notice # 01-186

TO:
All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain Securitie=
s=20
and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and COMEX Transacti=
ons

DATE:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to=
=20
Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX=20
Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1,=20
2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit=
=20
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are=
=20
further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will ser=
ve=20
as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for use o=
n=20
a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained from the=
=20
Exchange=01,s Clearing Department.

3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint=
=20
Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard=20
Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for Joi=
nt=20
Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used =
as=20
margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint=20
Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used a=
s=20
margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association =
as=20
one of the Joint Beneficiaries.

4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under =20
applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidia=
ry=20
or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing=
=20
House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank parent or=
=20
affiliate bank.




As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule=20
changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and=20
deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin=20
requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use =
of=20
such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions.

Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit (LCs=
)=20
now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a "pass-through" basis on bot=
h=20
divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able=
=20
to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. =
It=20
should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, a=
s=20
detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets m=
ay=20
not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin=
=20
obligations with the clearinghouse.

Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing=20
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable=20
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim=
e=20
on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customer=
s=20
to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member=
s=20
on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the=
=20
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter=
=20
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve=
=20
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;=
=20
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o=
ne=20
issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market=20
value.

Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse=20
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted=
=20
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at =
no=20
more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)=
=20
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,=20
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice=20
President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.

 (3) Calls issued by Member Firms for additional margin from customers may=

for open NYMEX Division positions, or conforming to the requirements of Rul=
e=20
4.01(E)(2) for open COMEX Division positions, or, for open positions on=20

en=20
into consideration and combined with any other monies available, enable the=
=20
customer's margin to equal or exceed the then prevailing initial margin=20
requirement.

 (F) Withdrawals of margin from a customer's account may only be permitted =
by=20

=20
are equal to or in excess of the then prevailing initial margin required of=

the applicable open positions at the time of said withdrawal request.

(G) The customer's response to a margin call issued by a Member Firm must b=
e=20

 (I) Arbitrage

(1) For the purposes of Exchange margin requirements, an arbitrage position=
=20

se=20
a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different delivery=
=20
month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject to the=20
rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage position=
,=20
each contract long and short must be carried by the same member firm for th=
e=20
same account.

(2) The Board of Directors, by resolution, may identify those futures=20
contracts, that are executable on and/or subject to the rules of a differen=
t=20
exchange, which shall be deemed to qualify as part of an arbitrage position=
.

(3) The Board of Directors or its designee may set levels of margin for=20
