Please find attached the referenced list.  For Enserco Energy, Inc., my 
previous approvals remain the same except for power, which has been shut down 
for trading (I can't just copy the last excel spreadsheet since the columns 
are not in the same order anymore).  Then, the only other new counterparty is 
also shut down for power but open for everything else.
