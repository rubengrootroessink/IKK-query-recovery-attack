Did you want this cpy on the list for Legal/Credit meeting?  ERMS hasn't been 
expanded as an Enron company to be added to list for discussion at meeting, 
and we have some old ERMS era masters people are working on that aren't 
getting discussed, and some ERMS era masters that should be unchecked so we 
do not discuss them at meeting.
