Attached please find the referenced counterparty approval lists.  Per my 
conv. w/Frank and Leslie Hansen's emails, on a going forward basis, U.S. 
based counterparties should not be approved for European based physical power 
products, and vice versa.  I don't know how you want to handle that, I have 
not "Xed" out European physical power from the attached list.  What should we 
do on a going forward basis?
