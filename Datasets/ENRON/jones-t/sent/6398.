I do not agree and I am discussing this with Justin Boyd in London before I 
(or Justin) responds to this Counterparty.  Joe, can you take a look at their 
EOL trades and see if there is any particular reason why their trades might 
be taking more than 24 hours to get a confirmation out?  Thanks.

Tana,

Glencore claims that the Governing Law in their EOL GTC's should be English 
Law.  Do you agree?

Thanks,
Joe

Hi,

I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
(from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
issues she has with EOL.

Tel: 44 20 7412 3190

Regards,

Debbie
