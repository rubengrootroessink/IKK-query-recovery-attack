Karen,

Upon re-review w/Credit, we have decided not to open this counterparty up for

Please confirm that this is the counterparty previously approved for online 
trading for EOL under the same name and identified as CP ID # 77297.
Also, please confirm whether you need financials for ENA or for all worldwide

John Arnold wants this counterparty opened ASAP for financial.  We didn't 
have any financial statements from them when they originally came thru, so we 
couldn't determine their ESP status, but we're OK now, so if you could open 
them for financial ASAP.

Thanks.
