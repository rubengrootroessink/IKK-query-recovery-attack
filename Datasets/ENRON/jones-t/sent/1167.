Attached is the list referenced above, revised to approve Imperial Oil 
Resources (cpy ID 58981) for all products but power (of course no credit 
derivatives).  The other Imperial Oil Resources Limited  from the original 
approvals (cpy ID5193), I would like shut down for all products until I am 
provided information as to how it differs from the other Imperial Oil 
Resources.  Whew...!!!
