The Paul's

In short it is suggested we have a disclaimer at the front of each 
description as well as a link ot the Legal & Provacy statement.

I do not like the idea of a disclaimer on the front of each description so 
what about putting one at the bottom of the market info page where the names 
of the markets are displayed?

Justin, would this be acceptable.  The Market Info page is a page which lists 
the names of the markets and the user selects the appropriate description 
from there.  Can you suggest an appropriate discliamer to put in?

Thanks

Awais

Awais,

Please see below. We should either have a short disclaimer at the end of each 
Market Description, or have a link to the Legal & Privacy Statement.  

We should also date each Market Description.

Justin,

I have now reviewed the market descriptions. As instructed, I have not
sought advice from Nick O'Neill or Charlotte Stalin on the regulatory issues
which may arise from this. I understand that you will be considering these.

I confirm that there does not appear to be anything obnoxious in these
descriptions. However, I should say that I am not an expert on the subject
matter of the descriptions and therefore, I would only be able to spot very
obvious problems. Clearly, you need to be comfortable that the contents of
them are true and not defamatory. For example, where you have stated that an
entity is a monopoly you must be sure that this is the case.

Ideally, you should have a statement on the screen that this is provided for
information purposes only and should not be relied on. If this is
unacceptable (and ideally in addition to that statement), there should be a
link to the legal and privacy statement.

Kind regards.

Andrew
