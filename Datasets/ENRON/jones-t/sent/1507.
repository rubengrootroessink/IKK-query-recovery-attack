Please handle the ISDA portion.  If there is no commercial pressure, and I 
don't think I have ever seen these guys do a finanical trade, the priority is 
probably pretty low.

Thanks,
Tanya

Rhonda/Tana,
See information below.  I received a call from Tracy Hoey (she is actually 
with New Energy) requesting and EEI agreement for Physical Power and an ISDA 
Agreement for financial Deals.  She said that AES Eastern is the unregulated 
side of the business.
