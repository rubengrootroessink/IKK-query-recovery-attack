I faxed over some changes Thursday.  I deleted all references to ECT and ECT 
Legal Advisors being a party to the opinion.  Haedicke is an officer of ECT 
International, he is General Counsel and Managing Director, and so he can 
sign as such.  No need to pull ECT into the opinion when unnecessary.
