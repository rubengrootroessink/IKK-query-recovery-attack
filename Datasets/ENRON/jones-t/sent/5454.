The only way to know exactly what agreements are outstanding is to do an 
audit of the software.  Many of the agreements have been taken in Enron 
Corp.'s name which is the company policy.

Subject: ASAP-Preliminary List of Online Contracts

Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline 
contracts I have been made aware of.  There are a few I have open questions 
about  or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.  Can each of you 
please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be 
missing.  Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response 
promptly I would be most appreciative.
