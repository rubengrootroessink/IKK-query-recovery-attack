Mark/Tana,

Due to the recent organizational changes with Sheri Thomas & Amita Gosalia=
=20
(see memo below), we will need to remove them as "agents and=20
attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on behalf of EOL" and ad=
d=20
Savita Puthigai, Lara McKinney and myself.=20

Also, Dale Neuner should be removed as he is no longer part of EnronOnline=
=20
operations but is responsible for DealBench and CommodityLogic operations.=
=20
Savita suggested we also add Torrey Moorer since I will be out on maternity=
=20
leave in mid July and he will be backing me up during that time.=20

Can you let me know the turnaround time of a change like this?
Also, is it separate documentation for North America and Europe?

Thank you for your help.
