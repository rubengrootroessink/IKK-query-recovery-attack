Per the request of Lucy Ortiz, I have reviewed the current list of weather 
counterparties we are trading with, and have targeted four counterparties 
that we have open for trading weather offline that  I am now going to open 
for online trading.

1.  El Paso Energy Marketing Marketing Company, name change as of 12/1/99 to  
El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company - previously approved for all products, 
except weather, now add approved for weather also.  Non-ISDA Master Agreement 
in place.
2.  Madison Gas and Electric Company - previously not approved for any 
financial products, now approving for all financial products.  No Master 
Agreement in place.  Credit, we need to pursue this financial master.
3. Swiss Re Financial Products Corp. - we previously did not approve this 
counterparty for any financial trading - now open for weather financial 
trading only.   No Master Agreement currently in place; however, we are 
getting close on the negotiation of this ISDA Master.
4.  Vitol N.A. - we previously had them approved for all products, but 
weather, open them up for weather, as well.  Non-ISDA Master Agreement in 
place.  Steve Douglas, counterparty is a Swiss corporation and have never 
sent us their tax forms.
