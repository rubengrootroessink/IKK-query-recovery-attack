Enron Canada has a Master Agreement [ECT form, non ISDA] in place with Energy 
West Incorporated (which ENA could trade under per the Services Agreement 
with ECC covering financial trades only).  Per my conversation a second ago 
with Credit, Energy West Incorporated and Energy West Resources are not 
showing up in their records as being one and the same corporation.  Sounds to 
me you need to call Credit for approval.  If we do not have a master, they 
would have to get Credit approval to do a trade w/o a master in place.

Tana, I am attempting to put together a "spark spread" with Energy West 
Resources (AKA Energy West).  EPMI has a master in place with Energy West 
Resources Inc. their current and correct business name.   I understand we 
have an ISDA in place with Energy West Incorporated who is one and the 
same.   In addition to credit concerns, is there any problem doing a 
financial transaction with Energy West Resources Inc. under the name on the 
ISDA of Energy West Incorporated ?
