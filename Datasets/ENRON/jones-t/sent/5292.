How did it get to be that these people are drafting their own NDA's.  I 
thought our agreement when we met with Dovie Keptra was that I would draft 
them.  I would prefer every time not to have to figure out what they've 
changed.

Attached for your review and comment please find the form of NDA that we 
intend to send to FLAG Telecom as soon as possible.  The attached is the same 
form as the Level 3 NDA distributed last week.

As we would like to send this out as early as possible, please call me at 
X54482 if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you,

Peter Feltman
