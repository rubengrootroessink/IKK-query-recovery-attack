Leslie Hansen was out today so Elizabeth forwarded your language to one of 
our power attorneys in the Portland office for review.  I have some minor 
clean up changes from Elizabeth, but except any material changes to come from 
Christian Yoder in our Portland office.  As soon as I receive Christian's 
comments I will add forward them on to you.
