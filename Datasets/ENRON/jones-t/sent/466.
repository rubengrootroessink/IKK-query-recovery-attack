Tana:

Attached is a credit worksheet for Enertek that requires them to post an L/C 
in the amount of $50,000.  I assume that we will be confirming the deal under 
a deemed ISDA since the Master is not executed yet.  The deal was just done 
today by Jennifer Fraser.

Please call me if I am not clear on the worksheet.



Regards,

Pat
