Anthony,

We have Confidentiality provisions in many of our swap agreements that 
prohibit us from providing copies of our master swap agreements to other 
parties, including, other Enron affiliates.  All requests by non-Enron North 
America employees for copies of swap master agreements should be forwarded to 
the paralegals in the Swap Group to determine if the agreement will allow us 
to provide copies to such affiliate, or whether we would  need counterparty 
approval to do so.

With respect to the agreements listed below, I will take a look at those and 
let you know whether they present any problem.
