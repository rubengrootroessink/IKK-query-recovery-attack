Getchen is in our personnel dept.  She will coordinate filling job positions 
with candidates.  If you just emailed her your resume, you might want to give 
her a few days because she is working on lots of jobs.  I've used her before, 
so you might want to mention my name, say I work in the Enron North America 
Legal Dept.  She is really sweet.
