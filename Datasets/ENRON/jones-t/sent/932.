Some notes on the attached lists:

3/24/00 List - the first two counterparties have no Legal changes per my 
earlier approvals.

3/27/00 List-we just got the financial master in signed and they cannot do 
pulp & paper and weather under it.
Ambac Assurance Corp. and Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund - I have a 
temporary "no" for them for financial products until I get more information 
on them to determine what they are and what they can do.  Per Credit, AMBAC 
only wants to trade credit derivatives, and Salomon Smith Barney is currently 
not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial.  If we get a 
parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status.  
In the meantime I am trying to get more information on the fund to determine 
what if anything they can do.

3/28/00 List-I previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening 
them up.   I sent an email about that earlier this week.
