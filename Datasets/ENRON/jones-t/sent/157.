I forgot one thing.  I have that rotted board on the garage wall near the 
garden, we talked about tearing that out and putting in another 2x2 or 2/4 or 
whatever it is, and then painting that.  Do you remember?

By the way, I can't believe you're alive.  By the way you've been quiet, I 
thought you were maybe in that plane too...!
