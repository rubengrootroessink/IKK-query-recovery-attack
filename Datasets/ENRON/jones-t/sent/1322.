I would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few 
questions.  First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, 
we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep 
in.  Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry 
about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is 
always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master 
would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason 
to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.

Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to 
mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular 
out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of 
Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it 
Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.  Will 
they be financially trading separately under those departments?  And if so 
should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?

Anything else special you think I need to mention?
