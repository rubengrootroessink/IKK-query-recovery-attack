Following up on our conversation re: a visit to Santa Fe when you come to 
Houston, check out the Website for The Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe 
(www.bishopslodge.com).   Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a 
silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great.  
The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink 
to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the 
activities going on in Santa Fe.  I think you are going to be too late for 
their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other 
fun things going on.  The website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking 
pool, horseback riding and shooting.  Take a look.
