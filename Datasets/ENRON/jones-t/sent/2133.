Below is an icon that will get you view access to the financial agreement 
database.  This lists all the financial agreements we either have executed or 
have drafts out to the counterparty (except Australia, which we are currently 
loading into the database).   This database is available with view access to 
any Enron employee.  If you have any questions about a specific entry, please 
do not hesitate to call me (or email me!).

Thanks Justin. As a follow-uo, Credit.com are now asking whether they can 
have a list of all counterparties with whom with executed ISDAs. I presume 
that is a long list but hopefully easily available. Thanks again for your 
help.

No, no ISDA's or other master agreements in place with this counterparty.

I have been asked by Credit.com whether there are ISDA agreements in place 
with the above mentioned banks (who are about to merge). I suspect the answer 
is No but please can we find out.
Thanks.
