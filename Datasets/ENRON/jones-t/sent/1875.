Hey,

What's with the out dated effective date. 1996? I had just got to Enron in 
December 1996.

 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under 
an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of 
Incumbency.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the
