Tax advise that this would create a permanent establishment for tax purposes, 
thus drawing EnronCredit.com Ltd into a US tax net.
NOT a good idea!
(It would be OK if Jeff lived in the UK!)
The solution is to set up a dedicated US entity, which we are working on.

Richard

Sue informs me that you don't want this to happen - please could you let Tana 
and Gillian Johnson know and explain why?

Many thanks

Michael

Thanks Tana - Cindy please could you put a Power of Attorney in place for 
Jeff Kinneman to sign, say confidentiality agreements and letters of intent 
(for now) on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited?
Please let me know if you need more details.

Many thanks

Michael

Gillian spoke to Jeff Kinneman and he would like to get whatever 
documentation would be required to permit him to execute documents here in 
Houston on a going forward basis for Credit.com.  We don't know what it will 
take to do this, but it really isn't practical for us to get Jim Derrick or 
Mark Frevert to sign.
