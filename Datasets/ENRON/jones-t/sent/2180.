Dale:

I spoke with Jeff Bluementhal earlier today and wanted to confirm the parties 
that should be approved for trading Argentine.  The Enron party that should 
execute Argentine physical gas deals should be Enron America de Sur S.A.  It 
should be noted that all counterparties for this product should be Argentine 
entities.

Regards

Lynn
