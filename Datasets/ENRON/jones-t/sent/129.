Yeah, we also need to provide copies of the signed resolutions to Ted Murphy, 
so he knows what's approved, so he then knows who does a trade outside of the 
approval.

We also then need to update the index to our corporate resolutions binders 
and substitute the revised resolution in our binders so the binders always 
contain the most current resolution.
