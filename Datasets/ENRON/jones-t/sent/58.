John, it's good to hear from you!

A few things on your paralegal friend.  First, we don't currently have any 
openings, though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience.  
Most of the paralegals in our group have about 15-25 years experience.  Also, 
we recently hired someone, and I don't anticipate us hiring for awhile.

Most of Enron's litigation work is done out of Enron Corp.  They do have a 
big litigation group up there, and that would be the most obvious place to 
start.  Chuck Cheek is the head lawyer for that group.  You could forward her 
resume up there with a note, it might get it more personal attention.  Also, 
keep watching (or she can watch, it online) the job bank, they advertise 
paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the Enron companies.

Another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals, and might hire 
paralegals with less experience, is the Global Contracts Group headed up by 
Mary Solmonson.  They're always looking for people, and it might be a good 
way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ECT.  Also, if her 
undergraduate degree was in business, obviously, she might have some more 
options in other groups.

As far as running goes, I'm trying to get back into shape.  I'm just 
surviving 3 miles around the park, and this weekend I plan to double my 
mileage to 6.  It sounds like we're both not in fighting form.  But I do want 
to start training in July with Houston Fit for the Houston Marathon again.
