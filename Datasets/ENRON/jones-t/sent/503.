I got a call from the Lower Colorado River Authority today asking us if we 
would like to put a power enabling and ISDA Master Agreement in place with 
them.  I spoke to Liz Sager and it appears we have already done a physical 
power trade with them.  Of course, we can still not do financial trading 
until we run through all the hoops with them.  I don't know who you directed 
your marketing package to, but he wanted some information on online trading 
and I said we would send him a packet.
