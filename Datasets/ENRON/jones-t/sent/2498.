Attached are ClickPaper approvals for November 20, 2000.  Please note that 
the credit limits in the spreadsheet reflect one-tenth of the actual credit 
limit that we have assigned for a given counterparty since the headroom 
within ClickPaper is calculated using Sigma Factor * Volume rather than 
Pprice * Volume.  We will assign all future limits by using one-tenth of the 
assigned credit limit since using the Sigma factor in these calculations 
generates a value of roughly one-tenth of the full limit.  Hopefully this 
will eliminate some of the recent problems we've had with counterparties 
busting their credit limits.  Please call or send a note if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Walter
