Mr. Uretsky,

At the request of Michael Danielson, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Confidentiality Agreement.  If the agreement meets with your approval, could 
you please have it executed by an authorized officer of Viant Corporation and 
fax it to me for signature by Enron North America Corp.   If you have any 
questions or comments, please do not hesitate to call me.  My phone no. is 
(713) 853-3399 and my fax no. is (713) 646-3490.  Thanks for your help.
