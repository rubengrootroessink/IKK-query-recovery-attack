Please find attached for your further handling, the legally reviewed versions 
of the Online Market Decsriptions for NGL, Oil and Oil Products and Plastics 
and Petrochemicals. 

Please ask Mark Taylor to review the Plastics and Petrochemicals description 
for relevance and accuracy.

Please advise if you have any questions or if I may be of further assistance.
