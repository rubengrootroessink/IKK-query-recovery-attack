Tana,

I have faxed to your attention some more issues with Tokyo-Mitsubishi 
documents.  Toky-Mitsubishi has sent a fax requesting a few things be added 
to our Confirmation.  The fact that the Master Agreement does not cover 
Commodity trades is not one of their problems (see below).  However, there 
are some Master related issues that they wish to have included in the 
Confirmation such as Market Disruption Events, Disruption Fallbacks, and a 
Non-Reliance provision.  As well as a couple of changes to our standard 
language ('first nearby month' rather than 'prompt month').

Let us know what you think of their comments.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

Joe -

The Master Agreement with TM does not contemplate entering into Commodity 
Transactions. Confirms with this CP will require special language to be 
provided by Legal. Please make a note in Special Handling and contact Legal 
if any further trades comes down. Once we have the language, we will need to 
revise the Confirmation for the trade done 10/15, and Bob will need to create 
a special template for TM.

Dale
