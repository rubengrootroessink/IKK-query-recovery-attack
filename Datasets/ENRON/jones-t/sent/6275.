Ian,

The confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to 
provide the agreement to affiliates.  I will need some direction from the 
counterparty either via email or phone before I can send you a copy of the 
agreement.  Sorry...

Hello Tana,

I was wondering if you could provide me with a copy of the ISDA in place with 
Alcoa Inc. today. It would be greatly appreciated if you could send this 
document either by email,  or to me by fax at 0207 783 1171.  Sorry about the 
rush on this.

Thanks in advance, 

Ian
