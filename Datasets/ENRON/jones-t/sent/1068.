I spoke to the guy reviewing the deals this morning.  He has come up with 
more deals than were on the list provided by Statoil/J. Aron, and now Bob 
Bowen is checking out the list.  They hope to have it to me by the end of the 
day.  It seems to me the way we need to proceed is to contact the J. Aron 
person and get the name of their person who can sign off on the trades, and 
have Bob Bowen and this person come to a consensus about the correct trades.  
Once we've got that nailed, then we amend their form of assignment to add the 
language that the trades need to go under the J. Aron master.  Are you with 
me on this?
