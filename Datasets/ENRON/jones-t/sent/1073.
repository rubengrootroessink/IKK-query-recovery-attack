As you both may recall, we left unresolved whether our intention was to have 
the credit derivatives tied to the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, if there 
was any.  Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but 
after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.  We need 
to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of 
the credit derivatives online, which is causing much trouble between Global 
Contract and the online crew.

Can you direct me as to what our approach will be.  Thanks.
