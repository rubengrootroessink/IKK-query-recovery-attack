Susan Vrazel has left the building : )  Actually, Susan has decided to pursue 
other avenues; her last day was 
Tuesday, 5/18/99. Global CounterParty (GCP) requests will be handled by 
Marilyn Colbert, Jason Moore, or myself,
 Samuel Schott. Feel free to contact me with any of your GCP needs, x3-9890. 
Have a wonderful and productive day. 
                            
Samuel

So you'll be doing name changes/mergers in the future, not Susan?
