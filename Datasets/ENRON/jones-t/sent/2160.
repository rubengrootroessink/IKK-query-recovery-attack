Thanks for the note.  Just pass on my concern for Clarissa and hope for her 
improvement.

Hi Tana

Michael has asked me to get in touch with you to apologise for not contacting 
you earlier and to say that unfortunately Clarissa is very ill and in and out 
of hospital so he will not be able to contact for the next couple of weeks.  
Consequently, he will not be in the office the  rest of the week and will 
also not be in next week.  He is not picking up his emails but is picking up 
voicemails.  If you would like me to pass any message on to him, please just 
email me or call me on 0207 783 7212.

Thanks
Fiona
