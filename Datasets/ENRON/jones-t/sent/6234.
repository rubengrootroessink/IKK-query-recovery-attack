Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,=
=20
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=018) will go into effect.

! In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will=20
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing=
=20
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

! The term =01&executing broker=018 as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the reg=
istered=20
billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitte=
d.

! Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up=20
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade=20
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer=
=20

o=20
an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new=20
customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Memb=
er=20

(d) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with=
=20
the executing broker for that account; and

account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or t=
he=20
