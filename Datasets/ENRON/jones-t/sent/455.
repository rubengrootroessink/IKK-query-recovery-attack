Will you be sending the ISDA Agreement for signature directly to Mark 
Frevert?  I'm asking because he will have to sign the incumbency certificate 
before Kate Cole, obviously, certifies to his signature.  How do you plan on 
doing this?  Perhaps we should have Edmund Cooper in London coordinate the 
signing.  What are your thoughts?
