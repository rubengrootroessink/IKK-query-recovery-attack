FYI, we are now executing Services Agreements, and it is my undertanding that 
Dave Samuels will maintain the files of the originally executed copies until 
I am given further instruction.  As with all the online documents I am 
getting executed on your behalf, I will maintain a copy in our files also.

We have received the executed Information Services Agreement dated May 22, 
2000 between Energy Argus Incorporated and Enron NetWorks LLC.  The original 
is being sent to Dave.
