Sorry for my hold up on this list.  I had an issue with the division/dba 
approvals that I needed to resolve with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor.  We 
will be issuing a policy (as soon as I draft it) about how to deal with 
divisions/dba's in the future.  For this Koch counterparty:

Per my conversation with Stephanie, I am provisionally approving this 
counterparty only with understanding that the online trading account name 
gets amended to read as follows:

Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

If the counterparty will not agree to this name change on its account let me 
know, I will talk to the Koch lawyer.  (FYI, this is the way we styled the 
ISDA Master Agreement, at the direction of the Koch lawyer.)
