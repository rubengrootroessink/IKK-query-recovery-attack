Paul,

I just spoke to Brent Hendry who worked on the Bermuda law advice, and he 
said he sent you the name of counsel.  I will also sent to you tonight a copy 
of the advice we just got with respect to derivative transactions and online 
transactions.

Tana

I need to use Bermudean counsel today on a transaction and understand we have 
recently selected Bermudan counsel re EOL.  Please could you provide me with 
contact details.

Many thanks and kind regards.

Paul
