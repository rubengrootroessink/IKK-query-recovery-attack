Attached is the referenced list.  Some comments:  We got a master financial 
agreement in place with Calpine Power Services  Company so it has been opened 
up to trade all financial.  Also, we replaced the old style "ERMS Master" 
with an ISDA, so I am opening TXU Energy Trading Company for all financial 
products as well.

For Trammo Gas, we got a letter from them a while back, reflecting under 
what  names they can do financial trading under (I sent you all an email 
about this about a month to two months ago).  That letter had the 
counterparty styled "Transammonia, Inc. acting through its  Trammo Gas 
Division".  I believe I already siad they could trade financial under that 
name.   Let's just be consistent about how we deal with these divisions...
