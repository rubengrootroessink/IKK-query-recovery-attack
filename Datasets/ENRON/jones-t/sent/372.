Per Mark's approval, when we entered into the master with CGAS, we found out 
they never entered into a resolution approving the swap agreement or trades 
thereunder.  So each and everytime we do a trade with them we are going to 
have to get a resolution authorizing entering into the trade.

So for the executed master swap agreement list we need to put:  "Need board 
resolution prior to trading"
