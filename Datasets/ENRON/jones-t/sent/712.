It was Canadian Natural Resources, and we are still working on it along with 
a host of other issues but we hope to have something signed by mid-week next 
week.  CNR is the priority, but we have also been talking to Petro-Canada and 
others but have not yet crossed the issue of executing an agreement.

Regards, Peter

This came up at our Group meeting today, did you ever sign that Master 
Netting Agreement for Petro-Canada at year end?
