Attached is my list where I approved this initial counterparties.  
Whew...!!!  As you can see, I opened National Gypsum w/o restrictions.  I 
have a database where I keep track of my approvals, unfortunately, the 
computer people are really busy and can't add my drop downs for pulp and 
paper approvals until late this week/early next week.  After reviewing 
thousands of online counterparties, I can't keep track of what I'm telling 
people without my systems in place!

Attached is my list with the approvals from Legal filled in.  As I mentioned 
Friday, we will need to keep track of any trading restrictions on a going 
forward basis, because it might impact approval of new online pulp & paper 
products.  Two of the counterparties on this initial list fall into that 
category.  ConAgra Energy Services, Inc. cannot enter into option 
transactions.  We currently have none online, so it's not an issue, but if we 
add options, this would not be allowed.  Second, The E.W. Scripps Company is 
allowed to trade 48.8 gram newsprint only transactions.  We do not currently 
trade 48.8 gram newsprint.

My database will track this, so to add new products online, the counterparty 
should come back through as an amendment, so I can catch it.  Does this make 
sense to you?

Tana, Karen-
I am currently working on the ClickPaper.com project and am responsible for 
the Product Control Group.  Attached from Tom is a list of about 100 
customers that were on our initial mailout and need to go thru the approval 
process soon.  However, below is a list of 4 customers that we need to focus 
on immediately - we would like to approach these customers to do our first 
trades, therefore, I will need to immediately send them their user ids.  
Irving Pulp & Paper Limited
ConAgra Energy Services, Inc.
Inland Paperboard & Packaging, Inc.
Waste Management, Inc.

I appreciate your help in this matter.
Thanks,
Michelle
