Tana,   Per my voicemail, here is the invitation I'm planning on sending out. 
Plz advise if you have any suggestions/comments and if you'd like me to mail 
it out to your group or if you'd prefer to do that.  

I need to provide a final headcount by next Monday, so plz let me know as 
soon as possible.

Thx, Mercy  x35082
