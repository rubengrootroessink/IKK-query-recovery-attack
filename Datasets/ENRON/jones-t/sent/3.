That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about 
the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade 
between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.  I have attached the 
proposed form of confirmation.  I have combined in it the usual tax language 
we have in RMT confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border 
trade between a Delaware corporation (usually ECT, now RMT) and company 
(Teeside Power) located in a treaty country acting exclusively through 
non-U.S. branches (England).  Please let me know if the tax language meets 
with your approval.
