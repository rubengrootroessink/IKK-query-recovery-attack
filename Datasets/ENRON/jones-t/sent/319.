For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can 
trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need 
your help and your list to be able to do that.  I am totally unfamiliar with 
the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in 
English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty 
or not.  I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with 
utilities and governmentals.  I've been searching that utility website trying 
to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it 
sounds like a utility or governmental.

Is your list done, or when will it be done?  Do you spell out if the 
counterparty is governmental/utility?  What help can you give me?
