I am getting ready to fax you Steve Kean's comments to the language.  Steve 
Kean is marking this material as to regulatory information only.  Not as to 
legal.  He told me he also passed these market descriptions to Karen Denney 
in Public Relations for her comments and she supposedly is going to send her 
comments to me for forwarding to you.  I will let you know as soon as I 
receive your comments.
