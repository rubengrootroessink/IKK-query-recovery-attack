We really haven't used the Local Currency form in several years.  We found 
that we were getting requests to switch to the Multicurrency Form so 
frequently that we made the Multicurrency our primary form.  In the long run 
we have found that the Multicurrency Form gives us the most flexibility as 
the trading markets become more international in nature.  If you prefer the 
Local Currency it may take me asome time when we get back on Wednesday to 
compare the forms and convert the document over.  Please let me know if that 
is your preference.

Thanks for the copy of the draft Agreements. Do you have a Local Currency -
Single Jurisdiction version of this agreement? Since this is a single, one
time transaction that would be a better agreement for us. Thanks
