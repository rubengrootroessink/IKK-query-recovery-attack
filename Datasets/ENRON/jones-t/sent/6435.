I have submitted the security requests to get the three of you access to the 
"Other Agreements" subdirectory of the Financial Agreement Database.  That 
approval usually takes about a day, as soon as it comes through I'll let you 
know.  You will of course, still need to solve how to get into the directory 
with Mike Neves.  Let me know when you can get in.
