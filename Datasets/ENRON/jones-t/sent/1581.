I take it by PG&E Core, you mean PG&E's Core Procurement Department.  Yes, it 
should go out under the master

Hi Tana,

Can we send a confirm under the Pacific Gas & Electric Company for PG&E 
Core?  The customer is calling for their confirms under the master.

Thanks,
Sheetal

PG&E Core states that they are a subsidiary of Pacific Gas & Electric Company 
who has a master w/ ENA.  Therefore, can we set up PG&E Core w/ a master?  

Thank you,

Sheetal :)
