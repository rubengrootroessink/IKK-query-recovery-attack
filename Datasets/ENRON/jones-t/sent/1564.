Attached is the referenced list.  The Bakersfield California is approved to 
only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.  Therefore, I have turned them 
down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product 
base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we 
offer newprint commodity swaps and options online.
