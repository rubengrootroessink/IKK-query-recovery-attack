Carol,

Engage faxed us their form of Coastal Corporation Guaranty.  It is not clear 
to me looking in the file what I should compare it to to make sure it is OK.  
It looks like our form of guaranty, but it is not the one I sent them.  What 
do I need to do here?

Also, in terms of the approved amendment, I see one in the file with some 
hand marked changes.  Are those changes agreed to and is that what we should 
sign?

Hope all is going well...

Luke:
What is the status of your review of my comments to this and to the amendment 
draft and questions that I had?  I am on maternity leave now so please call 
Tana Jones to finish this and she can get an attorney involved if necessary.

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?
