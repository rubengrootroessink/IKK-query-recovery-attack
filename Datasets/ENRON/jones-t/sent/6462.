Hi, Tana.  I=01,d prefer to work this at a lower level if possible.  Could =

Corinna -

I have looked at the attached.  It is fine.  I will be printing two origina=

for Net Works' signature.  I'll have them sent down for signature so that=

they can then be sent to Microsoft.

JDP MOU




Mark,

Can you please review the changes made by Susan Chang at Microsoft to the S=
QL=20
2000 SP1 JDP MOU for our Unify application.  Bob Ward is out of the office=
=20
until June 4th, and this application is going into production on June 11th.=
 =20
We need to ensure the MOU is finalized and signed prior to going into=20
production so that we can receive the appropriate support from Microsoft wh=
en=20
we go live.

If you need to contact Susan her telephone number is 425-703-6394.  Her ema=
il=20
is schang@microsoft.com.

Thanks for your immediate attention to this matter,
Corinna Bolender
Desk: 713-345-4388

Bob and Corinna,
Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
change.  Specifically:
an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
(though this hardly matters now considering the date).
The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
#4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
good addition.
#10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
customer.

If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
included.  Please print, sign and return.

Thanks!
JamMo!

Susan,
I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our
Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact
changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they
changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come
back and bite me later.  Roughly 4 or 5 sentenced.
Thanks for you help!

Hi, James.  I've attached a copy of the MOU which contains some minor
changes suggested by one of our attorneys.  Let me know what you think.
Thank you.
