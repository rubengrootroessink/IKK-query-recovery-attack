Tana,

Everyone who has access to Lotus Notes has "view" (no legal comments) access 
to the Legal Online Trading database.  Just forward the following link to 
whomever you want to view the system...

Online Trading Agreements -->

By the way, I am still waiting for confirmation of the access request below 
to the Financial Trading Agreements database.  I'll keep you posted.

Davis Minns, Robert McGrory, and Alison Keogh in the Australia Legal Office, 
and Jane McBride and Yo Yamanishi in the Japan Legal office need full edit 
access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database in Lotus Notes.  Can you 
let me know when this has happened.  Can you also get the view capability to 
the Legal Online Trading Database.  Thanks

Last week Tana and I discussed geeting the Australian ISDA Masrer Agreements 
loaded onto the the international data base. I already have access to this 
data base through Lotus Notes.

The agreed actions were

Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up 
and explaining functionality.

Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.
