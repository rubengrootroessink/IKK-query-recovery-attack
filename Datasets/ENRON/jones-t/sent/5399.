Tana,
This is the Total International deal that needs to be reassigned:
January 4 US Prop FOB Phy MB TET

The rest of the details are in the e-mail below.

I will also ask them to apply for a new id  under Elf Trading Inc. so that we 
do not have to go through this in the future.

If you need anything else, please call me at 5-3614.

Thank you,
jennifer McQuade
