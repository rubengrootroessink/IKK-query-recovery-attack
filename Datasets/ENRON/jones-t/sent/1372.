Tana,

If George only needs read access, you can just send him the database link and 
he should be ready to go (remember -  we opened the system up to everyone).  
Let me know if you need antyhing else.

Mike

Mike,

Can you grant George Hope with the Online Team, view access only to the Legal 
Online Trading Database.  Can you let us know when his approval comes in.  
Thanks!
