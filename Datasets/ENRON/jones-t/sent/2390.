Michelle:

Should we back date to date immediately after organizational resolutions or 
just ratify past acts?  Preference?

I will prepare Unanimous Consent electing Robert Jones.  What do we want to 
use as effective date?  Please advise.  Thanks, Deb

Robert Jones appears to be a VP of Enron Net Works, but not EnronOnline. 

By copy of this email to Deb Korkmas, I would like to confirm that the above 
is correct, and if it is, can we please get Robert Jones added as a VP of 
EnronOnline.

Thanks!

Tana:

Does Robert Jones, HR VP, have signatory authority for Net Works and 
EnronOnline?   Per Michelle Cash, he needs it since he signs employment 
contracts, ect.  If he does not, we'll need to have some retroactive 
resolutions prepared.

Please let me know.

Leslie
