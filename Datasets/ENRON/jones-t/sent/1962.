At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching our current from of ISDA 
Schedule for governmental entities and our sample form of legal opinion for 
such entities.  With respect to NYPA, we do have a copy of an authorization 
to hedge approved by the Board of Trustees of NYPA that they faxed us a year 
ago and I will fax a copy of it over to you shortly.
