Below are the international lawyers who need to be notified of form changes.  
Notify them only when forms are completed (not as they might be evolving).  
Also, they should be using the swap forms in the attorney bank, so they need 
to know where they are located.

Justin Boyd, London
Edmund Cooper, London
Mark Elliott, London
Paul Simons, London
Peter Keohane, Calgary
Martin Rosell, Oslo
Matthis Lee, Singapore
David Minns, Australia
John Viverito, Japan
