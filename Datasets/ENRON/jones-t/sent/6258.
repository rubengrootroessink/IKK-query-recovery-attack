Matt,

Justin Boyd, Mark Elliott and Paul Simons already had edit access to the 
database.  From London, Nicola Beales, Robert Quick, Tracy Foy  & Robert 
McGrory (is he in Legal?) already have edit access (also yourself & Edmund).

Are All the other People you have requesting edit access in Legal?

On read access, Rod Nelson from Credit already has Edit access from his days 
in London.  You can send all those other people the Link (if it works) and 
they should be able to get in.  If they are in Credit we will want them to 
have edit access because they can read the comments so they can see more 
detail about the negotiation.  And hopefully, input their comments about 
their negotiation to keep Legal apprised (we can always hope!).
