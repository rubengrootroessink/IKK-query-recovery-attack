Tana,

I have received the quote for the new files for your area.  The 5-drawer 
files are $682 each and the 2-drawers are $362 each for a total of $5,948 
(includes tax).  If you want me to proceed with the order, please send me an 
authorizing email.  Also, I still need to know how you would like the 
cabinets to be keyed: all alike, split by banks (by groups) or individually, 
or a combination of the last two options.  I can submit this purchase order 
now without this information, but will need that shortly.

I will be out of May 26-28, so if you have any questions, please contact Pat 
Scarborough (x35368).

Robin
