Louis,

The brother of the kids downstairs is renovating a house in the Heights and 
needs an electrician to rewire or do a new fuse box or something.  Do you 
think that your electrician would want to give them a bid on the job, or do 
you have someone else to recommend?  They hired someone, who has in effect, 
taken their money and run, and their house sits, unable to proceed on the 
rest of the renovation work, until they can get the electric work done.

Thanks.
