To all,

The new Enron Center Garage has opened and if those of you that have accepted 
spaces at the new garage would please return your Met and Allen Center 
parking cards ASAP,so that we can back fill your spaces with others on the 
waiting list.  The Allen Center and Met cards will be deactivated 
immediately. Please contact Parking and Transportation if you have any 
questions.  You may hand your old card to the security guard at the garage 
exit through the end of this week.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Louis Allen
