Just wanted to give you a head's up.  We received last night from ED&F Man 
their form of proposed Clearing Agreement with the OMLX.  It appears they 
simultaneously sent it to the OMLX.  I am having my assistant fax a copy to 
you.  I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, I'll do that first thing this 
morning.  As you recall, we sent them the OMLX's form for signature a few 
weeks ago, and they've now come back with their form.  I don't know how 
customary it is to negotiate this with the OMLX?  Anyway, we'll take a look 
at it here and give you a call.
