Tana:
1. CMS Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company is not on any of my lists as a 
FERC-authorized power marketer, and we do NOT have a trading relationship 
with them.  Therefore, this entity is NOT authorized to trade U.S. power 
products.

2. Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC is a current trading partner.  I have 
a few calls out to see if I need to restrict their access to Enron Sales only 
and will let you know in a bit.

Leslie
