Souad,

We can use the Deemed ISDA format I already sent you.  And the guarantees 
(when we get them) should work for allfinancial transactions.

Tana,

Another deal was executed on 8/25/00 with  Gas Natural Mexico (#NW9602).  Can 
we have this deal roll up under the pending Deemed ISDA and Gty that their 
parent was to issue ENA (Use Credit Previously Provided)?

Give me a call at x6-6002 if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Veronica
