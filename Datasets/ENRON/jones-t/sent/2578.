Matt and Denis,

Can you help us with this NDA we need executed for an EnronCredit. meeting on 
Monday?  If you could print it out on EnronCredit.com letterhead and have 
Denis initial it for signature.  Because of time, Leslie can't initial this 
before we execute it, but we promise she will initial it before we send it 
out to the customer.  Then, can you have it executed by an officer of 
EnronCredit.com and return it to me at fax nol 713/646-3490.

Thanks for your help!
