It looks like Mark has been working on this from out of the office.  Maybe 
you don't have to do anything!

Richard -

Thanks so much for providing the below document.  While I appreciate its 
simplicity, it does not fully satisfy Enron's requirements.  If it is not too 
much trouble, could you or Kenneth please provide comments to the agreement 
provided.

I will be back in my office on Wednesday and can address matters directly 
with Kenneth or you at that time.
