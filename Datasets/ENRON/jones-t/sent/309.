Awais:

Attached please find my proposed revisions to the East and West Power Online 
Market Descriptions.  I have revised the first section (Background) of each 
document from an editorial perspective.  The remaining changes are intended 
to correct inaccuracies in the documents.  I've spoken with Allan Aronowitz 
about the fact that it might be a good idea to include some general 
disclaimers relating to any projections or the like included in these 
descriptions and think that it would be an excellent idea to include such a 
disclaimer.  I have accordingly left in some forward-looking type projections 
that I might otherwise recommend revising or deleting altogether.  If you do 
not intend to include any general disclaimers, let me know so that I can 
further revise as necessary.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 853-6121 with any questions or comments 
relating to the attached.

Regards, 

Leslie Hansen
