We just received what we hope is a final draft of the documents from Deutsche 
Bank, and I hope to respond back to you shortly, once I have had a chance to

Many thanks. Apologies for the error, I obtained Tana's e-mail details from
someone at Enron in London and they had misspelled it for me.

Thanks again for all your help.

Clare,

Thanks for your note.  Your e-mail trouble is due to the spelling of Tana's
name - should only be one 'n.'  I am forwarding this on to her.
