Per our conversation.

1.  Replace front outdoor light fixture.
2.  Add door numbers to bottom of front door (1920 Banks).
3.  Add door knocker to middle of front  door (cute kitty door knocker!).
4.  Replace light in front sunroom with new light.
5.  Fix window in back sunroom so it locks or closes (I'm afraid it would be 
easy to pry open, and we have had recent robberies in neighborhood).
