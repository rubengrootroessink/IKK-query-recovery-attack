Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving the following 
countries to the non-approved list:  Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Slovenia.  Below 
is the list, now updated to reflect this change.

Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives:  Finland, 
Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S..

Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include:  
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Singapore, 
Slovenia, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a 
non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a 
branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   
This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.
