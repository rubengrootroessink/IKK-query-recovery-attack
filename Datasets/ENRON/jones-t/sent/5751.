Notice No. 01-70
February 27, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX and COMEX Division Members and Member=20
Firms                                        All Clearing Member Firms

RE: Margin Credit for Spread Positions with the Goldman Sachs Commodity Ind=
ex

The NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a margin credit for the NYMEX=20
portion of a spread position with the CME Goldman Sachs Commodity Index=20
("GSCI"), effective at the close of business Wednesday February 28, 2001.

The GSCI contract is based on a basket of 26 commodities traded on a variet=
y=20
of markets. Included within that basket are several NYMEX and COMEX product=
s,=20
representing approximately 75% of the index.

Each Clearing Member providing sufficient documentation of a properly=20
allocated portfolio between the NYMEX and GSCI contracts will receive an 80=
%=20
credit against the outright margin in effect at that time. This spread cred=
it=20
is being adopted by NYMEX independent of any margin imposed by the CME on=
=20
GSCI contracts. The spread credit will be granted in 100 lot increments (ie=
.=20
100 GSCI contracts vs. the basket).

Spread Credit for each 100 GSCI contracts
