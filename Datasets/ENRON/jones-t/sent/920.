Would you supply Tana Jones with the exact name and date of the Master Firm 
and the Gisb with Entergy Power that orginally came from Columbia Energy.

Thanks,

Stacy

Entergy Power Marketing Corp. has applied for a Password and has asked us to 
give them a "comfort letter" stating that the current trading with them will 
go under the respective master for the product and not the online GTC.  I 
have spoken to Credit and we are trading financial gas, physical gas, and 
physical power (through EPMI).  Can you please let me know first, if you have 
a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern 
the product or would we need to use an override letter and if the master 
agreement will govern the trades, please provide me the exact name, parties 
and date of the contract.  Obviously, as usual with online matters, this is a 
RUSH.
