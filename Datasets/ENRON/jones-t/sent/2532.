Can you please add my assistant, Taffy Milligan, on for full edit access to 
the referenced database.  Can you also delete Shari Stack from edit 
capability, as she is no longer in our group.

Also, can you provide me a list of the individuals with full edit access.  I 
need to check to see if there are other people that have left our group or 
legal and credit that should be taken off.

Thanks!
