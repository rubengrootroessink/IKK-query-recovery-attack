I do have a copy of those.   Please provide me with a copy of the new one 
when it's signed.  Thanks for your help!

Paul,
We are just about to get the long-term agreement with Arthur Andersen 
signed.  I will attach the latest version of this, which we are waiting for 
AA to give final approval and assign .  We do have the short term agreement 
that was signed to provide the audit of the price reports from Nov. 1-30.  I 
believe Tana does have a copy of this contract.  (Tana- I think Claudia Clark 
also has a copy).  Let me know if you would like to see that copy as well.

Thanks.
Julie

Tana - we also have an agreement that has either been signed or is about to 
be signed with Arthur Andersen (whereby they provide 'audit' services for our 
EnronOnline Price Reports (aka indices).  Julie Ferrara should have this 
agreement if one of them hasn't already sent it to you.

Julie  - could you also forward me this agreement assuming you have it? Would 
be useful to have it in our other discussions with AA re: SECA Coal index .  
Thanks).

Subject: RUSH-EnronOnline Agreements

Attached is a list of the EnronOnline documents I am aware of.  Please let me 
know if there are any additional agreements that have not been included.  I 
have bolded those documents I am still trying to obtain copies of (and the 
person who might be aware of them).  If you have copies can you please 
provide them to me ASAP.

Thanks for your help.
