I'm helping Alan Aronowitz out with a presentation he has to give on the 
global energy markets and I was thinking that Paul recently did a 
presentation and maybe there might be some good slides on the European 
markets that I can pull in.  Can you locate, or find someone to locate, 
Paul's presentation, and email it to me.

I hope you get out of work at a decent hour today.  I bet you could use a 
beer with all the late nights you've been putting in.  How's the house going?

Thanks for your help!
