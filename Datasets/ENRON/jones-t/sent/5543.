My email was more directed to the lawyers, kinda telling them what their job 
was once they get access.  Whatever we need to do the load the systems, or 
whatever training, it's ok by me.

There are not any GTCs and it is not that simple to provide.  We have to load 
the application on the users machines.  We have to go through Tradespark to 
get access to the site.  Why don't we schedule some time so that I can show 
you how this works.

Please provide the following lawyers with a guest ID to the above website.  
The individuals listed next to the products will check any online GTC's (we 
think there are none), and/or short or long product descriptions to determine 
whether we are happy with the language/contract terms.
