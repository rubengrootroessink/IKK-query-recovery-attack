I am forwarding to each of you the referenced assignment with respect to 
physical trading and the online account.  I also called the company and got a 
copy of the name change document they were referring to in the assignment.

 David  --- I gave this doc to Tana Jones (for Eonline trading).  It also 
referred to physical deals, so she was going to pass it on to Debra 
Perkingiere.   Call Tana - she can tell you where it is at.   Thanks!     (it 
did not effect financial trading).

Could I have a copy of the assignment which I sent to you via interoffice 
mail the other day for
PPL Utilities?? I would be interested in picking this up from you if possible.

Thanks
David
