Re: Pacific Forest Resources

Unless this is another company or they have changed their name subsequent to 
the execution of the ISDA Master in 1998, we have an ISDA Master in place 
with this counterparty and have a copy of their Articles of Incorporation in 
the file, and there is no "Inc." at the end of this company's name.  If you 
would like me to send you a company of the company's Articles of 
Incorporation I will be happy to do so.
