You, as counsel, can agree to any form of NDA you think is acceptable.  I 
will print it out and bring it around for signature

Tana -

Peter's message below contains a form of NDA that was provided to New World 
by both EBS and Enron Puerto Rico.  While I realize they are not Net Works, 
if this form is acceptable, do we have to have special approval from ENW 
management to use a different form?  Let me know because I have no problem 
with the attached form and need to finalize this for Peter.

Thanks.

Lou,

Attached is the requested NDA with Enron Networks.  I added in the business
purpose regarding the Online Website.  This is form of the Enron NDAs
negotiated with Enron Broadband Services and Enron Puerto Rico.  This form
is different from the form Enron Net Works sent you as referenced below.  In
order to keep our NDAs consistent, David thought it would be best to stick
with one form agreement.  This form was the one sent to us by the other 2
Enrons - not our form.
