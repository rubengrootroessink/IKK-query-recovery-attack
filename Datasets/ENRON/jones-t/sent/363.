I spoke to Mary Solmonson about the chain of command in IT.  Obviously, 
everyone reports to Phillipe Bibi in the end.  She looked up Gary Bode, who 
Michael Neves, our Lotus Notes contact, reports to, and Gary is a Manager, 
but she didn't see his direct boss on the chart.  She suggested for the 
Fishkin Project that we try and use Inja Chun, a woman she says is very good, 
or Chris Behney.  (She said we could have her, but she would be very 
expensive!...just kidding!)  I'm going to give Danny Clark a call to see who 
at EES is using Documentum to manage their documents.  Perhaps we should set 
up a meeting to talk to Phillipe Bibi about the Fishkin project, so we make 
sure we get a good person assigned to us.   What do you think?
