Tana,

As I know that you are a lady with a great passion for, and knowledge of, 
English history, I thought that I would share with you the attached e-mail 
which was obviously written by an Englishman of the old school.  Please 
recite it to yourself using your best BBC English accent. 

Enjoy!!

Yours ever so

Mark
