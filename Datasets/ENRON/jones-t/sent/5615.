Sheri,

Obviously, you're aware that Brent Hendry had problems when he tried to log 
in yesterday.  Now Wayne Gresham has tried to log in and can't get in 
either.  I expect no one else can get in, they just haven't tried yet.  Can 
you go over your directions and figure out what's wrong.  Thanks...

Attached is the file that you guys need to load on your desktop.  It is 
pretty self explanatory - I am also sending the instructions I received from 
them.  I have a guest password that you can use to speed up the process.  
user id - sthomas   password - perry76




Installation Instructions:

  1. Double click on the EXE file that you have downloaded.
  2.  Run the Setup program (the program will guide you
through the setup, just follow the prompts).
  3.  Double click on the shortcut to load the application.
  4.  Enter the following User ID in the User Name box:
netnrg3
  5.  Click on the Preferences button and enter the following
IP address in both the Primary and Secondary Session Manager fields:

  6.  If you have a proxy server, check the "enable proxy" box 
and enter the server IP: port #.
  7.  Click OK
  8.  Enter the following password in the Password box:
espeed
  9.  Click the "Login" button
 10.  If you see your available instruments loading in the bottom
left hand corner of the screen, you have logged in successfully.
