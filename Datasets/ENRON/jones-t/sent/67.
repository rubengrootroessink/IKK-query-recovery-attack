It appears that you are signed up for this class, and the confirmation and 
approval should go to you & Scott.  Remember that you will be charged if you 
do not cancel if you are not going to go (and the charge for canceling is 
pretty high, about $1000.  There is no charge if you attend.  Also, let me 
know if you don't get the proper approval forms.

I need to sign up one of our U.K. attorneys for the Derivatives I class being 
held August 9-10 in Houston.  His name is Mark Elliott, his boss for approval 
purposes is Scott Sefton, head of London Legal, and Scott's billing 
information is 912/0729.  Can you please confirm Mark's time for this class 
as we need to book his plane reservations.  If you like, you can contact Mark 
via email for approvals, just let me know that that is how you plan on 
proceeding.  Thanks for your help.
