I will have your bike and helmet in the car and drop it by your house if
you
like.

What is Holly's email?

Looking forward to seeing you.

Lucinda will be joining us.  I havent heard back from Holly.  Maybe you
might want to give her a call too.  I'm sure she's a little stressed out
right now!  Maybe you could bring my bike & helmet when you come.

Good Morning!!

Did you get in touch with Holly and Lucinda?  Call anyone else you want...

See you then.  I will bring your bike.

Please call Carol.  How about the Buffalo Grille, or is that too busy?

Good!!  If you want to get Hollie, Lucinda, etc., to come, please feel free
to do so.  Is there any special place you want to go???

I have been thinking about you as well.  I have your bicycle and will
return
it to you when you are ready for it.  I can bring it on Saturday.  Will it
fit in your car?  If not, I can drop it by after breakfast.  Might need to
come by anyway to see what else you have done to it.

I will call Carol, too, if you don't care.

Breakfast at 10:00 sounds great!  Wherever you want to go...also, I need to
get my bike back from you, I might be doing some biking.  I've been
thinking about you.  Hope all is going well.

Miss Tana,

Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I
thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available.

I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at
10, or whatever...

Let me know.

Patti
