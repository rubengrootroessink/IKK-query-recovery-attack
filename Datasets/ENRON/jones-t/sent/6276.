I had a rush approval on this list, so while you were out having a baby 
(well, actually Louise was doing all the hard work!), I called Leslie at home 
at Elizabeth's direction because I had to get Sierra Pacific Holding Company 
approved.  We are currently purchasing power from them and Ed Sacks said we 
just gotten an EEI in place with them so Leslie approved them for both the 
bid and offer on west power (even tho Credit is going to open them up for 
purchases only).

No one has approved any other lists while you were out, so I have been 
patiently been waiting your return...sniff...sniff...
