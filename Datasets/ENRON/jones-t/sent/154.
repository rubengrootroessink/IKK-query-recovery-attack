I got a call while you were away from a woman at an affiliate of National 
Bank of Canada, they want to see our standard form of Repo Agreement to put 
in place for one of their affiliates "Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.", 1155 
Metcalfe Street, Montreal, QB  H3B 5G2. The contact is Theresa Pace (French 
pronounced) and her # is (514) 397-5850.  I spoke to Harry Arora about it, 
and he said Darren Delage is working on it, and Darren is out the week on 
vacation and to wait til he gets back next week to send it out.  So when you 
have a minute, let's talk about what to do.
