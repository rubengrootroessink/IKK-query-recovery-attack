I have gotten a phone call from Hydro-Quebec checking on the status of this.  
Can we expect a credit worksheet for an ISDA comparison?

Tana:  look in lotus notes.  I think you should contact Russell for Canada 
(since Rod is gone).  Cyntia Pastega is the business person.  SS

Hydro Quebec has forwarded to us their form of ISDA Schedule for the 
referenced counterparty for review.  There is no indication of what Enron 
business person is interested in this counterparty.  I will forward a copy of 
the ISDA to Mr. "Canada" Suttle, and open a Lotus Notes entry with the 
contact information.  We won't do anything until we receive a credit 
worksheet from Credit.
