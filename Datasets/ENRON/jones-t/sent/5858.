Mary,

All those traps with security were worked out 4 years ago.  London can get 
into the o: drive from there, the only directory they have access to in the 
o: drive is the atty.fms bank.  If we put the swap forms back there, they can 
get at them.  I know, because I've pulled them up myself from London.

Do you understand that this is the case?  There seems to be confusion.

Mary,

I have spoken to Taffy regarding this matter.  She said that even if we move 
the forms within atty.fms, that the satillite office will still not be able 
to access them.

The only way that the forms whether in stty.fms or SWAP FORMS can be only 
accessed if one can access our "o" drive.
Therefore, each satillite office must contact computer security @ Enron an 
request access to our "o" drive.

Thats the story.

Thanks for sending out the redlines.  Where are we in moving the forms back 
into atty.fms?  How is this done?

All,

Last week we rolled-out new versions to our financial trading forms found in 
the SWAP FORMS directory.   The new versions are located in the Current Forms 
subdirectory, which is located within the SWAP FORMS directory.

For your convenience in tracking our changes, set forth below are redlined 
version of such forms:



  


Further, there now exists a new version of Annex B for ECC.  The changes 
therein coorespond to those made under the Annex B for ENA.

If any of you would like clean versions of such documents, please access them 
through the SWAP FORMS directory.
