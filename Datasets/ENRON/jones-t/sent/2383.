Dear Mr. Dune,

At the request of Dovie Keprta, I am enclosing our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.  I have also enclosed a blacklined draft showing 
the changes from the NDA you executed with Enron Broadband.  If the enclosed 
meets with your approval, please have an authorized officer execute two 
copies and return them to me for execution by Enron.  If you have any 
comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.
