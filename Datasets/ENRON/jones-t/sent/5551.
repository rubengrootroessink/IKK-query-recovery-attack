Lisa,

I have a call into the physical steel lawyer.  We will not be able to copy =
an=20
existing profile for physical steel.  Physical steel is a totally new onlin=
e=20
product for us.  We, obviously, cannot copy financial steel, because=20
counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not ESP's, if=
=20
their master doesn't let them trade steel, etc (the usual swap issues).  Wh=
at=20
I think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why any=
=20
counterparty cannot trade physical steel, so I would open all counterpartie=
s=20
up to trade it.  I'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm th=
is.

Just a note, Global Contracts should also not be able to copy a profile,=20
because they should have a totally new GTC dealing with physical steel issu=
es=20
specifically.  I'm sure Karen will probably copy me in on her email.  Just =
in=20
case...I want to confirm what Global Contracts is saying for this one...

I'll get back to you to confirm the above for Legal.
