As Frank indicated below, below is a new bandwidth product being introduced 
online.  Frequently, if we have a new product and it is close enough in 
character to another product, we just mirror the approvals we have already 
given to the mirrored product.  Does this strategy work for you, or are there 
any issues we are unfamiliar with that would require us to review this 
product in a totally different manner?

Below is the description of the new bandwidth product type that is rolling 
out shortly.  My initial thoughts are to copy the profiles from the existing 
physical bandwidth product types.  Please send me any comments as soon as 
possible.

Thanks!!!!
