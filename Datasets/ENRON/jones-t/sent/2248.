Just a note re: "Miller Balish O'Neil PC" on the list from the 25th.  I just 
had a conversation with Mark about that one, it sounds awfully like a law 
firm to us.  Unless a member of the Legal Dept. requests a guest ID for a law 
firm doing legal research for us, we should never grant guest ID's to a law 
firm.  It can only hurt us!  It's possible it could be an accounting firm.  
Per Mark, we wouldn't want to grant accounting firms access either.  "PC" 
(for professional corporation) is a good giveaway that we might have one or 
the other.
