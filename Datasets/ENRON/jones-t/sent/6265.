Cute kitty, makes me want to get another kitten.  It's hard to believe Frank 
ever looked like that, tho...!

Every time I see a picture like this, I'm more ready to bring one of these
critters home, but I am sure J & L would put me out and change the locks,
too.

Do I have cat duty this month when you head to the wine country?
