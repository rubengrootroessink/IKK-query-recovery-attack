On the 9/11/00 list, Credit wants to open Ontario Power to trade financial 
power, but I cannot until we speak to Canadian outside counsel.  They are 
part of the split up of Ontario Hydro, which was the Province of Ontario, and 
obviously, a governmental, before the split up.  They are still a wholly 
owned sub of a governmental and we cannot open them up until we talk to 
outside counsel about the governmental issues.  I have a call into Canadian 
counsel right now.

Also, on the 9/8/00 list, Sempra Energy Solution called me to find out when 
they could trade, so if you could open them up pronto...
