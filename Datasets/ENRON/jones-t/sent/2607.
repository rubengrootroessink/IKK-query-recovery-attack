Tana:  Here's the background info.  Do you want to prepare the ISDA CSA?  We 
will also need an amendment to replace the old with the new.  I now need to 
reread Tanya's message.  Sara

Sara,

With respect to the amendment to the B of A ISDA Credit Support Annexe, the 
contact at B of A is James Allred (MD Energy Finance Group & Credit 
Products). He will pass the docs onto the relevant lawyer.

Tel: 713 651 4830
Fax: 713 651 4841

As you suggested, I have spoken with Tanya re. the Credit Support Annexe, & 
she will be sending you a worksheet. 

I have left messages with Teresa re. Mahonia docs. I would be grateful if you 
would speak with her so that we have consistency in the Chase & Mahonia 
contracts.

Please give me a call if you need anything else. 

Many thanks, 

Soma
