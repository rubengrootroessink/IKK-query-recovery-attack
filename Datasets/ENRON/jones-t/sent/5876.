Mark,
The customer changed their mind again & wants an termination letter produced 
for the 2 deals attached.

Tana,
Please let me know if you need any other information in order to create the 
documentation neccessary. 
Thank you for your help.

Hetco  and Enron have mutually agreed to cancel these transactions and not 
net them out via eol. Sorry for any confusion. Please send them the 
apropriate paperwork. Thank You
