Stacy,

I don't know anything about this, I guess it's yours?

I'm not sure who the best person to address this issue to is. Please let me 
know if this is something you can answer:

Canada has inadvertently created two products, one 29-day (Feb) and one  
31-day (Mar) in the > 1 Month < 1 Year category, and wants to move them to 
the < 1 Month category. As you can see below, the GTC's are the same for 
either category. Can you check and make sure that the Master Agreements don't 
prohibit this?

Looks like I was confused. There is only one Canadian GTC. The split was done 
solely to accomodate the different Master Agreements.

I don't have a problem moving 31 day deals into the <1 month category, but 
you should check with Contracts first, to confirm that the <31 day Canadian 
Master Agreements do not prohibit this.

Edmund: Here is the latest Canadian GTC.

Mark/Elena:  We have two kinds of Master Agreement in Canada: Less than 31 
days and greater than 31 days. As a result, we will need the two product 
types for Western Canadian Gas. However, the same Canadian GTC can be mapped 
to both product types. Could you two please coordinate on making the 
necessary changes to the system and spreadsheet?

If this is not clear to anyone, please call.

Thanks,

Dave

Per my voice mail, here are the revised GTC's for Canada.  Section 2 
Securities Representation has been tweaked.
