I just spoke to John Cameron, the lawyer for the Company and our plan is to 
email him, an associate of his, and Doug Thomas the draft as soon as it is 
ready.    I will also fax John Cameron the draft.   Tracy Ngo in Credit is 
working up the credit, and I am doing as much of the draft as I can pending 
credit.  Carol St. Clair, a lawyer in our Group here in Houston, will be 
reviewing the draft.  As this is moving quickly, please provide us with any 
updates of information.

Gentlemen, as we speak Enron's Credit and Legal teams are conversing on the 
best way to approach, either an ISDA or a Long Form Confirm, for "papering" 
the requested financial hedge.  Once Enron Credit is "comfortable" with 
Bellingham Cold Storage (BCS), Legal will prepare the necessary 
documentation, once approved by BCS/John Cameron, I will quote work up some 
July executable numbers and attempt to contact the Robert, Doug, John C.  
This will require everyone's joint efforts in order to accomplish this in 
such a short time line.  BCS and John Cameron should anticipate a call from 
either or Enron's Credit and Legal personnel.  Thanks,  John

We need numbers as soon as possible this morning -- also these must be
serious -- not notional.

I am at 771-5090.  I will be available at 784-3758 all day.  My email
follows me around so you can always get me  on email.
