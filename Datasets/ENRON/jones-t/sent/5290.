My understanding of this NDA is that London gave it directly to Craig Chaney 
to get executed by the counterparty.  So, David, I think you need to get a 
copy from Craig, and then forward a copy on to me.

Tana:

I have not yet received a copy of this NDA.  Have you?  If so, please 
distribute to David as he requested.  If not, please contact Robert Harris at 
Credit2B at the e-mail below and ask him to fax you a copy.

Could I have 2 copies of this. Has our London office received a signed copy 
as well?

Thanks
