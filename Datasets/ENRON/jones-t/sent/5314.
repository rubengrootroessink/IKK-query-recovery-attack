We have several ISDA with Lehman Brothers.  Attached is an Icon that will 
allow you to view the Financial Trading Agreement Database, which all the 
Legal Dept., including the London Legal Dept. should use to track their 
financial master agreements.  Matt Dawson know how to use this database, if 
you need to visit with him.

By copy of this email to Mike Neves, I am requesting that you be granted full 
edit access to this database (Mike, Denis is a lawyer from London).

Further to our telephone conference call this afternoon I thought it would
be useful to set out the points that were discussed and the outstanding
issues together with an indication of who is responsible for the next step
on those points.  Please find attached a document which does this.  I
understand that the parties would like to have a further conference call
tomorrow or probably more likely on Friday to revisit these issues and see
what progress has been made.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any queries.

Kind regards,

Clare Godson
Allen & Overy
