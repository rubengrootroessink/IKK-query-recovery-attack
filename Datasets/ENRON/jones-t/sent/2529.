Matt,

 As you may or may not know, I am the liason in Houston between the Online 
Team and Legal, coordinating all responses for counterparty approvals for all 
products.  I am asking because until recently I have not been approving 
Singapore counterparties to trade any financial products.  It has been my 
understanding that there are not problems for any counterparties trading 
physical products.  I can continue my practice of not opening Singapore 
incorporated counterparties to trade financial products online until I get a 
real push from a counterparty that wants to trade financial.  Should that be 
my continuing practice?

Hi Tana

Trust you are well.

OTC derivatives are not regulated in Singapore. The issue is whether a 
particular product type may infringe gaming or insurance regulations. This is 
particularly pertinent to Weather and Credit, for which I would need to 
consult external counsel for definite answers. Is there a new commercial push 
to do so at this time? We haven't any Weather and Credit traders here in 
Singapore.

As for metals, if they are exchange traded futures contracts (eg. London 
Metals Exchange contracts), the trading of gold would be regulated.

There is no category of counterparty that would be particularly problematic. 
Capacity issues would be determined by each company's constitutional 
documents.

Hope this helps.

Regards
Matt

Matt,

Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for 
Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have 
(like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.):

Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals)
Weather Derivatives
Credit Derivatives

Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade 
any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?  I am going to 
attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products 
we trade.

Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in 
Singapore?  For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for 
no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required 
before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc.  



Thanks!
