Per our discussion when I was in London, we ordered you  a box of blue files 
and sent them to you (for your original deal files since you said you 
couldn't get those types of files in England).  One of our assistants got a 
call from what I guess must be Meagan and she (Meagan) said she was sending 
the files back because it wasn't what she wanted.  So if you do want the blue 
files you might want to intervene with Meagan before the files cross the 
Atlantic again.  We would, of course, be able to use the files here, so no 
big deal.
