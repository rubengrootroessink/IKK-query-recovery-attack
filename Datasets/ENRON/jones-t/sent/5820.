Nope, not yet.  I'm absolutely swamped...!!!  I haven't forgotten about it 
tho.  My short agenda is Day 1:  Go over basics of financial documentation 
w/confirm desk team & your assistants (maybe 2-4 hours depending on level of 
detail we go into) (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 
2:  Go over specifics of confirmations with your assistants so they can 
prepare the Special Legal/Credit Annex for a confirm and review how to read a 
credit worksheet and what the credit issues mean (spend rest of day approving 
online counterparties), Day 3:  Spend time with you & Peter going over what I 
went over with assistants & confirm people, then maybe spend time letting any 
of your dealmakers quiz me as they desire about swap issues (spend free time 
approving online counterparties).

Don't add a lot of people on, I get really nervous speaking in front of large 
groups...I am a shy girl, you know!

My thoughts are

Tana, Peter just asked me to follow up with you as to whether you have had a 
chance to prepare a draft agenda for when you are in Calgary.  Peter and I 
would like to review it before it gets distributed to everyone.

Thanks
Greg
