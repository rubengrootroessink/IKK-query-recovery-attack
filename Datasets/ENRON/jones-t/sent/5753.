I left you a voicemail yesterday about getting a master in place with 
Anadarko located here in Houston so they can trade Brent Crude and IPE 
lookalikes on EnronOnline under a master instead of a GTC.  We have an ISDA 
in place with Anadarko, but since ECTRIC is the counterparty online for those 
products, the trades wouldn't go under the ENA master.  The trader is 
pestering me about this.

What I would like to do is handle getting this ISDA in place with ECTRIC here 
in Houston, if that's OK with you, just mirroring the US master (except 
getting a Multicurrency in place since we have a Local Currency in place with 
ENA).  Is that OK with you?
