Edmund,

Below is the standard information we always have in every email when we get a 
master swap agreement executed.  With this email Global Counterparty can open 
the counterparty. We then immediately send the master swap agreement and 
other documentation down in the attached memo.    If we get the master in 
signed but we're waiting on critical additional documentation  (like the 
guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental) we hold off on sending 
the email.  Sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on 
incumbency certificates (which we do not consider critical in most 
circumstances) so we may send the email, send down whatever executed 
documentation we have, while we wait on the certificates.  We used to wait to 
send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed, 
but they can't approve the counterparty without getting the master.  Does 
this make sense?...

I am now going to look for one with special instructions...

Below is my standard memo to Global Contract with any kind of executed 
documents I send down to them.  Also, a new procedral thing that is evolving 
here in Houston, we used to send Global Contracts the originally executed 
guarantees, but Credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all 
guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future (with a 
copy in the Global Contract file)
