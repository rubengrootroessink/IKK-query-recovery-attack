Anthony,

I just spoke to the Entergy lawyer, and this merger isn't effective until 
2/1/01.  She will be sending me documents when they are filed with the 
Delaware Secretary of State.  So you don't need to worry about this.

Please let me know if someone in SAP is already working with EOL on this and, 
if so, the status.

Thank you,

heads up

Effective February 1, 2001, Koch Energy Trading and Entergy Power Marketing 
will be merging.  The new name will be Axia Energy Trading.  I have left a 
voice mail for Karen to call the customer with details of what Enron requires 
to accomplish this change in our systems.  I also conferenced Vikkie Karel 
(Koch Energy  -- 713-544-5269) with Walter for clarification of the parties 
that are merging.

Regarding EOL users from both companies, is there a way that the customer can 
keep IDs/filters/etc. and move to the new name? OR, will new IDs need to be 
created?  ===== this is for you, Stephanie

Griff
