Jill,

We haven't seen credit come through yet.  We can't do anything without it.

Russell & Brad, Have you been able to get with United regarding Credit 
approval for a Master SWAP Agreement ?  We have given them several quotes on 
a collar this past week, but can't transact until we get the contracts in 
place. (We need financial and physical contracts).  If you haven't reached 
them, please let me know. The contact for credit issues is Leigh Prieto, CFO 
and his number is 512-328-8184. The trading contact is Doyle Valdez. Thanks.
