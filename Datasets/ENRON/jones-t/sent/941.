I continue to say "no" for financial because they are not an eligible swap 
participant.  For a counterparty to become an eligible swap participant if 
they are not one in their own right, they would have to post an up front 
letter of credit fully covering their trading PRIOR to doing any trades.  So 
this ball is in Credit's court.
