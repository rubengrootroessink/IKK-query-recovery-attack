Thanks for the update!  I hope things are getting better for you since you're

We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00 
("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the 
approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed 
the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and 
paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and 
option transactions"  with ENA.

For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we 
trade.  For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps 
and options.  If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both 
ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval.

I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts 
and Camille Gerard.
