Per my conv. w/Carol St. Clair, Crestar commented on the ETA, but never 
requested that their comments be formalized as an amendment.  Per our 
understanding, they have not requested a signed amendment and opened the 
counterparty w/o any changes, so we have not pursued them.

Tana,

Can you confirm the status of the amendment with Crestar?

Thanks,

Dave

Dave,

I spoke with Carol St. Clair last week who told me that the ETA has been 
worked out with Crestar.  Would you please confirm that for me before I call 
them.

Thanks.

Lisa
