Raquel -

Thanks for the message.  I will get the letter and Password App. out to you 
tomorrow.  As to the ETA, the reason we do a side letter on the changes is 
because every user of EnronOnline is required to "click" on the on-line ETA 
prior to using the system.  Accordingly, the process is really this - 

- PGW completes the PA and submits it to EnronOnline
- Presuming approval of the PA, EnronOnline issues the appropriate password 
and user id to PGW
 - PGW signs onto the system using the password and user id
 - After being asked to change the password, the on-line ETA appears and PGW 
must "click" to accept in order to use the system

Since the ETA is not agreed to until access is first obtained to the system, 
if you want to wait to sign the amendment letter, that is fine.  Either way, 
I will have them forwarded.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

Thanks Mark.  They look OK.  I think Enron needs to send them to us, because
the sideletter to the Electronic Trading Agreement ("ETA") needs to be on
Enron letterhead (see attached).  If it is acceptable to you, please send
the Password App, ETA, and Side Letter to my attention at:

Thanks for your help on this one.

Raquel:

Please see my proposed revisions to the Password App.  Let me know if this
addresses your concerns.  If so, please provide me with the full name of PG
Works, as well as the mailing address and recipient for the side letter so
that I can finalize.

Regards,

Leslie

Leslie:  Thanks.  My only comment is that your suggested language should
also apply to Condition (2), second paragraph, of the "Enron Online
Password
Application." Please let me know if you concur.  Thanks.
