Hey Gang,
Just wanted to let you know that I will be joining Elizabeth Sager's group at 
Mark H's request.  I will continue to work on and finish most of the day to 
day ISDA work that I am currently involved in, but please forward all future 
work to others in the group.  If you are not sure about a file, please call 
me or stop by.  It has been a pleasure to work with all of you as I continue 
to believe that out of all of the legal assistant groups, you are the hardest 
working and brightest, not to mention the fact that the swaps group could not 
exist and function the way it does without you.   I will certainly miss 
working with all of you.
