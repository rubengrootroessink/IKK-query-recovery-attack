To All:

I have attached an omnibus confirm worksheet for a transaction with this 
counterparty.  We require a guaranty from their parent.  We recently 
transacted with this counterparty at which time we required the same 
collateral (Marie Heard worked on this).  They failed to provide the guaranty 
and unwound the positions.  Now they say they will provide the guaranty. At 
the time of the initial transaction they sent over thier format which Shari 
Stack reviewed and commented, which I have a copy of.  I feel we should 
attach a red-line version of this guaranty to the confirm for their review.

Please advise,

Russell.
