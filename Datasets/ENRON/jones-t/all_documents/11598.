Matt,

Back office should have access to insert confirmations comments.  Yumi Takei 
needs to be on the back office list (not the lawyers list) - Gail Hill and 
Carol Findlay also need to be added; you should also ask ask them whether any 
other back office staff need access to add coments.

Credit need to have edit access for inserting credit comments. 

Add Denis O'Connell and Paul Johnson to the lawyers list.

Note that I am the only person in London with delete capability.

Thanks, Edmund
