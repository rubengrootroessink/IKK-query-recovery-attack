Sorry for the delay, but you know how pushy lawyers and commercial types can 
be (the HPL one's).

Anyhow, after hours of consultation with the appropriate parties, the 
rounding convention
below looks to be correct.

I am deeply hurt that I was not included in the political swankienda.  I feel 
like one of the survivors that
was kicked off the island.

We've got a draft master with the following rounding conventions:

Short tons: zero decimals
Temperatures:  zero decimals
US Dollar Amounts:  to the nearest cent

Do you know whether those are our standard rounding conventions?

P.S.  Do you get a invite to our favorite email person's political swankienda?
