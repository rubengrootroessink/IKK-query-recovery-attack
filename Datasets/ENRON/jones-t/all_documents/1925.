I found the partially executed NDA on my desk yesterday.  I thought it was a 
copy, but it must be the original.  I'll mail it to you, Tana, and then you 
can send us back a fully executed copy.

Lorraine, Mike is wrong.  I never got the fax of the executed NDA.  May he 
could call his contact at the company and get them to send it to me?!

Yahoo signed this nondisclsure agreement.  And fax'd it back to Tana Jones.  
Will you call Tana, make sure we executed the document and fax'd back to 
Yahoo, and get a copy for our files.  We also need to set-up and new file for 
Yahoo.

Thanks...
