As we do with all Tradenames, Divisions, DBAs etc., we create Type 3 records 
"child records"
 which we then link to a Type 1 record "legal entity".

If a Trader wants to trade under "Scooby Doo", we can do it and have all 
exposure roll-up to his legal entity record.

Hello Tana,

In answer to your question - - both. Ripon Community Printers is a Tradename 
for Lyke Corporation.

Best Rgds.

Is the counterparty known by the above ID Lyke Corporation or Ripon Community 
Printers, I'm confused?
