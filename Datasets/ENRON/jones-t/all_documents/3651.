We've encountered another error with TAGG this morning and you may not be 
able to access the application from your main Start Programs menu.  However, 
you can access it through Terminal Server by doing the following:

From your desktop click on "Terminal Server"
You should be at "Enron Remote Services" homepage
You can now select "General Purpose Cluster 2 - Notes R5"
You will be prompted to enter your network ID and Password - then click OK
You are now at a black screen with four icons on your left and the "START" 
button right below the black screen - select "Programs" "Trading" "Deal 
Clearing"

If you're still not able to access TAGG from Terminal Server, contact the 
Resolution Center at 34888.

TAGG upgrade has been completed and we can now access the application.  When 
you first launch TAGG it will take a couple of minutes to do a workstation 
installation, once the installation is complete you will see the familiar 
screen where you enter your password.  

Thanks.

As of this morning, we have lost access to TAGG applications.  All Windows 
2000 users will not be able to access TAGG until the upgrade is completed.  
The team anticipates completion of the upgrade by the end of the week.

Thanks.
Nony
