I do not believe that I have already sent the attached ISDA worksheet.  I 
have also checked the Lotus Notes d/b and did not find any entry for Micron.  
So I assume I did not send it.  Anyway, please begin drafting if it is not 
already started.  Michael Moulton is interested in getting it completed, and 
he has a better than average record of closing deals.

Thanks.
Paul
