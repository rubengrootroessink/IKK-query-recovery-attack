Pursuant to the documentation the counterparty provided when they entered 
into the power EEI, and at the direction of Marcus Nettelton, a lawyer in the 
power group, the counterparty name for the Port of Oakland should set up in 
GCP as follows:

The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Board 
of Port Commissioners

GCP, if you could please redo the counterparty name, and Stephanie, if you 
could please resubmit the PA to match the counterparty name, then we can get 
this one done...
