Nanette/Lee -

Attached are the updated versions of the BETA and FA, as well as clean 
versions of each.  Please review these at your earliest convenience. 

If all is in order, please have two originals of each document printed for 
signature by an authorized officer of Prebon.  Once each document is signed 
and dated (and the Password is completed in the FA), please fax a copy of 
each agreement to Bob at 713-646-2126.  Enron will countersign the faxed copy 
and forward a copy to your attention via fax.  The originals should also be 
forwarded to Bob so that they can be physically countersigned by Enron.  

Please let me know if there is anything further that either of you should 
need.

Thanks for the continued cooperation on this matter.
