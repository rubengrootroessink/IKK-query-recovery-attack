Tana:

Please prepare 2 execution copies (or do we need 4 so that each of the Enron 
companies has a copy) of a Confidentiality Agreement in the form attached 
below.  The only changes from the original form that you sent to Redibook is 
the change in the name of the CP from REDIBOOK to Spear Leeds in the first 
line and the signature block and the change from Texas law to New York law in 
the 2nd line of Section 5.  

Thanks,

Leslie
