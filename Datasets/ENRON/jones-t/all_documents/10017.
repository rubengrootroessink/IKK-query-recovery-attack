Super Savings Abroad

Dear Tana,

Spring is nearly here, and that means it's time to think seriously=20
about planning your next trip, whether it's for spring break, summer=20
vacation, or just because you're tired of being cooped up in the=20
house. Whatever your reason for traveling, consider going a little=20
further afield this time. International travel isn't as expensive or=20
as complicated as you might think. And, as always, we're here to=20
help. Travelocity.com has loads of online information to help you=20
decide where to go--and great deals to help put your trip within the=20
reach of your budget. It's a big world out there--it's time to=20
discover it!=20

***FEATURED THIS MONTH***

Win a Trip to Scotland
Enter to win a trip to Scotland. One lucky winner and guest will=20
receive the vacation of their choice: a golf vacation, a hiking=20
tour of Scotland, or a romantic getaway. Don't miss out, enter by=20
April 30, 2001.=20

Barcelona
Save 15% on your airfare when you pay with a MasterCard!
Barcelona surely ranks among Europe's most beautiful and artistic=20
cities. Picasso called this city home for a time, and there's a=20
museum devoted to Mir?, as well. But the most obvious works of art=20
are the examples of architecture unique to Barcelona. The eccentric=20
genius Antoni Gaud? erected a number of eye-catching buildings here,=20
including his unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia cathedral.=20
Also worth seeing is the old gothic quarter, full of postcard-perfect=20
winding alleys and hidden shops and galleries. Far from living in its=20
past, however, Barcelona offers plenty in the way of modern pleasures=20
of dining and bar-hopping, as well.=20

Mexico
Save $25 per person to Mexico!
Whether it's culture or beaches, margaritas or Mayan artifacts that=20
you seek, there's a vacation for everyone in Mexico. From the teeming=20
streets of Mexico city to the jungle ruins of Chich,n-Itza, adventure=20
abounds. Of course, so does relaxation. Beach resorts such as Canc?n=20
and Cozumel provide as much sun and surf as you could ever want. You=20
can also escape the crowds in more off-the-beaten-path locations such=20
as Zihuatanejo and Mazatlan. Whatever you're looking for in a=20
vacation, you'll find it in Mexico.=20

Copenhagen
Save 15% on your airfare when you pay with a MasterCard!
Copenhagen isn't Amsterdam, but it is one of Europe's livelier=20
cities. Maybe it's the need to cut loose after the long, dark=20
winters. Maybe its the glorious, nearly endless spring and summer=20
days. Whatever it is, Danes certainly know how to have fun. And=20
whatever your idea of fun is, you'll find it in Copenhagen. From the=20
timeless amusement of the world-famous Tivoli Gardens to the longest=20
pedestrian shopping street in Europe to the continent's largest jazz=20
festival, Copenhagen makes for a delightful vacation.=20

Dublin
Great fares to Ireland from Aer Lingus--only on Travelocity!
Dublin is a shining example of how a city can turn its fortunes=20
around in less than a decade. Once an overlooked corner of the=20
British Isles (think The Commitments), this "Celtic Tiger" has=20
transformed itself into a beautiful, vibrant city. Attractions=20
such as Trinity College, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and, of course,=20
the Guinness Brewery still pull in visitors as they always did.=20
But today, shopping, dining, and night life are also first-rate,=20
and the city attracts much of the same well-heeled, fun-loving=20
crowd that used to head directly to London, Rome, and other urbane=20
European capitals.=20

Brazil
Save $100 on your South American vacation!
The bad news is you've missed Carnival. The good news is, the drunken=20
crowds have all gone home, and this is an excellent time to see the=20
real Rio de Janeiro. Rio is one of the most exotic cities in the=20
Western Hemisphere, a place where the infectious rhythms of samba and=20
bossa nova are in the air and the beach is a way of life. Of course,=20
there's more to Brazil than just this one city. The Amazon jungle=20
beckons the adventurous, and the country's Iguassu Falls are a=20
must-see for nature lovers. Discover the passionate way of life that=20
is Brazil!=20

Rome
Save 15% with British Airways to Rome!
It's said that all roads lead to Rome, and you owe it to yourself to=20
test that theory one of these days. Europe's most ancient city offers=20
an exciting blend of the historical and the modern. Sip cappuccino=20
next to monuments older than Christianity. Shop for shoes along=20
streets once trod by emperors. Shop for postcards in the shadow of=20
the Sistine Chapel. Few places on earth boast this concentration of=20
art and history, and fewer still wrap it a package as beguiling=20
as Rome.=20

Travelocity's Been There
We've already been there...and you can go there too! Been There! from=20
Travelocity.com features real stories by real people (our own=20
hardworking, travel-loving employees) who've been to great=20
destinations! Read about our adventures then make your plans to go=20
