Tana:

here's the fax number for the ERS confidentiality agreement when we have an 
executed copy to send to them for execution.

212-819-0171 is the correct fax number.  917-522-1622 is the correct phone
number, although I can also be reached at our general number 212-819-0170.

Please confirm that your fax number is 212-819-0171.  (The phone number I
had for you was wrong, so I don't want to rely on this fax number either.)

Send the execution copy to me.  Faxed signature pages are fine.

Steve:

All of your proposed changes are acceptable.  I'm finalizing the document
as per the attached and will have it sent to you for execution after I have
had it executed on my end.  To whom should I send the execution document?
In the interests of time, I suggest that we exchange fax copies.

Regards,
