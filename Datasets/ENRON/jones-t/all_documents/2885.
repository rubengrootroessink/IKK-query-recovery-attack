Tana,

In light of recent decisions regarding EOL procedures, your assistance in 
answering the following questions is requested.  Since the new products are 
already being traded, I would appreciate your answers at your earliest 
convenience.

Thank You,
Anthony

Subject: EOL -- New Financial Product Types

Should EOL copy existing Financial Master contracts into the new financial 
product categories?
Where a previous contract restriction exists, should EOL copy existing 
Financial Master contracts into those previously restricted financial 
categories or leave the category blank without a Financial Master?
