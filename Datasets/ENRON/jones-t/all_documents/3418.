Thanks for this - Leslie had thought that you would like to have a response 
next to each name. But I will take you up your suggestion!

If I recall correctly - only the first one had "Declined" next to the name. 
For the others - I had to scroll right to look for Credit's "X" in the 
product list. Do you want me to mention those where Credit has put an X?

Shari,

To save you some time in the future, if a counterparty says "declined" on the 
worksheet, you don't even have to look at it at all, because it means Credit 
has decided not to trade with them.
