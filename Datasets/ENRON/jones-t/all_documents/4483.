Dave:

That very well may be the case.  The legal department likes to maintain 
copies of all executed documents that run through us, and Tana Jones is the 
appropriate person to receive these copies.  EOL may have a process for 
maintaining contracts as well -- I'll leave it to you to determine what that 
process is -- please let me know for future reference.  If EOL maintains 
originally executed contracts, the legal department would like to maintain 
copies of all such documents for our records.

I believe that we are keeping all legal documents in a file section that EOL 
maintains.  Leslie - please let me know if this is not correct.  If OK then I 
can introduce Victor to the right people in EOL.

thanks
Dave

Leslie, 

1. Do we have a filing system for legal documents such as the agreements 
between us and INSI and the affidavits received from prize winners?  If so 
how do I go about filing things there, if not where would be an appropriate 
place to compile these documents and for how long should they be kept? 

2. Do we need to have internal (Enron) prize winners sign affidavits?  If so 
can we send the same docs we used for the external prize winners and if not 
could you draft and send me the new versions.

Cheers

Victor
