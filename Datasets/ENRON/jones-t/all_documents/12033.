If you are looking for a copy of an ISDA  Master Agreement with Exxon, there 
is none.  If you are looking for a physical power master you need to contact 
Rhonda Denton.  I have access to financial trading agreements only.

Don Scott of Exxon Power Team contacted the EOL Call Center this morning 
requesting a copy of his Company Master Agreement because it has been 
misplaced.  I am not sure if you are the correct person to handle such 
request.  Could you please assist or forward to the correct party responsible 
for such a request.
