 You forwarded to me a letter from Enron Corp. to the above vendor 
authorizing the use of a subcontractor by the name of Jason Yang.

The letter is non-specific as to name and title but since the work is for the 
Online Project, I would imagine that Philippe Bibi would be the appropriate 
person.  

I have not submitted the letter to Philippe for signature for two reasons:  

(1) We do not have the original Agreement for Project Services.  I don't know 
who executed it but it is not in our files. 
(2) There are actually a couple of standard subcontractor agreements that we 
ask the Contractor and Sub-Contractor to execute.  I am attaching electronic 
copies to this e-mail and printed copies to the hard copy which I am 
returning to you along with the original letter.  

If we find the person (Corporate Officer) who signed the original Agreement 
for Project Services, we should have that person sign all of these documents 
and then formally transmit them to the vendor.  We need the original 
agreement before we can proceed.

Please call me if I can be of help.     

The subcontractor agreements are attached below.  gene
