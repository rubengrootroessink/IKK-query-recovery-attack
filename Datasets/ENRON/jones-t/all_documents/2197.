Hello Everyone,

Per John Suttle, we are to use the same credit worksheet and attach the same 
assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine to the confirmations of the 
below deals. 

Our customers are waiting for our confirms so if we can put Twister(John S.) 
and Strata Energy (should have received worksheet from Brad S.) on our 
priority list, that would be wonderful.

Thanks,
Sheetal :)

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:
Todd Tharp
Manager of Gas Contracts
Sanguine, Ltd.
1861 East 71st Street South
Tulsa, Ok 74136

Thanks,

John
