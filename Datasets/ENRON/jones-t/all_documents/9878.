Tana, I spoke with Steve Castleberg last week (3/2).  We have closed out this 
application since Alliant Energy Corporation is already approved with an 
execute ID and Steve Castleberg is a user under that entity.  After speaking 
to him, he will access the site using his current ID under Alliant Energy 
Corporation.  Thanks.

Walter

The fellow from Alliant keeps calling me to check on the status of his access 
to EnronOnline.  We received the executed ETA Amendment about 3 weeks ago and 
he is really hot to trade.  Can you give me some estimate of when we can 
expect to get him out of Credit, or call him if there are some credit 
issues?  His name is Steve Castleberg and his ph: is 608/877-8207.  Thanks!
