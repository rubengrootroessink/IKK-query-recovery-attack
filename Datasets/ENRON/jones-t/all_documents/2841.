Forward the agreement to Mr. Fredericks.  There is no problem between
counsel.  I'm alerting Mr. O'Connor not to expect the ca.

Mark,

I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who
your
attorney should be on this deal.  I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, and
left
him a message to which he finally responded.  He is now expecting to see
this
CA.  I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney.  I don't
want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your
direction
as to how I should handle this.

I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone
number is 713/853-3399.
