Holly,
The seats upfront are for Continental Elite members.  Her profile does not
show she is a Continental OnePass member.  I called Continental to see what
they could do.  Since she is traveling with an Elite member(Mark Taylor, and
Frank Sayre), they moved her upfront.  I'll send an updated itinerary with
her new seat assignments.
Sorry I didn't catch this earlier.
Thanks,
Rae
