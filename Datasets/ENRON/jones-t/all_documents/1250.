Hello David. 

 I just received a call from ENA legal (EOL) requesting a copy of the 
executed Duke Energy Trading & Marketing Pty Limited ISDA with the executed 
guarantee attached.  I told them that you had sent me a copy, but it did not 
include the guarantee.  From a Credit perspective, I have approved this cp to 
trade on-line effective immediately.  However, when you have a chance, please 
send a copy of the contract to Tana Jones in ENA Legal.

Also, the same people are looking for a copy of the Citipower Pty ISDA.  I 
was not sure that this contract had been executed.  When this contract is 
executed, please copy ENA Legal (Tana I suppose) with the guarantee 
attached.  Again, from a Credit perspective, Citipower is approved to trade 
on-line effective immediately.

Thanks, David.

Rod
