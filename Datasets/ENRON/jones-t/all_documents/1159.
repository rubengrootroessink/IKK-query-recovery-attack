Attached below is the updated list of potential Japanese customers for 
EnronOnline.  Note that column "B" now contains a "legal name" for each 
company.  I hope that this will help in reviewing these counterparties.  Once 
again, we are shooting for the end of next week to have this review 
completed. 
Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help in this process.

Thanks!!!

Hi guys

I've filled in the formal names for all the potential clients except the 
bottom two (which I will get soon).

My guess is that its going to be a very long process for you to run the 
credit process over all 110 companies by the time we get this up and running. 
Maybe you could start with the trading houses and investment banks which are 
likely going to be the counterparties we deal with first.

Could you also inform me of any counterparties that fail the credit process - 
I will not send a mailout to companies that fail the test.

Regards
Rousseau
