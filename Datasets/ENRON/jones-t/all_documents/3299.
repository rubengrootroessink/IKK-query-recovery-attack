My Mother, my teacher,
 
My mother taught me TO APPRECIATE A JOB WELL DONE -
"If  you're going to
kill each other, do it outside - I just finished
cleaning!"

My mother taught me RELIGION - "You better pray that
will come out of
the carpet."

My mother taught me about TIME TRAVEL:  "If you don't
straighten up, I'm
going to knock you into the middle of next week!"

My mother taught me LOGIC:  "Because I said so, that's
why."

My mother taught me FORESIGHT - "Make sure you wear
clean underwear, in
case you're in an accident."

My mother taught me IRONY - "Keep crying and I'll
*give* you something
to cry about."

My mother taught me about the science of OSMOSIS -
"Shut your mouth and
eat your supper!"

My mother taught me about CONTORTIONISM - "Will you
*look* at the dirt
on the back of your neck!"

My mother taught me about STAMINA - "You'll sit there
'til all that
spinach is finished."

My mother taught me about WEATHER - "It looks as if a
tornado swept
through your room."

My mother taught me how to solve PHYSICS PROBLEMS -
"If I yelled because
I saw a meteor coming toward you; would you listen
then?"

My mother taught me about HYPOCRISY - "If I've told
you once, I've told
you a million times - Don't Exaggerate!!!"

My mother taught me THE CIRCLE OF LIFE - "I brought
you into this world,
and I can take you out."

My mother taught me about BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION -
"Stop acting like your
father!"

My mother taught me about ENVY - "There are millions
of less fortunate
children in this world who don't have wonderful
parents like you do!"

THANKS, MOM!
