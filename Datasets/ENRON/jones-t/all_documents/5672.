David:

As we discussed, this CP is expecting to receive a revised NDA to replace the 
form we previously sent to them.  Accordingly, I will have Tana prepare a new 
form of NDA, which I will modify a bit to incorporate their proposed 
revisions to the previous draft to the extent they are acceptable, and send a 
revised draft to the counterparty.

With regard to the MOU, I have left Dennis a voice mail explaining that I do 
not feel comfortable picking up an MOU in the middle of negotiations.  I do 
not agree that it needs to be the same lawyer drafting the MOU and the NDA 
and intend to discuss this issue with him.

I have briefly discussed the general issue of our involvement in the 
representation of EnronCredit.com with Mark Taylor and will follow up with 
some more helpful guidelines next week.  In the meantime, I'll work on the 
ERisk NDA.

Regards,

Leslie

Tana asked me to give you this NDA draft document which we forwarded to Erisk 
yesterday morning followed
by their comments which you have a copy of.

Thanks

I will negotiate the NDA for David's group.  The counterparty had several 
comments to the NDA that David sent out yesterday, so I will need to respond 
to those in order to finalize the document.

Denis has drafted the MOU, and I will leave it to him to finalize that 
document after he has addressed any issues raised by the counterparty with 
regard to the MOU.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen

David,
Denis told me yesterday that the same lawyer needs to do NDA and MOU (the NDA 
is an extension of the MOU) and that Leslie was looking at the NDA so should 
do the MOU as well.
I suggest that you give Denis a call to clarify.
Leslie should mail Denis (and copy me) with the final documents saying they 
are OK, Denis will initial them, and I will get them signed and send them 
wherever they are required.

I'll publish a general procedures guide later so everything works smoothly 
going forward!

Regards,
Richard

How is this going?

There is an appendix A under Section E of the MOU which is 
a non-disclosure agreement.

We are working on this NDA with Tana Jones of ENA Legal.

Cheers,
David
