John,

This will be no problem.  I will have Mark Greenberg contact you when he
returns to the office tomorrow.  Hope we can resolve these issues in the
near future.

Again, please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Adri

   Tim Smith said you  had a form of confidentiality agreement you had sent
   to him.  We have  taken the time to prepare and provide you a
   confidentiality agreement which  contains substantive provisions that
   have already been reviewed by your counsel  in our other dealings.  Many
   of the provisions are very similar both  agreements.  Therefore, please
   have your counsel review that document as  soon as possible.
