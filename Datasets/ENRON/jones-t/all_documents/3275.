Not terminal - at least I hope not!  I have a hiatus hernia which has been 
giving me a lot of difficulties recently. I've been to hospital for a variety 
of test; some not so yucky, so a it yucky (tubes down the nose and into the 
stomach!). I'm seeing my specialist tomorrow to get all the results and 
determine a suitable course of action - I'm getting a bit fed up swallowing 
pills that aren't really doing that much anyway.  I'll keep you updated - but 
don't worry I'll be back on full form in the hopefully not too distant 
future. Edmund

Edmund,

I heard yesterday you have been out for quite a while sick.  I had no idea.  
What's the scoop?  Should I be worried?
