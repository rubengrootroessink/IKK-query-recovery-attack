The following CPs are NOT authorized to trade US power:

Parallel Petroleum Corp. - restricted by credit
Terra International, Inc. - restricted by credit
Utilities Commission City of New Smyrna Beach - we have a contractual 
relationship with the City of New Smyrna but not w/the Utilties Commission.  
Let me     know if this CP objects to their restriction for US power, and 
I'll talk to them.
