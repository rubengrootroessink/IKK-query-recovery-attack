> SUPER GRANNY: DEFENDER OF JUSTICE (TRUE STORY)
>
> An elderly lady did her shopping and, upon returning to her car,
> found four males in the act of leaving with her car. She dropped her
> shopping bags and drew her gun, roceeding to scream at them at the
> top of her voice, "I have a gun nd I know how to use it! Get out of
> the car you scumbags!"
>
> The four men didn't wait for a second invitation but got out and
> ran like mad, there upon the lady, somewhat shaken, proceeded to load
> her shopping bags into the back of the car and get into the driver's
> seat.
>
> She was so shaken that she could not get her key into the ignition.
> She tried and tried and then it dawned on her why. A few minutes
> later she found her own car parked four or five spaces farther down.
>
> She loaded her bags into her car and drove to the police station.
> The sergeant to whom she told the story nearly tore himself in two with
> laughter and pointed to the other end of the counter; where four
> pale white males were reporting a car jacking by a mad elderly woman
> described as white, less than 5' tall, glasses, and curly white
> hair carrying a large handgun.
>
> No charges were filed.
