You should now have edit access for the financial trading database.  Please 
only edit those entries relating relating to ECTRIC.  Below is the icon which 
I hope should get you entry into the database (it's a shortcut, and I'm not 
sure it work in England, let me know and I'll stop sending it to people there 
if it doesn't!).
