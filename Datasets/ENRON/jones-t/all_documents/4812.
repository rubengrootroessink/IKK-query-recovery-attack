Hello Tana - please could you help Bruce out or point him in the right 
direction - I just spoke with him and the agreement would need to be under 
Texan law, so our standard form is not suitable.

Many thanks

Michael

Michael,

I work in EnronCredit in Houston.  Adam Tyrell suggested I contact you about 
getting a template non-disclosure agreement to send to a client (at their 
request).  Could you please send me something today if we have a standard 
form? 

Thanks,  Bruce
