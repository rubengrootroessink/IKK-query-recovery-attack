Tana,

Thank you for sending along this draft which reflects the minor changes
which are acceptable to PG&E.  Please have the executed Guarantee sent to my
attention at 77 Beale Street, mail code B28L, San Francisco, CA 94105.  (If
you could let me know when you are sending it, I'd appreciate that.)
