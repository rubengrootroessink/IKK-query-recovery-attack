Tana:

I'm finalizing an NDA with Reuters.  Once we have a fully executed NDA, 
please ensure that you send a copy of the NDA to Tom O. Moore.

Thanks,

Leslie

Leslie,

Here is the Reuters document.  Let me know if this doesn't look like it and 
you need the other version.

The people to contact in the department are:

Tom O. Moore - Director of Contracts, 713-345-5552
Laine Borgman - Sr. Specialist, 713-345-6470
Carmen Ayala - Specialist, 713-345-6269


I will send them an e-mail and tell them that Reuters is having you make some 
changes.  If you need them to assist in getting the documents signed, please 
let them know.

Thanks,
Karla
