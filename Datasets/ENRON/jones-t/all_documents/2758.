Andy had mentioned to me that he would probably be signing the 
confidentiality agreement  before it goes out, so I presumed that thats the 
case . This is the first time I'm working on a project like this so I'm not 
fully familiar with the process and would appreciate your help. If you think 
the first draft that needs to be sent out does'nt require any signature lets 
go with that. Thanks a lot.

Why do we want Andy to sign the draft going out?  If it's not a rush, it 
makes us look heavy handed to send a signed document, giving a tone like 
"this is not negotiable!".

Hi Tana,

To answer your questions 

1. The companys full name is NatSource LLC
2. I'm not sure but it should be exactly the same as what we sent to True 
Quote, Houston Street and Espeed.
3. The project is for posting EOL prices on NatSources Electronic Trading 
Platform.
4. The companys address is 
Nat Source LLC 
140 Broadway
30th Floor, New York
NY 10005
It should be sent to the attention of Jack Hogan (Tel 212-232-5335, 
fax-212-232-5354) Their General Counsel is Andrew O Connor (tel 
212-286-1234). Andy Zipper will sign the document before it is sent.
5. Its not a rush we're just starting to talk to them.

I hope this gives you all the information you need. Thanks a lot. 

Savita

Subject: Confidentiality Agreements

In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following 
information:

1.  The company's full legal name
2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form
3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of 
transaction is it for)
4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number
5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday 
morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to 
talk to them)
