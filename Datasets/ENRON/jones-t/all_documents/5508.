I understand that this will be executed in London.  Is there a lawyer who 
will initial the NDA for EnronCredit in connection with our execution?  I'm 
assuming you will have this NDA executed prior to the meeting.

Subject: I2 NDA

Gillian:

Attached please find the I2 NDA as revised to provide that the term of the 
NDA is 3 years and that Confidential Information disclosed under the 
agreement is protected for 2 years after the date of the disclosure.

I can finalize for execution after I2 has approved the contents of this NDA.  
I'll leave it to you to distribute to them.

Leslie
