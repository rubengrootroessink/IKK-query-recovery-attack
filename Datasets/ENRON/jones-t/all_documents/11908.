Tana -

Could you please send an e-mail to Mr. Gros asking for confirmation of the 
relationship between Sunguard and the entity that signed the NDA (it is still 
in my office).  What we need is some evidence of the subsidiary relationship.

Thanks.

Mark, perhaps if you sent me the agreement in question, I could better
answer your questions.  If you have it electronically, please email it.
Thanks.
