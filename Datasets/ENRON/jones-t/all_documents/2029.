The contact person is Rick Wagner at 713-324-5605.  He is out this week, so I 
am unable to ask him what type of confidentiality agreement he needs.  
However, his assistant was able to provide the following information.

Continental Airlines, Inc.
1600 Smith Street
HQSMO
Houston, TX  77002

Fax: 713-324-2801

I would suggest that we start out with a confidentiality agreement just for 
Enron and see how far we get.

Thanks for you help,

-Dan
