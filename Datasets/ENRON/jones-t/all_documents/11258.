Peter -

I am trying to catch up to the facsimile or original of the final NDA.  It 
appears we did not receive the fax on Friday and have not seen anything since 
we forwarded our signed document.

Could you please check into this for me and advise.

Thanks.

At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   I am not sure if we have the correct legal name
of your company, so can you please verify that for me.  If you have any
comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713)
345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.
