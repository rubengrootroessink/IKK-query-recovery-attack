IVOLUNTEERI  
I Have a Dream - Houston is committed to motivating and encouraging 
disadvantaged inner city children to graduate from high school through 
tutoring and mentoring.  Its "classroom" is located at Gregory Lincoln 
Elementary-Middle School on West Dallas, just 5 minutes from Enron.  
Volunteer tutors work one-on-one with "dreamers" during the school year, once 
a week for one hour.  Volunteer opportunities include tutoring, mentoring, 
field trip chaperones and assisting with administrative and fund-raising 
tasks.   Enron volunteers make wonderful role models.
