Sara/Tana, an additional point that we will need to reflect in the documents 
is that the optional termination provision should now only be one way, in 
favour of ECC, for the first six months, after which time both parties have 
the optional right to terminate.  Also, they are now okay with LCs as the 
sole collateral (ie. no cash collateral required).  Rick Borden has indicated 
that final comments from RBC will be coming out on the documents tonight.  
Rick has also confirmed that he will be providing the schedule to the 
interest rate swap in short order.

Thanks

Greg
