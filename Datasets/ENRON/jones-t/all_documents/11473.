Peter -

I have attached below a beta test agreement for Enron Canada.  The product 
being tested is Net Works' CommodityLogic internet based back office tool.  
This system is currently in the development state and is being reviewed by 
Enron, as well as other companies within the industry.  Peggy Hedstrom is 
involved in the process of reviewing and testing the CL product.  

We have obtained similar agreements from all beta test participants and need 
to have this for CL's files.  We are also obtaining one from ENA.

Please direct this to the proper party for signature (two originals) and then 
have them forward the originals to my attention or Tana's.  We will ensure 
the agreement is countersigned and one original is returned to ECC for its 
files.

If you need more information this matter, track me down at the conference and 
we can discuss it further.

Thanks for the assistance.
