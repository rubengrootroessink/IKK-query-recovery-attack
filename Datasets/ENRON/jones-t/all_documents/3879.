There are only two ways that I can think of that would allow him to access 
the Financial Trading Agreements information if he is no longer with Enron:

1.) if A&K uses Notes and has been granted a connection to our network and 
are cross-certified to access the ecthou_ln1 server
2.) Jason has a desktop/laptop with Terminal Server Account access to our 
network and he continues to maintain an Enron NT account and Notes ID (or 
Cross-Certified A&K Notes ID).

Please keep in mind, my Notes administration knowledge is a bit rusty and 
limited, but I'm pretty sure that this is the way it would have to work.  In 
any case, remote access in this capacity should be coordinated through 
Information Risk Management/Notes Administration.    I'm sure this is not 
very clear, maybe you can call me and we can discuss.

Mike,

Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now 
gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.  Is there some way for 
us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?  He is a 
lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the 
information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting 
him security access.  Can we get him access?

Tana:  Can Jason gain access to the database for the purpose of 
entering/reviewing comments?  Sara
