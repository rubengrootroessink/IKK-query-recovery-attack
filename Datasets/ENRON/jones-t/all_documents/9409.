The situation with Carolina Power & Light Company and Florida Power 
Corporation is this:  these two counterparties are both subsidiaries of the 
same parent holding company, Progress Energy, Inc. effective December 2000.  
They have not merged, they are stand alone entities.  I ran this past Tana 
Jones in legal to make sure it was okay for Mr. Kenny White of Carolina Power 
& Light Company to have a Sub-user ID under John Tyler, Master User, for 
Florida Power Corporation, and legal is okay with it as long as the 
counterparties are comfortable with the situation.  Robert Williams, 
corporate secretary of  Carolina Power & Light Company has confirmed that 
they are in fact satisfied with this set up.   I am making notes in the 
database pertaining to this.  If any further clarification is needed please 
feel free to contact me.

Thanks,
Karen O'Day

Here's what we know (or don't) so far:

According to Teresa Mandola, these two C/Ps have merged (or are in the 
process of merging).  Apparently, though, Teresa and the two C/Ps are the 
only ones that know about the merger.

Global has been made aware of this potential (they weren't before Karen O'day 
called them) and is making appropriate inquiries with each C/Ps legal 
departments.  Karen is monitoring the status.

In the meantime, we did not tell give any information to the trader, over the 
phone or via email.  In fact, the guy couldn't remember his user ID and we 
didn't give him that either.

Does this help?

Subject: Question

Teresa,

I have a question regarding a call from a Mr. Kenny White - Carolina Power 
and Light Company having difficulty logging to the Enrononline website ( 
incorrect login ID ). He stated his login ID and Password was set-up by a 
John Tyler - Florida Power Corporation. 

I have never come across this type of situation before, where a Master User 
from one company is issuing  out login access for Enrononline to a sub-user 
with under a different Global Counterparty.  

Please  let  me know if you have any suggestions, if this is proper procedure 
or if this is a unique circumstance.

John Tyler - Master User Login ID# ADM94439

Kenny White - Sub-user ID# KENWHITE 
Telephone # 919-546-2485


Thanks,
Cecil John
