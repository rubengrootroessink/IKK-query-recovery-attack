Hi everyone. 

I have volunteered as a campaigner for the United Way here at ENRON because I 
wanted to give-back to the organization that was instrumental in my father's 
comfort during his hospice.  I hope that you  will join me in achieving Ken 
Lay's goal of 100% participation by Wednesday, August 23.  

ENRON has created a home page making it very convenient to make a pledge.  
Please take a FEW minutes and visit http://unitedway.enron.com to make your 
confidential pledge.  

If you experience any problems entering the system please contact me at 
X57373 immediately.  We are in the process of ironing out a 'glitche' or 
two.  

Remember, No gift is too small.

Thank your for your consideration.
