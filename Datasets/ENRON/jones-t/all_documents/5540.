I didn't have a record of any NDA with TIBCO, so I checked with Kay Young, 
the paralegal that handles NDA's for ENA and its affiliates, and she doesn't 
have any record either.  The London and Calgary Legal Depts also file their 
signed NDA's with Kay, so unless the NDA is in some other name or not filed 
with Legal, there doesn't appear to be one.  You might want to check.  
Otherwise, it appears we will need to get one in place.  In order to do that 
I will need

Hi Tana-

I initially contacted Marie about locating the NDA we signed with TIBCO.  I 
am not sure when this was done, but it has been a while I'm sure since TIBCO 
provided the software for EOL.  I need to see if the NDA covers all 
subsidiaries and affiliates globally since we are discussing business 
development opportunities in Europe with them.

Let me know if you can assist with locating the TIBCO NDA.

Best Regards,

Pat Cini

Hi, Pat!

It's business as usual over here.  How about you?  Things going okay in 
London?  I may be coming to London after the first of the year to train my 
counterpart over there, once he/she is hired.

I checked our records and I don't see an NDA with TIBCO however, Tana Jones 
could have prepared it since she is the EOL contact.  Unfortunately, she is 
on vacation this week, but I'll check with her assistant and she if she knows 
anything or can direct me to the appropriate person.

Marie

Hi Marie-

How are things in Houston??

I need your help again if possible.  I am looking for a copy of an NDA 
between Enron and TIBCO.  TIBCO is a company that provided software to run 
EOL and we are trying to generate some other business development 
opportunities through EBS.  What we are trying to understand is if the NDA is 
global and covers all subs and affiliates.

Let me know if you can dig this up or if I should bother someone else.

Thank you,

Pat
