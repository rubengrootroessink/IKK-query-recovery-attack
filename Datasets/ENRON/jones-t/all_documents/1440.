Hope you get this!  This is the strangest system up here.  I can't find any

You should forward this to Tana.  It's nice to know it's okay to be a bitch.

When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a bitch.
When I stand up for those I love, they call me a bitch.
When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts, or do things my own way,
they call me a bitch.
Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in my heart.  It means I
live my life MY way. It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.
When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak up against it, I am
defined as a bitch.
The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being
everyone's maid, or when I act a little selfish.
I am proud to be a bitch!  It means I have the courage and strength to
allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone
else's idea of what they
think I "should" be.  I am outspoken, opinionated, and determined.
By God, I want what I want, and there is nothing wrong with that!
So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame,
try to squash every ounce
of beauty I hold within me. You won't succeed. And if
that makes me a bitch, so be it.
I embrace the title and am proud to bear it.
