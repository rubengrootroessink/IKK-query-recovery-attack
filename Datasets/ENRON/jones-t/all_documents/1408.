Stacy, some time ago Mike Etringer and you were working on the Las Vegas 
Cogen LP Commpodity Swap N02595.1.  Could you send me a copy of the 
confirmation swap with the changes that were made, the auditors need a copy 
today in order to complete for a deadline of Friday.  My fax number is 
503-464-3740. Thank you.
