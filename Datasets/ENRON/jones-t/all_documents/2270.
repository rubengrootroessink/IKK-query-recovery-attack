Perhaps we should state that it fine to trade equities, bonds and fx provided 
that they do not trade the book for Enron or
have access to Enron's info  on the subject.  Then all other commodity 
trading should be out of bounds.  Have our
traners stick to working and thinking about books for the benefit of Enron.
