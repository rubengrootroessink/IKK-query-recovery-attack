Who is working on assignment of CES deals in the Statoil portfolio to J. 
Aron???  We have succesfully moved all the other financial deals and have 
obtained collateral from J. Aron.  However, $10MM of exposure remains behind 
in the CES/Statoil portfolio.  Would this not have been included in the 
assignment? Please advise status.

Do you know status of moving CES deals in Statoil to J. Aron?  We finally 
obtained the execution of Statoil to J. Aron; however, it seems the CES deals 
have been left out.

Please advise
