I knew that as soon as I left, Reggie was going to get out of control.  I 
thought the two of you could take care of him, but I see I was sorely 
mistaken.

You are both wrong, it is Reggie's fault, he told me not to hang around 
either of you!!!!!

Yeh, you're right.  It is her fault.  In the past, she always had plans and 
couldn't (or just didn't want to) go with us.  I guess that's the price you 
pay for being so popular and in demand.

It's really all Genia's fault, she goes to lunch too darn early.  I guess we 
need to make a date beforehand for lunch with you...!

Hey, I was an invited guest.  It wasn't my party!  Sounds like someone is 
trying to weasel herself out of trouble.
