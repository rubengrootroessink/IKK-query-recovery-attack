Per my conversation a minute ago with Donna Lowry, please take Lesli Campbell 
off your distribution lists for receiving Credit's executed masters, and  
replace her with Shemeika Landry.

You might ask (as I did) what does Donna Lowry have to do with Credit 
distributions?  I spoke to Donna, and as the head of Compliance and a member 
of the risk management team, Donna's team will be auditing the credit 
information contained in the masters to ensure our counterparties are 
complying with their credit covenants.
