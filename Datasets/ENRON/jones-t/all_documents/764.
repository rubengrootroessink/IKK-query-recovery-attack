Subject: Counterparty Approval List for 1/28/00

Attached please find referenced list.  The only amended counterparty with a 
change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.  I wonder, when 
we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my 
prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?  Right now I have to go 
find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see 
if I have any problem with the change.  So usually, unless I have - change 
next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.  Does that 
make sens?
