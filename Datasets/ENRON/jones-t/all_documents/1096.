On Saturday, April 1, 2000, Enron will be hosting the "Enron Earth Day 
Festival" located at Buffalo Bayou Park.  The Allen Center Garage will be 
used for event parking.  Enron personnel, contract employees and the public 
will be allowed free parking in the Allen Center/Met Garages. Parking will 
also be available in all metered parking areas free of charge on Saturday.

use your garage access card to enter the garage, this will save Enron event 
parking fees.
