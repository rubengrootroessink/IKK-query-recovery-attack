Hello everyone,

Could someone please prepare an assignment letter to move trade q13022.4 from 
NG Trading, LLC to NG Energy Trading, LLC.

Also, in the original confirmation certain credit language was added to 
require an independent amount of $1MM be held through maturity of the trade.  
NG Energy Trading, LLC recently received a guaranty from Alliant Energy 
Corporation, an A-rated utility, which will be used to secure the trade after 
the assigment.  Therefore, my question to you, is do we drop the independent 
amount language from the original confirmation and provide alternative 
language referencing the new specific guaranty.  If so, the date of the 
guaranty provided is October 24, 2000 and it is due to expire November 1, 
2001.

If you could e-mail such a document, I would be most grateful.

thanks
brant
