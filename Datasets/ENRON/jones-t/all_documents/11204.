Kathryn -

In accordance with our discussion, attached you will find a blacklined and 
clean version of the Beta Agreement between your client and Enron.  I have 
made the revisions based upon the original document forwarded and have 
incorporate those of the changes we discussed.  The only item that I changed 
that was not discussed was the addition of the words "TO THE OTHER PARTY" in 
the fourth line of Paragraph 6B.  These words were inserted as it is only 
between the parties that the waiver is effective.

If these changes meet with your approval, please have the agreement reviewed 
by your appropriate business personnel.  If acceptable at that level, please 
have two originals of the agreement signed and dated.  Once completed, a fax 
of a signed document should be forwarded to my attention (at the below fax 
number).  I will ensure it is countersigned by Enron and faxed back to your 
attention.  The originals should be forwarded for completion by Enron and, 
once completed, one fully signed original will be forwarded back to your 
attention.

I appreciate your cooperation with this matter.  Please do not hesitate to 
call me if you should need anything further.
