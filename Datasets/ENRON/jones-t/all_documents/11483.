Mark,
Andy is pressing hard to fast track TFS and get them finished by next week.  
I would like to get a definitive agreement to them asap.  Here are the new 
numbers I showed Alan Kurzer:
$200k North American Gas and Power 
OR
$150k North American Gas with a $75k 30 day option for North American Power

Please use the language that releases the broker from liability once the end 
of day confirmation is completed.  
Any concerns that you have with the prices should be settled with the fact 
that TFS does significantly less business with us (compared w/ Natsource & 
Prebon) and this deal is priced accordingly.

Thanks,

-Dan
