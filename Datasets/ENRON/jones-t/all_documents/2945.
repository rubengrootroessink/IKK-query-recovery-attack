Due to various delays the container will most likely not get to my house 
until Thursday so I will be probably be taking Thursday and Friday off.

My container arrives into the port of Houston tomorrow from Argentina.  It 
will take 3-5 days to be processed and delivered to my house.  I will need to 
take two days off next week to manage to the process of unpacking.  I should 
have a firm idea on Friday of what days they will make the delivery.  I 
expect it will be Tuesday/Wednesday or Wednesday/Thursday.  I will keep you 
informed.
