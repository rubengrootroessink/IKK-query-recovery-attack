Denis,

I saw a copy of an MOU dated in November that you had initialed.  I have had 
no discussions with anyone with Enron Credit or ERS about the MOU, so I have 
no idea if ERS has agreed to the MOU that was sent to them.  I'll leave it to 
you and David to sort out the status of the MOU since I have never worked on 
this document.  

I have finalized the NDA and Tana Jones is handling its execution.

Leslie

Denis:

What is the status of the MOU for ERisk?
ERisk needs a signed copy from us and then they will sign and send a copy.

Leslie said that she will forward the NDA to you to review which Steve Wagner 
of ERisk 
sent to her yesterday.

Thanks

David - the EFT responsibility statement should be included where you are 
making a presenr=tation to UK counterparties.  The language I sent to Bruce 
was to be inserted in a presentation to be sent to a prospective US 
counterparty.   I will provide you witha universal proforma in due course.

Denis

Denis:
The "Feds" powerpoint presentation which Bruce sent to you earlier with the 
language below in the prior email
is different from the attached presentation here called "EC presentation".



Please advise

Thanks
David
