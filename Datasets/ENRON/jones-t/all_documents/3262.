Can you please have Tana clarify if the counterparty wishes to have a new CP 
name set up as Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company (which 
it sounds like) or if they will make financial trades under Northern Illinois 
Gas Company (since Nicor Gas Company is the physical trading entity).  We 
still cannot report (or even SET UP) the contract until we know which CP name 
is correct.  Until then, the 08/14/00 EOL report will still be outstanding.

Thanks,
Stacey

Subject: Counterparty Approval List for 8/14/00

With respect to the attached list, a few things:

1.  With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are 
approved for all products (including financial & power).  Can you let me know 
if your approvals reflect otherwise?

2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company:  
Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be "Northern Illinois Gas 
Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company".  We have just received the executed ISDA 
Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set 
the master up.  Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading 
arm, so that entity name should be left alone.

I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from 
Australia about a question.
