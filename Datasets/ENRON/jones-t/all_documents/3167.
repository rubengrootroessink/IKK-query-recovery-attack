I am not sure who in credit handles this file.  If not you, please forward to 
the correct party.  MeesPierson has merged into Fortis (guarantor under 
MeesPierson ISDA.  Susan Baily will send a copy of the notice letter to 
credit.  Fortis will now be a multibranch party acting through Amsterdam 
(main office), Rotterdam, Singapore, and Frankfurt am Main.
