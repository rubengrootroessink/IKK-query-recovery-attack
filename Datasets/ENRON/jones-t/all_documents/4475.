Tana,

We now have an application from Tembec, Inc.   Steven Norris, as Treasurer, 
is the one signing the Password Application for Tembec.   When John Cummings 
met with him last week, Steve stated that he would be involved in setting up 
the users for Physical transactions.

After reading the requirements below, it sounds like the two signature rule 
applies to Financial transactions only.

In other words, can we set up Steve as well as his users with Physical access 
without two officers' signing?

If so, then we could get them on-line with Physical access and then work on 
whatever we need for Financial access.

Thanks for your help!
Camille

On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed 
by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the 
President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or 
Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must 
ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not 
by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those 
above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction 
EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your 
group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you 
would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it 
up to me.
