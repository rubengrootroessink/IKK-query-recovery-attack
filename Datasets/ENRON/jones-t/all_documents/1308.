Please revise the profile for San Diego Gas & Electric Company so that this 
CP (i) can both purchase and sell US Western power products and (ii) can 
neither purchase nor sell US Eastern power products via EOL.

Rhonda:  I'm pretty certain that the matrix already designates the WSPP for 
this CP but if it does not, please revise the matrix.

Call me with any questions.

Leslie
