Tanna,

Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations.  If you
could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being put in
place that would be really helpful.  I also have another quick request and
that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB.  I have spoken to
Delene Travella at FUNB.  They are negotiating an ECTRIC Schedule with you
in Houston which they want to finalise before commencing EnronCredit.com's
negotiation.  Can you give me an update on where this negotiation stands and
how long before it is likely to be finalised?

Many thanks,

Clare Godson
