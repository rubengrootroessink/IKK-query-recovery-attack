Subject: Counterparty- Genesis Ventures

Tom/Tana-

Genesis ventures migrated last night. The counterparty needs to be retouched 
on the 5 European products (read only) and also US Recycled ONP Physical 
(trade).  

I would appreciate it if you could revisit this counterparty when you get a 
chance.

Best Regards,
