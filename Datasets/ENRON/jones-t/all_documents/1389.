CRM consents to the assignment; however, if you feel that we can use the 
consent to move the J Aron ISDA negotiations forward, it is worth a try.  I 
wouldn't want to hold the assignment up for too long, but if we can convince 
J Aron that putting this additional number of trades under the old document 
is a bad idea; hopefully, we can finalize the document.  My understanding is 
that the Enron gty is the only outstanding issue, is that correct?

Thanks,
Tanya
