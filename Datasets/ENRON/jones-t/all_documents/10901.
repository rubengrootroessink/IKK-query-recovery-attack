Good afternoon all--

I was wondering if we might be able to schedule an appointment sometime 
tomorrow to go over the status and procedure for Net Works Origination's 
legal docs so we can create a new system of maintaining a status report. I 
think 30-45 minutes of your time is all we need, and if you could, please 
email or call me back with a set of times that would work best for you so I 
can schedule a short meeting. Thank you.
