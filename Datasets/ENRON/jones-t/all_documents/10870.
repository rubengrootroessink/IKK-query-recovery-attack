Peter -

Below I have attached my comments to the Global Crossing document.  What I 
have done is accept all of GC's changes and then reflected the items we 
either need to have (e.g., arbitration) or that are in addition to the 
comments made by GC. 
Please review the attached at your convenience and let me know if you should 
have any questions.

If the attached is acceptable, please feel free to forward it to GC for 
review and comment.
