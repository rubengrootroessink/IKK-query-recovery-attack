Thanks for your call this morning.  I was in the middle of legging some gas
cracks and had to go.

Before we begin trading with you, we need to execute an ISDA.  I am
attaching a copy of our standard schedule.  We have this agreement in place
with all of the major dealers; and so, in general, we will not accept
substantial changes to the agreement, particularly with regard to credit
terms.

Again,  thanks for your call, and I look forward to dealing with you in the
future.

John
