Hi, I did receive information in the mail for you to complete regarding the 
assignment for financial deals.

I'll bring it by in person. The physical piece has been completed.

This is a consent to the physical business, not financial.  Stacy Dickson 
will sign off on this as soon as she gets Credit approval, which it appears 
she has not yet.

Susan,

Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above 
referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric 
Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.  
These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we 
have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you 
know anything.

Thanks,
Joe
