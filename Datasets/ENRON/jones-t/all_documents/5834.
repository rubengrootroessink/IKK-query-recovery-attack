Tana:

As we discussed, perhaps Bob should have a brief conversation with the 
counterparty to confirm that an NDA is appropriate.  If the counterparty's 
only concern is that they do not want to be obligated to disclose 
confidential information in the course of any discussions with us, we are 
happy to include the following provision in our NDA to make clear that it is 
under no obligation to provide us with confidential information:

"Whether to disclose particular information remains the sole discretion of 
the disclosing party and nothing hereunder obligates a party in any way to 
disclose any information."

Leslie

Thank you for the NDA . I would like to clarify that as we do not know what
Enron have in mind we cannot at this stage commit to furnish  information
which may be implied in the first sentence of the document . More
appropriate wording  may be  "in the event of the provision of information
" At 18:26 06/12/00 -0600, you wrote:
