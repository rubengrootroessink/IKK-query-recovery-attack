I would like a NDA for American Express Global Travel Services in order for 
Enron Net Works and EOL to obtain and share information with them.  Amex is 
potentially interested in using the bid - ask engine of EOL to provide 
real-time ticket turnover for its suppliers (airlines) and demand side 
(travel agents).  Enron may eventually help Amex construct a financial market 
and financial products related to the travel industry.   I am keeping up the 
good fight!  Please keep this client and our intent CONFIDENTIAL.  All that 
we are doing right now is confidential.

Address the NDA to:
  

John Berkley
Vice President - Corporate Travel marketing & Business Developement
American Express Corporate Services
233 North Michigan Avenue
Suite 1920
Chicago, IL   60601

Let me know what else I need to provide you with.

-John
