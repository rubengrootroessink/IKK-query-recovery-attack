Michael,

I look forward to the creative brief and the opportunity to present our
offering. Would you please send us a few dates and times next week for us to
review the current website? I will ask Greg Griffin to assemble the
resources on our side for this meeting.

Please keep the round-table discussion with John Seely Brown in mind. This
forum helps executives from prominent companies (e.g., JC Pennys,
Nieman-Marcus, Vail Resorts, etc.) shape Internet business agendas. I
thought it might provide a convenient means for you to build alignment with
key members of Loise Kitchen's staff. Greg will make sure you get the agenda
details. The scheduling details are:

Friday, May 12, 2000
8:30 am to  10:30 am
Omni Mandalay at Las Colinas
221 East Las Colinas Boulevard
Irving, Texas

Best regards,

Rich Homich
