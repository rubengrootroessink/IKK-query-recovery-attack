Tana:

We should send the executed ED&F Man NDA to Robert Schlossberg.  He's out of 
town till Monday, but please try to get a hold of his assistant at the number 
below to get a mailing address.   Then, send it for Monday delivery after 
we've executed.

  Rob:

  I understand from speaking with Andy Zipper that he has
invited you to
  submit a preferred form of NDA in light of your objections
to the "overly
  broad" nature of our NDA.  Andy asked me to follow up with
you to touch
  base and find out when we should expect to see an NDA.

  Thanks,

  Leslie Hansen
