Subject: Calpine Power Services/Calpine Energy Services

This Counterparty is on the 11/9/00 EOL List.  We have received documentation 
that reflects that Calpine Power Services Company, an entity where we have an 
ISDA Master in place, has merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., 
an entity where we don't have an ISDA in place with.   Is Credit OK with this 
merger?
