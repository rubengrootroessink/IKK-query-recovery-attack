Please contact Tana Jones at X33399.  She is the paralegal who would know if 
a contract was executed.

Hi Ladies,

I'm trying to find a contact in your legal department to verify if an ISDA 
was created/executed yesterday or not?  One of our traders has asked us to 
send out some confirmations on a counterparty that is not in Global CP, yet 
he tells us that an ISDA was finalized yesterday?????  Thanks,

Matilda
