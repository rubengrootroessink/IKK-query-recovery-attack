Would you mind to send these documents to her?  I have no idea where to find 
this stuff. 

Thank you!

Shari

HI Shari - If you wouldn't mind, it would be helpful for me to see the form
of confirmation you use for parties that don't have signed ISDAs or master
agreements.  I have some older versions, but nothing current.  We are in the
process of reviewing our documentation and it's good to see what others in
the industry are doing.  I think you attach general terms to the confirm,
and also credit provisions.  Thanks for your help!

Meg,

It was good to meet you in person today!  I also enjoyed meeting the rest
of the gang from Coral - it seems like you have a good (and fun) group of
colleagues.

Re: the CAL PX, my colleague Christian Yoder is handling any issues dealing
with them. His telephone number is (503) 464-7854.  Also, did you know that
the CAL PX is giving a 2 day seminar here in Houston next week at the
Hyatt? I am planning to attend. If you would like information on this -
please send me your fax number and I can send over the agenda.

Re: Our "industrial" master for financial trading, please find it attached
below. There are two credit support annexes that go along with it depending
on how you want to structure the collateral requirements. I have included
them both, as well as some riders. Should you have any questions on the
document, please let me know.

Also, would you know Ann Reynaud's email address? I would like to thank her
again for lunch today.

Thanks and kind regards,
