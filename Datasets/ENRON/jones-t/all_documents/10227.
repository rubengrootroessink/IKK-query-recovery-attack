Marilyn,

We have a Paralegal Luncheon scheduled for Thursday, April 12th, and each of 
us has this date already set on our calendars.  Therefore, we propose that 
the GCP Training be scheduled for April 12th from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm.

Let us know if this works for you.

Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey

Ladies - 
I would like to get a vote on which date would work best for the training 
class in April. We have a conference room where a PC cart would work nicely 
for us. The monitor is a large screen for easy viewing. You might want to 
select 2 dates in case your first choice is taken. 

Which of these dates works best:  April 9, 11, 12, 13 (Mon, Wed - Fri) ?  
 Also, would 11 AM - 1:30 PM be enough time?  Lunch will be provided. 

I have approved all the security forms received so far so you should have 
view access to GCP in plenty of time. Look forward to hearing from you! 

Marilyn
