This is the listing from Tom Moran in Credit which was provided to Clickpaper
to represent those companies which are pre-approved.  
I need to understand if this includes Legal or not.

Also, let me know if you have any questions on the two 8/7 files and the one 
8/8 file
from Tom.

Thanks,
Camille

Tana, 
I see that National is pre-approved in Credit but I want to make sure
that Legal is covered.  I think that it will be but just in case the CP ID
is 26316. 
Thanks.
Camille
