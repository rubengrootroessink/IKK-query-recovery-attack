Brad is in Credit.  He sent down a credit worksheet for Enron Midwest LLC.  
Enron Midwest LLC was not recorded as a corporation in the Corporate 
Secretary's office.  The Confirm Desk called around to get me a contact for 
that entity.  I finally spoke to Kevin Radours in Richard Comoski's office in 
Chicago.  He told me that Enron Midwest was not the 50/50 joint venture with 
Peoples, as indicated in the Credit worksheet, Midwest Energy Hub was.  I 
placed a call to Brad to correct the Credit information.  Brad never returned 
my phone call.  Meanwhile Molly left a message that this Greg Penham wanted 
to work off the Peoples master.  I called Molly to get the scoop about the 
correct counterparty, and further get the articles & bylaws up to Kate's 
office.

Tana:  I don't know who Brad Diebner is.  However, Greg called me.  What Greg 
really needs is the ENA "form" of ISDA Schedule (with the utility election). 
He will also need a "generic" Paragraph 13.  The boilerplate can be mailed.  
Before you send, I need to chat with Mark and I'll let you know more later 
today.  Thanks.  Sara

I left a message for both Molly and Brad Diebner and neither has returned my 
calls.

I understand Greg Penman has inquired for the same.  I would be happy to 
coordinate amongst us and informed Greg accordingly.

Thank you
Molly

Tana

Is it possible to get electronic file for the Enron North America and Peoples 
Energy Corporation ISDA?  Is it in Word?  I am trying to get our new JV, 
Midwest Energy Hub, to utilize our format for the template for MEH.

Thanks
Molly

Molly,

Could you send me an electronic version of the ISDA that was signed between
ENA and PEC. I understand from our attorney that we did not work with an
electronic version, only a hard copy. In order to create an ISDA template
for MEH, I need the electronic version.

Thanks

Aparna
