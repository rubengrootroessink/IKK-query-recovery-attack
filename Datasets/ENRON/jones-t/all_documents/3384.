Marcus, Tana will get with me later this afternoon or tomorrow regarding the 
requested information.  She is the legal specialist who handles the EOL 
issues and has worked with the password application folks here in Houston and 
also in London.

Please could you find out who worked on the Password Application Agreements 
so we can respond. My suspicion would be that it may be different for 
different products.
 
Thank you.

Gentlemen,

Would be grateful if you could confirm to me the name of the Enron entity 
that is named party to the above PA in your jurisdiction(s)...

Thanks.

Hi Justin

We will need POAs for all the other companies which are PA signatories.

Can you please investigate.

Thanks

I think this will be OK if ENA gives a Power of Attorney to EPOL to execute 
these agreements on its behalf. It is the provision of a support service, in 
much the same way as the issue of trade confirmations, rather than the 
negotiation and conclusion of a trading transaction. Justin - can you arrange 
for a POA draft ?
Thanks
Janine

Janine,

The U.S. PA is executed on behalf of ENA, and not EPOL.   As for Aus. C/Ps, I 
don't know who the ETA Enron entity is.

The costs of the London PCG team will be allocated to the legal entities who 
benefit from their services under the provisions of the EnronOnline cost 
sharing agreement. Therefore there is no problem with the London based PCG 
team providing PA approval services in respect of Western Hemisphere and 
Australasian customers. The PA form itself is I think signed by EPOL for and 
on behalf of group undertakings which will include all group companies 
worldwide. Indeed, if we approve a PA form in respect of a European customer 
today, this European customer can still transact with non-UK entities 
(depending on the product transacted , and whether the customer has been 
approved to trade these products). Let me know if you think the procedure 
will work differently from that which I described. 

Congrats on the well deserved promotion.

Regards
Janine

Hi Guys

As the MG credit people sit in the London office we are considering amending 
the PA process for Western Hemisphere and Australasian customers.  All PAs 
received by the Houston and Sydney office from Metals customers will be 
forwarded to the London PCG team to process.  Part of the process includes 
signing of the relevant PA for the relevant Enron company.

Would we have tax/legal issues with having a London person authorised to sign 
these PAs on behalf of the relevant Enron companies?

Speedy response wd be appreciated!!

Thanks

Amita
