Dear All,

As requested by Houston please find attached details of our current contracts 
for gas and power split as follows:

1. Gas Breakdown - Covers UK and Continental Gas Trading

2. Master Grid Trade Agreements - GTMA's are the new master agreements for UK 
Power Trading following the introduction of NETA (New Electricity Trading 
Arrangements) on March 27 2001.

3. Australian ISDA's - Australian financial trades covered by the 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association

We are in the process of a joint project between Contract Management, Legal 
and Credit to prioritise negotiations for further master agreements. The aims 
of this project include limiting our credit exposures, improving our 
abilities to net and increasing our contractual security.

If anyone requires any further details or explanation please contact me on
