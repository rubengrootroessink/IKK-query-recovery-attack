Tana -

Can you take care of the below for me.  We need to finalize the marked draft 
(accept the revisions) and then prepare it for signature.  Since Kim has 
indicated this needs to be signed in Europe, it seems we should run the final 
version by Denis to ensure he is comfortable with the document.

Thanks.

Mark:

PWC/Credit Dimensions has accepted the modifications to their confidentiality 
agreement you suggested.  It is the attached work file, still in the 
revisions format with your edits in red.  I understand the process for 
getting this executed on Enron's side is to:

? Have you initial the agreement signifying your approval
? Forward the document to Richard Sage in our London office for signature

Please call me when you get this so that I can get it finalized. (X-36728).

Thanks.

Kim Detiveaux

Kim,

The modifications to the Confidentiality Agreement are fine. If you'll send
a signed copy of that to me we will countersign and return a copy for your
records.

With that done, I beleive we're good to move onto the discussions on the
data and platforming some portion of the Enron technology on
CreditDimensions.

Regards,
Craig

Craig:

We also enjoyed the meeting yesterday and look forward to working with you.

I had the Enron Credit attorney look over the documents, and he suggested a
few changes to the confidentiality agreement (see attached file).  Are the
suggested changes agreeable?

   Kim and Craig,

   Very good to meet you today. Next steps here would be for us to work
   with
   you data group in regard to Enron becoming a subscriber to the
   Counterparty
   data. We could also review the publishing of your counterparty data
   through
   CreditDimensions.

   To become a provider of data to CD we should get the Confidentiality
   Agreement and the Letter of Intent done. See attached.

   I look forward to talking with you again soon.

   Regards,
   Craig

   Kim,

   Nice to speak with you today. We'll see you and Craig Chaney at our
   office
   (1177 Ave. of the Americas, 28th flr) on Thursday, 05 April at 1:00pm.

   Attached is an introductory presentation to CreditDimensions that I
   thought
   you'd like to see. We look forward to meeting with you and Craig to
   discuss
   how CreditDimensions and Enron can work more closely together. Within
   the
   PwC FRM practice, the energy consulting group is headed by Fred Cohen.
   Also, Shyam Venkat has managed the relationship with Enron. I've copied
   both on this e-mail.

   We would like to further discuss your interest in subscribing to the
   counterparty data through CreditDimensions Also, we'd like to better
   understand Enroncredit's participation in Reuters Credit and how you
   view
   CreditDimensions in comparison.

   I've also attached the Confidentiality Agreement and Letter of Intent
   we'd
   use as our relationship develops.

   We look forward to seeing you and Craig next week. We agree that there
   seem
   to be many good opportunities in the energy credit risk management
   arena.

   Regards,

   Craig
