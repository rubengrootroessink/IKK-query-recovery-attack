Stephen -

Thanks for the faxes earlier today.  I have looked at the change you made and 
would like to see it read as follows:  "(vii) TradeSpark shall confirm with 
Customer, by a means other than through the System, any trade in which 
TradeSpark acts as a broker in a broker-assisted trade."  This is consistent 
with our conversation and creates an obligation outside of the System, which 
is what Enron is looking for.

I do not need to see another lined version as I am confident this change will 
be made.  I will, however, request, that you forward originals to my 
attention for signature by Enron.  If they are overnighted, I will ensure 
they are signed tomorrow and forwarded back to your attention immediately for 
counter-signature by TradeSpark.  This will dispense with the need to have 
signed faxes and originals.

Thanks for your continued efforts and cooperation
