Tana, most happy to send you a copy if this is necessary but a copis of ISDA 
Agreements are already sent to Laurie Mayer in ENA Legal. Copies are also 
sent to Rod in Credit. Please advise if this arrangement is satisfactory. If 
separate copies are required could you come to an arrangement with Laurie? 
This would be preferable to couriering another copy across the Pacific!  

Copies of the Duke and Citipower ISDAs I believe have already been 
distributed. The Duke Guarantee I recall arrived last week and will be faxed 
off today. Citipower Pty. had no guarantee.

So Tana probably Laurie would be your best source of our ISDAs, and failing 
that Shari Wicks here in Sydney.

Hello David. 

 I just received a call from ENA legal (EOL) requesting a copy of the 
executed Duke Energy Trading & Marketing Pty Limited ISDA with the executed 
guarantee attached.  I told them that you had sent me a copy, but it did not 
include the guarantee.  From a Credit perspective, I have approved this cp to 
trade on-line effective immediately.  However, when you have a chance, please 
send a copy of the contract to Tana Jones in ENA Legal.

Also, the same people are looking for a copy of the Citipower Pty ISDA.  I 
was not sure that this contract had been executed.  When this contract is 
executed, please copy ENA Legal (Tana I suppose) with the guarantee 
attached.  Again, from a Credit perspective, Citipower is approved to trade 
on-line effective immediately.

Thanks, David.

Rod
