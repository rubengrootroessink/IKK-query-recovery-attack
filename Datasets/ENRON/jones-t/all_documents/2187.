With regard to the physical power side, Ed Sacks from Credit gave his 
approval to the assignment of these transactions today. I just sent Anne 
Lovett at PPL a draft Assignment Agreement this afternoon. Things are a bit 
easier on the physical power side because there are master agreements already 
in place on both sides, which cover the OTC and the EOL trades. 

Let me know if you want a copy of anything we produce or sign.

		 Subject: PP&L Alssignment of Trades

I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate 
our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and 
online transactions.  Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the 
physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in 
it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is 
faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.  PP&L tells me 
that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have 
not received such approval.

With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any 
particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in 
doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done 
with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if 
Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).  It 
seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.

Saying, all that, I guess I need to know if (1) Credit has approved all these 
consents, (2) when power & gas have consented, and (3) if Frank is OK with 
assigning the online account over...
