Rhonda:

Please take a look at the attached list and let Genia know if any of the 
counterparties are current trading partners.  Genia, please take a look at 
the list and see if any of the counterparties are FERC approved.  I didn't 
even open the list, so I hope I haven't saddled you with a huge chore.
