Hi Stephanie -
It doesn't have to be that week, it can be the week before or the third week. 
I was just going by someone's comment about the second week of April. 
If 4/15 - 18 works, that would be OK too. I will be out of the office from 
4/19 - 4/23. Talk amongst yourselves and keep me posted. Thanks for your 
quick response!
Marilyn

PS  Would you be the point person for your group so I don't bombard everyone 
with emails?

Marilyn,

I will be out that week, except for Friday, but I know that Susan Bailey will 
be out that Friday.  If you need to schedule it that week, I can always get 
with Susan, Samantha or Tana to later to review the information.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Ladies - 
I would like to get a vote on which date would work best for the training 
class in April. We have a conference room where a PC cart would work nicely 
for us. The monitor is a large screen for easy viewing. You might want to 
select 2 dates in case your first choice is taken. 

Which of these dates works best:  April 9, 11, 12, 13 (Mon, Wed - Fri) ?  
 Also, would 11 AM - 1:30 PM be enough time?  Lunch will be provided. 

I have approved all the security forms received so far so you should have 
view access to GCP in plenty of time. Look forward to hearing from you! 

Marilyn
