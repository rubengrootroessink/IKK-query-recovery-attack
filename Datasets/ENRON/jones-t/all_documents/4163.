Chile has been approved to use the North American forms of the Electronic 
Trading Agreement and the Password Application for companies located in 
Chile.  Please note the Enron entity must not have a permanent establishment 
or branch located in Chile and the counterparty should appoint a process 
agent in the US.

This approval does not address due diligence issues as it relates to specific 
products or counterparties.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
