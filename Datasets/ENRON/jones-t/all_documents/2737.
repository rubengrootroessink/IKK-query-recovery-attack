Dear Tana,

Pursuant to our telephone discussions, attached please find our proposed
Amendment referenced above.

(See attached file: NAME CHANGE AMENDMENT JUL 20 00.doc)

With regard to your comments on our request for a replacement Guarantee, for
purposes of proper record keeping, consistency and as a matter of market
practice, we would appreciate a replacement Guarantee substantially the same 
as
the existing Guarantee except for the name change.  Upon receipt of the new
Guarantee, we will arrange to return the existing Guarantee to you.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any comments or questions.

I look forward to working with you to finalize the Amendment.
