Mike:

I revised the nit in Section 1 and have attached a new red-line, as well as a 
clean copy.  If PW fails to get back to us before I leave today but agrees to 
my proposed revisions, please send a copy of the final NDA to Tana Jones.  
She can review and confirm that they incorporated my changes and get Mark 
Taylor to initial or she can initial on my behalf so that we can get the 
document executed before your meeting tomorrow.  If PW does not incorporate 
all of my changes, I'll have to consider their changes before we can execute.

Leslie
