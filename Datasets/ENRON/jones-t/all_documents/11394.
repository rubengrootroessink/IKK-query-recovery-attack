Dear Hosts:

The list below sets out the five parties for the May 19 Church Gourmet.  If 
you have trouble finding telephone numbers or e-mail addresses for people, 
please call the church office or e-mail the church office.  Many new members 
are joining us this time, so each party includes one or more persons whose 
information can be found only in the newest church directory.  

Most of the parties include at least one vegetarian.  Please ask your 
parties' vegetarian to make the Maque Choux or Red Beans and Rice.  I suggest 
that the host make the dessert - or that the host ask the maker of the 
dessert to bring his or her own pan to use for flaming stuff.

The Gerhart party is rather small.  Kleta, you may not need to assign all of 
the menu items for your household.  The Hollrahs have requested that they 
bring red beans and rice.  If the Wendtlandts cannot make it, please let me 
know, I have some substitutes in mind.

We have some possible substitutes to call if one or more of your guests 
cannot make the party and gives you sufficient notice.  If a guest calls with 
less than 3 days notice, and you think their excuse is such that they should 
be able to cook even if they can't eat, feel free to ask them to do so.  In 
the event of last minute cancellations, wing it, invite a neighbor or other 
friend and have fun anyway.

Thanks for your help - Laissez Bon Temps Roulez!
