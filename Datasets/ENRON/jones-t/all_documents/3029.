Tana,
  
The Forcenergy amendment should be like the HS Resources document we just 
executed.  The changes are as follows:

New Collateral Threshold: $7,500,000

We are reducing the strike price on all oil hedges (all oil deals) by $.17. 
All oil and gas deals are now "Exempt Transactions" (Yes, all deals are 
exempt, but we are just changing the strike price on the oil pieces).

We need to back-date the contract to be effective July 1, so we can capture 
the August settlements. ( I think this will do.)

If you need anything else, please let me know.
