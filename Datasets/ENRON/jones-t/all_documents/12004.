John -

I have seen the EPMI agreement and it looks very similar to the one we 
forwarded for Net Works.  I will be talking to our internal personnel a bit 
further to fully understand Green Mountain's concerns and will get back to 
you in the next day or so to see if we can put this matter to bed.

There is a confidentiality agreement in place with Enron Power Marketing,
Inc., along with several transaction documents.

John -

Unfortunately, I am out of the office and will not return until Monday,
5/21.  I will have our staff check where these other agreements may be, but
I am not confident that Net Works has an existing NDA with your company.
To make this search a bit easier, could you please advise me of the "other
dealings" you are referring to.

Thanks and thanks for your patience.

John,

This will be no problem.  I will have Mark Greenberg contact you when he
returns to the office tomorrow.  Hope we can resolve these issues in the
near future.

Again, please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Adri

   Tim Smith said you  had a form of confidentiality agreement you had sent
   to him.  We have  taken the time to prepare and provide you a
   confidentiality agreement which  contains substantive provisions that
   have already been reviewed by your counsel  in our other dealings.  Many
   of the provisions are very similar both  agreements.  Therefore, please
   have your counsel review that document as  soon as possible.
