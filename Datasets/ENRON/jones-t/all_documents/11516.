I understand that the correct name for the Port of Oakland counterparty is as 
set out below. Please confirm that this is the case and that we are not 
dealing with another counterparty. It is also my understanding that we have 
an EEI in place with the counterparty set out below and that they insisted 
that this description be applied to them in any dealings and signed an EEI on 
that basis.
 
If the Port of Oakland counterparty is one in the same, please ensure that 
they are properly described, if it is a different counterparty, with no EEI 
in place, then as agreed with Ed Sacks, we will only approve a 6 month tenor, 
not 12 months.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus
