We contacted International Paper Corp. when they first applied and found that 
they are related, but they are separate entities from International Paper 
Company.  International Paper Corp. is a division of International Paper 
Company according to Walter Guidroz's notes in the Access Database.  Cheryl, 
can you contact someone at International Paper Corp. and see what the 
relationship is for sure?  The applicant may be wrong and not sure what or 
who to talk to over there to get the correct answer.

Thank you,
Karen O'Day

Hey Bernice,

I got an error message while trying to send this message to Karen O'Day.
Would you resend it to her. Although, I believe Claudia is back, so we should 
be fine.

Hi Karen,

I'm in agreement with Tana's message below. I understand that the Trader / 
Requester
applied to EOL as International Paper Corporation, however, after further 
investigation, 
DnB supports that the location of this company is actually a Branch location 
of International Paper Company, CP/ID 1836 - - already an EOL counterparty.

Please confirm and advise.

Please contact Bernice Rodriguez if an inactivation of this Branch record is 
in order.



Bernice, if an inactivation occurs, would you adjust the spreadsheet above on 
the O: drive
and resend it to our EOL distribution as an EOL 03-07-01 Amendment.

Thanks !!

The above counterparty on the 3/7/01 list is ID#93394.  We had a counterparty 
on the pre-approval list that was called International Paper Company and was 
ID#1836.  Was that one in error?  Are they the same, different?  What's the 
scoop?

Thanks for your help!
