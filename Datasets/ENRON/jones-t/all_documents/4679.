Leslie,

Yes, you are correct.  If you can send me the NDA with any modifications that 
you require, I'll send it back to Xuma for their signature.

Thanks,
Laura

Laura:

Am I correct in understanding that Xuma signed the EBS form without 
modification?  If that is the case, we should prepare the NDA with Enron Net 
Works LLC as the party in lieu of EBS and have Xuma execute the revised 
agreement.  In the future, we need to use the Net Works form of NDA; however, 
since the EBS form has already been sent to and accepted by the Counterparty, 
I'm okay using this form.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen

Tana/Leslie,

Attached is the NDA that we used with Xuma.  They've signed it in hard copy 
and sent it back to me, but since then our group has switched from EBS to Net 
Works.  Please advise as to how you need to modify this.

Thanks,
Laura

Thanks, Robin.  I actually have another NDA to ask you for and it's a last 
minute request for a meeting that I'm attending tomorrow in San Francisco 
(for which I'm leaving in an hour or so).

The counter party is a company called XUMA.  The relevant info is below.  
Thanks and I'll follow the same procedure as with onexchange.

Regards,
Laura

Here is the NDA.  Please select the "Read Only" option in order to open and 
print.  Please print 2 originals for signature so each party has an original 
executed NDA, or you may e-mail it to them as long as they follow up with 2 
originals.  After the other party executes it, you will need to get an EBS 
attorney to initial it before an EBS VP or above can execute it on our 
behalf.  If you have any questions please call me and please make sure I get 
an executed original back.  Thanks.

Ed,

I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I have not been able to pull up your
street address on your web site - I get a message that the server is busy.
If
you send me the relevant info on Onexchange, as requested below, I'll send
it on
to our legal department to expedite the NDA.

Thanks.

Regards,
Laura
