Tana,

Brad Flinn and I spoke re. the credit terms for Bellingham.  I have agreed to 
increase the cp's collateral threshold level from $500,000 to $750,000 as 
well as the third-party cross-default from $500,000 to $750,000.  Brad was 
going to check w/his attorney, at which time, somebody will contact you to 
let you know whether they've agreed to the $750,000 for both.  They may come 
back and just ask for the $750,000 increase to the collateral threshold and 
keep the $500,000 for the cross-default.  Either way, I'm fine with this.

Thanks for your follow up.

Tracy

Below is John's contact as Boeing.  He would like to get some credit so we 
can get this counterparty an ISDA.  I understand that you are under the gun 
today, if you could just let us know when we might be able to get some 
credit.  Much thanks!
