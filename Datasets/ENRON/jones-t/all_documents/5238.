I actually received the last document I need to put otgether binders this 
week.  Linda and I will compile closing binders with all the relevant 
documents next week and send you one set for your files.  I will send copies 
of the RBC documents to Rick at the same time.

So, when are you going to come and enjoy our crisp weather?  Mark Taylor 
e-mailed me saying he thought it was a good idea for you to come up here to 
train Linda and Sharon.  It ain't Stampede, but at least Peter and I can 
return the hospitality.

on the prepay.  Can you send him a copy?  Also, when they're all together,
