Bill,

I think you are about to become my new best friend!

We have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on 
EnronOnline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.  The 
Counterparty sent in a Password Application styled:  Koch Industries, Inc., 
acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  (Which also happens to 
be the same styling on the Master Swap Agreement we have in place with this 
Counterparty.)

They way I understand it, GCP has the two following Counterparties already 
set up:  (1) Koch Industries, Inc., and (2) Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

The EnronOnline Team has been trained to never set up a company as a 
division, to always send the Password Application back to the Counterparty 
and try to get the Counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal 
incorporated name as part of the counterparty name, which they sucessfully 
did in this instance, but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.

Can you help us?!!!
