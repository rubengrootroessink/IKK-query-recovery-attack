Hi there.  I don't believe we've spoken before, but I'm new to Enron and
will be managing the Emerging Products documentation, including Weather.
I just spoke with Brent Hendry, and he directed me to you for help on the 
following:

The weather desk has done two new deals with the counterparty Hanover Re, with
whom we have not done business before.  Below is the email received from 
credit
stating no additional credit terms.  I guess at this point I need to have you 
put together
a Deemed ISDA for this counterparty.   Please let me know exactly what you 
need from
me (if anything), and I'll get it to you right away.  

Thanks,
Diane Anderson

P.S. - Both deals are between ENA and Hanover Re, not Enron Re as Tanya wrote

This trade is ok to confirm without additional credit terms - we just need to 
be sure we are using the correct name (which should be Hannover 
Ruckversicherungs).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  I would 
be interested in understanding why we are conducting the trade out of Enron 
Re instead of ENA.  I assume we are still documenting using  a deemed ISDA?  
Thanks!
