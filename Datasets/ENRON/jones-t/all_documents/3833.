Ms. Tana,

Sorry about flaking out on you this past weekend.  I have been so tired and
especially with all of the running I have been doing.  Hopefully, I will
feel better after the Chicago marathon on Oct. 22.

Just to fill you in on a couple of things, I sold my house to a builder and
signed a contract on the townhouse on Timmons Lane.  I decided I didn't want
another house right now and simplifying rather than complicating my life was
more in order for me.  Plus, I can put money away for college.  The 2
closings will not finalize at the same time because I am assuming the
townhouse loan and it will take longer.  I am looking at moving some time in
October.

Please forgive me for not staying in touch as I would have liked, but it has
been very stressful and wears on my old bones.  You know how it is when you
have decisions to make (alone)!  I think about you a lot, so please don't
take it personally.

By the way, if you care to look at the plants in my yard, you are more than
welcome.  I have one in a pot that I bought this summer that needs to be
planted because it dries out too quickly in the pot.  I can't remember the
name right now but will look tonight and let you know so you can ask your
gardener if she thinks you should have it.  It has a pretty little purple
bloom on it and I think it blooms all summer.  I will have a small patio,
but it is already planted with azaleas and I don't need any more pots.

Talk to you soon.
