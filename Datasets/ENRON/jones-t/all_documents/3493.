Hello, we typically trade in Megawatts not kilowatts.  I am not sure of the 
standard for Megawatts or kilowatts.  I have asked a few people around my and 
they don't know either.  Sorry I have not been helpful.  If I find out the 
answer I will let you know.

Thanks,
Melissa

Melissa,

We've got a counterparty with a draft of a master where the counterparty has 
the rounding conventing for kilowatts at 6 decimal points.  Is that our 
standard convention?  Thanks for your help!

P.S.  I have passed your request for a copy of that assignment to my 
assistant Taffy Milligan.  She can get you copies of any documents in the 
future.
