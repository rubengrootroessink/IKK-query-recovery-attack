See the attached language per the following.



Pursuant to the request of the paper/pulp trading desk via Jay Epstein, the 
foregoing language should be included in all paper/pulp confirmations 
prepared as omnibus confirmations.  This language should not be inlcuded 
where an ISDA is in place because the ISDA already includes pertinent 
language.

MarkTaylor and Tana Jones:  The trading desk has also requested that this 
language/concept be included in all online transactions via Enron Online or 
Click Paper.   Tana, please speak with Mark and Jay about how this can be 
implemented.  Of course, the language will have to be conformed to the online 
documentation/definitions.


Cordially,
