Bank One Line is closing today, with give up agreement to be finalized early 
next week.  If there is any particular "file" processing for credit lines 
applicable to this group, please advise.  Otherwise, I will have file with 
originals set up and provided to Kay Young for central file room.

ABN further comments are due Monday and phone conference indicates very few 
issues.  Should close next week.

By copy to Jeff, please provide tax comments on ABN on Monday.  Thank you.  
Mary
