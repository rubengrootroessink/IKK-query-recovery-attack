This is just too funny not to pass on!  Happy Monday!



Why I Fired My Secretary

Two weeks ago was my 45th birthday, and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning 
anyway. I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say "Happy 
Birthday," and probably have a present for me. She didn't even say "Good 
Morning," let alone any "Happy Birthday." I thought,"Well, that's wives for 
you. The children will remember." The children came in to breakfast and 
didn't say a word. When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and 
despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet said, "Good 
Morning Boss, Happy Birthday." And I felt a little better; someone had 
remembered. I worked until noon. Then, Janet knocked on my door and said,"You 
know, it's such a beautiful day outside and it's your birthday, let's go to 
lunch, just you and me." I said, "By George, that's the greatest thing I've 
heard all day.  Let's go." We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally 
go; we went out into the country to a little private place.  We had two 
martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously.  On the way back to the office, she 
said,"You know, it's such a  beautiful  day. We don't need to go back to the 
office, do we?" I said, "No, I  guess not." She said, "Let's go to my 
apartment." After arriving at  her apartment she said, "Boss, if you don't 
mind, I think I'll go into the  bedroom and slip into something more 
comfortable." "Sure,"  excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in 
about six minutes, she came  out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my 
wife, children, and dozens of our friends. All were singing Happy Birthday... 
and there on the couch I sat...     


naked.
