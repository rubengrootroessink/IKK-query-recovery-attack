Cynthia -

Brian asked me to forward to you Enron's comments on the nondisclosure 
agreement previously forwarded for review.  I have attached a version of your 
agreement marked to reflect Enron's comments.

Please review the attached at your convenience and feel free to contact me 
directly with any comments or questions you may have.

Thanks for your patience.
