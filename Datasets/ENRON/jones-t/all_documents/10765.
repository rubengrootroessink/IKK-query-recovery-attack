Steve -

I looked at the below language.  I guess I still have some concerns about the 
concept.

Why don't we go back to your original suggestion and delete the concept 
entirely.  I am sure if either party believes strongly enough that a breach 
has occurred, it will pursue its available remedies.

If this is acceptable, I will work off of the draft forwarded by Brenda and 
see if we can finalize a document for signature by Enron.

Please let me know if this will work.

Thanks.
