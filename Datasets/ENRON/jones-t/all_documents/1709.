- Paragraph 3: Same concern as in last email.
- Paragraph 4: Are we happy to forego the application of the liabilities 
clause whenever a Counterparty does a transaction under a Master agreement,

Subject: Kennecott ETA Amendment Letter

David:
Enclosed is a new draft of the Kennecott amendment letter.  Mark and I have 
discussed the counterparty termination language and have come up with the 
language that I have high;lighted.  Upon your approval, I plan to use the 
same language for the Duke and Cinnergy letters.
