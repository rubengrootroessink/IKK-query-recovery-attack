Tana:  So you'll know.  Sun MicroSystems is the agreement that's been 
floating out there - I think hung up on the residuals clause.  Travis is out 
of town until May 7.  Is Mark Greenberg picking up Net Works stuff?

Hello Jonathan, John --

We look forward to the meeting next Wed. the 2nd in Palo Alto.  

Let's get at least a basic NDA in place so that we can get into some detail 
at the meeting.  Who should we work with on this?  Best regards.
