Enron=01,s United Way Campaign is quickly winding down.  With six days left=
 in=20
the campaign, only 45% of ENA employees have participated in this year=01,s=
=20
campaign.  Since we are striving for 100% participation, these numbers are=
=20
disappointing to us.

Last year, Enron's company-wide participation level was 78% with several=20
business units achieving 100% participation.  However, ENA had the poorest=
=20
participation rate of all Enron companies at 56%.  Needless to say, we can =
do=20
better.  In fact, we must do better.

Our expectations are high and rightfully so.  The Greater Houston Area is=
=20
important to all Enron employees and the United Way is one of the best ways=
=20
to invest in building a stronger community for us all.

This is an important cause and Enron is recognized in Houston for our=20
efforts.  Additionally, ENA employees are some of the most highly compensat=
ed=20
employees at Enron with generous bonus and option programs.  Please conside=
r=20
how your gift -- no matter how big or small -- can make a difference in our=

community.

Please log on to http://unitedway.enron.com now to change lives right here =

our community.  It's fast and easy.  For questions about the campaign, plea=

Thanks in advance for your generosity.
