We will need to shut them down for Australian power if they they don't have 
that level of assets. Weather products are fine a legal prespective as they 
are not subject to the same restrictions.

HS Energy Services is relying on a parent guaranty to be able to meet the ESP 
criteria.  It does not meet the financial test on its own.  However, we have 
approved them to trade financial and have an ISDA Master in place.  Should I 
shut them down for the Australia products?
