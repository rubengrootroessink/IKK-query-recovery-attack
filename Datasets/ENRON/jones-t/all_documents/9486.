Arfan,

We need to discuss this before you send anything out.  I had an extensive 
conversation today with Tana Jones in our Legal Department today.  She said 
that it is up to the London Legal department (Justin Boyd in particular) to 
set their own perameters with consultation with Houston Legal, and vice versa.

Those below are accurate, however, after speaking with Tana, the list below 
may not be comprehensive.  She is recommending that you speak with Justin 
Boyd.
 I think we may be putting ourselves in the middle of something that the two 
Legal groups should be discussing amongst themselves.  

Please feel free to call me tomorrow.

Thanks.  Lisa

Thanks for the response.  Please let me know if you agree with the following 
treatment and I will let our credit, legal and contracts departments know:

US Power - READ only
US GAS PHY (Restricted) - READ only
Argentinian Gas - READ only except for Argentinian customers

Please let me know so that we can do any clean up that we need to do.

Thanks

Arfan

Arfan,

US Phy Power Products can only be given to US counterparties.  US Gas Phy 
(RESTRICTED) (3 product types) are only given access to a select few 
counterparties that the US West Gas Traders approve.  All other 
counterparties should only have read access to these product types.

Also, please see the email directly below (in blue) from our Legal Department:

A few news flashes re: limitations on products:

1.  The only parties that can trade Argentina physical gas are Argentina 
counterparties.  They have licensing requirements similar to US physical 
power.  All existing counterparties that are not Argentinian should be shut 
down for this product.

2.  Mark Taylor just found out in a meeting with the tax guys that only ENA 
can only enter into credit derivates with US counterparties.  

If you have any other questions, please contact me or Stephanie Sever.

Regards,

Lisa

Arfan - I am passing your request to Lisa Lees since she has the low-down on 
that type of info (if it is applicable, that is).

Thanks!

Are there any restrictions on any of your product types that we should 
instruct our legal and credit deprtaments of as per my email below ?

For example we are not allowed to give any access for financial products 
types to Italina customers.

Thanks

When our legal and credit departments review counterparties for EnronOnline 
they will look at all product types and only restrict those that they have 
reason to.  We have not been told to restrict Argentinian gas and therefore 
our credit and legal department do not restrict access to this product type.  
I will check with the  Houston product control team to see if they are any 
restrictions

Arfan

Nicola,
    I am curious,  why are you reviewing this counterparty for Argentina Gas, 
since we do not have any activities going on right now.
This is one of the many records of counterparties that showed in EOL with 
Argentina Gas as a product type.
We started having this situation since last week and the legal and credit 
reps also showed up as London based.
That is the reason for our inquiry.  
Thanks for you your help.

Nicola,
 Being that everything has been updated in EOL, I couldn't attach a copy of a 
record.
Next time I find one, I will send you an attachment so that you can see what 
we are talking about it.
Thanks,
Janie
