I will be out of the office starting  2001/04/27 and will not return until 
2001/05/06.

I will not have access to email (or telephone messages) while I am away.  I 
will respond to any messages after I get back to the office but if you need 
to contact me urgently, please contact my assistant, Maggy Yamanishi (813
