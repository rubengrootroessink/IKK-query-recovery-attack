Mark

Thank you very much for your fast actions.  Our meeting with Sabre went very 
well. I will drop off our signed original to Tana shortly.  I look forward to 
meeting you soon.

Steve -

Attached is what I have as the final version of the Agreement.  It is a clean 
copy of the version forwarded to Enron by Brenda reflecting Sabre's changes 
to Enron's 3-20-01 draft.  The only modification I have made is in Section 7 
- Term.  Since we do not have Supplements attached to the agreement, this 
provision needed to be revised to reflect a different method of calculating 
the term.  I have provided for termination upon the earlier of (i) 2 years 
from the effective date or (ii) upon 30 days written notice from one party to 
the other.   In light of the fact that we do not have the Supplements, this 
seemed to make sense.

Please take a look at the attached and confirm it is acceptable.  If so, I 
plan on initialing an original and forwarding that document to our personnel 
in the morning for signature.  Since they will be meeting with Sabre 
personnel, I will be faxing it to them at your offices for them to sign and 
have countersigned by Sabre prior to their meeting.  Since I will be in a 
meeting out of the office tomorrow morning, I will be unable to address any 
changes.  Accordingly, please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks.

Mark, thanks for looking at the language.  Deleting the concept is fine.  If 
you need another copy
of the draft, please let me know.

Thanks, Steve
