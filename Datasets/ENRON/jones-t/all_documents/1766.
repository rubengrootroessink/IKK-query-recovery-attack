Tana,

I know you don't want me to be a "bottle neck" when new users need access to 
the system, so I put the following together to show how to create an SRRS 
request.

Take a look at the following groups in the Notes Name & Address book that 
have been set up specifically for your Financial Trading Agreements 
database.  This should help you to figure out the group(s) to which the 
persons listed in your email should belong:

group 1 --> Admin/Editor Access (people like you)
group 3--> Author/Editor Access (general users)
group 2--> Reader Access* (readers with all view/comments access)

*Default (open access) is restricted to Reader to only the one (1) 
un-secure/no comments view we set up.

Security Resource Request System (SRRS) link to SRRS -->
...then take a look at the following example of a request for access that I 
submitted; you can use this as an example:

I hope this helps, call me if you have any questions and we can discuss.

Mike 3-3363

Tana,

I have had a request from Michael Khajeh-Noori, Deepak Sitlani (London) and 
Michael Schuh  (Frankfurt) to access to the NEW Master Swap Agreements 
database, can you please confirm if they are allowed to access this database, 
and if so what level of access they should have.

Thanks & Regards
