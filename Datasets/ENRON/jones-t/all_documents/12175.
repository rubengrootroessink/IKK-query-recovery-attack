I have left Deb Robinson of Engage (403-297-1477) a voice mail indicating 
legal's need for a power marketing license if they want to sell power to us, 
but that buying is fine.  From a credit perspective, however, we are not 
changing our EOL enabling profile.

Stephanie/Tana,

Could you please expedite the following amendment the profiles of Engage 
Energy America LLC and Engage Energy Canada L.P. as soon as possible this 
morning.  Paul Radous is opening both of these entities up to trade all US 
East and West Phys Power products and I have made the changes in Profile 
Manager.

Thanks for your help !
