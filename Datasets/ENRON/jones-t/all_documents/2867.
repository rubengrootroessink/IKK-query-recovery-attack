Tana,

Do you have a copy of this stuff? Carol St. Clair worked on the issue.

Thanks,

Dave

OK with me in this instance. They should be supplied with our termination 
phone number and termination language used as previously constructed (I think 
we have done this before in the UK? If not, we have in the U.S.)

Dear Dave,

I hope all is well with you!

I have spoken with Dick Stoppe of Dow Benelux regarding issues they have with 
the ETA.  He told me that their lawyer has pointed out a variety of issues 
relating to the one-sidedness of the ETA.  However, Dow are prepared to 
accept the terms of the ETA if the termination clause 6(a) is made mutual.  I 
explained that they could stop trading if they were unhappy for whatever 
reason, but in such an eventuality their preference is not to have the ETA 
continuing in force.  I have no problems with this but obviously this needs 
your blessing to proceed.

Thanks, Edmund

Justin,

I have spoken to you a couple of weeks ago about Dow having inquiries about 
Enron Online and the termination clause. I have told them what you have told 
me, but they nevertheless would like to talk to you.

Dick Stoppe told me that he tried to give you a call but apparently he hasn't 
heard anything back.

Can you pls give them a call: 004117282144

Dow is one of the most important and biggest customer so I really would like 
to get them on board
