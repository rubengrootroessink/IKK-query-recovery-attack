Hi,
I'd like to have these turned around as soon as possible.  Leslie, I'd like 
to meet with you regarding this deal tomorrow morning, Friday 10/20, at 
10am.  Please advise if this works with your schedule.

I'm suggesting to Exodus that we add language to the Global US & Global UK 
order forms stating something like "the parties agree to negotiate in good 
faith the completion of the Master Services Agreement form by December 15, 
2000.  This order form is not binding until successful execution of the 
Master Services Agreement."  [Leslie, I sent the Master Services Agreement 
form to you via Tana earlier this week].
 
Regards,
Kara

Kara,

I'm enclosing the Siebel Orders that reflect space in the U.S. and the U.K.
The quantity is shown in terms of cages which contain 4 racks and 4 20-Amp
power circuits per cage.  I assumed 92 racks in the US and 12 racks in the
UK based on the assumption that a typical customer will take 3 racks at a
minimum.  I'd like to reiterate that this order does not obligate Enron.
The space will be billed as it installs, and I anticipate that we'll blow
past our projections!

There is also a line-item for full-time program management on the US order.
Like we discussed,  it's critical to have this person ramping-up each
marketplace and defining the bundles as we go.   I'll work through the LOI
tomorrow.  I'd like to target a signing meeting in Santa Clara for next week
while you're team is in town followed by the energy discussion with our
execs.

Please let me know if you have any questions.   I look forward to Rex's and
David's feedback after your meeting in the morning.

Thanks!
Andrea
