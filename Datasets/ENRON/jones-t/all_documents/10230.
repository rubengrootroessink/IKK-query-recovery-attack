Thank you for agreeing to coordinate this matter with the counterparty last 
week.  Upon my return from Spring Break, I received a facsimile sent March 
8th from Roger Sobotkiewicz (counsel for SaskEnergy) stating their intention 
in entering online transactions is that the Master Agreement with Enron 
Canada dated 7/19/1995 would prevail in the event of a conflict with the 
online Electronic Trading Agreement.  I am forwarding the document to you 
this morning via hand delivery.

SaskEnergy has a Master Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement dated July 19,1995
executed with Enron.  With respect to EnronOnline, it is not clear which
agreement or terms would prevail in the case of a difference between the 2
agreements.  Could you please clairfy?

I can be reached at the above email or by telephone at (306) 777-9376 or
fax (306) 569-3522.
