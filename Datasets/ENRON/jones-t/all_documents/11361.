FYI...Here is a web site for that ISO question I had.   I guess we don't 
worry about ISO's.  I will look into this.

John-
Derrick called back, he doesn't know anything about QS9000, I looked it up on
the web, you may want to look at the link attached to gather more info while I
ask around some more.

John-
No reply from Derrick yet.  On the software, our software people want to know 
if
it is called "Crystal Reports"?

Hey Mike

Please see the attached presentation we showed you on Wednesday.

 <<GM short deck 2001-04-24c.ppt>>

Also,

1. Any word from Derrick Starosa on the ISO question?
2. Do you have Crystal Ball application in order to run Monete Carlo
Simulations?

Have a good weekend.
