Thanks,

Dana,

You should copy Fred Philipson on future corresponence, as I will be focused 
on other activities.  Thanks for all your help and support.  I think Enron 
has a good solution that you should consider.

Subject: NDA - CMS Energy - Panhandle Pipe Line Companies

  This agreement should be in the name of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
Company.

We want to strike item #2.  The language provides that we will not disclose
the "existence" of the confidentiality agreement.  Normally, we only agree
not to disclose the confidential information.

If these changes are acceptable, we will be ready to arrange a meeting.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me.
