Surprise, surprise, we are rolling out another new product type next week.  
As documented below, this will be a financial power option.  Should we copy 
the customer profile for the existing east power financial swap or does this 
require special handling???  Please let me know as soon as you can.

Thanks for your help!!!

This is a follow-up to my e-mail sent yesterday; we are pushing on with this 
new Product Type.

Matt - I need a Sigma Factor.

Deal Type: US East Power Financial Option (Call)
Currency: USD
Country: US
Commodity: East Power
Default U of M: MWh

Please see the attached, and here's how these work:

The easy part is that it's a Call Option. Initially, we will only be offering 
this products as the Seller, meaning the Counterparty will pay the premium 
and ENA pays the Cash Settlement Amount. The option is 'automatically 
exercised' at any time the capacity of certain named nuclear power plants 
goes below 25% (which induces the 'Knock-in Period'). When this happens the 
Cash Settlement Amount will be the total of Notional Quantity X (Hourly PJM 
Floating Price - Strike Price (100 MWh) for each hour during the Knock-in 
Period, and in no event will be greater than USD 4MM. Knock-in Periods may 
commence upon the later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the first day a 
Knock-in Event occurs, and will end upon the earlier of (i) 160 Peak hours 
after the commencement of the Event, (ii) the conclusion of the Event, or 
(iiI) the Termination Date; so - you can have multiple Events during the term 
of the transaction, but there will only be one Cash Settlement Amount 
pay-out, which will be 30 days after the last date in the term of the 
transaction.

Per Legal, these transactions will be subject to the GTC and should never be 
subject to any existing Master Agreement.

discussions with Dale Neuner.  I have attached both a clean copy and a 
red-lined version against the last draft.
