 I left both of you a voice mail last night and I listened to it, but you 
probably did not hear my message very well due to a bad line.  Ultimately, 
Cassandra is needing some information on brokerage accounts first thing 
tomorrow morning (Wed., 11/15).  She will be going to San Antonio early 
afternoon and is needing to review a brokerage account document for Ted 
Murphy's signature.  Tana, as I mentioned in my voice mail, when Ted doesn't 
understand information that is requiring his signature, he will not sign it 
until he fully understands it.  Therefore, it is imperative that we get a 
listing of all brokerage accounts and the specific commodity groups they are 
currently work with (if available) to Cassandra as soon as possible; 
otherwise it will have to wait until Monday.  If I remember correctly, most 
of the brokerage agreements that need to be signed require a rush signature.  

Also, Cassandra needs to be able to sign off on these documents as Ted is on 
his way to London effective January 01; therefore we need to figure out a way 
that she should be added sooner rather than later.  I realize that Mark 
Taylor is out of the office until Monday; however, can Alan Aronowitz approve 
this request on his behalf?

Can you please give Cassandra a call at x30429 first thing so we can resolve 
this issue.

I really appreciate your attention to this matter.

You indicated you'd sent the instructions to have me added as a signer 
authorizing the opening  of new accounts, but when I spoke with Bob Bruce in 
Legal tonight, he said I had not been added to his knowledge.  Who did you 
send it the instructions to?  We just need to circle back with Bob so we've 
gone through the right channels.

Thank you,

Cassandra.
