Tana,
Sorry I did not get back to you earlier.  This is the first time I have read
email over the weekend.  Yes, Mark and I will host Church Gourmet at 7 p.m.
on Saturday, May 13. Does everyone have a dish to bring? Do we need to help
Ulf with the chicken and pork or something else? Let me know.  I will contact
my folks if you will contact yours.
Peace,
Beth

Our address is 4605 Willowbend Blvd.  We are in between Post Oak and Stella
Link just south of the 610 South Loop. Directions from Christ the King:
(There are many ways to get to our house, but I will give freeway
directions.)  From the church parking lot take Rice Blvd west to Kirby. Turn
right (north) on Kirby until you get to 59. Get on 59 going south and exit
the 610 loop going south. 610 will pass Meyerland Plaza on the right.  At the
same point where 610 turns headed east, take the Post Oak exit going south
and get in the far left lane (do not exit at West Bellfort).  Willowbend
Blvd. will be the first stoplight. Turn left.  After the first stoplight our
house will be on the right.  You may park in our driveway or on the street
(it is legal after 6 p.m.) or in the turn around space in the medians (just
make sure there is room for cars to pass).
