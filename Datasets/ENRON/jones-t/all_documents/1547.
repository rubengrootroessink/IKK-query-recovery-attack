"Let us now join reason to faith and action to experience, to transform our=
=20
unity of interest into a unity of purpose."
-Lyndon Baines Johnson

By now we have all seen the posters in the plaza, at the tops of the=20
escalators, at the bottoms of the escalators.  Or, at least, we have receiv=
ed=20
the emails and seen the chart-climbing graphic at all-employee meetings.  I=
t=01,
s everywhere:  One Enron.  And, by now, we all have a pretty good idea wher=
e=20
Management stands on the subject.

Now it=01,s your turn.  How do you feel about the One Enron concept?  Do yo=
u=20
have suggestions for how we can achieve this?  What sort of roadblocks do y=
ou=20
think we will face along the way? Will our culture allow us to break down t=
he=20
barriers between elevator banks?
