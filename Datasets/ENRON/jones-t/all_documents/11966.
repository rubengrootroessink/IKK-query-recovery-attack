I am not sure whether adequate notification has been received from PECO or 
ComEd since their merger to form Exelon, however all trades with these two 
former entities should be with Exelon Generation Company, LLC as all 
agreements have been assigned and assumed by this new entity.
 
Exelon have indicated that they are not prepared to sign an EEI Master 
Agreement for at least three months while they complete their restructuring. 
In the interim the area that I see causing potential confusion is if on 
EnronOnline, for example, different terms were agreed with PECO and ComEd. If 
this is the case please advise and we will need to find a solution  to avoid 
any confusion going forward.
 
In addition, from a credit perspective, there may be issues which Ed Sacks 
may want to re-visit.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus
