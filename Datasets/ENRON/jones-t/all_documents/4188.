It's another big week for eSpeak, with two thought-provoking events.
Join us Wednesday, October 4 at 10:00 am Houston time for Harry Arora, vice 
president of eCommerce.  Harry will be answering your questions about 
DealBench.
Thursday, October 5 at 10:00 am Houston time, Beth Tilney, managing director 
of marketing and communication, will be on hand to discuss Enron's new 
employee satisfaction survey:  The Pulse.
We hope you'll be able to participate in both events, but if you can't, be 
sure to pre-submit your questions on the eSpeak site.


Incubate your intelligence.  How?  First, recognize you have competitive 
intelligence.  Second, go to the Edge and post competitive intelligence. It's 
that easy.  We'll look for you on the Edge.
