Swapco;

*  related Enron Corp. Guarantee (incorporating Revolving Credit 
representations, warranties, financial covenants, etc.);

*  transaction Confirmation Letter (x2, i.e. financial prepay and interest 
rate swap);

*  legal opinion of Blakes re: ECC;

*  legal opinion of VE (or whoever) re: Enron Corp.;

*  legal opinion of Macleod Dixon re: Sapwco;
