Carlo,

We are OK with all of the changes you have proposed, except for the deletion 
of paragraph 5, which is important to us.  Considering the key individuals 
who have been  involved in the development of the EnronOnline system, our 
legal team has advised us to seek the inclusion of this section.   Please 
advise me of your further thoughts.

-John

John, I have sent you back our suggested changes to the NDA. If you agree,
then please send it back as final and we'll get it signed. As you can tell,
we removed section 5 since in the spirit of co-operation, this seems
inappropriate and a very unlikely circumstance.


Best Regards,

Carlo
