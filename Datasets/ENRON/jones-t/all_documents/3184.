Susan/Tana  
Do we have a Master Swap agreement with Credit Lyonnais SA (country of 
registration is France)?  We recently did a deal with them and the credit 
report is stating that a confirm is ok to go out since we have an MS with 
them.  I looked in your database and it seems that we don't have an MS.  Just 
wanted to check with you first before doing anything.
Let me know , thanks.
