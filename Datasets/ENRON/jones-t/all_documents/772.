Tana:

Neither ANR Pipeline Company nor Kimball Energy Corporation may trade U.S. 
power products.

ANR Pipeline Company is not a current trading partner and is not listed on 
the FERC lists of authorized power marketers.
Kimball Energy Corporation has been barred by credit and thus we are barring 
them as well.
