The question is; is it actually part of the legal name for the counterparty?  
If it's part of the legal name, fine, if it's not, we cannot be incorporating 
the state as part of the name in Global Counterparty, since this will not be 
the actual legal name.  If the problem is that people are making assumptions 
when they see a city or county name, then they will have to investigate a 
little further to see if this is really the city or county they want.  The 
main problem is that documents are generated from Global Counterparty using 
the legal name, such as invoices, payments and confirmations, and there could 
be legal implications if we do not have the proper name on the document.

What do think about putting the state in parenthesis after a city's 
counterparty name??

In the future, if we have a city or a county come through, we need to 
identify the state they are located in as part of the counterparty name.  The 
City of Huntsville is an example where I took it to be the the City of 
Huntsville, TX, and, per my conversation with Tom today, it appears they are 
the City of Huntsville, AL.  This isn't going to be a problem with my 
financial approval, since I shut down all cities for financial unless we have 
a master in place, but it might be a problem for power.  The same would apply 
to counties.

So, if we get cities and counties in, let's try and make the state part of 
the counterparty name.

 Leslie, do you have any problem w/Huntsville, let me know?
