Attached is an Approval Form that will have to be completed to request if we 
want to trade with a new counterparty or on a new reference credit. I have 
incorporated comments from Origination, Credit and Legal. But should you have 
any further comments please let me know ASAP, as I plan to introduce this 
form by the middle of next week. (Note that there will be two forms, one for 
bankruptcy swaps and one for other credit derivatives.)

Regards

Tomas
