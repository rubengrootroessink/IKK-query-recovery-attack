Tana,
I didn't have much luck with the gentlemen in London.  His counterpart in the 
US is Jim Paul and he'll try to get it signed.  I wasn't sure if you need to 
change anything in the document for the US.  Please email a revised copy to 
jpaul@carrfut.com.  His mail address is Carr Futures, Inc., One World Trade 
Center, 92nd Floor, NY, NY 10048.

Thanks,

Dan
