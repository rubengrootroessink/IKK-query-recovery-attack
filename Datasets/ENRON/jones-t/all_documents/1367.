Tana, I received a request this week from Jannalyn Galloway of Reliant Energy 
Services Canada, Ltd. to commence the process of putting an ISDA in place 
between Enron Canada Corp. and Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  We 
recently finalized a Master Physical Agreement between these parties and I 
was wondering if you could commence the process of obtaining credit approval 
to do the ISDA and provide a draft to Jannalyn.  Her fax number is 
713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as 
above.

Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me 
know.

Greg
