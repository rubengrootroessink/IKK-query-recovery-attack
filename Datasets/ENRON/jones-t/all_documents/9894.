Due to the City of Houston water main problems in front of EB1 the city will 
begin repairs at 7PM tonight.  There is a possibility that this repair will 
shut off the domestic water supply to the building and could last for  4 - 5 
hours.  This will not affect critical HVAC equipment,  but it will affect 
restrooms and kitchens.  Again there is a possiblibity the domestic water 
could be off from 7PM - 11PM.
