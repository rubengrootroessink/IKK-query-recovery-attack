Tana,

We are not certain that Netherlands and German counterparties are permitted 
to trade the U.S. Bandwidth products.  I have left a voice mail for Mark 
Elliott asking him about these countries.  We think that until we have a 
definite answer, these counterparties should not be approved for trading U.S. 
Bandwidth products online.  Perhaps once we speak with Mark (hopefully on 
Monday), we will be in a better position to know if we can open these 
counterparties  for trading online.

Have a good weekend!
