Would you be able to do me a favour and take a look at the attached NDA - or 
ask a colleague to do so - many thanks - as we are to stick with Texan law, 
please ignore my mark-up and look at the document at the bottom.

Any questions please don't hesitate - many thanks

Kind regards 

Michael

Michael - .com is based in London.  IO think it would be best to stick to 
Texas law at this stage - can you get this signed -off in Houston.

Tks alot for your help,

Denis

A couple of points - EnronCredit.com's registered address is here (Unless 
there is a US entity of the same name?)
Not surprisingly it is governed by the laws of Texas. Two things we can do - 
change it to the laws of England and have arbitration in London (I've 
provided for that approach in the attached document) - or send it to Houston 
for review (I have a contact we can send it to).

Otherwise it looks a standard NDA.

Mike

USA is closed for Thanksgiving Thursday and Friday, so we are OK so long as 
we get it out by 5pm Friday.
