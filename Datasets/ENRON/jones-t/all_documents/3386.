This should help clarify a lot of things, thanks Tana for the Certificate of 
assumed name.

The receipt of the assumed name certificate from the State of Illinois proves 
that Northern Ilinois Gas Company is an active Corporation (set up in GCP as 
a HQ company) with Nicor Gas Company as their assumed name (Set up in GCP as 
a tradename). Seems like in Global Counterparty both the counterparties are 
set up exactly the way it should be. The request below is to change the 
tradename's name from Nicor Gas Company to Northen Ilinois Gas Company dba 
Nicor Gas Company, which I don't have any documentation or instructions for. 
Upon my conversation with Sandy Allison, Attorney Nicor Gas at Ph (630) 
983-8676 x2882 all the contracts and legal binding documents should carry the 
name Nicor Gas Company, and so does the Assumed Name Certificate says. In 
addition, Marcia Nawrocki, Attorney Nicor Gas on her fax cover sheet attached 
with the Certificate, instructed to "use NICOR GAS COMANY".

In lieu of the above facts, Global Counterparty does not feel necessary to 
make any changes in its database. 
Regards!

Susan Bailey, the paralegal working on this master, spoke to the Company 
after receiving these emails.  They faxed to her a copy of the assumed  name 
certificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under 
the name Nicor Gas Company.  Per her conversations they have not changed 
their name, they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas 
Company.  Being so, the online account would have to be renamed as Northern 
Illinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company.  Per my conversation with Stacy 
Dickson, a physical gas lawyer, they still transact physical gas under their 
master with Northern Illinois Gas Company.  I will have a copy of the assumed 
name certificate walked down to Adnan.  If we are all in agreement after 
this, it seems like we need two counterparty names "Northern Illinois Gas 
Company" and "Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company".  Upon 
receipt of the assumed name certificate, please confirm your agreement and I 
will contact Credit and the Online team.

OK, guys, based on Adnan's information from the counterparty, all contracts 
under Northern Illinois Gas Company will be changed (via name overlay) to 
Nicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change 
documentation.   Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ 
company and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up 
under Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract 
can be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.

I apologize for all the confusion and hope this helps all parties concerned.

Thanks,
Stacey

Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name "Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names "contractually" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

Nicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further 
clarifications in this matter.

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.
