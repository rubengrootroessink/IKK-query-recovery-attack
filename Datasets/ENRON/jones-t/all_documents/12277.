Thanks Tana for following up on our discussion with Mark Taylor and Sara on 
Friday.  Mike was scheduled to come on Friday and provide me the server that 
your database is located on.  I did tell him of our efforts to try to 
determine the server when I came to your office.  He did indicate that the 
did not think it was a CORP vs. ECT domain issue. Mike will hopefully come to 
help us out today or this week.

Thanks.
Shemeika

I have submitted the security requests to get the three of you access to the 
"Other Agreements" subdirectory of the Financial Agreement Database.  That 
approval usually takes about a day, as soon as it comes through I'll let you 
know.  You will of course, still need to solve how to get into the directory 
with Mike Neves.  Let me know when you can get in.
