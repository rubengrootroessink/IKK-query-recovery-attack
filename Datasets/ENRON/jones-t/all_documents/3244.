Tana-

Please put me on the list, so that I can begin monitoring these issues.  When 
I return to the States (around the beginning of October, if all goes 
according to plan) this duty will then be passed on to the permanent Enron 
lawyer in Tokyo.

Thanks,

John

		 Subject: Online Japanese Counterparties

Do you want to be on the distribution to see the daily Excel Spreadsheets 
when they have Japanese counterparties for approval?  For online, what I 
daily do is send my new counterparty lists to each of the relevant trading 
legal groups.  Each of the legal trading groups has one day to respond or I 
will consider their products approved for the counterparties on that day's 
list.  I have been giving the approvals for Japanese counterparties.  
Currently, I am approving them for all products (with the only restriction 
being on bandwidth, where they can only trade the US segment, which happens 
to be the only bandwidth products we have opened online so far!).   I 
understand that when we offer Japanese based products the approval process 
may get more complex.

Saying all that, do you want to be on the list for the daily approvals, or do 
you want me to continue to respond for Japan w/o running it by you?
