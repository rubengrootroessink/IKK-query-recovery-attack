Subject: Enron MOU


Hello Teresa:

Pursuant to our recent conversations, attached please find a Memorandum of
Understanding.  The MOU includes the list of questions upon which Aether
would like clarification.  I am also including a copy of our Standard
Non-disclosure Agreement.  Please have a look at both and let me know what
you think.  Please note that the MOU lists Louise Kitchen as a cc'd party.
I did not cc her myself.  I will leave that to you.

As for the NDA, can you please have 2 copies signed by the appropriate
parties and mail them to the attention of:

David Buehler
General Counsel
Aether Systems, Inc.
11460 Cronridge Drive
Owings Mills, Maryland 21117
410-654-6400

We will execute both and return one signed copy to you.

Lets try and talk late tomorrow.  I can be reached at the number below, but
I will be working a Trade Show most of the day, so please leave a message if
you don't get me.  Otherwise, I will try you after the show breaks around
4:00PM ET.

Thank you.

Ron
