Just because you have 13 masters out for signature doesn't mean you will get 
13 signed masters back.  What are you doing, calling in the troops so that 
you all can crush me!  I sure thought Susan and Samantha wouldn't fall into 
your evil ways, but I guess I was wrong.  Oh well, hopefully I will soon be 
able to shout from the rooftops that "EBS RULES!!!!!!!!!!!".

I was a little dismayed after our lunch when you disclosed the number of 
broadband masters potentially close to signature. However, I was a little 
cheered up when I got back and checked with the Swap Group and found out we 
have 13 masters out for signatures right now.  It still may be hard to beat 
you at your going rate...but, all I have to say is we're still in the 
game...GO TEAM!!!
