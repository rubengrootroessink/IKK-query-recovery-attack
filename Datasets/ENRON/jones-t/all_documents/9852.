Frank,

We do have small exposure on the physical gas side with Apache, although not 
much.  We also have a Master Physical document dated 1995, although I do not 
know what lawyer would work on that.  I would approach Dan Hyvl on that.  
Also, I am not sure if you are aware buy Enron Corp issued a $25MM guaranty 
in conjunction with the Master Swap agreement dated 1994.  

Thanks
Russell
