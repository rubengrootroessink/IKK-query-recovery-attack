Gillian,
I have reviewed Enroncredit's requested changes to the NDA.  Most are fine.
In response to some, I have added or changed some language.  The only real
significant issue that I could see was the length of the protection period.
The absolute minimum i2 will agree to is 3 years.  Please review my changes
in the attached document.  I would be happy to discuss any of these and can
be reached at the numbers below.
Thanks for your help and your consideration.
