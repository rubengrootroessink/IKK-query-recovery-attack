Wayne -

Please see the below.

I confirmed with Dynegydirect the use of the exhibit is to reflect situations 
where Enron has a master agreement that is intended to control over the 
on-line GTC's.  With this attached to the ETA, the concerns you have about 
the GTC's should be satisfied.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

Thanks for your assistance.

Mark,

This may help.  It appears that Dynegy has amended the ETA to include a 
Master Agreement for Coal.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Dear Ms. Sheri Thomas,

Please attach the revised exhibit to your ETA with Dynegydirect.  The
change is due to your request for Coal and Emissions.

If you have any questions please call me at (713) 767-4582.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.
