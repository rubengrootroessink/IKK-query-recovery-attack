Yeh, you're right.  It is her fault.  In the past, she always had plans and 
couldn't (or just didn't want to) go with us.  I guess that's the price you 
pay for being so popular and in demand.

It's really all Genia's fault, she goes to lunch too darn early.  I guess we 
need to make a date beforehand for lunch with you...!

Hey, I was an invited guest.  It wasn't my party!  Sounds like someone is 
trying to weasel herself out of trouble.
