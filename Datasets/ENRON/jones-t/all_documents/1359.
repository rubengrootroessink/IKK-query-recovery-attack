Enron/Reuters Working Group:

Attached please find revised copies of the Order Forms and Terms & Conditions.
Please note the following changes (as discussed with Enron this afternoon):

NEWS ORDER FORM (Order Form No. 1):
The Base Service Fees have been modified to reflect $78k per month in year 1 
and
$83k thereafter.
References to "April 24" have been changed to "April 25"

DATA ORDER FORM (Order Form No. 2):
Page numbers have been inserted at the top left of each page
References to "April 24" have been changed to "April 25" (pages 1 and 4)
The date of termination by Enron has been changed from "September 1" to
"September 7".
The $5000 fee waiver for the first year of quotes has been dropped (see page 
5,
sec. 1), reflecting the fact that $5000 has been reduced from the News Order
Form in the first year.

TERMS & CONDITIONS
Section 1.1:  The term is now defined as 24 months from the 1st day of the 
month
following the "Initial Billing Date".
Section 10.1:  In order to make the language consistent between the Terms &
Conditions and the Order Forms, the term "Minimum Charges" has been replaced
with "Base Service Fees".

If these changes are satisfactory to the parties, then we may prepare copies 
for
execution.
