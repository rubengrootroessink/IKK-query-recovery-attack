Tana,
We were reviewing the attached list and had a few questions on the 
Counterparty Names:

Aquilla Energy Marketing Corporation  .....We are trading financial deals 
with them under the name Utilicorp United Inc. 
Coral Power LLC    .....We are using Coral Energy Holding L.P. (this is the 
entity with whom we have the Master Agreement) 

Let me know what you think on these two...

Kim Theriot

Per the request of Stephanie Sever, I am attaching a list responding to her 
request to confirm the attached counterparties ability to trade financial 
power products online.  Stephanie, the ones I said "OK to open" you will need 
to go in and open for financial power (from Legal only).

Call me if you have any questions about specific counterparties.
