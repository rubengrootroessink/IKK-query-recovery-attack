Dear All,

So far the only information that I have received is that we are members of:
International Petroleum Exchange
Amsterdam Power Exchange  N.V. (APX)
Spanish Pool (Mercadeo de electricidad - Omel).
and
UK Pool

However as you can see from the email from Tana Jones attached at the bottom 
this does not complete all the information she needs. Can anyone provide any 
further information, if not please can you let me alternative sources.  

Many thanks
Lorna

Dear All,
Many thanks for your responses, however I would greatly appreciate some more 
information.  I attach the email that was sent to me last week requesting the 
information and hope this provides an adequate guide.
Many thanks and have a great Easter break

Subject: Need Information for Audit

In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin 
funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of 
all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the 
products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any 
rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should 
include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy 
commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.

Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.  
Much thanks!
