Mark:

Attached please find the final version of the NDA revised as per our
discussion this morning.  I have attached both a clean version and a
red-line against the last version I sent to you.  As we discussed, I will
have the NDA executed and forward to Lee for execution on your end.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen
