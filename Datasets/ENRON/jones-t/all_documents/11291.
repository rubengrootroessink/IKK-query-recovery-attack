Raquel:

Please see my proposed revisions to the Password App.  Let me know if this
addresses your concerns.  If so, please provide me with the full name of PG
Works, as well as the mailing address and recipient for the side letter so
that I can finalize.

Regards,

Leslie

Leslie:  Thanks.  My only comment is that your suggested language should
also apply to Condition (2), second paragraph, of the "Enron Online
Password
Application." Please let me know if you concur.  Thanks.
