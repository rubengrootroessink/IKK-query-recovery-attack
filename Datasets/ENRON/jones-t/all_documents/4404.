Tana,

Back in March of '97, we did an IR swap with the above counterparty.  I think 
the documentation may have been done in legal, as we have no record of it at 
all, and nothing ever went to the file room.  Would it be possible for you to 
pull the file and se if there is a confirm for a trade with the following 
details?

Initial Notional USD 5,803,569
ENA pays float--1month LIBOR
CPFL pays fixed 6.15%
Effective October 30, 1997
Expires December 31, 2001

Deal number M 43205

If you have such a deal, could you please forward me a copy of the 
confirmation?  THanks!
