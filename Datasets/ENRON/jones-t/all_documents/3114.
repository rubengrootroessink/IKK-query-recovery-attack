Joe,

The hounding can soon stop from Credit.  I sent a copy of the assignment 
notification to Bridgette Anderson in Financial Global Contracts this 
afternoon, she is going to have legal approve it and then she can have the 
contracts assigned.  Can you follow up with her so the deals can be moved 
over.

Thanks,
Russell

Russell/John,

I can't remember which of you was requesting the change for Phoenix deals to 
be moved to Dominion Field Svcs, but here's the latest.  Neither Susan Bailey 
or Tana Jones knows of an Assignment or name change, so if you have any 
back-up info on these, let me know.  Until we get notified by someone in 
Legal, we're not able to move these deals over.  Let me know if you have 
anything.

Thanks,
Joe

I looked in the Lotus Notes database, and I didn't see anything about this.  
Unless Susan is working on this, I know nothing...

Susan/Tana,

I'm getting hounded by Credit to move some deals booked with Phoenix Dominion 
Energy LLC over to Dominion Field Services, Inc..  Are either of you aware of 
an Assignment Agreement reflecting this change?  Let me know if it's okay to 
do this.

Thanks,
Joe
