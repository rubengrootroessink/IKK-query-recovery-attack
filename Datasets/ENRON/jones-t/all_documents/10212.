John,

Give me a call and let me know how you want to move forward.  My best guess
is that if your legal signs off then fedex a hard compy to Totality attn
John Sheputis.

Joe,  and I think Tom you were looking for this too.  sorry it took me this
long, didn't realize it was a priority.  but here you go with my comments.
I didn't make many comments, (being Enron--i.e.Jurisdiction) however the
most important would be the Arbitration clause.  we would not want our
Confidential Info--e.g.. intellectual property handled by and
Arbitrator--too important.  You can have them call me directly to discuss if
they have any problems.

Kate
