Tana:

Stupid request but it's important to this CP -- please sent John Nugent a 
revised form of NDA with  Enron Net Works LLC as the only Enron entity 
(delete both ENA and EOL).  Then, I hope that he will review it.

Thanks,

Leslie

John - The legal department informed me that the Enron NDA would be mutually 
binding and if we worked from your Purchase Pooling NDA that it would take a 
few days before they could review the document.  Is it possible to work from 
the Enron NDA or do you or your attorneys have specific questions?
