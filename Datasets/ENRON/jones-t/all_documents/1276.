Karen, regarding HPL EOL contracts, I added the information recited below 
concerning the ETA to the Core Main comments for contract 96001929.  I have 
not seen any assignment information pertaining to this contract, therefore 
the contract will remain in the U.S. Gas name for the present time.

Tana, if you have any asset assignment paperwork please forward copies to 
Marilyn Colbert, Debra Perlingiere and me so that we can process the 
information appropriately within each group.    aa
