John,

This will be no problem.  I will have Mark Greenberg contact you when he 
returns to the office tomorrow.  Hope we can resolve these issues in the near 
future. 

Again, please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.  

Thanks,
Adri

Subject: Confidentiality Agreement


Tim Smith said you  had a form of confidentiality agreement you had sent to 
him.  We have  taken the time to prepare and provide you a confidentiality 
agreement which  contains substantive provisions that have already been 
reviewed by your counsel  in our other dealings.  Many of the provisions are 
very similar both  agreements.  Therefore, please have your counsel review 
that document as  soon as possible.
