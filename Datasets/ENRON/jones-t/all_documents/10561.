Are they confirmations being returned to us or are they ones that the confirm 
desk has questions on for us?

Reggie just brought around a whole stack of confirms of pulp & paper deals 
that came into the fax area.  Is anyone looking for this stack of confirms?  
If not, I'll have Reggie walk them down to Joe Hunter.
