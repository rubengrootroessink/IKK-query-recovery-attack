Bob -

I am out until late this afternoon or tomorrow.  Unfortunately, I cannot 
access the last version of the Prebon LOI to ensure I have all final 
comments.  If either you or Michael could forward the final document to me 
and Tana, we will ensure that all similar language is included in the Prebon 
BETA and Fee Agreement.

As to Amerex, I have not seen any comments yet.  If they have come in over 
the last two days, I will catch up to them tomorrow.

As to Natsource, I will set a time with Carol to finalize.  She has been 
traveling and I have been out.  I will update you once that meeting is set or 
has taken place.

Have a good weekend.

Mark can you please revise the Prebon agreements to reflect changes to the 
LOI.  I will be out until next Tuesday and would like to move forward on 
Prebon, Amerex and Natsource.  Thanks
