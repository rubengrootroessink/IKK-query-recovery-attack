I have received an executed Futures Agreement for Carr Futures, Inc.  
(CP#57764) from legal.  It is an old agreement that dates back to 1996.

I see where this counterparty is in Profile Manager but would like for you to 
verify whether or not this agreement should be set up for on-line trading.

Thanks,
Georgi @5-4435
