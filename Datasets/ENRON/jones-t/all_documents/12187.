As discussed the buy approval, from the legal perspective only relates to the 
US entity, not the Canadian entity.

I have left Deb Robinson of Engage (403-297-1477) a voice mail indicating 
legal's need for a power marketing license if they want to sell power to us, 
but that buying is fine.  From a credit perspective, however, we are not 
changing our EOL enabling profile.
