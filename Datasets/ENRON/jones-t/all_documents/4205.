Both Chile and Peru have been approved for all products.  Use the North 
American forms of the Electronic Trading Agreement and the Password 
Application for companies located in both countries.  Please note that the 
EOL agreements, including the GTCs, should not be subject to local law and 
the Enron entity must not have a permanent establishment or branch located in 
Chile or Peru.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
