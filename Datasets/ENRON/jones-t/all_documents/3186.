Miss Tana,
?
Hope you are doing o.k.? Have you been able to  get any relief from working 
so much?
?
I haven't heard anything from Enron.? Think it  is a dead-end street???
?
Also, Sarah and I are now thinking about buying a  townhouse on Timmons Lane, 
across from the post office between W. Alabama and  Westheimer.? What a 
change in lifestyle???!!!!?? It certainly  would be a better deal for me 
financially now because I could put some money  away for college.? I know the 
return on townhouses is not anything like a  house, but it might really be a 
welcome change for both of us.? The place  is Park St. John, red brick, and 
you probably know which ones I am talking  about.? I went in to see several 
of the units and have found one that is in  very good shape.? Clean, new 
hardwoods, new tile, new carpet.? 2  BR/2BATH, small patio (need some 
plants???) and very well maintained.? What  do you think??? I looked out in? 
Garden Oaks this weekend and saw a  lot of cute places out there.? 
?
