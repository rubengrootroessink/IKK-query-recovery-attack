MONDAY 1ST MAY 2000
ENRON HOUSE - LONDON OFFICE CLOSED


The London office will be closed and NO employees will be allowed entry to 
Enron House due to Anti-Capitalist Demonstrations which are being held from 
Saturday 29th May through to Monday 1st May 2000.  

We would also like to advise any visitors travelling to London to AVOID the 
West End.

Thank you.
