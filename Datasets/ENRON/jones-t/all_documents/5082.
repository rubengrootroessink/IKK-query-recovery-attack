Subject: EOL Deal With Bad Spread Price

Hi Bruce,

As per our conversation this morning, I've been looking over EOL deal number 
547959 (TAGG deal number Q75763.1) and it looks like a situation that Legal 
will definitely need to be advised of in order to determine the most 
appropriate course of action. This Nat Gas spread trade's price was set at 
better than 9 dollars, which is clearly a bad price, but PG&E is the seller 
and they could potentially try to hold us to the trade. Since this sort of 
situation could easily lead to problems (both legal and relationship-wise) 
with the counterparty in question, I would strongly reccomend getting 
guidance from the Legal Department on how best to handle the deal.

I'm sure that Commercial will also be trying to contact Legal regarding this 
situation and I will forward this email to them as well. Just let me know if 
you have any trouble contacting them from your end and be sure to keep me 
informed of any decisions they make. I will do likewise if I hear back from 
them first. 

Thanks

Torrey
