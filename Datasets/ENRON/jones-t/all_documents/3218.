Leslie-  I'm checking on the status of the letter agreement we had agreed to
for the Enron On Line terms and conditions-- when do you think we can expect
to see this letter agreement?  I will be out of the office until September
6, so if it's prepared before then, please email to Laurie Peddicord -- her
name appears at the top of this email.  Thanks.
