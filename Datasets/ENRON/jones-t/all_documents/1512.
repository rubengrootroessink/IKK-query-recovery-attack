Subject: Listing of Finalcial Contracts in Global Contracts

 Here is a listing of all the Financial contracts we currently have in 
Global. The listing shows the type of contract and the transaction types each 
contract allows, that is why the same contract number will be listed several 
times.  If you would like clarification on any contract please contact 
Anthony Campos at 3-7911.
