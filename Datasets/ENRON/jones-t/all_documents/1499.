Three of the five parties are full and ready to go.  Tana Jones is still 
working on getting responses from her group.  I asked her to call you if she 
ends up with fewer than 8 persons at her house.  You two might need to 
combine parties like you did last time with Anne Pearson.

Life is getting pretty crazy for me with the move - I'll help if you need me 
but am running low on creative grey matter at the moment.
