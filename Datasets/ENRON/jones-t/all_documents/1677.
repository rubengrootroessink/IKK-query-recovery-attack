Attached below are two seperate Credit Worksheets for the subject 
counterparties.  Both requests are from Caroline Abramo who trades in New 
York and Houston (You can reach her at 212-702-3910 or x3-6619).  She will be 
visiting the counterparties soon and would like to have sent them the 
documents within the month.

  

Thanks,
