At the direction of Mark Taylor in order to meet the EOL business demands the 
following files are being reassigned from Tana as set forth below.  On each 
file you are assigned please change the paralegal assignment in the trading 
database and review the comment sections to provide yourself with an update 
on the file and then check with the current attorney and ask if there is 
anything currently required of you with respect to the file.  If you have 
questions on the files, you should feel free to visit with Tana too.  In the 
future Tana will handle only limited ISDA files, but of course she is always 
available to answer questions adn problem solve.

Panus:  Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited/ Apache
Lakeside Feeders Ltd.
Ontario Power
BNP Paribas (Guaranty only)

Bailey:  Engage Canada

Samantha is not now being assigned additional files because many more of her 
files are now high or very high.

Thanks, as always.
