A process agent is just a "legal" representative of the Chilean counterparty 
located in the US.  The agent can not/should not execute any trades on behalf 
of the customer.  Basically, Chilean customers should not be treated any 
differently than any other EOL customer, other than there should be an 
appointed process agent.

Lisa - We need to talk to Tana to ensure that the verification of a process 
agent for Chilean customers is covered by our approval process.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Frank,

Is the "process agent",  someone who is an agent in the US that can execute 
trades on EOL for and on behalf of Chilean customers?

Regards,

Kathy

FYI

I'm still not completely clear on the role/responsibility/purpose of the 
"process agent," or what, if any, changes will be required to our customer 
set-up process.  We may need to have a conference call/meeting with Brent 
Hendry to solidify this process.

Frank

Process Agent is someone who would accept legal service of process if there 
were ever a dispute between the parties.  This requirement is solely so we 
could get jurisdiction over the party in the US if necessary.  Call me if you 
need further clarification.

Brent

Please could you elaborate further on your email to Frank Davis et al.  I am 
in the Product Control Group in London and we have received two PA's in today 
from Chilean customers (South American Minerals Inc & Vorveck Cie SA).  These 
counterparties are both interested in trading Metals on EOL.  I am currently 
checking with David Tregar (Lawyer, Enron Metals) to find out if Enron Metals 
has any form of establishment/branch in Chile.  We would, however, appreciate 
it if you could define what you mean by 'process agent'.  I am assuming, in 
the case of the two companies that have applied for EOL access with us today, 
that both of these companies will have to have an agent in the US that can 
execute trades on EOL for and on behalf of the counterparties concerned. Do 
correct me if I am wrong in this assumption.

Thanks in advance for your help

Rgds

Anna

FYI

Per the note below, it looks like Chile is on the way, although the second 
sentence raises a couple of questions that need to be addressed before we 
allow any Chilean counterparties to "sign-up."  Also, who is responsible for 
creating the ETA and PA , and "attaching" them to the website?????

Chile has been approved to use the North American forms of the Electronic 
Trading Agreement and the Password Application for companies located in 
Chile.  Please note the Enron entity must not have a permanent establishment 
or branch located in Chile and the counterparty should appoint a process 
agent in the US.

This approval does not address due diligence issues as it relates to specific 
products or counterparties.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
