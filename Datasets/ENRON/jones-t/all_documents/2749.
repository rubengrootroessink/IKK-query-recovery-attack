Tana:

Please prepare a letter agreement amending the terms of the ETA for Allegheny 
Energy Supply Company, LLC.  (You can call Pat Clark, their attorney, at 
724-838-6217 if you need the address of this CP.)  The following should be 
included in the ETA, to the standard form of this agreement:

1.  Section 1 of the ETA is hereby amended by inserting the words "executed 
by the Parties" following the phrase "(i) master agreement or agreements or 
other written agreements."

2.  Section 2(b) of the ETA is hereby amended by inserting the phrase 
"subject to the terms of any confidentiality provisions set forth in this 
Agreement, including Section 5, or in any master agreement or the GTC entered 
into between theh Parties with respect to any Transaction" at the end thereof.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Leslie
