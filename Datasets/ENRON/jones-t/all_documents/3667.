Top City Destinations

Dear Tana,=20

How do you rank the best cities? The answer is, you can't. As the=20
saying goes, there's no accounting for taste. Every traveler is=20
looking for a slightly different balance of price, location, and range=20
of activities when choosing a vacation. Still, some places have just=20
about universal appeal. Can the majority of our members be wrong? The=20
following destinations are among those visited most often by=20
Travelocity.com users--the kinds of places that have something for=20
everyone, and see visitors return again and again, year after year.=20

Las Vegas
Las Vegas is dominated by the Strip, where the attraction, of course,=20
is gambling. But what grabs the eye first is the incredible sight of=20
the neon Strip itself. You'll find properties made to look like=20
miniature versions of New York, Paris, Venice, and ancient Egypt. You=20
can also see a stunning array of nighttime shows, ranging from=20
favorites Siegfried and Roy (and their white tigers!) to Cirque du=20
Soleil. And at last, Las Vegas has begun to cater to its youngest=20
visitors, with sites such as Wet 'n Wild, Adventuredome, and the=20
Scandia Family Fun Center providing good clean fun for the kids.=20

London
Swinging London has been attracting visitors since the Normans stopped=20
in a thousand years ago. Today the city, with its curious combination=20
of the medieval and the modern, still brings in visitors from all=20
corners of the world and all walks of life. Buckingham Palace and=20
Westminster Cathedral are there for those looking for a touch of=20
history. But there are more modern pleasures to be found in London=20
these days as well, from popular music to high fashion--and even fine=20
dining. Read More.=20

New York
New York really does seem like a new city these days. Visitors who've=20
been away for a few years will instantly notice that the place is=20
spiffier, the neighborhoods more tidy, and even the cab drivers are=20
more friendly. There's never been a better time to visit the most=20
storied of American cities. Fall brings a host of eclectic festivals=20
that show off the city's eccentric and diverse character: Labor Day=20
weekend is the occasion for both the drag-fest known as Wigstock and=20
the more sober but equally proud West Indian-American Day Carnival.=20
Halloween is feted in grand style in Greenwich Village, and=20

Mickey. By all means, visit Disney World--or any of the six other=20

***DESTINATION GUIDES***

Chicago
Chicago has shaken off the grit to become a livable metropolis with=20
world-class attractions. The city is also a major center for blues and=20
jazz. The Museum of Contemporary Art impresses modern-art lovers from=20
all over. The city's Sears Tower may not be the world's tallest any=20
more, but it still provides stunning views of the park-studded city.=20
And considering that Frank Lloyd Wright was based here, impressive=20
architecture is not hard to find anywhere in Chicago. Attractions such=20
as the zoo and the Chicago Children's Museum will keep kids busy, and=20
you really could shop till you dropped on the city's Magnificent=20
Mile--there's truly something for everyone in Chicago. Read more.=20

Paris
Visitors returning to Paris will notice that many of the city's=20
museums and grand hotels have been renovated, as if hoping to put on a=20
good face for the turn of the century. Don't worry; the city hasn't=20
lost any of its character. It's still more jam-packed with museums,=20
churches, diverse neighborhoods, and, bien s-r, dining,=20
than just about any other city on the planet. Read More.=20

Washington, D.C.
As our nation's capital, Washington, D.C. is exactly the treasure=20
trove of civic sites you would expect it to be. The Capitol, the=20
White House, presidential memorials--all these are open for public=20
tours. The truly remarkable thing about Washington, D.C. is that many=20
of its most popular attractions are absolutely free. None of the 14=20
museums that make up the Smithsonian, for example, charge a penny for=20
admission--not even the National Air & Space Museum, which is the=20
world's most popular museum.=20
