I'll ask Tana Jones to send you a notice.  We've resolved all outstanding 
issues -- I'm just waiting for Anne Love to let me know the address for the 
letter agreement so that I can finalize.

Do you happen to have the address?

Leslie

If the changes are as we discussed, then there should be no problem - please 
forward to my attention for execution.

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: Talisman ETA

Dave:

Attached please find the revised version of the Talisman ETA.  I have 
included a red-line comparing this version to the last version that you 
reviewed.  Talisman basically agreed to all of my proposed revisions.  
Specifically, I revised the language in Section 2(g) and 4(a) as per our 
discussion.  I deleted theri proposed language in Section 3(a).  Section 6(b) 
provides that only Talisman is limited in rights to assign (only with Enron 
consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.)

Please give me a call with any questions or comments.

Leslie
