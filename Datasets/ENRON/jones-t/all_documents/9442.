Ok to open them up all the way. They are FERC approved to sell power. 

Thanks,

Things may come in a little differently because of Profile Manager (my direct 
input into the EOL System).  I will now only see amendments to counterparties 
that have already been approved, thru Profile Manager, they will not be 
coming in thru the spreadsheets any more.  So, on amendments that affect 
power, I am going to have to send you an email about the change.

For the above counterparty, we originally had them open for power sales 
only.  Now, Credit is coming back thru wanting to open them up for the bid 
and the offer.  Do you want to change the earlier approval from power sales 
only, or open them up all the way?
