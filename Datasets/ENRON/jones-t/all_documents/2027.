Tana,

 I'm sorry but I can't remember if I've already asked you for this 
documentation or not.  I have not received anything and would like to get 
this resolved.  Please let me know if I need to contact someone else to get 
this information.

Thanks

Lesli

Valero Gas Marketing LP assigned its master swap contract to Valero Marketing 
& Supply before its merger with PG&E according to legal.  CAS does not 
reflect the assignment - it shows that the master is still with Valero Gas 
Marketing which is now PG&E Texas VGM.  Can you get a copy of the assignment 
from Tana Jones and get the master moved within credit aggregation (the 
trades are in the right place)?

Thanks,
Tanya
