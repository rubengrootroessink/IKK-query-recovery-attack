Tana -

The password app. and letter agreement are both on Leslie's drive.  Can you 
finalize them and get them to Ms. Guzman?

Thanks.

Thanks Mark.  They look OK.  I think Enron needs to send them to us, because
the sideletter to the Electronic Trading Agreement ("ETA") needs to be on
Enron letterhead (see attached).  If it is acceptable to you, please send
the Password App, ETA, and Side Letter to my attention at:

Raquel N. Guzman
Philadelphia Gas Works

Philadelphia, PA  19122

Thanks for your help on this one.

Raquel:

Please see my proposed revisions to the Password App.  Let me know if this
addresses your concerns.  If so, please provide me with the full name of PG
Works, as well as the mailing address and recipient for the side letter so
that I can finalize.

Regards,

Leslie

Leslie:  Thanks.  My only comment is that your suggested language should
also apply to Condition (2), second paragraph, of the "Enron Online
Password
Application." Please let me know if you concur.  Thanks.
