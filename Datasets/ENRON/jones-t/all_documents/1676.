Gents,

Here are the final term sheets for the three tranches of swaps we have
executed. These terms are being transferred into formal, legal confirmations
which will be available in the next few days.

If you have any questions please let me know. As for a visit, let me know a
few days in May that work for you and I will come down with the King.

Regards,
Jon
