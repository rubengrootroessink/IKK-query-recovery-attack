Doug -

I received your voice mail message about BlueSox.  I have attached a letter 
for your use.  I realize the name of the financial institution is not 
necessarily accurate, however, it is consistent with the confidentiality 
agreement.

Please review the attached and let me know if you should need anything 
further.  If you send the attached, please be sure to copy me or Tana Jones 
so that we have a copy of the letter for our files.

Thanks.
