Hi to Everyone,

I did ask about International Paper Corporation when I spoke to International 
Paper Company's legal department regarding the merger of Champion 
International w/into International Paper Company.  I was told there was no 
affiliation.  I also looked at D&B today (see the Company Lookup below).  It 
shows there is an International Paper Company, a branch, with the same 
location as the Corporation record, as Sam indicates below.  I was unable to 
find any D&B report or any other company report i/n/o International Paper 
Corporation.  Once I learned there was no affiliation between the Corporation 
record and the Company record, I mistakenly assumed that it was a separate 
entity.

It appears that the Corporation record is set up in error.  It should be set 
up as a branch of International Paper Company, or it should be inactivated as 
a duplicate record.

We contacted International Paper Corp. when they first applied and found that 
they are related, but they are separate entities from International Paper 
Company.  International Paper Corp. is a division of International Paper 
Company according to Walter Guidroz's notes in the Access Database.  Cheryl, 
can you contact someone at International Paper Corp. and see what the 
relationship is for sure?  The applicant may be wrong and not sure what or 
who to talk to over there to get the correct answer.

Thank you,

Hey Bernice,

I got an error message while trying to send this message to Karen O'Day.
Would you resend it to her. Although, I believe Claudia is back, so we should 
be fine.

Hi Karen,

I'm in agreement with Tana's message below. I understand that the Trader / 
Requester
applied to EOL as International Paper Corporation, however, after further 
investigation, 
DnB supports that the location of this company is actually a Branch location 
of International Paper Company, CP/ID 1836 - - already an EOL counterparty.

Please confirm and advise.

Please contact Bernice Rodriguez if an inactivation of this Branch record is 
in order.



Bernice, if an inactivation occurs, would you adjust the spreadsheet above on 
the O: drive
and resend it to our EOL distribution as an EOL 03-07-01 Amendment.

Thanks !!

The above counterparty on the 3/7/01 list is ID#93394.  We had a counterparty 
on the pre-approval list that was called International Paper Company and was 
ID#1836.  Was that one in error?  Are they the same, different?  What's the 
scoop?

Thanks for your help!
