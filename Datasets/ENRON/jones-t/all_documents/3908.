Janelle,

As per our conversation, attached please find the Enron form of guaranty.  
Please note that prior to ENA entering into any financial transactions with 
NYPA, legal has indicated that we have some due diligence that will need to 
be completed.  It appears that we began this process some time last year, 
however, were unsuccessful in our efforts.  If you could, please assist us in 
this process by providing me or Tana a contact in NYPA's legal group.

Please call with any comments or questions.

Rgds,
Ed Sacks
