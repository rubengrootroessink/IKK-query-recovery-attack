Please see my previous email on the above counterparty regarding limiting to 
ERCOT products, which apparently we are unable to do, in such circumstances 
limiting to East Power is the next best we can do.

Water Guidroz, our EOL administrator will effect the change in status for 
Lubbock Power & Light to allow them to only trade "East" power only as we can 
not just designate ERCOT in the EOL system.  Additionally, tenor will be 
limited to 3 months.

Regards,
Wendy
