Tana et al:  This list indicates the agreements that I have as relating to 
the Offline Project.

 I thought we had come to an agreement with Sun Microsystems, Inc. 
(separately from iPlanet)  Let me know if anyone has an executed version.  

I'm not sure AfricaOne and Ejasent are Offline agreements.  Stephanie and 
Mark , let me know.
