To All:

Attached is a credit worksheet to amend the ISDA with Engage Energy Canada 
and Enron Canada.  Engage Energy Canada has a new Guarantor with respect to 
their ISDA contract so the appropriate changes need to be made to the ISDA.  
This includes the receipt of an executed guaranty from the new Guarantor.  

The current guaranty is provided for both Engage US and Engage Canada for 
their prospective ISDA's, so in order to keep things consistent one new 
guaranty should be received covering both entities.  A credit worksheet to 
amend Engage US was sent up to the legal group April 21.

Thank you,

Russell
