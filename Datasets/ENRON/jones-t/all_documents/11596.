I look forward to having you all as guests for an evening of Cajun cooking
at my home on Saturday, May 19 at 7:00 pm.  Some of us (I won't name
names!) are hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of
African Uno!

Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and
attached below are the recipes for the evening.  I will provide beer, wine
and soft drinks.  In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go
with the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.

Please let me know as soon as possible which recipe you would prefer to
prepare.

Laura Johnson (1)
Charles and Janice Thompson (2)
John Hagood (1)
Ann Hutson (1)
Henry and Alicia Goodrow (2)
Beryl and Ray Mack (2)
Tana Jones (1)

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 to the Greenbriar exit (like you are going to Church)
2.  Make a right on Greenbriar
3.  Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first
left possible onto a street called Milford
4.  Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the
opposite direction)
5.  The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to
the 59 freeway)
6.  On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on
the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks
7.  My phone number is (713) 529-1038
