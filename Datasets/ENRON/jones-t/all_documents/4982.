The following CPs are not authorized to trade US power:

CMS Field Services, Inc. 
Howell Corporation -- restricted by credit
Massachusetts Electric Company -- they sound like a utility, but they are not 
a current CP and not on my FERC lists of utilities or marketers.  
Navajo Tribal Utility Authority -- not a current CP/not on my FERC lists

NOTE:  Can you get me a contact for Mass. Electric or Navajo so that I can 
discuss with them whether they are authorized to trade power.
****************************

City of Burbank is authorized to trade West power products only pursuant to 
the WSPP Agreement.
NOTE:  Credit has them set up for P only in the West -- I'm not sure why they 
are thus restricted.
