This counterparty came thru on 2/28/01 list.  I checked my database and we 
had them open for power sales only on the pre-approval list.  When I checked 
Profile Manager, it had them open for east & west power, transact on BOTH the 
bid and offer.  Do you still want them to do power sales only?  Both east & 
west?
