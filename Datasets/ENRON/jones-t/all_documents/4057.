You will need to contact credit to get the process started for an ISDA 
Master.  They will prepare a credit worksheet and send it to us.  In the 
meantime you can send us what information you have regarding the 
counterparty.  Also who is more likely to trade with the counterparty?  ENA 
or Enron Europe?  If Europe is the primary Enron counterparty it may make 
sense to have them take the lead on negotiations and we could mirror the 
final document.  Let me know if you have any questions. 

Regards,
Brent

Hello.  Do we have an ISDA in place with BAREP?  If not, could we get this 
process started?  We've already done deals with them.

Thanks


Steven
