Do you know if this dispute has been resolved with Engage Energy US, LP.?  
They are requesting execute to physical power again.

Please note that we are in a dispute with Enage Energy US, LP with respect to 
power trading, and they are shut down for power trading only until such 
dispute is resolved.  I have already confirmed this with Stephanie.
