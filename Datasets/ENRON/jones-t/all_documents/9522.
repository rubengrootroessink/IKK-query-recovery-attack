Subject: Financial Trading Agreement Database Link

If you do not have access yet to the Financial Trading Agreement Database, 
this link should get you access.  Hopefully when you open up your computer 
tomorrow you will now have an icon to get in.  Credit people, if you do not 
have edit capability let me know and I will get you access.
