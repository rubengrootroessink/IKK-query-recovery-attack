Amy Oberg will take a brief look at six trends that are shaping the future of 
business:


        *  From org chart to flow chart
        *  I link, therefore, I am
        *  New values = new value
        *  Everything.com
        *  Cubicle, sweet cubicle
        *  They're coming! They're coming! The net gens are coming!
