Dear Tana,

At Travelocity.com, we're committed to helping every one of our 
members make their travel plans as easily and efficiently as 
possible. With that in mind, we'd like to let you know about two very 
useful, members-only newsletters we'll be sending to you each month 
at TANA.JONES@enron.com that'll keep you up-to-date about 
the latest travel deals and great destinations. 

We've sent you this message because you're a registered member of 
Travelocity.com (or one of our partners' travel sites). If you think 
you've received this message in error, though, or if you do not wish 
to receive the newsletters, you can easily unsubscribe or change your 
e-mail preferences by clicking on the link at the bottom of this

Now we'd like to tell you about Real Deals and The Insider, two 
invaluable newsletters that millions of Travelocity.com members take 
advantage of every month. 

Real Deals is full of great travel information, special fares, and 
other deals to help you go farther on your travel budget. To get the 
most out of your travel dollar, you'll want to look here before 
planning your next trip. 

The Insider is packed full of insights and stories about popular 
seasonal travel destinations. This newsletter is like a personal tour 
guide, offering an insider's knowledge of each issue's 
featured destinations. 

We understand how busy you are, so we work hard to make sure that 
both Real Deals and The Insider are packed with helpful information, 
and are easy to use. You'll find that the time you spend reading them 
is more than justified by the time, money, and headache they'll save 
you when planning your next vacation or business trip. 

Travelocity is changing the way the world plans and buys travel with 
our innovative tools and technology, and our newsletters are just one 
more way we help you get the most out of every trip you take. We hope 
you'll take some time to read them, and let us know how we're doing. 


Sincerely, 

The Team at Travelocity.com 
Go Virtually Anywhere!
