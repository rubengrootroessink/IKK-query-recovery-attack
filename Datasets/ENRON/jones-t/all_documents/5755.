Using "by third parties" instead of "hackers" seems  fine.

Thanks for your help!

Good point.  What do you think about the following revision?

Section 4(b)(ii) of the ETA is hereby amended by inserting the words =01&(o=
ther=20
than by third parties who have not obtained the Passwords directly or=20
indirectly from or through Counterparty or as a result of Counterparty's=20

agents or contractors=018 at the end of such section.

Leslie,

We reviewed BP's ETA  Amendments  and have only one comment:

On point 6, Section 4(b)(ii) "(other than by hackers who have not obtained=
=20
the Passwords from or through Counterparty)".  Do you believe the word  =20
"hackers" should be used here? What is the definition of a "hacker"?


As for the WAPA ETA we are currently discussing with Credit one of the=20
clauses. As soon as we have the final approval or comments I will send them=
=20
to you.

Thanks!

Amita,

Based on Leslie's note, it looks like the US agreement has not yet been=20
signed. If in fact the UK agreement has also not yet been signed, please le=
t=20
me know - if one BP company has been playing us off against the other for=
=20
negotiations purposes, it significantly changes the complexion of what both=
=20
agreements will contain.

Thanks,

Attached please find the final form of ETA letter agreement as negotiated=
=20
with BP Exploration and Gas, Inc.  As you probably recall, this is the one=
=20
that required several concessions from us based upon the agreement that was=
=20
negotiated with BP Gas Marketing Limited.  The traders are very anxious to=
=20
get this CP on EOL, so please give me a call at your earliest opportunity=
=20
with any questions.

I was also following up on the status of the Western Area Power=20
Administration ETA that I sent you on 11/27.  This CP is extremely anxious =
to=20
start trading on EOL.  This one is a bit unique, so call me if you want ot=

As always, thanks.
