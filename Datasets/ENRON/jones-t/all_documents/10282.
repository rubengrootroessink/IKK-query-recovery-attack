Tana:

As soon as you get confirmation that your request has been completed, please 
let Edmund know so he can update/replace the London documents in the 
Financial Trading Agreements Database.

Edmund:

I'm not sure who in the London office currently takes care of Notes apps, but 
try David De-Coi or Gary Gleeson.  They (or whomever has taken over the 
administration function for Notes; I'm sure if its not them, they will know 
who...) can have the old London copy of the Financial Trading Agreements 
database removed from the ECTLON-LN2 server.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Regards,
Mike

Mike,

I attempted to give Edmund Manager access by doing one of those security 
requests today.  I don't know if you need to do anything or not here....

Dear Michael,

Following our conversation the other day I have spoken with Tana about 
allowing me delete capabilities on the database.  Tana has kindly consented 
to this so hopefully she has confirmed/will confirm this so that the 
necessary technological changes can be made from your end.

Many thanks, Edmund
