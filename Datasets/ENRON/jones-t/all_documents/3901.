I am having trouble locating a copy of a gty that was secured from Energen 
Corp. to cover the financial trading business of its sub, Energen Resources 
Corp.  Has anyone received a copy of this gty or know of a place we can check 
to see if, in fact, this $60MM gty was ever received.

thanks
brant
