Standard ownership change is fine.

It has been brought to my attention that we have done several internal trades 
the last few days with the referenced wholly owned Enron company (right 
Tony?!).  With Tanya's approval, we need to get out an ISDA Master between 
Northern and RMT with no credit except the standard change of ownership 
clauses.   If that is OK with Tanya, Susan, can you pass on this master to 
the next paralegal in the rotation.  Tony will attend to getting the master 
signed from Northern's side.

Thanks.
