Steve -

We are good to go on the agreement.  If you can sign on your end and have 
your people bring it with them to meet with Enron, we will get it signed.

Thanks.

    Mark,

    Thanks for the message.  I am standing by - and I have signature 
authority,
so I can turn around the NDA quickly.

    Steve
