The discussion regarding the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 with 
Ken Raisler of Sullivan and Cromwell has been scheduled for 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. 
in Sandalwood Rooms A & B of the downtown Hyatt Regency Hotel (sorry, we will 
not be serving lunch).

Attorneys and legal specialists in the swaps/Enron Net Works group are 
strongly encouraged to attend.

Each of the attorneys should have already received a package that includes 
the complete text of the CFMA, as well as the text of the Commodity Exchange 
Act, black-lined to show how it has been revised by the CFMA.  Please let me 
know if you have not received this package.

Sometime next week I will give Ken a broad outline of topics we would like to 
cover.  Please e-mail me with your thoughts in this regard.  Thanks -- Bob
