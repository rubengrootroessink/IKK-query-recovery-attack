Sounds like a plan...

Could everyone please continue to reply to all when possible and
appropriate?  I will be leaving to meet with he Governor around 11:00am and
our Chairman, Stew Thomas and our Controller, Brad Flinn will be taking over
on this...  I continue to forward each message to them... this will just
make it easier as well as insure that they are acting immediately upon your
messages / requests...

I have included their e-mails above...

Thanks,

Douglas G. Thomas
President & C.E.O.
