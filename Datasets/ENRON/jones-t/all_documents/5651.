Tana -- Per our conversation, I need a unilateral confidentiality agreement 
for:

Analytica, Inc.
Attention:  Dr. Richard R. Batsell
3601 Plumb
Houston TX 77005-2929

email:  Randy@batsell.com
fax:  713 669 1017
phone:  713 661 6878

I am going to discuss the possibility of having Dr. Batsell's company conduct 
a market research study on electronic commerce platforms.  The results of the 
study will be used by EnronOnline management in strategy formulation.  

You can fax or e-mail the agreement directly to Dr. Batsell.

Thanks

Kal
