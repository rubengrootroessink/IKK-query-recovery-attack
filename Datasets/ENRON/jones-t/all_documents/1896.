DO NOT OPEN ANY E-MAIL WITH THE SUBJECT LINE, "Resume - Janet Simons"
A new and dangerous computer worm is spreading through e-mail systems.  It is 
a variant of the W97M/Melissa family with a very dangerous payload.  More 
dangerously, it deletes all files on all drives the user has access to upon 
closing of the document.   This is a worm in that it does not infect the 
local host system.  It spreads by email on opening of the document. It will 
arrive by email with the following format:

We appreciate your cooperation while we all work to keep Enron's computing 
environment secure.  We are taking measures to try to prevent this e-mail

Please note the following Enron Policies regarding viruses: 

Email

Malicious Code (Virus) Screening
In addition to the Enron requirement for email attachments (received and 
sent) to be screened for malicious code (viruses, Trojan Horses, etc.), users 
of Enron information resources are required to detach email attachments that 
are received on to their hard drive for local virus screening purposes. 

All executables (*.bat, *exe, *.com, *.vbs) files should never be launched 
from email without first consulting with IT. 

Virus Alerts
The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer 
viruses and Trojan Horses. However, within among real virus notices are 
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are 
still time consuming and costly to handle. It only wastes bandwidth and 
unnecessarily alarms other computer users.

Please, do not perpetuate unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojan 
Horses. If you receive an invalidated warning, don't pass it to all your 
friends, pass it to your IT computer security manager to validate first.
