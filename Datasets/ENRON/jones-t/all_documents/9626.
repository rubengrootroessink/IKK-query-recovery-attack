Tana,

Can you tell me which numbers the CA's are in the atty.fms?

Thanks,
Genia

As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements 
contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms.  We have 
developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the 
swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is 
used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a 
counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the 
counterparty.

I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not 
be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.

For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms 
contained in the atty.fms bank.

Tana,

Could you please supply me with a copy of your current Confidentiality 
Agreement?  Since we "copied" your group on the Enron Corp. Guarantee 
Agreement, I thought we could do the same with the CA.

Thanks,
Genia
