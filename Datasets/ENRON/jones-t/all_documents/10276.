Dear Michael,

Following our conversation the other day I have spoken with Tana about 
allowing me delete capabilities on the database.  Tana has kindly consented 
to this so hopefully she has confirmed/will confirm this so that the 
necessary technological changes can be made from your end.

Many thanks, Edmund
