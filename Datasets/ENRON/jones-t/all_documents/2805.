Do you have access to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can 
look these dates up?

Tana,

Can you please confirm for me what the financial master agreement dates are 
for Utilicorp United Inc (GCP shows 6-21-00) and Dynegy Canada Inc (GCP shows 
6-16-95)?  

Canada currently has several confirmations that are being held until we can 
resolve what the dates are.


Bernice
