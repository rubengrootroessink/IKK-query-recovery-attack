Hello Matt,

looks fine except for a tiny little detail: it should cover ECTRL and 
physical power as well, to me it now seems to cover physical gas only.

Second question: Do the financial transactions cover all commodities (gas, 
power, weather etc etc)?

Thank you very much!

rgds,
Minna

Attached is my proposed form of Guaranty to cover the US & UK business with 
Paribas.  Tanya, please note, per our discussion I have increased the 
guaranty amount to $50mm.  We have also added ECTRL to the Guaranty.

Please let me know if it meets with your approval and I will forward it to 
Paribas in NY.
