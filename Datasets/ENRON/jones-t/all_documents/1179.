Enron and The Princeton Review have teamed to offer a review course at the 
Enron Bldg. for the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).
The GMAT figures prominently in applicatons to business school.  While work 
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are important components of the 
application, only the GMAT score can be changed substantially in a short 
period of time.

The Princeton Review invests over three million dollars per year in research 
and development.  They routinely send their GMAT teachers to take the actual
