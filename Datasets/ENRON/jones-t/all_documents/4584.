It has been brought to my attention that the Mieco ISDA has not been received 
by the company.  Could you let me know if there is any hold up or perhaps if 
we need to trace the package?      Thanks

Ed,
I thought Mary and I finalized our issues a week or so ago, but I haven't
seen anything yet.  Maybe getting a signature?  Peter

Peter,

Hope all is well.  Wanted to make sure that the ISDA has been received by
you.  My last recollection was that Mary Cook had agreed to all of your
requests.  Please respond when you get a chance.

Regards,

Ed Sacks
