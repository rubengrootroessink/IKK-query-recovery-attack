David,

Are you going to approve the Australian counterparty directly, or do you want 
to start sending your approvals to me for response?  I will need to know 
which products,  of the broad range of products we offer, they can trade, or 
will open them up only to Australian power?

Let me know, because the online people need to know who they should expect 
responses from (they only want them from me!).
