Good morning wine lovers,
I trust all of you will have a safe and happy new year and come to see us next year!!!  
Always sounds strange to say 'see 'ya next year', no?  Anyway, on to the business at hand.  Starting in 2002, I am going to experiment with something.  It seems that all of you on our email list are quite regular with your visits to our tastings.  Therefore, I will be announcing the weekly wine seminars through this service only.  Sending our schedule in the mail just doesn't seem nearly as cost effective as this email service.  So, starting now, I will inform everyone of the Thursday topic on Monday.  Let's see how it goes.
Immediately following the Thursday wine tasting topic you will find an awesome sampler case.  This case contains the winners from last week's tasting with a special price.  If we can continue to stock the best wines from the Thursday tastings, this trend will continue.  That is, the sampler will contain the highest scoring wines from the previous week's Thursday night tasting, unless we sell out of those wines in the tasting.
