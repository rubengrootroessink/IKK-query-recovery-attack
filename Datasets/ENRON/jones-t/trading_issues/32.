Re:
Proposed Give-Up Rules



	Attached please find proposed COMEX Rule 4.86A, "Give Up Rules."  Generally, this Rule seeks to outline the responsibilities for both clearing members and floor brokers with respect to the handling of give-up trades.  The recommendation for this Rule was approved by the Compliance Review Committee, the COMEX Governors Committee at its most recent meeting, as well as the NYMEX Board of Directors.  Additionally, a replicate version of this Rule has recently been approved for the NYMEX Division.

		Proposed Rule 4.86A affects a "Special Matter" under the terms of the COMEX By-Laws.  Accordingly, COMEX Division Members have ten (10) days to submit a petition signed by owners of at least 155 COMEX Division Memberships requesting a vote of the COMEX Division Members to disapprove the amendments, pursuant to the procedures set forth under COMEX By-Law 205(D).  If a petition is not received, or if the amendment is not disapproved, it will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Implementation of the Rule is tentatively planned for August 1, 2001.

	If you have any questions concerning these procedures, please contact Thomas F. LaSala, Vice President, Compliance, at (212) 299-2897.




Rule 4.86A	Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and clearing members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, member firm or floor broker to whom the order is transmitted.

I.	Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

A.	Limits Placed by Clearing Member - A clearing member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the clearing member of the limits.  Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice shall be retained by the clearing member.

B.	Trade Rejection.  A clearing member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:  (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Section I(A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  If a clearing member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

C.	Billing.  The clearing member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the clearing member by means of the ATOM system.  Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the clearing member, customer and the executing broker.

II.	Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Members

A. 	Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once an order has been accepted, a broker or his clerk must:  (1) confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (2) accurately execute the order according to its terms; (3) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (4) transmit such executed order to the clearing member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules.

B.	Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with his/her obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and clearing member under these rules.

C.	Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the clearing member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:  1) the customer has a valid account with the clearing member; 2) the account number; 3) the brokerage rate; 4) the customer is authorized by the clearing member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and 5) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account.  The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes:  opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

D.	Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed clearing member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with Rule 4.86A, the broker may, in his discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the clearing member(s) of any such rejection.
