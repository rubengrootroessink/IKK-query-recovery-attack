   Word of the Day for Monday April 8, 2002:

   recalcitrant \rih-KAL-sih-truhnt\, adjective:
   Stubbornly resistant to and defiant of authority or restraint.

     If  they  lingered  too long, Clarice hurried them along in
     the  same annoyed way she rushed recalcitrant goats through
     the gate.
     -- Kaye Gibbons, [1]On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon

     As   Mr.   Lincoln  and  his  Union  generals  insisted  on
     unconditional  surrender,  the  end  of  slavery,  and  the
     specter  of an egalitarian nation where race and class were
     in   theory   to  be  subordinate  ideas,  so  recalcitrant
     Southerners  by  the summer of 1864 dug in deeper for their
     Armageddon to come.
     --Victor Davis Hanson, [2]The Soul Of Battle

     This  recalcitrant  fellow  was  the  only  dissenter in an
     otherwise unanimous recommendation.
     --Sherwin  B.  Nuland,  "Indoctrinology,"  [3]New Republic,
     February 19, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Recalcitrant  derives from Latin recalcitrare, "to kick back,"
   from  re-,  "back"  + calcitrare, "to strike with the heel, to
   kick," from calx, calc-, "the heel."

   Synonyms:   unruly,   ungovernable,  intractable,  refractory,
   willful,  headstrong,  wayward,  disobedient.  [4]Find more at
