   Word of the Day for Sunday April 7, 2002:

   exculpate \EK-skuhl-payt; ek-SKUHL-payt\, transitive verb:
   To  clear  from  alleged  fault  or  guilt;  to  prove  to  be
   guiltless; to relieve of blame; to acquit.

     Each  member is determined to exculpate himself, to lay the
     blame elsewhere.
     --Joseph  Wood  Krutch,  "How Will Posterity Rank O'Neill?"
     [1]New York Times, October 21, 1956

     At  the  same  time,  they  said,  representatives  of  the
     inspector  general's  office  at  the  CIA  were  generally
     protective  of  the  intelligence  agents  involved  in the
     matter,  highlighting  evidence  that  seemed  to exculpate
     them.
     --Tim    Golden,    "Guerrilla's   Asylum   Analyzed   Amid
     Contradictory Claims," [2]New York Times, December 12, 1996
     _________________________________________________________

   Exculpate  is  ultimately  derived from Latin ex-, "without" +
   culpare, "to blame," from culpa, "blame, fault."

   Synonyms:   clear,   discharge,  exonerate.  [3]Find  more  at
