   Word of the Day for Thursday March 28, 2002:

   doula \DOO-luh\, noun:
   A  woman  who  assists  during  childbirth  labor and provides
   support  to  the  mother,  her  child  and  the  family  after
   childbirth.

     Chris   Morley   launched  Tender  Care  Doula  Service  in
     Valencia, California, seven years ago to provide nonmedical
     postpartum care workers (or doulas) to frazzled new moms.
     --Roy Huffman, "Healthy returns," [1]Entrepreneur Magazine,
     February 1, 1996

     Unlike  midwives,  who  deliver  babies and are licensed to
     perform  medical  tasks, labor doulas provide emotional and
     physical support to the laboring parents.
     --Stephen  L. Richmond, "One Labor-Intensive Job," [2]Time,
     March 12, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Doula  derives  from Greek doula, "servant-woman, slave," akin
   to [3]hierodule.
