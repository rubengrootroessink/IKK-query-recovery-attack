   Word of the Day for Friday March 29, 2002:

   nonagenarian \non-uh-juh-NAIR-ee-uhn; no-nuh-\, noun:
   A  ninety  year  old  person;  someone  whose  age  is  in the
   nineties.

     There  seemed  to  be  relatively  few [1]octogenarians and
     nonagenarians  alive in the early 1930s. Contrast that with
     my  current  practice,  in  which  I  see a great number of
     patients in their eighties and nineties.
     --Stephen  L. Richmond, "Tales from the Death Certificate,"
     Physician Assistant, January 1999

     Good  health  is  essential, of course--a gift that none of
     these  nonagenarians,  having  outlived  friends  and loved
     ones, takes for granted.
     --Roy  Huffman, "Working Past 90," [2]Fortune, November 13,
     2000
     _________________________________________________________

   Nonagenarian  derives  from Latin nonagenarius, "containing or
   consisting   of   ninety,"   from  nonageni-,  "ninety  each",
   ultimately  from novem, "nine," as in November, originally the
   ninth month of the old Roman calendar.
