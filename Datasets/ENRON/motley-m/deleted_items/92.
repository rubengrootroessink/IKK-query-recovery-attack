   sunder \SUN-dur\, transitive verb:
   To break apart; to separate; to divide; to sever.

   intransitive verb:
   To become parted, disunited, or severed.

     As  the  issue  of  slavery threatened to sunder the United
     States, President Abraham Lincoln, using biblical language,
     warned that "a house divided against itself cannot stand."
     --Morris  B. Abraham, "Using the bully pulpit at the United
     Nations," [1]Minneapolis Star Tribune, January 20, 1997

     Momentous  business  was at hand, as the last colonial ties
     with  England  were  about  to be sundered, and Madison was
     compelled  to take his stand for both a separation from the
     mother  country  and  the  erection of a republican form of
     government.
     --Robert  A.  Rutland,  James  Madison  and  the Search for
     Nationhood

     Their  romance  was  sundered  by  World  War  II,  and she
     scarcely saw Tito again until 1953.
     --"Tribute:  For  40  Years  Prima  Ballerina  Dame  Margot
     Fonteyn  Created  a  Soaring  Legend  of Grace and Beauty,"
     [2]People, March 11, 1991
