  <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>	The Crown Room Club offers a useful oasis when you travel, with data ports and computer access (at select locations), free local telephone calls, fax machines, desk space, fully staffed bars, comfortable chairs and more.

The regular membership rate is $475 annually, or $725 for you and a spouse.

In order to receive $20 off the rates listed above, be sure to join by April 15. To enroll, visit any Delta Crown Room Club or print an application from delta.com/crcapplication <http://e-mailprograms.delta.com/AC/Clickthru?q=ad-_4jAQzEESOiE-Nnih6DfwYmgkVIE>.   <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>

  <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>	Offer is not retroactive and may not be combined with any other offer, discount or award. A Crown Room Club membership obtained by the redemption of frequent flyer miles is not eligible for this one-time bonus-mileage offer and the $20 discount. If membership purchased includes a spouse card, only one SkyMiles bonus and $20 discount will apply. When mailing a check as payment for your Crown Room Club membership, be sure to deduct $20 from the membership fee for your applicable SkyMiles membership level. Allow six to eight weeks for the bonus miles to appear in your account. Mailed applications must be postmarked by April 15, 2002. Faxed applications must be received by April 15, 2002. All standard Delta SkyMiles program rules and conditions apply. Offer is nontransferable.
