     Orley  had  once  been  forced to resign from a local men's
     club  for  casting  aspersions  on the character of another
     member's wife.
     --Thomas A. Underwood, Allen Tate: Orphan of the South

     Its meetings were fiercely argumentative; members seemed to
     love nothing better than to cast aspersions on each other's
     intellect and class loyalty.
     --Glenn Frankel, [1]Rivonia's Children
