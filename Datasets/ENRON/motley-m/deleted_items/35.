Lessons of Enron...The value of diversification. 

Dear Valued Customer, 

One of the harshest lessons to emerge from the $60.7 billion wipeout of Enron has been the losses suffered by Enron employees who placed too much faith - and too many of their limited retirement assets - in company stock. 

The Enron fiasco also affected millions of other Americans who encounter serious risk arising from holding too much stock in a single company. 

Searching for the lessons of Enron <http://wwwrd.0mm.com/eng063091+266998867>, Financial Engines researchers went to the data and ran thousands of simulations on portfolios with varying combinations. Their research and insights into the benefits of diversification may surprise you!

Q: How do I account for real estate investments in my portfolio? 

A: You should include your real estate investments in the Financial Engines Investment Advisor
 service only if they now or will some day generate income that you invest towards your retirement or if you plan to sell your real estate at some point. 

To include the investments you make from rental property income from now until your retirement: 
Click the Personal info tab, and then click Investments. Click the account and fund/stock in which you invest your rental income. The service assumes that all of these investments continue until the age you selected as your retirement age. If this income will continue in retirement, please follow the steps I explain below. 

To include rental income in retirement: 
Click the Personal info tab, and then click Benefits. In the Retirement benefits area, click Add benefit and fill in the appropriate information. 

To include the liquidation of real estate in the future during your retirement: 
Click the Personal info tab, and then click Benefits. In the Retirement benefits area, click Add benefit and fill in the appropriate information. Be sure to select one time payment for the Duration.
