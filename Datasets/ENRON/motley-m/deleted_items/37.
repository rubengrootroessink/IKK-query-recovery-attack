   Word of the Day for Tuesday April 2, 2002:

   abscond \ab-SKOND\, intransitive verb:
   To  depart  secretly;  to  steal away and hide oneself -- used
   especially   of  persons  who  withdraw  to  avoid  arrest  or
   prosecution.

     The criminal is not concerned with influencing or affecting
     public  opinion:  he simply wants to abscond with his money
     or  accomplish  his  mercenary  task  in  the  quickest and
     easiest  way  possible  so  that he may reap his reward and
     enjoy the fruits of his labours.
     --Bruce Hoffman, [1]Inside Terrorism

     Pearl,  now  an orphan (her father having absconded shortly
     after  her  conception),  has  been  taken to live with her
     great-aunt Margaret in the north of England.
     --Zoe Heller, [2]Everything You Know
     _________________________________________________________

   Abscond  comes  from Latin abscondere, "to conceal," from ab-,
   abs-, "away" + condere, "to put, to place."
