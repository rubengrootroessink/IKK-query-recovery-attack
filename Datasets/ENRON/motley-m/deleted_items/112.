   Word of the Day for Sunday March 3, 2002:

   celerity \suh-LAIR-uh-tee\, noun:
   Rapidity of motion or action; quickness; swiftness.

     Though  not in the best of physical form, he was capable of
     moving with celerity.
     --Malachy McCourt, [1]A Monk Swimming: A Memoir

     Furthermore,  as  is  well known, computer technology grows
     obsolete with amazing celerity.
     --Alan  S. Blinder and Richard E. Quandt, "The Computer and
     the Economy," [2]The Atlantic, December 1997

     The lightning celerity of his thought processes took you on
     a  kind  of  helter-skelter  ride of surreal non-sequiturs,
     sudden  accesses of emotion and ribald asides, made all the
     more  bizarre  for  being uttered in those honeyed tones by
     the impeccably elegant gent before you.
     --"A life full of frolics," [3]The Guardian, May 19, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Celerity  is  from Latin celeritas, from celer, "swift." It is
   related to accelerate.
