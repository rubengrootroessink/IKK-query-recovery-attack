QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================
"Because it's a family, Catholics around the country won't
give up on it very easily. There will be outrage and
embarrassment and anger, but the church is often referred
to as Holy Mother Church. And you might get angry with your
mother, but it's your mother."
-R. SCOTT APPLEBY, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American
Catholicism at Notre Dame.
