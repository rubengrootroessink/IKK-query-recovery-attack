   Word of the Day for Wednesday March 13, 2002:

   indomitable \in-DOM-ih-tuh-buhl\, adjective:
   Incapable of being subdued or overcome; unconquerable.

     Now,  late  in his career, when he could no longer pull off
     all of the individual moves that had once set him apart, it
     had become increasingly obvious that what had distinguished
     him  was  his  indomitable  will, his refusal to let either
     opposing  players or the passage of time affect his need to
     win.
     --David  Halberstam,  [1]Playing  for Keeps: Michael Jordan
     and the World He Made

     Because  of  his  strength  and  toughness  as  well as his
     constant attention to the welfare of his army, his soldiers
     affectionately called him Old Hickory. Hickory was as tough
     a  substance  as they knew, and General Andrew Jackson was,
     in their minds, indomitable.
     --Robert V. Remini, [2]The Battle of New Orleans
     _________________________________________________________

   Indomitable  is  from  Latin  indomitabilis, from in-, "not" +
   domitare, from domare, "to tame."
