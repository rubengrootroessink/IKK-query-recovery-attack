   Word of the Day for Saturday April 6, 2002:

   demagogue \DEM-uh-gog\, noun:
   1.  A leader who obtains power by means of impassioned appeals
   to the emotions and prejudices of the populace.
   2. A leader of the common people in ancient times.

     This  was  to  have  held a sculpture of a Roman charioteer
     driving  four  horses,  but  the  work was never completed,
     leaving behind what looks like a diving board or a futurist
     balcony,  ideally suited for a demagogue exhorting a throng
     below.
     --Michael  Z.  Wise,  "A Fascist Utopia Adapted for Today,"
     [1]New York Times, July 11, 1999

     A  consummate  demagogue,  McCarthy  played  upon  cold war
     emotions  and  made  charges  so  fantastic that frightened
     people believed the worst.
     --Arthur  Herman,  Joseph  McCarthy: Reexaming the Life and
     Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator

     Even  when  he  showed  his  true colors as a demagogue and
     trickster,  Stalin  did  so  in  such  a crisp and weighty,
     confidence-inspiring  manner that he bewitched not only his
     conversational partner but himself as well.
     --Milovan  Djilase,  Fall  of  the  New Class: A History of
     Communism's Self-Destruction
     _________________________________________________________

   Demagogue  derives  from  Greek  demagogos,  "a  leader of the
   people,"  from demos, "the people" + agogos, "leading, one who
   leads," from agein, "to lead."
