   Word of the Day for Wednesday April 3, 2002:

   probity \PRO-buh-tee\, noun:
   Complete and confirmed integrity; uprightness.

     Unless  some  light  is  shed  on  shady  dealings and some
     probity  restored,  more  young  lives will be blighted and
     careers choked off.
     --Norman Lebrecht, [1]Who Killed Classical Music?

     To  suggest  that  this  exemplar  of financial probity was
     enriching  himself  at public expense was to shake the very
     foundations of the new Republic.
     --William Safire, [2]Scandalmonger
     _________________________________________________________

   Probity  is  from Latin probitas, from probus, "good, upright,
   virtuous."
