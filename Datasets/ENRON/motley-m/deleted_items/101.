   Word of the Day for Sunday March 10, 2002:

   expatiate \ek-SPAY-shee-ayt\, intransitive verb:
   1. To speak or write at length or in considerable detail.
   2. To move about freely; to wander.

     He  had  told  her all he had been asked to tell--or all he
     meant  to  tell:  at  any  rate  he had been given abundant
     opportunity   to  expatiate  upon  a  young  man's  darling
     subject--himself.
     --Henry Blake Fuller, Bertram Cope's Year

     At  the  midday  meal  on fair day, a large one (meat loaf,
     boiled  potato,  broccoli),  Mrs. Lucas, married to the man
     with  the earache, expatiates on the difficulties of caring
     for  a  parakeet  her  daughter  has  unloaded upon her and
     which,  let  out  of  its  cage  for an airing, has escaped
     through the door suddenly opened by Mr. Lucas.
     --William H. Pritchard, Updike: America's Man of Letters

     His  relationship  with  his  family  was for many years an
     unhappy one, and he does not care to expatiate upon it.
     --Barbara  La  Fontaine, "Triple Threat On, Off And Off-Off
     Broadway," [1]New York Times, February 25, 1968
     _________________________________________________________

   Expatiate  is  from  Latin  expatiari,  "to walk or go far and
   wide,"  from  ex-,  "out"  +  spatiari,  "to walk about," from
   spatium, "space; an open space, a place for walking in."
