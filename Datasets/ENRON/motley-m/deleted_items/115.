   Word of the Day for Friday March 1, 2002:

   prolix \pro-LIKS; PRO-liks\, adjective:
   1. Extending to a great length; unnecessarily long; wordy.
   2. Tending to speak or write at excessive length.

     It  was  a  cumbersome  book,  widely  criticized for being
     prolix in style and maddeningly circular in argument.
     --Simon  Winchester, "Word Imperfect," [1]The Atlantic, May
     2001

     Montaigne  is  a  little too prolix in his determination to
     tell us almost everything that happens as he fishes his way
     across the country, and he gives us a few too many accounts
     of  the  people  he meets and of their repetitiously gloomy
     opinions.
     --Adam  Hochschild,  "Deep  Wigglers  of the Volga," [2]New
     York Times, June 28, 1998

     Greenspan,  on  the other hand, is given to prolix comments
     whose   sentences   are  hung  like  Christmas  trees  with
     dependent clauses.
     --John  M.  Berry, "Greenspan: A Man Aware of Feasibility,"
     [3]Washington Post, June 14, 1987
     _________________________________________________________

   Prolix   is   derived  from  Latin  prolixus,  "poured  forth,
   overflowing,  extended, long," from pro-, "forward" + liquere,
   "to be fluid."
