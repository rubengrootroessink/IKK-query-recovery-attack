   Word of the Day for Monday March 11, 2002:

   nescience \NESH-uhn(t)s; NESH-ee-uhn(t)s\, noun:
   Lack of knowledge or awareness; ignorance.

     The  ancients  understood  that  too  much  knowledge could
     actually  impede  human  functioning -- this at a time when
     the  encroachments  on  global nescience were comparatively
     few.
     --Cullen  Murphy,  "DNA Fatigue," [1]The Atlantic, November
     1997

     He  fought  on  our behalf in the war that finally matters:
     against   nescience,   against  inadvertence,  against  the
     supposition that anything is anything else.
     --Hugh  Kenner,  "On  the Centenary of James Joyce," [2]New
     York Times, January 31, 1982

     The notion has taken hold that every barometric fluctuation
     must  demonstrate  climate  change. This anecdotal case for
     global warming is mostly nonsense, driven by nescience of a
     basic  point,  from  statistics  and  probability, that the
     weather is always weird somewhere.
     --Gregg  Easterbrook  "Warming  Up,"  [3]The  New Republic,
     November 8, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Nescience  is  from  Latin  nescire,  "not to know," from ne-,
   "not"  +  scire, "to know." It is related to science. Nescient
   is the adjective form.
