     They sat there in their formal bargeman's rig... looking
     solemn:  they were part of a ceremony, and levity, winking,
     whispering, smiling, had no place in it.
     --Patrick O'Brian, [1]The Hundred Days

     I must say that if the doctor was indulging in levity at my
     expense, it is a levity I find in the worst possible taste.
