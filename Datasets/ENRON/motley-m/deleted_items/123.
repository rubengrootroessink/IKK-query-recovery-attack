     The  meeting  went  on  for hours, accommodating loquacious
     bores who were each allowed their say.
     --Andrew  Sullivan,  "Gay  Life,  Gay  Death,"  [1]The  New
     Republic, December 17, 1990

     In  drawing  a sharp contrast with the loquacious Ginsburg,
     her  new  lawyers  appeared for just a few moments and said
     virtually  nothing  to reporters before retreating into the
     building.
     --Peter  Baker, "Lewinsky Replaces Ginsburg," [2]Washington
     Post, June 3, 1998
     _________________________________________________________

   Loquacious  comes  from Latin loquax, "talkative," from loqui,
