   Word of the Day for Monday March 25, 2002:

   farrago \fuh-RAH-go; fuh-RAY-go\, noun;
   plural farragoes:
   A confused mixture; an assortment; a medley.

     Ivan Illich writes "a farrago of sub-Marxist cliches, false
     analogies,  non  sequiturs,  false  or bent facts and weird
     prophesies."
     --"The  Paul  Johnson  Enemies  List,"  [1]New  York Times,
     September 18, 1977

     Roy  Hattersley  will  upset  much  of  Scotland by calling
     Walter  Scott's  lvanhoe  "a farrago of historical nonsense
     combined with maudlin romance."
     --"Literary  classics  panned  by critics," [2]Independent,
     January 18, 1999

     From the moment the story of the Countess of Wessex and the
     Sheikh  of  Wapping  broke,  there  has  been  a farrago of
     rumour,  speculation  and  fantasy of which virtually every
     newspaper should be ashamed.
     --Roy  Greenslade,  "A sting in the tale," [3]The Guardian,
     April 9, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Farrago  comes  from  the  Latin  farrago, "a mixed fodder for
   cattle,"  hence  "a medley, a hodgepodge," from far, a sort of
   grain.
