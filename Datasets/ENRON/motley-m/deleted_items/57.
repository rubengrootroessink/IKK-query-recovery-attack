ATTENTION:  POWER TRADERS
TradeSpark is pleased to announce, effective immediately, Off Peak Short
Term Products for AEP, Cinergy and Entergy are available on the platform.
You must first subscribe to the instruments to add them to your portfolio.
The new products are listed in the attached file:  "Off-Peak Short Term
Products.doc".

a)  Off Peak Next Day
b)  Off Peak Balance of the Month
c)  Off Peak Weekend 2X16
d)  ComEd and TVA will be available shortly

If you're setting up a new grid  (10 grids maximum), select/click on the tab
that you wish to use.  To add these to an existing or newly setup grid:

1.   Double-click on the heading area "Symbol" (blue background).  A box
will appear (wait a few seconds), when "North American Energy" appears,
click on the + sign to open the subscription tree.
2.   Click on the + sign in front of "ENGY".  Highlight the product you wish
to subscribe to and in the right hand screen, click the checkbox to the left
of the Instrument Name.  Click on all instruments to be viewed, go to the
next product and repeat (you can subscribe to as many different products as
you want).
3.   When your selections are complete, click on "DONE".  
4.   All new products will appear at the bottom of your page in the order
subscribed.  Drag and drop them to organize your screen.
5.   If you have setup a new grid and don't have all the buttons/columns,
click on the tab for a grid that is setup properly.  Place your pointer in
the middle of the trading screen and right click.  A new box will appear; in
the middle of that box, click on "Choose Column".  When that box appears,
click on "Apply to All Grids" and select "OK".  The new grid will be setup
(you'll need to adjust the column width on the "Market" and "All Markets"
columns).  When satisfied, remember to SAVE YOUR PORTFOLIO.

Please refer questions to the sales group 713-655-5005.
