I did not know about you and Kate. Congradlutions! My family is fine and I'm
happy to see your about to start one of your own. You probably heard this
once or twice in the last month but it's really only a job. Keep your head
up and if there is anything that comes to mind that I might be able to help
you with. The number is 011-44-207-827-2940 or home 011-44-207-586-0131.

Good Luck!

Harvey,
Thanks for the note. I really appreciate your concern. I hope all is
well in the European markets and you and your family are settling in
your new enviroment. Things are crazy here. You would not believe the
situation with ENE's credit situation. Nothing we could have ever
expected. Things are fine with me though. Kate (my fiance......I'm not
sure if you knew) is coming back to Portland and we are to spend some
time in December together. Tkae care and thanks again.
Regards,
Matt
