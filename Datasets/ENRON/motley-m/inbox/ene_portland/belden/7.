Please plan on attending a meeting on Wednesday January 2nd at 11 AM in Mt. Hood.

During the first two weeks of January we would like to hold training sessions for people in our office.  The goal is to provide an overview of each major function in our office to anyone who is interested in learning about what goes on here.  My current thinking is to spend an hour each day, say from 11 AM until noon, in training.  One or more people from each group will be responsible for coming up with an outline/agenda and leading an hour long session on what you do.  If you have received this e-mail, you have been tentatively nominated by me to lead or co-lead one of the training sessions.

Here are the sessions that I propose:

Overview		Tim Belden and/or Chris Calger
Risk			John Postlethwaite
Scheduling		Stacey Runswick, Donald Robinson, Diane Cutsforth
Fundamentals		Tim Heizenrader
Real Time		Bill Williams
Term Trading		Matt Motley
Cash Trading		Sean Crandall
California Market	Jeff Richter
Middle Market		Stewart Rosman and Paul Choi
Services		Chris Foster
Credit			Susan Rance
RTO Development	Alan Comnes
Legal			Christian Yoder
BPA			Steve Hall

Here are some ideas to consider for presentations:
What does your job entail -- important timelines and workflow during the day.
Inputs and Outputs to your job -- information and people
Who are your internal/external customers?
What is the purpose of your job?
Lingo - what is the vocabulary of your job?

At our meeting I would like to brainstorm potential ideas for the presenations and get some group input on what should be covered and how it should be covered.  Thanks for your help with this.
