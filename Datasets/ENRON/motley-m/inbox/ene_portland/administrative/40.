Some of you have been inquiring about your continued employment status with Enron.  After speaking with our HR VP in Houston, we can ease your minds somewhat.  At this time, we are unaware of any positions that are targeted to be eliminated on January 31.  Obviously, things can change, however, at this time, you remain an Enron Estate employee.  

If you were targeted for NetCo but did not receive an offer from UBS, you are an Enron Estate employee.  You will continue to be paid as you have in the past until you receive further notice from our department or your supervisor.  

The Estate needs your help to continue functioning.  Many Estate employees are working to assess available projects.  There are other teams who are assessing the skills of each employee.  You can help this process by making contact with other Estate employees to ascertain where you can add value.  If you are unclear about how to do this, please contact us and we will direct you to one of the many project leaders. 

This is a difficult and stressful time for all of us.  We will continue to communicate with you as we learn more from our corporate teams, however, please feel free to contact us if you have any concerns or questions.

Thank you!
