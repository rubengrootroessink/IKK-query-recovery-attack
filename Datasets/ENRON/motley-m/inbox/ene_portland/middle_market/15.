Here is my revised draft for our latest confirm.  I have updated th term, strike prices, premium, and Index.  I think the one thing remaining is putting in the one day delay in the payout calculation.  Could you take a stab at that.

Also if you are indifferent on moving the exposure limits from our previous deal to this deal, I would like to move $25 MM from the old deal to the new.  The old deal will have $10 MM remaining.

Call me to discuss.

Paul Choi
