Dave and Tom,

Attached below is our proposal for helping to buy back energy you may not need.  It incorporates netting out Washington and Fallon Volumes for the coinciding period.  It also provides prices for the period that overlaps your 50 MW purchase from us and the cities needs beyond that period.

We can disaggregate this transaction but I thought it may make sense to net out volumes so you are not incurring transaction costs (i.e. bid/offer spread) for those volumes.  This is all delivered to Mona, but I think we can get transmission to Gonder for Fallon's energy requirements for a small premium from a variety of players.  

The proposal is in spreadsheet format.  These are preliminary prices and a first crack at the structure, so I want your feedback on how to enhance this proposal.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Paul Choi
