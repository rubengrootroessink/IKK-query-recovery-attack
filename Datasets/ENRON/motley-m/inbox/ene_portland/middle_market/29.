I spoke to my contacts at CFE and had a hard time getting concrete answers out of them regarding transmission availability from Rosarita to Tijuana.  My recommendation is for the developers to talk directly with CFE to try to get the info. THe two contacts are as follows:

Marcos Valenzuela    011-5265-58-15-13
Abelardo Borquez      011-5265-58-15-14


The questions I tried to get answered were:
 
Is there available transmission in the term market?
Can I buy it for a 3-5 year period?
Is there a published rate?

Marcos seemed to indicate he thought it would be available but it was unclear as to whether it would be sold term or what the price was - he made it seem like it was a case by case basis.  I could not provide answers concerning timetable and speicifc location for the plant.
