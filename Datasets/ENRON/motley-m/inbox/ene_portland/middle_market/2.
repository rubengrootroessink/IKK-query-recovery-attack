Hey guys,

I am getting the tickets today at the box office.  I was thinking we get together for cocktails around 7:15 at the Southpark Bar and Grill and can get you the tickets then.  If you can't make it before for drinks email me and I will get it to you before.

Paul

I got the tickets and was able to get a $5 discount, so the price is $26 per ticket.  It is this thursday at 8 pm.  We will probably get together for drinks prior to the show.
