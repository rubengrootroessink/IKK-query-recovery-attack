Connie; Matt Motley who I work with over here is interested in going to Thailand for his honeymoon.  I told him that your son taught school there and that you had visited numerous times thus making you an excellent source of information.  If you would not mind answering a couple questions for him I'm sure he would really appreciate it.  I highly recommended Puket for starters.  Thanks again and hope all is going well.    John
