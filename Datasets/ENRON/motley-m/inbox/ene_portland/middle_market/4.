I have heard good things about this play and wanted to know if you are interested in watching this on Jan 17th (Thursday) at 8 pm.  It is at the Center Stage and is $31 per ticket for good seats.  You can find more about it at http://www.pcs.org/plays/seagull.shtml.  Tell me by tomorrow if you are interested and how many tickets you want.
