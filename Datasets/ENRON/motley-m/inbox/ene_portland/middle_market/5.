Hi John,

Would be happy to help him out...just have him either email me or give me a call (8896). 

Hope all is well with you....such changes going on.  

Just returned from a trip to Italy as that is where our son is now....what a great time!

Keep in touch and have a happy holiday season.

Connie

Connie; Matt Motley who I work with over here is interested in going to
Thailand for his honeymoon.  I told him that your son taught school
there and that you had visited numerous times thus making you an
excellent source of information.  If you would not mind answering a
couple questions for him I'm sure he would really appreciate it.  I
highly recommended Puket for starters.  Thanks again and hope all is
going well.    John
