WHAT: This weekend, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, in
coordination with its Sacramento Urban Search & Rescue Task Force #7,
will test 18 Urban Search & Rescue canines. During the Disaster
Search Canine Readiness Evaluation, each canine will undergo a
rigorous 1 ? hour test rescuing mock victims from rubble piles of
various configurations. 

WHO: Eleven US&R canines from various parts of California, seven from
other states and one from Canada. Some of the canines are being
tested for the first time, others are being recertified as required
every two years, but most are being tested for a promotion.

WHEN:Eight dogs will be tested each day on rotation. Saturday and
Sunday handlers and canines will congregate at 7 a.m., with 'victims'
taking their places at 8:10 a.m. The tests will run each day at 8:30
a.m., 11:05 a.m. 1:55 p.m.
	   
WHERE: Florin-Perkins Landfill, 4201 Florin Perkins Road, Sacramento
