George

 Saturday night sounds great, Darlene is in South Africa for the next 2 weeks 
so I'm ready. Call me at home 713-588-5176 or at work 713-853-3917.
 Golf also sound good, another guy from Calgary who now works down here Chris 
Dorland, I think you've met him before, wants to golf as well. 
 Look forward to seeing you.
