In preparing our business implementation plan, I am trying to identify and prioritize the relevant transmission agreements for each of the 3 northeast pools.  My assumption is that, for pure internal transactions in each of the three pools, we do not really need to be a signatory to the respective ISO transmission agreements, and thus signing of these transmission agreements is not of the highest priority.  Does this sound correct to you?
 
My sense is that we only would need to sign on to the ISO transmission tariff to facilitate inter-pool transfers and/or to serve load in the regions.  Does this sound correct to you?
 
Please email or call me with any insights you might have.
 
Regards
John
