Hello Rob Benson,

RWR would like to welcome you again to our second edition of Sound Energy.  You will receive this publication on a free trial basis for the next 45 days.

Every two weeks, we look at energy companies and sectors that strive to make energy more efficient or the environment cleaner.  These
sectors include renewable energy (including wind and solar power),
distributed generation (fuel cells and microturbines), and power
semiconductors.

This edition includes:
- Feature Article:  Is Wind Still Blowing?  A closer look at the U.S. wind market.
- Overview of renewables, distributed generation and power semiconductor sectors.
