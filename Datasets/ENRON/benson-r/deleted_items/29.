FROM Dr Arusi Agbara.
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
AFRICAN INTERNATIONAL BANK.
LOME-TOGO.
TEL:00228-911-40-37.
FAX:00228-222-45-84

DEAR,
                   (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE)

I am Dr Arusi Agbara, chief accountant for the bills
and credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of

African International Bank Lome-Togo in west Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact
you on a business transaction that will be very
beneficial to both of us at the end of the
transaction.

During our investigation and auditting in this bank,
my
department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on november
1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in
his account with this Bank without any claim of the
fund in our custody either from his family or relation
before our discovery to this development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret
within myself and partner to enable the whole plans
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time
of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six
million five hundred thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through my good friends who works with
chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here
in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person
to me to be viable and capable to champion a business
of such magnitude without any problem .

Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer this money to a
foreign account has been put in place and directives
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
as you indicate your interest and willingness to
assist us and also benefit your self to this great
business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant, we
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would
eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the
time
of transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of
kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and
also present a foreign account where he will need the
money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it
may be after due verification and clarification by the
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money
will be remitted from to your own designation bank
account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction
is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total
sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to
take care of expenses that may arise during the time
of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while
60% will be for me and my partner.

Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as
we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank
until you confirm the money in your account. and ask
us
to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
of the fund according to percentage.

previously indicated and further investment, either in
your country or any country you advice us to invest
in. All other necessary information will be sent to
you
when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as
soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.

Yours faithfully,
Dr.Arusi Agbara.
