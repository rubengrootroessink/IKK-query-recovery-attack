Kevin - The following counterparties were approved to EOL trading through Cal'05 for East Physical Power.  As we agreed, the charge would be $0.10/mwh for both '04 and '05 and this would be revisited in December of this year.  The list of counterparties approved was based on a list provided by you a month or so back.  Please pass on the information to you trading desks.  

rgds, Ed Sacks
