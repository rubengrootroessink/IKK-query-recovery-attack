Rika, 
According to our sources, the union and FirstEnergy management are still negotiating and they won't strike until negotiations break down. The union has committed to giving management a 36 hour notice before a strike begins. Since that is true, it is very likely the unit will complete the refueling outage prior to a strike (if one occurs at all). The unit is now in hot shutdown and we expect restart by late Sunday or some time on Monday. 
If a strike occurs, non-essential personnel will be sent home while essential personnel will prepare to remain "locked in" at the site until the strike concludes. This is for the safety of the essential personnel, so they don't have to cross picket lines. 
Dan
