FYI.   Looks like PIRA will be releasing a bearish material balance and 02 gas price outlook soon.

Rogers,

Wanted to make sure that I mentioned that we have redone our balances
initially and they are showing something even uglier than we had discussed
.. something like a 1.3 TCF EO March 02. That would mean a loss of some 3.5
BCF/D of injection demand in summer of 2002. Not surprising, we are probably
going to revise our prices down and throw out the V bottom and grab a long,
wide U bottom .. no $3 prices for 2002. You know what we really mean. UNT
was rallying today at over $8. This thing could almost as ugly as the last
down cycle.

Regards,
Allan
