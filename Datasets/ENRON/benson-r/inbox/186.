Hey Rob, sorry if I sounded a little weird on the phone the other night.  My
boyfriend and I were in the middle of a really heavy discussion when you
called.  He was standing right by me, (upset with me), so it was a little
awkward.  It was great to hear from you and I'd still like to meet you for a
drink sometime after work.  Take care, Holly
