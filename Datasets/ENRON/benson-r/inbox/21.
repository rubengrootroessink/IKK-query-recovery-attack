Rob,
 
See tab "Rob" in the attached spreadsheet. Same story on Portfolio #2: reducing gas position, lowers VaR. I have ran two additional scenarios for Portfolio #2 with 2/3 and 1/2 of the original gas position. Let me know if you have questions.
 
Vlady.

Fletch,
 
The limits have been quoted using the 10d-99 measure. However, UBS will use all three measures.
 
In Portfolio #2, Gas risk overweighs Power risk. NG-R4 correlation is 60%. If you reduce your NG position, risk will come down. See portfolio 2a with 20,000/day of J-V 02 Gas. Also, see my simple square root of some of squares calc in the updated spreadsheet.
 
I will run Rob's scenarios sometime today and send it to you.
 
 
Vlady.

Vladimir,
 
Which measure are we going to be using at UBS?  VaR on portfolio #2 dosn't make sense to me that adding gas short to same position as #1c. increases risk.  What's up with that?  Also, could you forward the results from Rob Benson's portfolio's to me?  Thanks,
 
Fletch
