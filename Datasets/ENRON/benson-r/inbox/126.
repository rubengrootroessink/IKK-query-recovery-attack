Due to the problems we always seem to have regarding non-EOL transacted gas deals, the following procedure should be followed from today forward:

Please send, via e-mail, the terms of gas deals that are transacted with another power trader or transacted with a gas trader over the phone.  We will then ensure that it gets captured in the gas valuation system.

Please forward this to your direct reports.  

Thanks,
Stacey
