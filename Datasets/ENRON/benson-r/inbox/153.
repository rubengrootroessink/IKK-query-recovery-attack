>One day when I was a freshman in high school, I saw
>a kid from my class was walking home from school. His
>name was Kyle. It looked like he was carrying all of his
>books. I thought to myself, "Why would anyone bring
>home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a
>nerd."
>I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football
>game with my friends tomorrow afternoon), so I
>shrugged my shoulders and went on.
>As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward
>him. They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his
>arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt. His glasses
>went flying, and I saw them land in the grass about ten
>feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible
>sadness in his eyes.
>My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and
>as he crawled around looking for his glasses, and I saw
>a tear in his eye. As I handed him his glasses, I said,
>"Those guys are jerks. They really should get lives." He looked at me
>and
>said, "Hey thanks!" There was a big smile on his face. It was one of
>those smiles that showed real gratitude.
>I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where
>he lived. As it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him
>why I had never seen him before. He said he had gone to private school
>before now.
>I would have never hung out with a private school kid
>before. We talked all the way home, and I carried some
>of his books. He turned out to be a pretty cool kid. I
>asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my
>friends. He said yes. We hung out all weekend and the
>more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my
>friends thought the same of him.
>Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the
>huge stack of books again. I stopped him and said,
>"Boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles
>with this pile of books everyday!" He just laughed and
>handed me half the books.
>Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best
>friends. When we were seniors, we began to think
>about college. Kyle decided on Georgetown, and I
>was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be
>friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He
>was going to be a doctor, and I was going for business
>on a football scholarship.
>Kyle was valedictorian of our class. I teased him all the
>time about being a nerd. He had to prepare a speech for graduation.
>I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there and
>speak. Graduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He
>was one of those guys that really found himself during high school. He
>filled out and actually looked good in glasses.
>He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.
>Boy, sometimes I was jealous.
>Today was one of those days. I could see that he was
>nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back
>and said, "Hey, big guy, you'll be great!" He looked at me
>with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled. "Thanks,"
>he
>said.
>As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and
>began. "Graduation is a time to thank those who helped
>you make it through those tough years. Your parents,
>your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach...but mostly
>your friends. I am here to tell all of you that being a
>friend to someone is the best gift you can give them. I
>am going to tell you a story."
>I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the
>story of the first day we met. He had planned to kill
>himself over the weekend. He talked of how he had
>cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was
carrying his stuff home.
>He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile.
>"Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from
>doing the unspeakable."
>I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy
>told
>us all about his weakest moment. I saw
>his Mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same
>grateful smile. Not until that moment did I realize it's depth.
>Never underestimate the power of your actions. With
>one small gesture you can change a person's life. For
>better or for worse.
>God puts us all in each other's lives to impact one another
>in some way.
>Look for God in others.
>You now have two choices, you can:
>1) Pass this on to your friends or
>2) Delete it and act like it didn't touch your
>heart.
>As you can see, I took choice number 1. "Friends are
>angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have
>trouble remembering how to fly."
>There is no beginning or end..Yesterday is history.
>Tomorrow is mystery. Today is a gift.
>It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends
>how much you care. Send this to everyone you
>consider a FRIEND. If it comes back to you, then
>you'll know you have a circle of friends.
>WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER, YOU'RE REQUESTED TO SEND IT TO AT LEAST
>10
>PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PERSON WHO SENT
>IT TO YOU.
