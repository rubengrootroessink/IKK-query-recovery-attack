Hey Rob.  How's it going?  I wanted to let you know that Chris' girlfriend Lisa is giving him a suprise birthday brunch on Sunday, December 9.  Will you call her about the details and to let her know if you'll be able to make it.  Her cell phone is 713-480-1076.  

Hopefully we'll see you there.

Kim
