Hey Rob!  How's it going?  Mexico was fun, but the weather was overcast most
of the time.  No, I don't have a ring on my finger yet, but I'm still dating
the same guy.  I just moved offices to El Paso's downtown office at 1001
Louisiana.  I didn't think I'd like being downtown, but so far I'm loving
it.  Yes, we should go golfing or go for a drink downtown.  Maybe we could
meet someday after work since we're both downtown.  Holly
