Howard, during a recent strategy meeting we had several questions as to how the virtual process will be implemented, and how that will change the markets we trade.  In particular, we are curious about the resolution of certain issues including system integrity insofar as SCUC is concerned and how ancillary costs will be passed.  Obviously, we certainly are still very curious about the latest expected start-date.  Please let us know your thoughts on these issues and any others you feel relevant.

Thanks.
Willis
