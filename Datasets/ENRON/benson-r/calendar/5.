Subject:	Touch Football
When:	Sunday, December 02, 2001 11:00 AM-1:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where:	Rice University (see attached map)

Guys:

Come on out this Sunday and take out some of your frustrations on the field.  We will have beer this time, so be prepared to have a few.  Forward this on to anyone else you can think of who'd like to play.

We're having a touch football game this Sunday the 2nd at Rice.  The attached map indicates the place where you should park (small white box with X in it) and where the game will take place (larger white box nearby).  Game time is 11AM, and we'll play until whenever everyone gets tired and goes home.

Teams will be picked on site.  There are several fields adjacent to one another, so we can play two games simultaneously if we have too many people for one game.  I will bring two footballs, and some cones for field boundaries.  Please feel free to bring other equipment as you see fit (e.g. - footballs, cones, flags, other if you have them).  Cleats are recommended if you own them already (and if not, go pick up a pair at Academy for $20).  Please bring your own water/food/beer/other refreshments.
