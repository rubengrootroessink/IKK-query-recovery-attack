I would like for the new person to help with the transition.  When you meet Robert Guthrie I will make sure that is to be one of his first priorities.  I would say lets get Chad to start helping you, but he is getting married next week and going on a honeymoon and will be out of pocket and this will be good project for Robert to do or get someone who he works with to do.

Sorry for taking so long to get back to you, too much going on today with the Jeff Skilling resigning.

Thanks for another tax education lesson.   I understand



Next issue -

Again this is currently confidential.  The Bentley co 1473 is transitioning to EFS with a target date of 10/1/01.  As a result, this company will no longer be a division of EESNA 15A.  It will be a legal entity of EFS.  I have been out here working on mapping of 1473 timberline accounts into SAP.  I have discovered that Timberline is not a full source G/L.  For example, no taxes are recorded, rather what is in SAP issued.  I want to get Timberline setup as a full G/L just like the other EFS groups.  I would like assistance from the tax group to make this happen.  Should the person handling 15A help us or should we wait until the transition and a new person is assigned.
