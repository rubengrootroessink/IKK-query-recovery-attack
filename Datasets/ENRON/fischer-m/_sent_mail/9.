Tom,

Attached are the graphs for energy lost due to the pitch and overspeed faults 
you listed. As I mentioned before the methodology requires decent data 
recovery for the 10-minute data. The data recovery was poor for several sites 
in January, and for Fenner and Klondike in May. 

I will be compiling a report on this request, summarizing the graph types and 
some explanation of the methods used to produce them. I hope to have that 
completed within the next couple of days.

If you see deficiencies or suggested modifications let me know.

Mark
