Hi Mark,

The message at 10:47 says the the computer was rebooted at that time.  That 
is about the only way that I know of that this message would be recorded.

When the TrbCurtail Service is started it does not remember what turbines 
were curtailed.  It waits 10-minutes after starting before issuing any 
commands to calculate a 10-minute average.  After the 10 minute startup wait, 
the first command output from this program would have released all turbines 
that were currently curtailed, and curtailed new turbines as needed to keep 
the 10-minute average MW output at the curtailment setpoint.

So at 10:57 any turbines that were curtailed before that time would have been 
released.
The curtailment log file Visupro creates at the turbine should be able to 
verify this if needed
.

Subject: Curtail200206.db Question

Joe,

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is "Energy curtailed" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message "Turbine Com Established" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a "Energy 
curtailed" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded? 

Thanks,
Mark
