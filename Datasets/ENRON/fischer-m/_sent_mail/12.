Tom,

The graphs attached are formatted the same as the sample set I sent you 
earlier. As of today, Desert Sky 10-minute data has not been uploaded for 
June 2002 yet, and the data for Jan is nonexistant, so the graphs go from Feb 
to May 2002. 

If you have questions or comments let me know.

Mark
