Subject: Tehachapi Only - Desktop and Dell laptop Users

We will be working this weekend to coreload as many machines as we possibly 
can.  Please send me your network and lotus notes password.  If we do not 
have your passwords, I will reset them to password.  We will start with the 
South facility, and if all goes well, proceed to the north.  Please leave 
your machine logged on.  NOTE:  If you are an Expedition user, we can not 
load your machine yet, as the current version of Expedition does not run 
properly on Windows 2000.  A new version of Expedition will be installed on 
July 8.
