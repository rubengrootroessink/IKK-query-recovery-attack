Hi, Mary -

Well, I am no longer at Plains, and I am now back in the office.  I went
over to Duke (Galleria) for about 3 weeks - it was really great.  I am
suppose to be going out to Enron next week, but who knows.  What's
happening over there or as we like to say "down the street"?  If I do get
out there, let's try to do lunch.  I'll keep you inform of my schedule.

Bye,
Edna
