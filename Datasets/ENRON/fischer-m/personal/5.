Please respond to rkhansenWhat a pleasant surprise to hear from you.  I can understand your problem
with your mother.  My father has been hospitalized four times in the past 7
weeks or so.  He has congestive heart failure and he has to go to the
emergency room, be admitted, gets better, gets out and then crashes again.
He has been out now for almost 2 weeks this time and is doing better for
now.  My mother, who has no short term memory, is a another source of
constant concern.  I have them living at the Belmont on Holcombe.  They seem
to be doing okay there and making some effort to adjust to living with a
"bunch of old people" as my mother says.  She is 88 and is older than most
there.  Go figure.  She says, "but I can walk" so that is the difference to
her.

I am sorry you are going through the same thing.  It is so hard to deal with
everyday.  Not to mention when the phone rings late at night.  It has
happened so often to me that I just get up and assume it will be another run
to the emergency room.

It makes you want to drink margaritas and live life as hard as you can
because life is short then it gets to long.  If you know what I mean.

Law stuff is busy.  I lost the DeBakey case.  No surprise there but we had
some fun and made the old guy show up for trial.  Wish he had stayed home!
Lol

Anyway, it was good to hear from you.  Don't be such an email stranger. It
is always good to chat with you.

Take care,

RK

Sorry it has taken me so long to write back, I had a minor emergency in the
family.  My mother was and still is in the hospital and trying to get her
situated has been trying on me.

It was good to see you the other night.  What have you been up to?  Any
plays,
any trials, any golf?
