Hey I hear you might be going to DG's Halloween party!!!  I will be there
and I think Doug will be there too!   Long time no talk!  Hope all is well,
we really need to have dinner sometime in the near future!

How are things going at Enron?

xox,

Vera

p.s.  I still have your pressure washer.....I will bring it to the party or
just let you know when I drop it off at your house.
