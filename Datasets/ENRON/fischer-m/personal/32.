Dear Ms. Fischer,

Thank you for the opportunity to interview with you for the tax accounting
position on Friday, October 26.  I appreciate your consideration and
enjoyed meeting you and members of Enron staff.

The interview convinced me of how compatible my background and
skills are with the goals of Enron. I want to reiterate my strong
interest in working for you.

I look forward to meeting you again.

Sincerely,

Molly Helton
