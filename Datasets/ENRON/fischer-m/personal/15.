>Jaye, my flight arrives Saturday Aug 25 at noon. I am copying my family member on this note so you will have their email addresses if needed and also to update them on Nicaragua. I am having a good time especially considering my apprehension before I left Houston.  The way to travel is to hook up with a realtor who will take you all over for free.  The realtor (Steve) lived in Costa Rica for 20 years then moved to Nicaragua 6 years ago.  He is about our age and a true gentlemen.  Yesterday he took me to his house on one of the small islands on Lake Nicaragua.  He owns his own island.  There are about 300 of them.  Too rustic for me, but very peaceful. He arranged my travel from Granada to the Blue Bay Resort at Papaguyo Beach in Costa Rica.  It is only three or four hours away driving, but is a hassle because you have to cross the border.  If you want to see the property I visited, there are pictures at www.ranchosantana.com.  I feel safe here, but the real test will be when I!
> cross the border.  Today I left my room for breakfast very early.  I didn't lock up as I expected to return before the maid.  My money and passport were easily accesible.  The maid came while I was at breakfast, but nothing was missing.  Unbelievable since this might not have happened in the US. Today there is a big festival here in Granda with fireworks, a horse parade, etc.  Tomorrow I leave for the resort in Costa Rica.  The charge for the Internet use here is about $2.50 per hour.  Lisa and I paid $1.00 per minute on the cruise.  You  won't here from me again if the resort internet charges are astronomical. I am having trouble with hotmail so please email me at earthlink.net if you need to contact me.  Love Susan
