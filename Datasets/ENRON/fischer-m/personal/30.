<DIV><FONT size=3>Dear Ms. Mary S. Fischer:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a pleasure meeting you. I enjoyed learning more about Enron - strong commitment to innovation, employee satisfaction and productivity. I particularly impressed by the professionalism and dedication that you and Enron staff exhibited. After talking with you, I am firmly committed to and excited by the prospect of a career&nbsp;in Enron.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on our discussion, it seems that you are seeking an individual who shares your vision and is open to implementing creative and adaptive to changes. I share your vision and I am interested in the excellent opportunity to work on a variety of challenging projects with team in Tax Department. I believe that my academic training in UH and my experience working in Transpak and Look Ease qualify me for the position. One of my greatest strengths is an ability to motivate&nbsp;staff to strive for excellence and to work together to achieve common goals. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your time and consideration. I&nbsp;look forward to hearing from you soon. </FONT></DIV>
