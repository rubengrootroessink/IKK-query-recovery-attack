The Master Workplan is now available.  The backup workplan (used for filtering/sorting) will be available by 11:00am. 

I will be performing further updates tomorrow morning from 7am-9am and the workplan will again be unavailable during that time.

RANKINGS - There are numerous entities that have not been ranked.  Please update this information as soon as possible.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks again for everyone's cooperation,
