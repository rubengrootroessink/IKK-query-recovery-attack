There has been a new change to the topside close schedule. Income remains to be finalized; therefore, the TST will once again delay loading any new Hyperion and ECCS files into TIS until income is final (10/17/01).  The final topside files are now scheduled for export on Thursday, Oct. 18th.  You may continue to tax effect companies for topside close until Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. CST.
 
Please note the revised topside close schedule below, and contact the TST if you have any questions.
 
SCHEDULE
Monday October 15, 3:00pm                - Send back tax effect on 10/12 files. 
Wednesday October 17, 3:00pm         - Receive and load 2nd files from ECCS and Hyperion 
Thursday October 18, 3:00pm              - Send back final tax effect on 10/17 files. 
Friday October 19                                  - Post effective rate entry to Hyperion
