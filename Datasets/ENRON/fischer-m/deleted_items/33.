THIS WEEK'S HEADLINES:

 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS/GOODWILL/REVENUE - FASB AND SEC ISSUE GUIDANCE
ADDRESSING VARIOUS ISSUES
The SEC and FASB have issued the following guidance addressing business
combinations, goodwill/other intangible assets and revenue recognition
matters:

FASB ISSUES PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
The FASB staff has issued proposed implementation guidance on FASB
Statements No. 141, Business Combinations , and No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets . Paragraph 61(b) of Statement 141 requires that the
carrying amount of certain intangible assets be reclassified and accounted
for as assets apart from goodwill as of the date Statement 142 is adopted
in its entirety. The FASB staff's proposed announcement would clarify that
the phrase "accounting records have been maintained" as used in footnote 25
to paragraph 61(b) is intended to mean that an entity is accounting for an
acquired intangible asset separately from goodwill as evidenced by the
maintenance of separate general ledger accounts, subsidiary ledgers, or
spreadsheets for that intangible asset to which it posted periodic
amortization charges, impairment charges, and any other accounting entries
related to that asset.

August 31, 2001 update of Current Accounting and Disclosure Issues . This
document provides guidance to companies on hot disclosure and accounting
topics.

SEC FOREIGN ISSUERS - SEC PROPSES  EDGAR FILING FOR FOREIGN ISSUERS
On September 25, 2001, the SEC proposed a rule that would require foreign
private issuers and foreign governments to file electronically on the SEC's
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system the
documents they file under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Currently, the rules permit, but do not require,
foreign issuers to file their documents electronically. In addition, the
proposal would require foreign private issuers to translate into English
all foreign language documents filed with the SEC. Currently, the rules
permit the filing of certain foreign language documents that are
accompanied by an English language summary. This Literature Update (a)
describes the significant changes that would be introduced and (b) adds the
release to SEC Practice.
