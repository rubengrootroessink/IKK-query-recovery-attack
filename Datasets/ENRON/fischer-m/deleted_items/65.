Sharon,

Could you pls send this out to Tax Houston? Thks


If anyone is interested I have 2 tickets to the game this weekend that I will not be using.  Home game-1pm.

They are free to anyone who would like them.  The tickets are at my house, but you are free to stop by and pick them up at your convenience.
