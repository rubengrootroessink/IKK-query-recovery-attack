This is from the SAP Integrated Solutions Center (ISC):

Do you feel like your reports take forever to run during close?

Do you feel like you have to "reinvent the wheel" each month when you are trying to get your data?

Do you think that the close should be extended just so you have time to run all of your reports?  

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then we want to help......

The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) will be conducting condensed SAP Reporting Workshops on October 29th and 30th.  We'll be providing Tips and Tricks that will help you more efficiently create and execute reports in SAP during the financial close process.  

These workshops will be valuable and we encourage each of you to attend.  Please feel free to forward this invitation to those that you think would benefit from these sessions.  There is no signup required and no cost to participate.
