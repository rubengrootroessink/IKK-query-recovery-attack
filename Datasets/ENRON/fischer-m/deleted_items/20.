Are we all through with the update back process?  Mary needs some confirmation.

Everyone,

This is just a friendly reminder to have someone from your respective groups let me know when everyone in your group is done with the state update back reports.  I've only heard from the "Management Entities" group.  

If you think I've missed someone from the Forum group who should be on this list, please feel free to forward this.

Thanks,
Mary
