To:  Super Friday Interviewers

Further to our meeting this morning re Super Friday, attached are the Evaluation Forms you will be asked to complete after talking with each candidate.  If you have a strong preference between "soft skills" and "technical skills," please advise Valarie Barnes via e-mail or at ext. 5-3533.

Also, if you have any "basic tax technical questions" you think we should be asking to each of the candidates, please e-mail them to me with a copy to Patty.  We will compile and forward to Valarie on Monday.

Thanks,

Leesa

Leesa, 

These are the evaluation sheets which will be used next week.  Jackie Coleman or Donna Jones will need the list of additional technical questions from tax by noon on Monday in order to have a final review by HR.  The interviewer packets are scheduled to be delivered by Wednesday. 

Thanks, 

Valarie
