John,

After my calculations the deferred tax variance ended up being
18,503,872 versus our previous
variance of 53,535,100. I calculated Friday's hyperion Tax Liability
Accounts on the Balance Sheet
and made adjustments for the current taxes booked (which I will reverse
next close). I will come
tommorrow morning before your meeting at 8:00 am to compare my
calculation to actual balances
and make any adjustments if necessary if needed.  I have attached the
spreadsheet to this document.
I placed a hard copy of the spreadsheet on your desk. Have a good
evening.


				Thanks,
