Anything left in either of the refrigerators after 1pm tomorrow, Friday, will be thrown out as I am cleaning them out with Kitchen Lysol so we can have a clean and healthy place to put our lunches. Please in the future, if you do not plan to eat your meals you put in the fridge within two days, remove it as it will be discarded after two days. Lately, the odor has been unbearable coming from the fridges and I do not want to place my meals in a contaminated and dirty refrigerator and I am sure most of you feel the same way. All of your cooperation in this is greatly appreciated and NEEDED.
