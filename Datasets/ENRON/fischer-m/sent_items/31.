6:15 works for me.  The best way to get to my house from your house is go down Shepherd past 59 and make a right on Sunset Blvd and keep on going past Kirby and Buffalo Speedway and a couple of stop signs.  My house is on the right.  It has a witch out in the front.  The address is 3726 Sunset Blvd.

Are you still on for tomorrow?

ok ... let me know what time to be at your house (and directions, again ... I'm bad at directions) ... and I will pick you up on Saturday.

Beth Apke said to get there really early because parking is a mess.  So if the walk starts at 7:30, perhaps I should pick you up around 6:15?

I don't know if Carl is going to walk in American Heart Walk becuase of his knee problems, heaven forbid that walking would injure his knee so he couldn't play tennis.  You could probably talk him into walking, because he won't do it for me after seven years of marriage I have lost my influence/I'm officially taken for granted.

I will be walking this Saturday so lets meet at my house and drive over together.

Thanks, Mary ... will you be joining us after the walk at my house?  Is Carl walking, too?  It's kosher to hit up family members (I've collected from my Mom and Lloyd's Mom), as long as they don't mind.

Are you going to walk this Saturday in "Race for the Cure"?  Do you want to head over there together?

Leesa,

I wanted to confirm that I will be walking in the Heart walk on November 3rd.  I'm working on collecting those pledges.  I hoping that it is kosher to hit up family members for pledges.
