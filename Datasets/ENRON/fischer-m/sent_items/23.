I sent you and Sean an invitation to a party for Carl who is turning 60 on October 28th.  (I married a very very old man!)  I was hoping that you and Sean could stop by so I would have a familiar face there and since you live in the neighborhood.  The other guests are buddies of Carl, went to school with Carl, play tennis with Carl or worked at Pennzoil with Carl.  We have only been married seven years and I don't know these people that he has me inviting.


How are you doing?

Mary
