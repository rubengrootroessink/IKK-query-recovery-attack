Selma,

I think that I was scheduled for a vaction day on Monday but I don't know because I've screwed up my vaction schedule, but I will be taking a day of vacation Monday so I can get my slate floors resealed.  If you or anyone needs me on Friday or Monday please give me a call at home.  I should be there both days and I'm only 15 minutes away. 

I have nothing pending that is pressing.
