In reviewing the close schedule, I noticed that my CB meeting is currently scheduled on the day before close.  If it is convenient for all of you, I would like to move the meeting to Oct. 16.  The time will still be 9:00-11:00.  Please let me know if this presents a conflict.  If it does, we will keep the meeting as is.
