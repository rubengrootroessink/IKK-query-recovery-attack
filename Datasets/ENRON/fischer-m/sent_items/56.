How was the 15th?  Was it crazy?  Did any last minute clients come in begging to have their returns filed?  

Enron is still operating eventhough the President quit and they had to bring back Ken Lay.  Ken gave a speech this morning telling employees yes the stock has gone down but he predicts that it will go back up.  I hope that it does.

I'm planning to be at Debbie's party.  It sounds like it will be alot of fun.
