Mary

I thought I would forward this to you for any comments you may want to weigh in with.  Patty and I have already examined the potential changes to state apportionment and taxes based on 2000 numbers and determined there is little impact.  If 2002 is as big a loss year for the PBM group as 2001 is shaping up to be, there may be some NOL's that Limbach will utilize.  Let me know if you have any questions, concerns or comments.

Thanks
Rick

We are planning on merging the PBM group into Limbach Company.  However, I need to know from each of your departments what needs to be done, if anything, to accomplish this.  The plan is to continue using PBM, Marlin and MEPS as DBA's, but their financial information will consolidate into Limbach company's.  I assume that this may affect contracts, dissolution papers will need to be filed etc.  Please let me know what your individual department will need to do in order to facilitate this event.  Mike Angel will gather all necessary information on October 26 (or sooner if you have it) and continue to follow up on each unresolved matter until completion.  Please let me know if you know of any reason(s) that this merger cannot take place from your particular perspective.  Assuming their are no definite roadblocks, the merger will effectively take place on 1/2/02.
