I hope that you are coming back out to Enron.  Nothing much happening here except the stock price is sinking like a rock.  Ken Lay spoke to the employees this morning trying to raise the spirit.  He said don't panic, it will get better.  Let me know if you are going to be out here and lets do lunch.

Hi, Mary -

Well, I am no longer at Plains, and I am now back in the office.  I went
over to Duke (Galleria) for about 3 weeks - it was really great.  I am
suppose to be going out to Enron next week, but who knows.  What's
happening over there or as we like to say "down the street"?  If I do get
out there, let's try to do lunch.  I'll keep you inform of my schedule.

Bye,
Edna
