Dana,

I was suppose to do this a week ago.  Daisy is a friend of mine and she couldn't beleive that out of all the people at Enron I knew who you were.  She wanted me to ask you for your address so that she and Kim (who used to work for you but I can't remember her last name) could invite your wife to Accessory Cafe party that they are having at Kim's house.  Daisy said that they tried to send an invitation to Accessory Cafe party that was held at Daisy's house but the invitation was returned.  They had some nice things so I recommend it.  If you want to call Daisy directly her number is:  713-975-0250.  

Its a small world.

Mary F.
