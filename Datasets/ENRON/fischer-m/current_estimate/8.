Kim- We have been asked to provide an explanation for the variances between items in the first CE and the second CE for Greek Rice for noon tomorrow. Attached you will find a copy of the variances for RETAIL4 and WHSEES4. Please explain the variances highlighted in yellow on the attachment (for example, why did estimated NIBT for 2001 for RETAIL4 increase by  $20 million?) Call me if you have any questions about this.


Thanks so much,

Dara x3-0338
