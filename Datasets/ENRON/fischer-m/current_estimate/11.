Subject:=09RE: 2nd Current Estimate Model

Attached is an updated 2nd Current Estimate Model.  Apparently, the one we =
received earlier only included the 3rd Quarter numbers.  Please review your=
 models and make the adjustments as necessary.  I would still like to recei=
ve all models by the end of the day on Wednesday, August 1.

Thanks,
Michelle

It would help if I attached the model.  Sorry about that.

Subject:=092nd Current Estimate Model

Attached is the 2nd current estimate model from corporate financial plannin=
g.  They believe the numbers by business unit are materially correct.  (The=
 only exception to this would be the EGF group.)  They have not had the opp=
ortunity to thoroughly analyze the numbers, ask questions of the business u=
nits, tie out the numbers to actuals, or examine the overall picture.  Ther=
efore, changes are likely to be coming over the next week or so. =20

In the meantime, please prepare your model and make sure that it ties to th=
e attached model.  I would like to receive all models by the end of the day=
 on Wednesday, August 1.  If you are not able to meet this deadline, please=
 let me know ASAP.  As I receive updated models, I will be sure to forward =
them to you.

Thanks,
Michelle
