If we are only talking about a .6% drop in avg. availability, we had better 
be ready to defend our numbers. Not just defend but convince Zilkha why we 
are right with our calcs. Mark F. unless I am mistaken, Gary V. is expecting 
a bigger drop??

Subject: Mill Run report through May with Virtual Mode corrections.

Summary:
The Jan - May 2002 availabilities are revised to exclude virtual mode / pause 
events.   The results showed that every turbine had between one and two hours 
each month where the WTG was transitioning between states as per design.   
Therefore, the resulting total hours of pausing and virtual mode for each 
turbine was decreased by one and a half hours.   In addition the pausing due 
to noise curtailment at turbine 7 between the hours of 7 PM and 5 AM local 
time was excluded.   No other changes were made to the SCADA data.  The net 
result is that the Jan availability dropped by 1.5%, Feb dropped by 0.4%,  
Mar dropped by 0.3%,  Apr dropped by 0.1%.   Dec 2001 data was not corrected 
due becasue the data recovery of the minana files in that month was very 
poor.  The Somerset report  is  well underway and will be in a similar form.
