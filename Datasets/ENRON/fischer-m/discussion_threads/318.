Please be advised that the following network shares have been moved to a new 
server:

MIS
O&M

To connect to the new share locations, double-click on network neighborhood 
and find the machine called CABFLA06PSGE.  Double-click on the machine.  All 
of the shares will be listed.  Right-click on the share you wish to map and 
select Map network drive.  Select the drive letter you wish to use and click 
on OK.

I apologize for the late notice.  I was not aware that these shares were 
moved until this morning.  I will send out an update on data moves as soon as 
I am aware of them, hopefully minimizing your inconvenience.

Thanks.
