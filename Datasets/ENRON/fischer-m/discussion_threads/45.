Hi Mark,

Attached are the SCADA power curve for turbine #2 and #7 at Montfort that I 
got from Joe Chapman.  The power curve for turbine #2 show a drop in power 
around 11 m/s, which is a concern.  We suspect that this turbine is not 
pitching properly and would like to compare how this turbine is pitching to 
turbine #7, which does not show this feature in its power curve.  I don't 
know if time series of pitch, wind speed (with mean wind speeds greater than 
10 m/s), and power can be easily obtained using Visu Pro, but that would be 
useful.

Also, it would be worthwile to check 5 other turbines at random from Montfort 
to see is any other turbines behave the same way as turbine #2.

Let me know if you have questions and tell me what you can provide.

Thanks,

Philippe
