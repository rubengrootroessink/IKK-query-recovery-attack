Kurt and Jeff:
I have used the data lists, as given, and things went fairly smoothly,
with one exception.
I found several occurances of more than 107 turbines curtailed!  Check
the attached worksheet for one example.  I was able to sort out
duplicates and you can see what I came up with.  Since I have to use a
wind speed calculation when more than 21 turbines are curtailed, I don't
want to just assume that all 107 turbines were curtailed when there may
have been less.
I need someone to go over the numbers again, so we can have more
confidence.
Awaiting your reply,
David
