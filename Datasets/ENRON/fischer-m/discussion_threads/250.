On Monday June 24th AT&T reps will be on site at GE Wind Energy in both the 
north and south faculties to enroll you in a personal cellular plan.  The 
AT&T reps will be in the up stairs lunch room in the South facility and in 
the new lunch room in the North facility from 7:30 to 5:30.  These AT&T reps 
will be able to answer all of your questions concerning your personal 
cellular phone and plan.   If you are an existing AT&T customer please see 
the attached flyer. 


General Electric is pleased to announce that we have signed a national 
agreement with AT&T Wireless Services on behalf of all the subsidiaries.  
Effective immediately, GE Wind Energy employees will be able to receive 
discounted rates, based on the buying power of all of our divisions.  This 
includes major discounts on service for personal use.  This includes 
discounts on new phones and a 12% service discount off wireless service and 
airtime charges. Existing lines are eligible too!!  Be sure to spread the 
word! 

Once your personal line is on the GE Sponsorship program, the 12% discount 
shows up every month, and is applied to monthly service and airtime charges.  
This discount starts appearing on the second or third bill since when the 
line was added to the program.  Phones and accessories, for new services, are 
discounted at 50% off of the Manufacturer's Advertised Price!
