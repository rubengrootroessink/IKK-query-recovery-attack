What definition of down time do you mean?   If the GEWE definition,  the time 
when the turbine is faulted off automatically or in a repair status, is used 
then yes your are correct.   If the customer definition, when the turbine 
can't produce power in good winds, then you are incorrect.   The turbine 
can't produce power during manual pause  mode or in transition between 
states.  During calm months, the turbine should  not frequently be in 
transition.   Manual pause should be uncommon as per management direction.

Subject: Total Down Time

As a verification of understanding;

Total Down Time  = TO - (DT + RT +LOT + MT + EST + WOT)

Where TO = Total possible survey time.

Thanks,

Jeff
