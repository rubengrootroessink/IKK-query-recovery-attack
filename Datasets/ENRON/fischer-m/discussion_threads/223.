Apparently, my instructions have confused a number of people with regard to 
the Lotus Notes ID File.  DO NOT MOVE THE ID FILE from your local drive.  
Copy it and paste the copy out on the network folder you create.  If you move 
your ID file instead of copy it, you will not be able to access Lotus Notes.

Additionally, after you move you Notes archive file, your icons on Lotus 
Notes for your local mailfile will not work.  If you must access the old mail 
between the time you move the files and the time your machine is cut over, 
follow these instructions:

From a blank gray area on your Lotus Notes workspace, right-click and select 
open database.



Click on the Browse button



Click on the down-arrow next to look in and browse to the location of the 
data folder on the network you created:

  Inside the Lotus Notes folder you created, you will be able to see the 
names of your archived mail file.  Double-click on the file name and a new 
icon will be added to your workspace that points to this location on the 
network.

If you need further clarification, please feel free to call the help desk at 
x6862.
