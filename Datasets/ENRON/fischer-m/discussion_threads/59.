Mark,

Please compare these substation values to the SCADA transducer values.

Thanks,
Hollis

I thought I replied to this. I have no substation data since AEP did not 
install any meters.

The readings from Eskota Substation are as follows

Dec 2001, 41,954,410 kwh
Jan 2002, 44,697,000 kwh
Feb 2002, 36,690,740 kwh

Mike and George,
Please resend substation meter reading data to Hollis at your earliest 
convenience. He can not complete his reports until he gets this data. Thank 
you in advance

Bo

Bo,

We have not had any luck in getting the substation meter reading data.  We 
need this data to validate the information we are receiving from the SCADA 
power transducers.  The guys may have sent it to us already but either we did 
not get it or we did not recognize it as meter reading based production data.

Thanks,
Hollis

Bo,

We have yet to receive any information regarding substation data.  Are the 
guys going to send us data when they do their normally scheduled meter reads?

Thanks,
Hollis

Bo,

We would like to do a comparison of the SCADA kWh transducers from the 1.5 MW 
turbines with the meter monthly meter readings.  Would you send us (Mark and 
I) the monthly meter readings, including the date and time of the readings, 
for the 1.5 sites which you manage?

Thanks in advance,
Hollis
