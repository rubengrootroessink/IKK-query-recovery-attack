Executive Summary
Marion Horna and Kurt Anderson requested an explanation of how the EW 1.5 
Availability was computed.  In addition,  Barry Riffe and Jeff Duff have 
expressed concerns that there is confusion between the EW 750 owners, I.E., 
and EWC on how to categorize (OOH, UAH, or other) the direction curtailment & 
windshear curtailment for availability computations.   The attached memo is 
the result of a throrough review of the Exhibits in the 1.5 contracts that 
define availability and the UAH & OOH clauses which are similar between 1.5 
and 750 project contracts.  This memo doesn't include a thorough review of 
the Technical Specs or Germainisher Lloyd design recommendations for 1.5 
projects.  This draft memo proposes that:

 1)  EWC should not be penalized for direction curtailment and windshear 
curtailment losses to availability IF that curtailment is in accordance with 
 the Tech Spec of Germanischer Lloyd recommendations or requirements.   
Neither the UAH term or the OOH term in the contract apply.  
 The corrections applied to correct for windshear in previous EW 750 reports 
were made to compensate for the limitations of controller counters.

 2) Only those Offline Hrs ordered  by the organizations specifically 
mentioned in the OOH clause in the contract should be included in the OOH 
term in 
 the contract.  For example, if the owner is not specifically mentioned in 
the OOH clause then their orders for offline turbine should not be included in
 OOH.

The availability resulting from this computation will not penalize 
availability for all reasons that the turbine didn't produce power in good 
winds.  There will be events that prevent turbine production but do not lower 
availability, ie.  high winds, direction curtailment.
