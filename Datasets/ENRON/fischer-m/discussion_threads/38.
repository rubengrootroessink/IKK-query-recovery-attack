Hi Mark,
 As promised. FYI
 See you tomorrow morning.

Hi Keith,
Please review the following request from Mr. Verkleeren.

Inconsistencies with the grid downtime numbers at Mill Run.
Frequent PMT circuit breakers trip events.
 The Mill Run site had an event on 03/17, prior to the inclement weather, 
where pad's 1,3,5,6,7&8 had the PMT circuit breakers open @ approximately 
0900  but did not have any component failures and did not trip the SEL.

Per our conversation and the follow-up E'mail on 3/18, Zilkha is looking for 
a report on the steps taken to minimize the low gearbox oil pressure faults.

Best regards,

Philo

Philo,

After exporting and reviewing Mill Run SCADA data (Monthly Production file) 
for the running month, I observed several inconsistencies between turbines 
that do not make sense.  Specifically, for the grid downtime realized over 
the weekend (a result of the ice storm) which you had the pleasure of sharing 
with me, there was a total of approximately 14 hours of grid downtime.  The 
downtime began at 1930 on 3-17-02 and essentially ran until 0930 on 3-18-02.  
During this time I closed the breaker restoring grid power to the site at 
2345 only to have the site trip again within the next 15 minutes. (This can 
clearly be seen by viewing the attached text file and looking at the line 
voltages, VA, VB, VC).

The grid downtime calculated and reported on the Monthly file for turbines # 
2, # 4 and # 7 is not even close to being correct.  Please review the 
attached excel spreadsheet generated from exported SCADA data as 
verification.  All of the other turbines are somewhat close to calculating 
the downtime correctly but there are still certain mysteries with those as 
well.  As you are aware, nearly all of the main circuit breakers tripped at 
Mill Run at approximately 0930 on 3-17-02, this likely partially explains why 
there is some variability between grid downtimes being recorded.  I say this 
because a total loss in power to the turbine is realized in this event and 
SCADA probably cannot differentiate between a main circuit breaker trip and a 
grid loss.

I am requesting an explanation for the inconsistencies noted between grid 
downtime allocations per turbine as calculated by Visupro/SCADA.  As a 
reminder, I am also looking for a report summarizing the measures taken to 
correct the low gearbox oil pressure faults, and feedback on why main circuit 
breakers are operating at both Mill Run and Somerset.  The main circuit 
breakers were intended to be an added safety/protection feature and I was 
lead to believe that they would not operate on a regular basis.  The main 
circuit breakers are tripping frequently, this suggests a possible safety 
concern and warrants immediate attention.

I look forward to your response

Best Regards,

Gary
