Hello Dave,

WHITEWATER - LOCATION & FACILITIES FOR SERVICE CREW

I believe that now is the time to set the various elements in place for your 
department to meet our obligations with regard to service and warranty 
support on the project.

The project - located in Palm Springs - will comprise of 41 EWC 1.5 WTGs. The 
project site will not have any permanent facilities for operations and 
service personnel. The area is not secured and burglary is a major problem.

The EWC SCADA computer will be located within the substation building. The 
BOP contractor has requested a total of seven (7) T1 lines at the substation 
building for communications. He will make available one of these lines for 
use by EWC.

Our service crew trailer and tools container will have to be located off site 
in a secure location. We should start looking to rent secure space now. You 
will have to notify Robert Grant about the phone line requirements at the 
location where your service crew will based.

There will be a project site walk through on May 27. The BOP contractor 
expects to have the roads rough graded and the WTG pad locations staked at 
this time. You should arrange for someone from your group to be present on 
this day to develop familiarity with site and bring up any issues that may 
arise.

Best regards,

Mayura Botejue
Project Manager - Whitewater
