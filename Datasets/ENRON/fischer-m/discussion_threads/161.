Kevin,

In my previous e-mail I said the sampling frequency will affect the final 
result when it comes to calculating payment for consumed power.  I have 
modeled the impact of frequency.  This model demonstrates that the frequency 
is significant in the final answer.   Take a look at the column totals for 
each measurement frequency.

In my e-mail I referenced the SCADA system and did not include the sub 
station as it was not my intention to include a reference to the substation.  
I agree that we can integrate the values at the substation to get a total net 
power but this ignores the constraint the utility is introducing, chiefly 
that they want to be paid for consumed power at a different rate than the 
rate they pay for power.

In the model you will find 30 time intervals for measurement.  They can be 
whatever intervals you want.  Then there are measurement frequencies which 
are defined in terms of the intervals.  Since the utility requires that we 
pay for consumed power you can see we may have intervals where we have 
consumed power but don't pay anything because during the same interval we net 
positive power.  Conversely the opposite is also true.

I set this up with random numbers ranging from -25 to 100 to illustrate many 
scenarios.

Regards,
Hollis
