The maintenance fee for S-Plus that was invoiced September 2001 has not been 
paid.  

Due to our current situation, I assume that only in a crisis would the $1,740 
be paid.  So let me know immediately if you even think you will need to call 
the help desk.   With advance notice, we might be able to get a check to them 
in 48 hours especially if high dollars are involved in your analysis.

Please note that at this time, we have NOT been notified that we do not have 
support.  We will not get an upgrade until payment is received.

I will continue to try and mitigate this situation with Insightful.

Please contact me if you have additional questions or concerns.

Patricia

Patricia,
Is Statserver version 6.0 available to us at no extra cost due to support 
agreements?    If so then has Insightful contacted you on when we will get 
our copy?  Thanks.
