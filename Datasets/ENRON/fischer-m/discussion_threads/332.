Some time ago, I sent an e-mail to everyone asking that they print/save an 
e-mail from GE that indicated their username and password for Domino 
Accounts.  For your reference, I am forwarding my notification as an 
example.  Please go through your Lotus Notes file and find your 
notification.  Either print the notification or write down your username and 
password.  You will need this information to use Sametime Meeting, Sametime 
Connect, and QuickPlace after we cutover to GE's network this weekend.

Subject: Domino Account Created


Denise,

A Lotus Domino ID and password has been created for you.
         Username: XXXXXXXXX
         Password: XXXXXXXXX

Visit http://globalapp01.ge.com right now to change your
password. It only takes a minute to complete.  Like all
passwords, don't write it down and don't share it with
anyone.

This ID and password must be used for accessing
the following products:
 Sametime Meeting
 Sametime Connect (chat)
 QuickPlace (Internal and External)

Some GE businesses may also use this ID and password for
other applications based on the Lotus Domino products.
Please note, some of these applications will be switched over
to GE Single Sign On very soon. When you see the SSO logo,
use your SSO ID and password instead of this one.  For more
information, please contact your local help desk.

Please do not reply to this auto-generated email message.
If you have a question, please contact your help desk.
