MINANA files of JAN&FEB 2002 for FENNER has been loaded.For jan2002 large 
gaps are there in the data due to turbines not containing full months data 
and also some turbines started from 22nd jan and other from 27th jan.
For JAN 2002 turbine 7 is having less number of records due to duplication of 
records.

For FEB2002 turbine15 started data from 7th feb were as other turbines are 
having from 4th feb.That is the reason it is having less number of records.

Total number of records are 51484.Please look at the data and let me know if 
any problems are there.
