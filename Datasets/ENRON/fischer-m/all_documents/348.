Jeff,
Thanks for taking care of this.  Still have any hair?
I got mine cut yesterday, so there isn't much to pull on...

This data will come in handy, and I'll get the March-May curtailment
list via pro-rating method to him tonight.

As for Mark's email, he has the same sort of address as yours, but I
keep getting notes from Postmaster@enron.com about not being able to
deliver the message...go figure.
Cheers, Dave
