we have received the field action request ref.  #01459 c/w 4 photos.
?

the gearbox must be left locked down  
the gearbox must be returned to Eickhoff Germany  for repair and 
investigating the cause of damage immediately  
we request answers to our following  questions:

? 

what is the date of commissioning of WTG #  79?  
no. of operating hours at???  nominal load??? and at partial load  
are all teeth of the gearwheel damaged or a  segment only?  
does the pinion show comparable damage ?  
is a bearing damage visible ?  
are deformed components or casing parts visible in  the surroundings of the 
affected gear stage?  
is it possible to get photos of the surface  structure?with higher resolution 
?  
for damage diagnosis we require detailed WTG data  of the last 7 operating 
days, particularly of the last 24 hours before  stop,??i.e. gearbox temp. and 
speeds, power, wind speeds, 
are metallic particles in the filter?  
we need? the torque measurement results?  of the reference gearbox in Trent 
Mesa

?
as the undersigned will be absent next week, pl.  send copies of 
communication to Dr. Frank Krull, engineering office
fkrull@eickhoff-bochum.de
