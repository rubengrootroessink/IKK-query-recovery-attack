Mark,

Do you know of any information/analysis we have collected on the Trent and 
Desert Sky sites?  I know that we were collecting data from GA, but Matt was 
handling most of this.

Kurt,
 
We are aware that some lightning damage has been caused in the past to 
turbines at Desert Sky.  Could you please advise how many instances there 
have been and the extent of damage.
 
Could you also please provide summary record of instances of lightning damage 
sustained by the turbines across the 1.5 MW series fleet, with detail in the 
case of Trent Mesa.
 
Thanks.
 
 
Regards,
