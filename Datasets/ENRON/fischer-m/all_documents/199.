Jeff,

Do you know how often we need to download the Z-Met data?  In other words, 
what are the file characteristics?  Do they overwrite every 3.4 days, are 
they a data stack which has 1000 records, etc.

Thanks,
Hollis

Kelly,

We need to prepare an SUB to change the downloading requirement for the 
VisuPro data.  Specifically we need to include the Z-Met data (file and 
frequency) as well as a uniform methodology for file management.

Can we meet in the morning sometime to discuss?

Thanks,
Hollis
