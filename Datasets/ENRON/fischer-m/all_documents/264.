Mark,
I meant to tell you that the new curtailment software is in place so 
curtailments are recorded in Visupro after the 25'th.  The file is called 
Curtail.DB  We have no way of verifying the accuracy of the files but they 
seem to be right on.  

Matt

Matt,

The curtailment log implies that you had no curtailment for the last week of 
May (after May 25th). Is that true?

Mark
