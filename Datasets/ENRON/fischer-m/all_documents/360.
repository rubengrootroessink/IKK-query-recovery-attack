Clemens,

This sounds like what we need.  

From the last table structure Dave Miller sent there is a field for 
Plant_Index in the Errdev table.

Will you make this change prior to the release?

Cheers,

Subject: Primary Index for all messages

Hallo together,

Generating a primary index for messages.

The index in the Errdev on the SQL server is used to see if messages are lost.
 
A useful index should  be the index of the error message of  the PLC.

At the moment the PLC is not generating a error message.
If the PLC error fifo has an overflow the erroe messages are lost.

In VisuPro i want to use an index for every received error message.
This index is initiated with 0 if VisuPro starts
Every time VisuPro receives anerroe message the index number is incremented. 
Every error message send from VisuPro to the ParkPC and SQLServer has this 
index number included.
The index number is saved in the errdev table of the SQL server.
So you have the opportunity to check if you have all error message  VisuPro 
received itself.

So you have in index form 0 to an endvalue and start again at 0 if VisuPro 
restarts.

If you have a gap in the numbers you have lost an message.

Opportunity in the future:
If the PLC supports message counter we can use this as an index number.


Would this be okay to you?
