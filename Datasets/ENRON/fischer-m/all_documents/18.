Hello Klaus,

I am trying to do a comparison between the 1.5 MW availability definitions 
used in Germany versus the one used here in the US.  Per your attached 
e-mail, we both use the Enron Availability (EA) definition, however the 
definitions are different due to the number of available counters in the PLC 
and the placement of the "MT" term in the equations.  In Europe you are 
limited to 4 counters while the US VisuPro has 7 and in Europe you include 
the MT term in both the numerator and the denominator while in the US we only 
include it in the denominator but we deduct 4 hours per month as a 
maintenance allowance.

With respect to the timers, the differences center on how 8 status timers are 
treated which result in a slightly higher availability for US turbines given 
the same operating conditions.  The status timers are: "Overvoltage", 
"Undervoltage", "Underfrequency", "Overfrequency", "Outside Temperature too 
low", "Gear oil temp too low", "Line fault voltage" and "Line fault 
frequency".  In the European EA these values are counted as "Down Time" and 
are added in the denominator but not in the numerator resulting in a larger 
denominator and therefore a lower overall availability.  In the US EA these 
terms are added in both the denominator and the numerator thereby resulting 
in no change, either negative nor positive.

With respect to the "MT" term, the European EA includes this number in both 
the numerator and denominator which means the "MT" term does not affect 
European EA regardless of how much time a European turbine stays in 
maintenance mode.  In the US the use of the "MT" term results in a lower EA 
result for values where the maintenance time exceeds 4 hours per month (48 
hours per year).

This brings me to my questions:
1.  Do the 8 status timers result in very significant impact on the EA term 
in Germany and throughout Europe?
2.  Can you quantify, in percent EA, the impact of these 8 status timers for 
some typical turbines?
3.  Can you give me an example of how much "MT" time you accumulate in a 
month for a typical turbine?

If you have any other thoughts or ideas on how we might quantify the 
differences between the two EA definitions I would like to hear them.  

Best Regards,
Hollis

Hi Hollis,

in VisuPro we have two different calculations of "EA" = Enron Availability.

One for new VisuPro version and PLC program for USA (Montfort, Klondike, ...) 
and the other for the old VisuPro version for Europe. 





The Remote Control department use for the montly availability report to Adam 
Umanoff the calculation:


  Enron Availability: EA[%] = (SOT+ MT) / (SOT+DT+MT+RT) * 100%

 

Europe:
The running PLC program of the Bachmann controller in Europe supports only 4 
Timer:  

Timer:
System Ok Time  SOT
Down Time    DT
Maintenance Time  MT
Repair Time   RT


Survey Time (ST)  = SOT+DT+MT+RT


Availability:
Enron Availability: EA[%] = (SOT+ MT) / (SOT+DT+MT+RT) * 100%




USA:
The PLC program and VisuPro for USA supports 7 Timer:

Timer:
System Ok Time  SOT
Down Time    DT
Maintenance Time  MT
Repair Time   RT
Line Out Time    LOT
Weather Out Time  WOT
External Stop Time  EOT

Survey Time (ST)  = SOT+DT+MT+RT+LOT+WOT+EOT


Availability:
Enron Availability:  EA[%] = (SOT+LOT+WOT+EST) / (SOT+DT+LOT+WOT+EST+MT+RT) * 
100% 




Kind Regards,
Klaus Holtel & Klaus Eilermann

Klaus,
could you please answer that email and explain it correctly, that everybody 
understands it. Discuss that with Andrea and Uwe.
Please do that tomorrow.

Thanks
Uli

Uli,

At the bottom of this document there are 4 calculations for availability.  
They are Machine, Operational, Line and Enron Availability.  Which one of 
these availabilities do you include in your monthly reports to Adam when you 
are reporting availability?

Best Regards,
Hollis

Thema: Availability Definitions

Hello Ule!

In the Senior Management reporting (for Adam) can you provide me a definition 
of the availability terms you propose to use?  We want to compare them to the 
definitions we are going to use to ensure that they are similar.

Right now our plan is to use the Enron Availability definition 
(SOT+LOT+WOT+EST)/(SOT+DT+LOT+WOT+EST+MT+RT) from the VisuPro system for the 
1.5 MW WTG and the Machine Availability (Op Hours/ Line Hours) for the other 
turbines.

Best Regards,
Hollis
