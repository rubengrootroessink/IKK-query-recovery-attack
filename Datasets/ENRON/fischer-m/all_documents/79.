Kurt,

Next week I'm going to need some of your patience and understanding. I have 
been assigned the task of getting your "Trent availability forecaster" 
created. So I need to talk to you (next week, I'm trying to finish up a 
couple things today) so I better understand what you're needing.

Mark

Thank you for your help on this issue. You came through with the data for us 
which is expected. Your assistance, patience and understanding while dealing 
with me is very much appreciated.
