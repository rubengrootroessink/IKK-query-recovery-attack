Ward:
I have added a tab on the previous file (attached here), with 15-minute
intervals, from the ERCOT data. ?If you check the tab with the total of
each curtailment period, you will see numbers similar to the 10-minute
data, and a total at the bottom of the table that is roughly the same. 
What does this mean? ?I suppose it shows that the 10-min data was as
accurate as the 15-min data, and that the innaccuracies come from some
other source, such as log entries, which turbines were actually
curtailed, etc. ?I noticed at least a couple of time when the number of
turbines listed in the outage table does not match the list of
individual turbines, and when the number of hours does not match the
start and end times of the curtailed periods.
I think this at least answers one of the questions about which data set
can be used.
I'm hopeful that looking at each hour of both techniques shows a small
difference over the whole month will prove to be useful.
