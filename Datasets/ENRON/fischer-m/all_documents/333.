Hi Mark,

(1) yes, metmast are to be configured like you thought (Met[metId#] (WTG#)
(2) yes, I incorporated that adjustment for all monthly db files. 

Attached are sample data of each download



thanks you...Kim

Kim,

This looks pretty good, and will certainly be helpful to the people at the 
site trying to do the downloads. Just a couple of points:

(1) From this I don't understand how metmasts are to be configured. So maybe 
some clarification of that would be good. (Is it Met[met#] (WTG#) ?)

(2) For the Monyymm.db files, we need to get both the current month and the 
previous month (at least for the 1st week of the month), I can't tell if this 
software is doing that.

This looks like this should provide a big help in downloading data. Do you 
have a sample that you can send so we can compare to what our oracle upload 
script is expecting? (Just to be sure.)

Hope my comments are helpful.

Mark

hi Mark,

The files-download tool is finished, but before we deploy it to the field,  
can  you please review the Auto-download Program Version 1 spec and let me 
know if it follows the requirements?   Also, I am modifying the code for 
version 2. Thus, it is very important that I hear from you.  Thank you much!

 

Kim

Kim,

First, Hollis will be out of the office until further notice.  I'll be 
coordinating his tasks for the time being.  Since I don't have the full back 
ground on this development here are my thoughts.

I agree we should work towards the best solution for the task.  It may be 
that the version you are testing is that solution.  The immediate problem we 
are trying to solve is;

1) the sites spend too much time downloading these files
2) we need data consistently and frequently here in Tehachapi, system 
performance team,
3) the sooner we have a solution the more time we will save.

A quick review of the REC document indicates some type of download cycle in 
addition to file format, which would be useful for other reasons.  The on 
site servers are not set up to store real-time data currently, nor is the SQL 
transfer program currently designed to accommodate all of the various files 
listed in either solution.

Last thing, would it be possible for you to send me test data so we can test 
out upload to our STAR db.  There shouldn't be an issue, but this would 
complete a 360 test.

Hi Hollis,

It seems that REC- SCADA is working on the same task as I am, though the 
actual coding has yet begun.  I have coded and now testing at Klondike a 
simplified version of this task (spec. attached).    But before I start to 
modify the code for version 2, perhaps we and REC project leader of this tool 
should come together to derive an optimal decision for this task. What are 
your thoughts?   





User Interface for version 2:

Hallo everybody,

attached are some screenshots of the "Automatic download tool"

Markus Altenschulte is working on the specification. 

If he has finished his work I will distribute the document.
