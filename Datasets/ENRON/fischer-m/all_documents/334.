John,

If you haven't already taken charge of this, could you work with Patricia to 
test the data that Kim Nguyen sent.  Be sure to pass on the results of this 
test to Kim and Ron Brzeniski.  

Mark,  thanks for jumping in.  There are some features of the tool sent from 
Clemens which may be useful, but I do not think it is ready.
