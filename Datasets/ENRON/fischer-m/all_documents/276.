Kurt & John,
 I am forwarding this Email from Gary. At this time I have not completed 
investigating this problem, when I do I'll let you know so far I have been 
unable to find a reason for this.

Joe,

Upon my review of the mon files for Mill Run,  I have discovered some 
discrepancies surrounding the recent grid outage on 6-5-02 that require 
corrective action.
The Mill Run site experienced grid downtime on 6-5-02 between 2115 and 2330 
hours for a total of 2 hrs and 15 minutes.  The associated grid downtime that 
was logged by the mon files within Visupro recorded the following:

WTG#1   - 2hrs 20 minutes
WTG#2   - 2hrs 22 minutes
WTG#3   - 2hrs 24 minutes
WTG#4   - 2hrs 26 minutes
WTG#5   - 2hrs 18 minutes
WTG#6   - 4hrs 46 minutes
WTG#7   - 2hrs 12 minutes
WTG#8   - 5hrs 02 minutes
WTG#9   - 2hrs 16 minutes
WTG#10 - 2hrs 22 minutes

The majority of the turbines are within reason except for turbines #6 and #8 
which have recorded more than double the actual grid downtime.  In addition, 
WTG#4 reports no data in the mon file for 6-2-02, Can you explain this 
occurrence?  This is not the first time data has been observed to be missing 
from the mon file of an individual turbine.  I also noted that WTG#5 
experienced more than 10 hours on repair on 6-6-02, Was there a failed 
component that was replaced on this date?

As previously discussed, I want Visupro to be an effective tool for both you 
and me.  We need to work together to work out all of the bugs and reporting 
malfunctions so that we can have a high level of confidence that it is 
performing calculations and reporting accurately.  Please forward my concerns 
to the appropriate people within GE so as to respond to these couple of items 
in a timely manner.  Understanding the mon file discrepancy in particular 
will be useful for the upcoming meeting with GE personnel to work through the 
availability calculations.

Furthermore, please provide me with the field reports for the shaft 
inspections recently performed at Mill Run.  Am I correct in saying that 3 
shafts were tested at Mill Run and none at Somerset?

I look forward to your responses

Gary
