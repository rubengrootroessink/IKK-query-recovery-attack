Over the next few weeks there will be crews working in the North and South 
buildings installing new computer and telephone network wiring.  This effort 
is part of an overall project to upgrade the network and add capacity to the 
computer infrastructure in Tehachapi .  The wiring effort will include all 
offices, cubicles, conference rooms, and trailers.  The wiring will be all 
new and will not disrupt current network service during the transition.  

The wiring will start in the North and South buildings later this week and 
will continue through to July 24.  The crews will be working from 7:00AM to 
7:30PM throughout the weeks.  Please be aware that the crews will need access 
to offices, cubicles, and conference rooms.  They will attempt to hold 
disruptions to a minimum, but will be removing ceiling tiles and installing 
new outlets for data and voice service in each of your areas.  Transition to 
the new network will be completed by July 15.  The crews will then go through 
and remove all of the old wiring.  

Your cooperation is appreciated with this effort as we work to improve the 
computing and network infrastructure in the Tehachapi campus.  Any questions, 
please direct them to Bob Grant, X6850.
