In order to expedite the speed of network response in the days when we had 
hubs instead of switches IT/Spohn set up the cabling between my computer and 
Mark Fisher's computer and the network servers so they didn't go through the 
hub like they did for all other users.    In the current rewiring of the 
building will Mark and I be changed to a cabling configuration more typical 
of all other users down here?   This info will help us do limited elimination 
of causes for network problems before we call IT with future problems.
