training and awareness initiatives.  Your efforts to date have ensured that=

our business continues to improve dramatically in EHS, security and medical=

areas.  The EHS month, with a variety of focus programs, will enable the=20
business to make a quantum leap forward.  We have developed a set of progra=
m=20
expectations for each site to roll out over the month.  Most of these are n=
ot=20
complicated, often requiring only a few minutes of employee time to update=
=20
records or complete training.  Other programs will drive increased employee=
=20
awareness and commitment, assisting in improvements beyond the month long=
=20
effort.  This will take everyone=01,s commitment and attention to be=20
successful.   We will be sending out details on each item in next few days.=

Thanks in advance
