The Visupro curtailment log file "Curtail.db", is stored in the turbine data 
folder at each turbine.
At turbine "840006003" the database files would be in "C:\Visupro\840006003\"
At turbine "840006020" the database files would be in "C:\Visupro\840006020\"

The curtailment program's log file "CURTAILyyyymm.DB", is stored on the 
computer running the curtailment software.
At Desert Sky (Indian Mesa/Clear Sky) this is the second park computer.  IP 
address: 192.168.0.253
On this computer the database files is sored in "C:\Visupro\TrbCurtail\" 
folder.

Subject: Curtail File Download

Joe,

I know you told me where these files are, but could you spell it out for me 
so we can issue a SUB for an additional download.

I think we will want to download both the Curtail.db file logged for each 
turbine and the monthly curtail file logged by the curtailment software.

Thanks,

JD
