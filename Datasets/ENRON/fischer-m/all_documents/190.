Subject: Desert Sky ZMET graphs

Kevin,

Here are the graphs and data recovery information for the three ZMET stations 
at Desert Sky (Clear Sky/Indian Mesa). I chose to use May 9, 2002 and did 24 
hours (one of the stations was pretty flaky before May 8 in the afternoon). I 
don't know if these readings make sense, but we got exactly the expected 
number so 100% recovery. Hopefully these graphs finish up this testing phase.

Mark
