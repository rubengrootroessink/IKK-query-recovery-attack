Ignore if this is the second time you got this.

Of course, my only involvement with this was through eve's dropping.  We 
should be prepared to discuss what sort of process we would need to implement 
this request.  I'm sure I'll be asked by Jeff M.  

We can talk after the meeting today.

Jeff-
There is a definite need for a monthly Availability Report to be issued on a 
regular basis.  This is a valuable sales tool that we haven't been able to 
utilize lately.  I understand that the information coming from Germany for 
the European fleet has not been received on a timely or regular basis.  As 
the US information is processed through Hollis' group and Mark Walker has 
recently received updated European information, this would be a logical place 
for the report to be compiled.

Attached is a copy of the graph we have used in the past for inclusion in bid 
responses (updated in the GE Wind Energy format).  Although this document is 
for the 1.5MW turbine only, the GE Wind Energy fleetwide availability 
percentage is also required.  As the availability is currently low, we will 
also need some sort of explanation included.  Dan Lindquist's group has 
prepared a summary overview of the reasons for the low performance.  Ilan 
will be discussing with Bob what information can be released to the customer 
on a monthly basis.  An external summary should be released monthly with the 
availability numbers.  This may need to be coordinated with Dan Lindquist's 
group.

Ilan Caplan has provided Mark Walker with formulas and information for 
comparison purposes against the statistical methods used by Vestas for our 
turbine availability.

We should have a process implemented as soon as possible.  If you have any 
questions or concerns, please contact Alan Nueman.
