Executive Summary
The following report incorporates the monthly meter readings by the site 
personnel & review of the mon files from Visupro.   In all three months the 
project availability ramp up was not attained although the Dec availability 
is close.   It should be noted that the Oct 2001 grid availability was 
extremely poor and that erratic grid conditions are known to cause turbine 
trips associated with grid variations.   This should be less of a problem due 
to the DVAR  but the problem may not be eliminated entirely.   In November 
2001 the Visupro data recovery was only about 85% and it is possible that 
there was higher availability but there is no recorded data to prove it.   In 
contrast the data recovery was over 94% in Dec 2001.
