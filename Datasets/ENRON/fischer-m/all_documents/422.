As of Noon tomorrow, July 12, the EWC network will no longer exist.  This 
means that all file servers, printers, Lotus Notes, DataFlo Abra, and 
internet access will not be available to you until Monday morning.  You will 
be able to work on files that you have saved to your local machine, however 
you will not be able to print unless you have a printer connected directly to 
your PC.  

We strongly advise that if you will need to work on files that are stored on 
the network after noon on Friday and throughout the weekend that you copy 
them from the network to your local hard drive.  Once the EWC network is cut, 
you will not be able to retrieve files until Monday morning.

If there is an urgent business need for e-mail after noon through the 
weekend, we can provide GE Outlook mail web access.  Please bear in mind that 
setting this up for you will take valuable time away from our integration 
efforts.  We ask that you do not request this service unless it is absolutely 
necessary.  

We apologize for the inconvenience, but these steps are critical to meet the 
deadline of full integration with GE Power Systems on Monday morning, July 15.
