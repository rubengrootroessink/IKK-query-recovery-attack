I requested the actual power curves from Olivia. I need a wind speed to kw 
list. I didn't need the warranty amount.

Mark, the curtailment periods have been re-sent, this is the first I have 
heard about your requirement regarding the contractual power curve, it is 
95%.

Kurt,

I am unfamiliar with the below request. To complete the curtailment for Clear 
Sky that I was looking at, I will need the contractual power curve, and a new 
copy of the curtailment periods . (Due to my email problems rom earlier this 
week, I lost many email messages, that one appears to have been one of them).

Kurt,

Attached is a work request corresponding to the attached e-mail.  As you can 
see, we need some additional information before we can start the work.  With 
the deadline of tomorrow please do not delay in providing the extra 
information.

Also, note that we may not have the curtailment information.  We need to know 
the timeframe for the request before we can say either "we have it" or "we 
don't have it".  

Thanks,
Hollis

Yes, the services of your department are requested. We need the data as soon 
as possible, I would think the customer expects to see this by Friday at the 
latest. This is related to a request that Mark Fisher has been working on, 
perhaps he can provide additional background on this issue.

Kurt,

We haven't heard anything regarding a request for data for AEP.  Do we need 
to be involved and if so, then what is the timeframe that you need the data 
for?

Rich Simon needs the following data: 

10 or 15 minute average wind speed, wind direction from Met Tower 652 and if 
it is still standing from the 10 meter tower 653. ? 
10 or 15 minute energy production for each turbine 
Which turbines were curtailed and when and how long they were curtailed 

Let me know if and how long it will take to gather this data.
