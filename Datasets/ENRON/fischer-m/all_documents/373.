Greetings Everyone --

You may have noticed that your paycheck stubs reflect vacation and sick leave 
balances that are inaccurate.  Due to EWC being acquired mid calendar year, 
and GE "grandfathering" in our vacation levels, the balances as stated on 
your check stub will differ from your actual balances.  So, for the balance 
of this calendar year (2002), all vacation and sick time balances will be 
tracked locally on our own HRIS System (at GE Wind in Tehachapi).  

Human Resources will provide you with your true balances by the following 
method:

The first of every month Human Resources will print out a hard copy of your 
vacation and sick leave balances.
Employees located in the North and South Tehachapi facilities will be able to 
pick up a hard copy of their balances from their respective facility 
receptionists.
Remote site employees' balances will be mailed to the respective Site 
Supervisors for distribution.

Thank you for your continued understanding through the integration process.
