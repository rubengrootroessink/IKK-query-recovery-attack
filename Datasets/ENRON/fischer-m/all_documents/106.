Ron, Val, Jeff and Russell: 

Please read the attached test performed by Russell. He installed a calibrated 
watt/watthour meter and noted the difference between this meter and the 
turbine kWh readings. There was only 1% difference, well within the 
calibration and accuracy coefficients of the turbines metering system. 

This test confirms what we already suspected, that the turbine kWh meter is 
recording near correct. Since the values of this metering are stored in the 
Bachmann, the reporting on the VisuPro program is what is getting mixed up. 
We also know that there are problems when the metering totals are reset by 
site operators. 

Our information systems group can help with determing the nature of these 
problems, but they must be placed in the loop. They already download the raw 
kWh meter readings from the Bachmann controller and use these to determine 
actual production values. These values must be compared to the system 
metering at the substation. Both Information Services and SCADA need feedback 
from the site operators on the reading from the sub-station point-of-sale 
metering to help determine the nature of our problems, especially at Trent 
Mesa. 

Hats off to Russell for putting together this important test. 

Regards 

KLC

Kurt:

Here is the info from turbine 89. It still looks like the turbine meters are 
reading ok.
