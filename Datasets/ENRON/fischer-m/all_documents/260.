While we await this infromation to be added to STAR here is a spread sheet 
with the clock acronyms.  It may be helpful to pull into Splus as a dataframe 
from use?

Patricia,

The attached spread sheet contains the fault number and corresponding CLOCK 
acronym.  For simplicity, we can call the new field CLOCK and it should be 
var(4).

If there any questions let me know.

Thanks,

JD
