Flemming,
In reviewing the Klondike visupro files for processing for the month of 
June,  there are minana.db files missing.
These files contain 8 days of records which gets written to every day.

Would you have the files for the Wednesday downloads for June 5, June 12, 
June 19 and June 26 downloads?

Hopefully, the download program that is being sent out to the 1.5 sites will 
help in gathering files.

If you have questions email or call me 661 - 823 -6508

Thanks
John
