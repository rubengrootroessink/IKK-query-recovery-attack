Hi Mark,
I did the ATP for SCADA system in Trent on April 13th at 11:40am (CT) 4:40pm 
(UTC), it lasted for 24hours. I collected the database files from all the 
turbines.
The following is the observations for the data collected:
Turbines no. 47 & 48 were under major repairs and were not included on the 
ATP, so total number if turbines is 98..
During the night of the test turbines no. 24,25, & 27 stopped collecting 
data, and I reset Visupro application in the morning, so there is a 10 hours 
worth of data lost, I suggest we shift the starting time of the test for only 
these turbines so we can get 24hours of data.
Turbine no. 31 has some repairs done to it during the night of the test and I 
didn't have notice of these repairs, I managed to capture the data for the 
24hours test in four seperate files, two files minana.db and minana_2.db for 
the 10 minute average and statdat.db and stadat_2.db for the status. I 
believe there is 2 hours worth of data still missing.
Turbine no. 90, kept rebooting in the morning and I had to go to the turbine 
and restart the PC, it worked fine for the rest of the day but there is 2 
hours worth of data missing.
Other than that the data looks fine for all the rest of the turbine.
I am transfering the files right now to your folder on the transfer server, 
the folder name is SCADA ATP Trent, and also I will UPS to you by overnight 
delivery the data on a CD.
If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 661-332-6348, I will 
be in Indian Mesa site until Saturday.
Regards,
Alaadin
