Mark,

We now have the curtailment piece but what about the energy which was in the 
wind (i.e. what was possible)?

Kurt,

The March data has been uploaded ( 443663 of a possible 473184 or 93.8% 
recovery, which is better than I expected). Running the nacelle wind speed 
data through the power curve for the curtailed periods as supplied by the 
site shows that approximately  9,961,285 kWh was lost due to curtailment 
(taking into account 97% availability and a 2% line loss). Additional losses 
might have occured during the times of no recovered data, but that is not 
supported by this data set/methodology.

The spreadsheet for each turbine/time period is attached (Times in this 
spreadsheet are SCADA time, UTC).
