Subject: Output from the Global SCADA meeting in Spain, March 25 through 
March 29, 2002.

People: 

The global staff of our SCADA groups met in Madrin, Spain between March 25 to 
March 29 to discuss improvement and changes for a new version of VisuPro, 
Version IV. Although we did discuss the higher level issue of a new, 
comprenhensive, wind park based, completly revised, SCADA system -- our 
primary goal was finding ways to achieve "Customer Satisfication", with our 
current VisuPro SCADA system. 

The Tehachapi SCADA group brought with them a list of necessary fixes and 
required upgrades (40 individual issues) to the meeting. It is these issues 
we concentrated on. This list of 40 items was based on feedback from our 
customers, such as AEP, FPL, Zilka,  & NWP along with feedback from our O&M 
crew in the field, and what our own SCADA team has noticed during 
installation and operations. The attachment document is a compliation of that 
former list, where many items were already fixed, some were not necessary our 
could not be completed in a timely fashion and some were all part of a common 
group. Our new list has a total of 28 items, 5 of the highest priority, 7 of 
the second priority and 16 of the lowest priority. The responsible/lead group 
for each individual issues is also shown. 

The attached document is quite long but I suggest that everyone find the time 
to review. Our proposals include changes in the VisuPro Code, changes in the 
VisuPro data base structure, changes in the VisuPro storage capabilities and 
an additional Server PC that will provide over one full year of data storage 
and custom report generation to help achieve what everyone is asking for in 
SCADA. The details are shown in the attached document. 

The Tehachapi SCADA group has a video conference scheduled for Thursday to 
discuss the final elements of this plan -- labor resource allocation and time 
requirements to complete these proposed changes.  In light of our goal of 
having the major items running in our customers wind farms by July 15, we 
have prioritized each item. 

I will outline the final plan, including milestones and completion dates 
before April 9. 

Regards 

KLC
