Hi,

I know you may have some questions that need to be address during your 
discussions with the representatives from Zilka. It looks like I will be in 
the field starting this Thursday. (I'll be travelling on Thursday morning to 
Montfort if all goes as currently planned.) You should be able to reach me 
during that time on my cell phone. The number is:

 661-332-4018

Please call if there is anything I can do to help clarify any issues.

-Garth
