Jeff,

Mar - May 2002 have been recalculated and spreadsheets created. Mar & Apr 
wend down slightly due to the "extra" turbines. May has gone up, possibly due 
to some data filling in holes from before, data recovery does appear to be 
better this time. The spreadsheets are sorted and totaled by Bus.ID. The 
"extras" are at the bottom with 0 production.


Mark
