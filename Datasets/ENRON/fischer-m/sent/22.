Tom, 

Here are the fault paretos of fault counts for all sites for May 2002 
(may2002paretos_faults.pdf). For readability only the top 30 faults for each 
site are displayed. Both Texas sites had VERY high numbers of "wind 
deviation" faults.

I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto 
(by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf), 
which shows that the Texas sites have the highest mean faults per turbine. 
This also has boxplots of the number of faults by site to show the outliers.

I will do the June data, if still desired, when the data upload is completed.

As always, if you have questions or comments let me know.

Mark
