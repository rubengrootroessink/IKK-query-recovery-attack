Tom,

Here are the new graphs with totals (bar charts) and distributions (boxplots) 
for all seven sites through May 2002. 

I believe that I have come up with a method of providing you with the 
ESTIMATED energy lost. Since it requires using two data sets (faults and 
10-minute data) it will be take a bit longer to run. However I hope to have 
that result to you next week. 

Mark
