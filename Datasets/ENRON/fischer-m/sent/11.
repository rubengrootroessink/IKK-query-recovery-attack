Tom,

Here is a sample of the output for this request. For this I have only used 
May 2002. I for the boxplots one has had records removed when the ambient and 
gearbox temp is less than 0 (I can provide turbines and times if needed). 
There were many records where this occured. There were also 5 records where 
the Gearbox temp was over 100 and these were also removed. All of these over 
100 records occured on turbine 105 on May 1st between 1640 and 1740 (UTC). 
Temperatures were as high as 366. 

If this format is acceptable let me know and I will generate graphs for the 
data we have (Jan - "current" 2002).

Mark
