Please note the response from Mike below, and ensure the MOOP accurately 
reflects the turbine count.  Also, we need to adjust the projections for GWh 
to reflect any changes to the turbine count.

Thanks,
Hollis

Mike,

Are these the turbines which are on line are producing as of the date of this 
report?  In other words should our MOOP report total to these numbers for 
these sites with respect to turbine count?

Thanks,
Hollis
