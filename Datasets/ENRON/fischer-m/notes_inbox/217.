Good News, Team!

A new email address list for both USA and Europe is online -- viewable and 
downloadable for your reference.
You'll find an excel spreadsheet with US and EU addresses attached to this 
email. 

The list is also available from a link within the question and answer section 
of the intranet home page.

Regards,

GE Wind Energy Corp. Communications
