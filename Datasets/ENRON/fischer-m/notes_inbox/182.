Nagwa,

I'm attaching a sample of the output of your request (one turbine, #001). 
Please make sure all the fields you need are here.

The logic I used is as follows

(1) Find the moving average of Power (KW) using a 50 minute (5 record) 
interval.
(2) For all 10-minute records where the moving average is >= 1490 find the 
maximum amb. temp.
(3) Find a record where both conditions are true, high temp/high power. I 
added a marker (=1) for the selected record
(4) Make table +/- 12 hours from the marked record (should have close to 144 
records).

If either the logic or the fields selected need adjustment let me know.

Mark Fisher
