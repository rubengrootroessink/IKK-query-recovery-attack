Subject: Wind related faults

Hi Hollis,

Here is the document that we wrote in response to Ben Bell's inquiry about 
high wind faults:



I can briefly describe the "low wind" fault (#146 "turbine stopped due to 
calm). The low wind set point is parameter 2.1 ("start spinning speed") which 
is a generator speed reading and has a nominal value of 48 rpms. If the 
generator speed falls below this value by 15% (48 - (.14*48) = 40.8 rpms) for 
30 seconds then the fault occurs. The turbine will restart when the wind 
exceeds 3.5 m/s with the turbine not spinning. (I'm going to check with the 
control engineers in Rheine to assure my interpretation of this is correct.)

Here are some documents that describe how the parameters/set points relate to 
individual faults. This document describes the faults in some detail:



This document shows the nominal values of the parameters for all turbine 
types. (This is an "unofficial" version and my not match the parameter 
settings in the field exactly):



This document describes the parameters in greater detail. (Some of these are 
subject to interpretation so if we have questions about exactly what the 
parameters do we usually have to as the engineers in Rheine for more details):



I hope this helps. If you have further questions ask me.

-Garth
