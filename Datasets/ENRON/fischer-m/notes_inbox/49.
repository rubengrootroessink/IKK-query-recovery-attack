Mark,

The following list is to be used when compiling the windsystem full power 
test.  We will use the SCADA 10-average data.  Turbines need to be grouped 
into bus-groups.  So, we will need to aggregate all turbines on the bus and 
run the test.

On a separate topic,

We need to apply a similar logic to the existing curtailment program.  Thus, 
there would be two numbers (Bus-1, and Bus-2).  Can you verify if the 
existing spread sheets using the 10% correction were outputted.  I can use 
those to query this list for the historical.  If not, we can run the routine 
after we make the change for the June report.  

Recall, this is the month we need to verify the prorating method by R.S. and 
our method.  When we run the analysis, we need to compile the curtailment 
file into the Feb. format and send to Dave Matson.

Of course, we can talk about running all these.  If need be, I or Mark could 
run this analysis.
