Hollis - 

What is the process for us to go through and calculate the "Vestas" 
availability as we previously defined, similar to Ben's description below?  
AWEA is the goal.  This would be a high priority.  Lets discuss.

Be well,
Ilan

Thanks Ilan, excellent; please copy me on future numbers.  Have you been able 
to determine what these numbers would look like using Vestas' definition of 
availability:  Hours of Wind Turbine in Operation mode X 100 / Hours of Grid 
in Operation Mode.  I sure would like to be able to present an 
apples-to-apples comparison at AWEA 2002.  Ben
