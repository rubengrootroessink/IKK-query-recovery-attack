Since we all have active Outlook express mailboxes with GE which are 
forwarding to
our current Lotus Notes email addresses, you may get an automatically 
generated email
with account information in it. I am specifically referring to your Domino
username/passwords. Domino accounts are used for Sametime chat and
Quickplace access, two programs that are used by everyone at GE. These emails 
are 
generated as the users are populated into Oracle HR.  It is very important 
that you
save the information contained in this automatically generated email in a 
safe 
place until cutover when you will be able to use these accounts. The Domino 
account 
email contains a randomly generated password for each user, so if it is lost 
the password 
must be reset, which will cause delays and extra effort in the user getting 
this
access. 

Thanks.
