Sure, no problem.

Mark, are you anticipating that your portion of this request will be complete 
today?  If so, send your completed package to me, I will add my data and send 
it to Kurt Anderson.

Matt,

Assuming the WR completes today, I was hoping you would take the lead on 
distributing the final work product for WR 574.
