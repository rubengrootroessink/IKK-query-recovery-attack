Jeff,

I didn't have time to go through all of this to answer your specific question 
about air pressure. I think VisuPro does display in mbars but like I said the 
raw data from the ZMET is a count (0-4095) which corresponds to the range of 
the meter (1-6V is 0 psia to 15 psia). The conversions (transfer functions) 
are on page 3,4 and 8 of the ZMET software description:



Here are the data sheets for the instruments:



Hope this helps...
