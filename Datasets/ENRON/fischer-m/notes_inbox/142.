This is the last email I have that gives insight into what Gary Verkleeren is 
thinking or assuming about 1.5 availability.

Subject: Conversation with Gary

Kurt,
 As a follow up on our phone conversation, here are the main points that were 
covered in the meeting with Gary. Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

Gary was unable to find any information in the TSIA that outlined the 
procedure that we currently use to record maintenance time of 4 hours per 
month instead of recording the time as it is used. Gary had a conversation 
with Mike Kelly whom assured him that this has not been done in the past and 
seems to be an incorrect way to report the maintenance time. Gary also stated 
that this would lead to error in availability in months were there were 28 
days in the month compared to a month with 31 days

Mark Howller & Mike Kelly have also conveyed to Gary that using 10 min data 
to calculate estimated power production and availability was an industry 
standard. In an attempt to complete the sale of the site, Zilkha has been 
asked to provide 10 minute data to their potential customers. Grays questions 
is why are we not using the 10 minute data files to calculate our 
availability.

Gary also wanted to know how the Mon.db file could be more accurate then the 
Minana.db file, if the Mon.db file is taking samples from other files, and 
the other files have missing data like the Minana.db does. He also wanted to 
know how the Mon.db file could be verified if there happened to be a mistake 
as there appears to be on turbine 9 for the month of April. Where is the raw 
data proving the numbers in the Mon.db file.

We also discussed the faults on turbine 4 for the month of April. Gary stated 
that the faults he outlined in his letter came from the errordev.db file. He 
was unaware of the state of the turbine at the time of the faults or if they 
contributed to down time or not. I am researching this and will inform you as 
soon as I know.

Gary also per warned me of an Email that is planning to go out to Mike 
Miller. The letter states that over the past 6 months our turbines have 
performed poorly, and we have attempted to mislead them by over stating out 
availability. We have also misstated the amount of parts used on site and we 
have not explained problems to Zilkha, that we are experiencing with our 
turbines. He also states that we have not provided maintenance's to our 
turbines in the last 7 months.
