Subject: Re-calculation of Monthly Availibility (Mill Run/Somerset)

Gary,

On behalf of the GEWE Systems Performance team, please find a re-calculation 
of Monthly Availability for both the Mill Run and Somerset projects.  The 
following work is in response to your findings regarding availability 
incrementing with no power production above cut in wind speeds, conveyed 
through both Kurt Anderson and through Mark Fisher's meeting with you in 
early June.

The following methodology incorporates criteria discussed during Mark Fisher 
visit.  We are planning to provide some detailed examples later this week for 
your review.  I anticipate we will then discuss the methodology via 
conference.  The intent would be to use this fully automated methodology to 
account for this situation on a go forward basis.

Please feel free to contact myself of Kurt Anderson.

P.S.  Due to a transition of our email, please copy any email to @ps.ge.com 
and @enron.com as we are making a complete GE transition on Monday.

Cheers
