Mark,

I thought the CA included an LOT term in both the numerator and denominator, 
which is how I am coding it in the Crystal Reprots application.

Subject: Availability formulas used

These are the approximations (since no manual data was used) used in the 
tables you were provided.

"Enron Availability"     ea = (SOT+LOT+WOT+EST)/ST


Contractual Availability (EPC)  ca=(survey-DT-RT-MT)/(survey-4/(31*24))


Where

SOT= System OK time
DT= Down Time
LOT= Line Out Time
WOT= Weather Out time
EST= External Stop Time
MT= Maintenance time
RT= Repair time

ST=SOT+DT+LOT+WOT+EST+MT+RT
survey= Survey time

the 4/(31*24) is an approximation for the prorating of the allowed "4 hours 
per month" for maintenance time.

If you have questions let me know.

Mark
