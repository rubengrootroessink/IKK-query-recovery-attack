Gents,

I was asked to provide the following information along with the data I will 
be sending and taking with me next week.

Could you also please advise re. the following:

- Definition of the availability figure given in the monthly
availability report.
- Duration of the down-time due to columnar shut-down.

Could you confirm the following definition of availability we use in the 
monthly owner report:

Contractual Availability = (TO - DT - RT -MT)/(TO - LOT - MTprorated) * 100%

Also, do we track direction (columnar) curtailment at desert sky?  I will 
verify if there mean Utility curtailment in the morning.

I need to provide this information with the data I'll be sending to Garrad 
Hassan.
