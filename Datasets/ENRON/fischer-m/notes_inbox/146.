We have received a number of calls from folks that do not remember how to 
modify their voicemail greeting.  Follow the steps below to change your 
External and Internal Greetings.

1. Dial-in to check your messages as you normally do by touching the message 
button on your phone or by dialing 823-6799.
2. Once you are logged into your mailbox, touch 8, then 2.  The system will 
tell you to press 1 for your external greeting, or 2 for your internal 
greeting.
3. Press 1 or 2 depending on the greeting you wish to change.  
4. After you have selected the greeting to modify, It's a good idea to listen 
to your voicemail as it currently sounds to prepare you for recording the new 
message.  Press 2 to listen to your current greeting.  
5. Press 76 to delete the old greeting.
6. Press 5 to record the new greeting.  Press the # when you have finished 
recording.  
7. Press 2 to listen to the greeting you have recorded.  If you are satisfied 
with it, hang up.  If you are not satisfied, press 76 to delete it.  Press 5 
to record, # to end, 2 to listen.  Repeat this process until you are 
satisfied with your greeting.

If you have any questions, please call the help desk at x6862.
