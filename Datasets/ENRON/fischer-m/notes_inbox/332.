Ward, 

As per your request, attached is the wind data, and curtailment information 
from Clear Sky for the month of January. Please note that due to a lack of 10 
min. data from SCADA, the turbine data for the month of January is not 
available. We are confident that this situation will not be repeated. It is 
also important to note that periods of curtailment were derived from the 
manual log provided by the site. There were 13 periods between 1/22/2002 and 
1/31/2002. Since turbine nacelle wind speeds were not available, 4 met 
stations were selected (0648, 0651,0652,0659). The met station data is 
recorded hourly. The wind speeds were extrapolated to hub height using shear 
estimates. The hub height wind speeds were converted to kWh by applying the 
Clear Sky Power curve. For each curtailment period the kWh values were summed 
to give an estimate from each met tower, the four estimates were averaged, 
the averages were then multiplied by the number of curtailed turbines. This 
generated a estimate for each curtailment period. These values were then 
multiplied by .97*.98 (97% availability and 2% line loss) as spelled out in 
section 2.(b) of the PPA, to get a net loss. For January 2002 the sum of 
these estimates was 1,770,692 kWh.
