Mark,
Terrie mails the download CD's weekly and the Curtail.DB file is downloaded 
three days a week as part of the SCADA backup.  The four most recent 
downloads are on the way there today.  If neccessary, I can email the curtail 
files but it would be very time consuming.  Let me know if you need me to do 
this.

Matt

Matt, 

Have you made arrangements to send us that file? I haven't seen that file 
yet, so don't know how that is going to affect the curtailment computations.

Mark

Mark,
I meant to tell you that the new curtailment software is in place so 
curtailments are recorded in Visupro after the 25'th.  The file is called 
Curtail.DB  We have no way of verifying the accuracy of the files but they 
seem to be right on.

Matt,

The curtailment log implies that you had no curtailment for the last week of 
May (after May 25th). Is that true?
