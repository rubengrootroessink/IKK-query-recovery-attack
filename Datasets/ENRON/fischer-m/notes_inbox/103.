Guys: 

Attached are the meter readings for Indian Mesa for both feeders 
(transformers). They includ the production and the cumsumption, and cover a 
period between May 19 and June 10. 

I think this is the best way to determine the actual consumption, because 
these are the meters that the customer gets paid on and is charged for. 

Regards
