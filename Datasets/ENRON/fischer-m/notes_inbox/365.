Hollis,
The numbers should be correct on this also if you have access to visual pro 
Remote in the config. file their are chanxxx.db files whereas x= numbers. 
these have to be opened in desk top database. they have extended listings of 
units and min. /max. values. n-set is probably for the 600A  which also uses 
Visualpro, I will verify for you.


Regards
