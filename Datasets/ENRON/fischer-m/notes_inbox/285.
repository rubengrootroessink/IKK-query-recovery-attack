Please skim through the attachment below to see if you have any concerns 
about how the faults should trigger in the future.

Hi Erik,

I worked on this for a little while last night but I couldn't get a modem 
connection from the Hotel. I hope the timing is OK. The confirmed counters 
are highlighted in green. The counters that need to be corrected are 
highlighted in red. Most of the corrections are due to the fact that the 
fault/status messages that are the result of enabling a "manual" operation 
mode (for example, manual yaw) increment the maintenance counter not the 
"turbine OK" counter. Unfortunately, there are many faults that we could not 
confirm using the turbine simulator. If you have any questions Kim Nguyen is 
the person who did the actual testing. I forwarded the results to Mark 
Fischer and Mark Walker so they could check to see if this is the way we want 
the counters incremented for the given fault conditions but have yet to get 
any feedback. The faults that we could not test should be confirmed by 
looking at the Bachmann software. Hopefully this will occur in the near 
future. For now, this is the best information we have.
