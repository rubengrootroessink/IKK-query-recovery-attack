Mark,

A reminder to forward Dave Matson and Rich Simon the May Curtailment 
information in a format similar to Feb 02.

If you fill out the request and forward to Julie she can put a # on it.  I'm 
not sure if there was already a WR for this, but if not and we do additional 
work this new one could cover that work.
