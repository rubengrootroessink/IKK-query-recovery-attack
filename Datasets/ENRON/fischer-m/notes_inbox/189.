These are the levels of validation used to identify wind data in WIMS.  Most 
data is stored at level 2, and cared through 3-4 during an analysis.


1. General range checking used to identify and flag outliers so that data can 
be quickly processed for a rush report.
2. Pass data through WIMS (Wind Information Management System) validation 
routine to identify and flag out-of-range values, unusual shear, sticking 
sensors, etc.
3. Same as step 2, but passed through the validation routine a second time OR 
data scrutinized by additional analysis methods OR data analyzed by more than 
one staff member.
4. Imputing data.  Replace flagged data with "false" but reasonable data 
obtained from historical archives, a best fit curve,or some other form of 
imputation etc.
