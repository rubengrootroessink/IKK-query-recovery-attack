I will distribute copies of the initial draft of QFD chart to you.  The goal 
of the meeting is to clearly define the customers, collect all known and 
expected customer requirements (their WANTS),  prioritize the WANTS,  
brainstorm HOW we can or do meet the WANTS,  prioritize the HOWS, discuss how 
to organize the findings, and then talk about unnecessary or low value work.  
A customer is anyone we provide services, reports, analyses, data, or any 
other product to.  The customer is the C in COPIS.  

 If you have any time between now and 13:00 hrs then please think of any 
customer requirement (what they want from us) that you are aware of but is 
not under the header "Customer Expectation".   Scribble it on your copy in an 
open cell.   Other than that just bring your copy of the chart to the meeting 
with you.   Thanks.
