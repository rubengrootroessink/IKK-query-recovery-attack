Hi John,

Transportation Trading Services Company (1755) is not set up in TIS, Hyperion or SAP so we won't close this month.

FYI
Enron Operations, LP (535) (fka Enron Operations Corp.) In TIS preparer and reviewer respectively, M. Morrow, S. Seelig.
	owns
Enron Transportation Services Company (1N9) (fka Enron Pipeline  Company) In TIS preparer and reviewer respectively, S.Husser, S. Seelig.
	owns
Transportation Trading Services Company (1755).

Per our conversation, Facundo Caminos and Mary Fischer will be the preparer and reviewer, respectively.


Hi Vicsandra, 

I did not find 535 or 1N9 in the Consolidated Workplan (the one that allows filtering). It appears 535 is a partnership and 1N9 is either a holding company or asset management company. See above regarding 535 assignment.

Please call me if you have any questions or need more information.

Thank,

M.

Mark:   Would you see that the Transportation Trading Services Company gets closed today if appropriate.   It was not on our company assignment list.   If you need information re it ask Robert Gutherie.   Thanks, John.

Please make sure that these have been added to our lists.  I am assuming that John PRM team will handle the trading entity and Rick's group will manage the service company.
