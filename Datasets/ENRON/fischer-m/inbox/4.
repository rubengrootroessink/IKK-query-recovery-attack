Yes, that is the exact difference.  It is due to the establishing of the credit reserve account.

Cathy,
Tax is not able to roll the change in PRM.  Is the difference possibly related to the G&A expense that you booked in the credit reserve account?

Please note that I made a mistake in my first e-mail.  The $5,577,900 difference is on company 20Q- not company 20R.

Thanks-
Shanna

Attached is the MTM analysis that we have done by company and in total.  (includes entites: 1572, 890, 20Q, 20R)

As you can see from the schedules, we can not match the change in the balance sheet to the income statement activity for 2 of the companies.

For company 890, the difference is ($20,000,000)- Tax knows what this difference is and understands it- so no explanation/research is needed.

For company 20R, the difference is $5,577,900- this is the difference that we in tax don't understand.

I prepared the majority of these spreadsheets, so if you can't follow our analysis- please feel free to call me. (ext. 35736)

Tax has Hyperion Close on Tuesday, Aug 14th.  We will contact you that morning to see if this amount should change our current tax entries.

Thanks-
Shanna
