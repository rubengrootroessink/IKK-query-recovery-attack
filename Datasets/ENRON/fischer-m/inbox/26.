Jeff,
	I have attached all the entries related to the sale of the SO2 credits.  I have also attached an example of buy and sell of credits.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Olga

You seem to speak this language.  What is he talking about?

Do we have a summary of the accounting entries made to report the sale?

For tax close this Wednesday, we'll have to reverse the book realized gain on company 33R and calculate taxes on the tax gain.  Please provide a schedule identifying the total proceeds and SAP entries used to reverse the MTM and report the realized book gain.

Thanks!
