Hello Kenny,

Just a couple of things.  One our stock is up again today  now it is up 2 at 62$  I was wondering if we should sell some?  What is your opinion.
Also I have some reading for you tonight - The Skiliing Story is all over the Gas Market.  (I told Ya).  I know that Clayton has soccer tonight - dont worry about dinner , I would actually prefer some of that Turkey tonight.  

I love you
