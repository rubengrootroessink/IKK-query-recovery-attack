> I would sincerely like to sit down with you and anyone else you would like
> in the meeting to apologize and explain everything.  I mentioned at dinner
> that Enron's revenue to Natsource has not dropped at all since the launch
> of EOL to show that the business is still there.  I added that it has
> helped keep the market liquid, and that traders have become addicted to it
> (which is to Enron's advantage).

> I would like to meet if possible, but even a phone call would be great.  I
> do not want to push our position on you, but you must know what Enron
> means to Natsource.  Please find time to sit down with my anytime or allow
> a moment for a phone call.  My phone number is 212-232-5330.
