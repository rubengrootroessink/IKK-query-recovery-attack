Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, "We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?"  
"Sure," said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, "Now go out and play."  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, "What religion do you think we are?"  
The oldest one said, "We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you."  
The littlest one said, "Didn't you smell that water?"  
"Yes. What do you think that means?"  
"That means we're Pisscopalians"
