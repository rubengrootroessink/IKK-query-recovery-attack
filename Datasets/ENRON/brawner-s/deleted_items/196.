I really wish you would not feel that way or make an apology.  I do not consider what you expressed Friday night was anything other than honesty and true emotion and I would like to feel comfortable expressing those same feelings to you!  I trust you and respect your opinion to great extent because of the above.  If I can help its yours!

	Smile and take a deep breath!
	I believe their is a reason for everything!
	Let me know if their is anything you want me to express at the "All Employee Mtg"

Where do I begin?  I guess I could start with several excuses or reasons to justify my behavior on Friday, but the truth is there aren't any.  I only am left with total humiliation and embarrassment for my actions, words, and behavior.  Please accept my sincere apology.
