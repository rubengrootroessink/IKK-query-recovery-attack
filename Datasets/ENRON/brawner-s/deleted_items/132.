Jeff,

As I discussed with you before, I believe the problems started a couple of =
weeks ago when EES began e-mailing me in response to quotes and assuming we=
're "done" without verbally executing with me via telephone. At the time th=
e problem started, we were migrating to Microsoft Outlook and I had problem=
s migrating over causing a several day delay in receiving all e-mail. I hav=
e explicitly expressed to them I must have verbal confirmation over the pho=
ne, NO exeptions. They will continue to e-mail me and we can facilitate the=
 initialing/booking in the manner you have sugggested. However, upon verbal=
 execution of transactions I can immediately let the trader know and manage=
 the booking process. It was my understanding this matter was resolved last=
 week. I have not even quoted, much less transacted, on anything with EES s=
ince I was under the mutual impression that all of our "ducks were in a row=
" with regard to EES. Tuesday, Brad's book admin came to me early with unwr=
itten transactions that were several days old. Moments later, the book admi=
n came to me and said he was mistaken - everything was o.k. Yesterday, Sand=
ra called me  with a similar problem (EES was trying to confirm transaction=
s she had quoted some time ago). The contact I deal with at EES was out and=
 will be out until Monday. However, I called his supervisor that makes the =
decision to transact and is usually in the loop on these transactions and h=
e was not aware of any deals unconfirmed since we straightened everything o=
ut. So, I apologize for this mess and as soon as Jim Barker returns I will =
get everything cleared up. In the future, I will not accept any deals from =
EES that I do not verbally execute - that way I can immediately notify the =
trader and you guys/gals in booking. Please let me know if you have additio=
nal suggestions, and again, I apologize for any difficulty this has caused.

Craig,

As per our discussion last week, all email trade correspondences from Enron=
 Energy Services detailing the term, volume, location and bids/offers will =
be sufficient enough for Risk to book the deals directly into our systems. =
  Therefore, it will not be necessary to write up a ticket for any subseque=
nt long term EES deals.  =20

Please print out the EES email correspondences and give to the appropriate =
trader so that they may initialize it.   I hope this will aid us in the fut=
ure in getting any subsequent EES deals entered into our systems and confir=
med within a couple of days.

Thanks in advance,

Jeff Royed
