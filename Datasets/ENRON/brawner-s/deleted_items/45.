hello ladies!  our girls night is coming up  on january 24.  sandra and i talked about going to see south pacific and  having dinner at brennan (they will shuttle us back and forth from jones  hall).  the seats available on the internet are ok, so i have jon checking  at work.  does this sound like something you'd want to  do???
