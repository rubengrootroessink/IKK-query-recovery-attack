MEMO FROM GOD 
To: YOU   
Date: TODAY 
From: THE   BOSS    
Subject: YOURSELF   
Reference: LIFE 
I am  God. Today I will be handling all of your problems. Please remember that 
I  do not need your help. 
If life happens to deliver a situation to  you that you cannot handle, do not 
attempt to resolve it. Kindly put it in  the SFGTD (something for God to do) box. All situations  will be resolved, but in My time, not yours. 
[IMAGE] 
Once  the matter is placed into the box, do not hold onto it by worrying about  
it.  Instead, focus on all the wonderful things that are present in  your life now. 
[IMAGE] 
If you find yourself stuck in traffic; Don't  despair. There are people in 
this world for whom driving is an unheard of  privilege. 
[IMAGE] 
Should you have a bad day at work; Think of  the man who has been out of work for years. 
[IMAGE] 
Should  you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who has  
never known what it's like to love and be loved in return. 
[IMAGE] 
Should you grieve the passing of another  weekend;  Think of the woman in dire 
straits, working twelve hours a  day, seven days a week to feed her children. 
[IMAGE] 
Should  your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance; Think of 
the  paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.   
[IMAGE] 
Should you notice a new gray hair in the  mirror; Think of the cancer patient 
in chemo who wishes she had hair to  examine. 
[IMAGE] 
Should  you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about, 
asking  what is my purpose? Be thankful. There are those who didn't live long  
enough to get the opportunity. 
[IMAGE] 
Should you find yourself the victim of other  people's bitterness, ignorance, 
smallness or insecurities; Remember,  things could be worse. You could be one of them! 
[IMAGE] 
Should you decide to send this to a friend;  
Thank you, you may have touched 
their  life in ways you will never know!
