Laughing!  thanks for relaying the message to your brother, I had told him I sent him an Email and he just insisted he didnt get one, now I guess we all know why ...  I am glad your enjoying school so much, I look forward to seeing you for the Holidays also.  Any Christmas suggestions this year?   Take care- and I owe you and your brother some "hamburger money"  I will take care of you guys at Thanksgiving.   Take Care

Sandra

It's good to hear from you even though you wrote to the wrong nephew.  How's everything going in the big H.  School is going pretty well, my classes are going pretty well except one that really sucks bad.  Tell everyone I said Hello.  I look forward to seeing everyone at Thanksgiving, I'll relay the message to Brad.
