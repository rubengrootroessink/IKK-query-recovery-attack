I had mentioned to you last night that I would forward you the memo I sent my CEO of Enron yesterday.
Today seems better here, not so much anger around the trade floor.    This is our BID Week so we have alot of business to take care of.  And as of  9:11 this morning our stock is actually up slightly for the 1st time in weeks.  Hopefully,  we can close ont he Highs.

	As I sit here this Wednesday morning and watch ENE trade $15.80 I can not begin to explain the pit in my stomach.  I have been an employee of Enron since June of 1984, I have never written a memo to my CEO to express opinions and or ask direct questions. 
	I can not believe that the individuals that are responsible for this catastrophe are still employed.  And I guess I need to understand why?  FIRED THEM !   It is apparent to me  that the information we have given to the market place is not sufficient enough.  "THEY" don't trust us anymore.  Get a plan of action, attack it, and save this company.
