A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, "Preacher's Ass shows". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, "Preacher's Ass, out in front!"

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; "Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass." 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, "Nun has the best Ass in town." 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, "Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks." 
They buried the Bishop the next day.
