Yes, I signed and returned the original one last week.  Your assistant verified that Enron had received it.  It is the revised one I am curious as to the status.

Did you already sign? I'm happy to see if we sort out any confusion on wording later but I think we need to get a signed copy from you asap.

David,

Per a conversation with John Lavorado he mentioned that an amended agreement was coming for my signature.  I was curious as to when I should be expecting the amended agreement, could you confirm please.
