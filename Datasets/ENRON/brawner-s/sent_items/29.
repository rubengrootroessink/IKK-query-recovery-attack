Scott,

Just a quick note.  I believe you did a great job this afternoon in communicating with your group about Enron's "cluster."
Today I have found this overwhelming since of Pride for this company and I don't want it to fail.  So if there is ANYTHING I can do to help please let me know.  I am in for the challenge and the long haul.


Sincerely,
Sandra
