I have really spent alot of time reviewing the situation this weekend.  I
hope you have accepted my apologies and understood my thoughts about what
happened.  As I said, I put myself in your shoes and can understand what you
view is on many of the points.  I hope you could understand some of my
confusion on how the dinner went.

I do not think it will be easy for either group to put it behind us.  I hope
you understand that you are an important customer for us (which is why the
entire gulf desk went to dinner with you) and earning and keeping your
respect is important.  We have a long way to go in that area.

I hope things will be better today.  I am not going to have the Gulf desk
turn on the box until I hear from you.  I apologize that I did not catch the
"box time" on Thursday due to the scattered  schedules the Gulf desk was
keeping along with myself (long conference call); otherwise, you would have
had a call from me when things settled down that day.

Sincerely,

Steve
