Steve,

 My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle
themselves in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any
business dealings with anyone in the entire organization.  I am sure that
Matt and Darryl are good people and good brokers.  The bottom line is ( I
do not believe you are getting)  that I do not want to, and do not plan to
do business with Natsourse today or in the future.
