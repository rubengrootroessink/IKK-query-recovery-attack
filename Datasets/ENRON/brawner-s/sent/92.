Hey - I just checked my E MAils for the day.  Sorry to hear about the 
interview with AEP.  I really am quite surprised.   Did Kayvon say why they 
didnt want to give you an interview?   I believe your thinking correctly , 
you need to seriously consider the Balitmore job.  And dont forget there is 
that possiblilty with AGL in Houston.  Correct?
