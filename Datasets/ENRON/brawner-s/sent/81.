Sandra,
???? 
???? The email that you sent me last Thursday has bothered me the entire 
weekend.? That is why I am emailing you from home.? I just want you to know 
my true intention of the email I sent you that day.
???? First and foremost,?I invited you and Kenny out for drinks, or a dinner, 
as friends.? I repeat,?"as friends" and nothing more.? I said in that email 
that business does not have to be discussed and?I meant it.? As far as 
the?Enron/Natsource?"deal" that you are talking about.....it had nothing to 
do with the email I sent you.? As far as I know, that "deal" has been in the 
works since September/October between Jack Cogan and Andy Zipper.? So I want 
it to be clear to you that the "deal" had nothing to do with me sending you 
that email.
???? As a matter of fact, the reason why I sent you that email and invited 
you out was because of the last time we spoke.? Remember when I instant 
messaged you?? The reason why I approached you that way was because I thought 
we were close enough friends that I could.? As?I found out, I was wrong.? 
However, when I spoke to you that day, on the phone, and asked if I could ask 
you out in the future ( when?I come to Houston).....you said I could.? I have 
planned to come down for weeks.? Even though you choose to not deal with 
Natsource, I still considered you a?friend and thought it would be 
appropriate to ask you out.....and so?I did.
???? As you know, I take things to heart.? I was really upset with 
the?response I got from you.? I am emailing you from home because it bothered 
me so much that I needed to make sure you understood my true intentions.? I 
hope I have done that.
???? Finally, I just want to say that I will not bother you again.? I just 
want you to know that?I have always tried to do the right thing.? I feel as 
though you are questioning everything I say or do and that you believe there 
are?ulterior motives behind my actions.....and it just isn't true!??With 
that, I wish nothing but good things for you and your family.
?
???? good bye,
???????????????? Ray?
