Wanted to say Hello.  I must tell you I miss you, I don't have anyone to 
shake my head at anymore. Hoping all is well with the new position.  Also 
wanted to thank you for calling Pam I do appreciate that .  There are  plans 
are for my husband and I to meet some friends of yours this weekend.  We are 
getting together with the Schnitzers and they have invited the Kushnicks .  
Jon and Susan really enjoy them and have wanted to introduce us for some time 
now.  
Looking forward to the introduction.    Again,  I hope the job is treating 
you well.


Best Regards,
Sandra
