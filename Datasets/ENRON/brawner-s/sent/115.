My bible study lasted until 9:00.  I was exhausted.  I had been on the phone
all day.  I am working this career thing very hard.  I am leaving in the
morning for Tulsa to look at houses and apartments.  I have not excepted the
job yet.  I have to be sure.  I also have some interviews set up for Monday
and Tuesday of next week.

I have to have faith that God will lead me in the right direction.

I have to call Susan and Jon and apologize.

What is Jon's phone number at work?

Pam
