Steve,

 My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle themselves 
in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any business 
dealings with anyone in the entire organization.  I am sure that Matt and 
Darryl are good people and good brokers.  The bottom line is ( I do not 
believe you are getting)  that I do not want to, and do not plan to do 
business with Natsourse today or in the future.
