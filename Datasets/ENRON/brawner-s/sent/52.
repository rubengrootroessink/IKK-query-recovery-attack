A beautiful woman loved growing tomatoes, but couldn't seem to get her 
tomatoes to turn red. One day while taking a stroll she came upon a 
gentleman neighbor who had the most beautiful garden full of huge red 
tomatoes. 

The woman asked the gentleman, "What do you do to get your tomatoes so 
red?" The gentleman responded, "Twice a day I stand in front of my tomato 
garden and expose myself, and my tomatoes turn red from blushing so much." 

 The woman was so impressed, she decided to try doing the same 
 thing to her tomato garden to see if it would work. So twice a day for two 
weeks she exposed herself to her garden hoping for the best 

  One day the gentleman was passing by and asked the woman, "By the way, 
How did you make out? Did your tomatoes turn red?" 

"No" she replied, "but my cucumbers are enormous!"
