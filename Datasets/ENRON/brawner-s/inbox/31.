Hi Sandra,

I hope you had a nice Christmas and a fun holiday season.  We as you can
imagine with three  5 year old boys, it was hectic but, the look on their
faces Christmas morning was priceless.

I wanted to let you know that I am leaving Prebon as of January 15th. I have
spent the last eight years of my 16 years in the Energy field with Prebon
and we part on the best of terms.  I am talking with a few banks, a
consulting firm and some energy companies, but also plan on spending some
time at the house with the family.  I will let you know when and where I
decide to go.  Hopefully we can work together again in the future.

Best wishes for continued success in 2002 and the years to come.  Please
give my best to Kenny.

Sincerely,

Bill
