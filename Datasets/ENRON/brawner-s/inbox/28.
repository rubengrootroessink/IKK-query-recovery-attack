Greetings, Sandra.  I hope life will be treating you better over there
soon.  As you might know, most of EnergyUSA was given pink slips effective
over the next 3-6 months.  As a result, it is back looking for another job.
I was wondering if it would be possible for you to write a letter of
recommendation for me?   I'm really regretting this leave from Enron now.
In my quest for looking for something stable, I ended up fucking myself up.
At least I have a few months before our house is finished.  Hopefully, I'll
have something by then.

Thanks,

Jeff the Genius
