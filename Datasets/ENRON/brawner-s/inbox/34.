To all,

I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and we discovered the following:

City of Madison transport:	transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward
MGAF transport:		write down 2007-2020 position.  Loss of about $500K - Scott as we spoke, I'll take the blame
LRC/Stringray positions:		Kam to review and explain
Annuity:				Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above
Alagasco:			Tammi deal, Sonat Tier 2 position
Others:				As I explained to Kam, any gain from closing this book should be transferred for the
				account of Jared Kaiser
				 	      Bank of America
					      ABA 0011.....just kidding!  It comes from sitting by Sandra too long.

Kam - thanks for your help and let me know if you need my help.  As well, please reply if I have not covered all issues.


Regards,

Jared
