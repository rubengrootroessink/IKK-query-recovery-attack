 Some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling.=
 =20
We apologize for any trouble that you may have had.  The enrollment works=
=20
best in either Internet Explorer or Netscape.  The most frequent problems=
=20
were a result of the Lotus Notes web browser that many employees have=20

As a reminder - Following is the original message regarding the PAC=20
enrollment:

Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to=
=20
become a "million dollar PAC".  Enron employees, who provide all of the=20
funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective,=20
becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new=20
challenge.  With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal=20
employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent=20
contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, pleas=
e=20
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your=20
contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public=20
policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both=
=20
parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.  Amoun=

federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal=20
Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee=20
contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of=20
those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of=
=20
our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of=20
e-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives,=20
international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and=
=20
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants an=
d=20
a variety of environmental and tax issues.  Enron has a long and successful=
=20
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy.  That track=20
record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers=
. =20
The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters ca=

about what they are doing.

One of the best things about Enron is that we don=01,t just take things as =
they=20
are.  We challenge the status quo.  We ask why.  We change things.  The PAC=
=20
helps us do that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today =01) and ple=
