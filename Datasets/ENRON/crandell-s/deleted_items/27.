This thread is a little confusing but the upshot is that NP15-NW1 was undersubscribed (only 50 MW out of 165 MW bid upon) but the winning prices was very high: $10,000/MW-yr.

Hi Alan,
Sorry about that.  I didn't walk all the way through the numbers.  We had an
initial offer of 165MW but only 51MW were bid on so the remaining 104MW go
back to the TOs.  So 51MW times the clearing price of $10,002 gives you the
$510,102.  If you have any questions on this please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim,

Thanks for the reply.  If I take the total revenues for that branch group
($510k) and divide by the MW sold (165 MW) I get the $3k/MW/yr number not
the $10k number.

Alan

Hi Alan,
The closing price for COI NP15-NW1 was $10,002.  It closed in the first
round, thus was the seed price as posted on the web-site.  Where did you get
the $3092 number from?  Give me a call if something doesn't look right.

Thanks,

Jim,

I can't make sense of the $/MW number for COI_BG in the "by branch group"
report.  Shouldn't it be $3092 instead of $10000+?
