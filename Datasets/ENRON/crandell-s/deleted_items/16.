Mo,

The Estate has a valuable transmission contract with PGE (between Mid-C and COB).  We (you) get billed once an month and need to make sure the estate pays this promptly.  PGE has been given your name as the POC.  I treat this like a power contract and make sure Houston wires the money as soon as we get an invoice.

Steve
