   Don't know if this will reach you.  I tried to reach you on your work number
   but the vmail never "beeps" to leave a message.  With the
   situation at Enron, I was thinking of your situation.  If I can be of
   any help, pls let me know as I have some experience in the search area (if
   applicable).  In any event, it would be good to hear from  you.  I really
   appreciated the help you had given to me.
