 =09 =09    Dear Chuck,  Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay will not testify at e=
ither Congressional hearing this week.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook =
says because of Lay's decision not to appear, the Senate Commerce Committee=
 is expected to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to Lay as early as Tue=
sday morning.  Two House subcommittees could soon issue their own subpoenas=
 as well.  A subpoena would compel Lay to appear, but it does not guarantee=
 he will testify - he could invoke his constitutional right not to speak.  =
 Other hearings involving Enron will proceed as planned, with three hearing=
s scheduled for Tuesday morning.  One of the hearings involves Enron board =
member William Powers, who will testify in front of the House Energy and Co=
mmerce Committee's Oversight Subcommittee. Powers led the internal investig=
ation at Enron, resulting in a report released this weekend that was highly=
 critical of the company's management team.  We'll have highlights from Pow=
ers' testimony on Tuesday from Washington.   Unsecured creditors can help e=
nsure a better rate of return on what they're owed by Enron through claims =
trading.  That's according to Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny Parkins. =
 He'll join us during the noon ET newscast from the Houston bureau to discu=
ss the process of claims trading and how creditors can assure they will rec=
eive some sort of payment.   Also from Houston on Tuesday, Williams Gas Pip=
eline CEO Doug Whisenant talks about pipeline safety following September 11=
. He'll also discuss the future of Williams Gas Pipelines.   We'll have mor=
e from the one-on-one interview between West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym=
