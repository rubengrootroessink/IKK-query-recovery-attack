 =09 =09    Dear Chuck,  Another Congressional hearing into the Enron colla=
pse is scheduled for next week, with the focus falling on energy.  The Sena=
te Energy Committee will look into what impact Enron's demise has had on en=
ergy markets.  The Washington bureau will have complete coverage of Enron d=
evelopments on Capitol Hill.   The White House could find a lawsuit on its =
doorstep next week.  General Accounting Office Comptroller General David Wa=
lker says he could decide as early as Wednesday whether to sue Vice Preside=
nt Cheney over the administration's decision not to turn over more informat=
ion regarding the work of his energy task force.  The GAO has never filed a=
 similar lawsuit in its history, but Vice President Cheney maintains the re=
quest is inappropriate.     FERC Chairman Pat Wood addresses a meeting of t=
he American Public Power Association in Washington on Monday.  The Washingt=
on bureau will have details on the APPA meeting and coverage of the regular=

n on the start of a possible FERC investigation.    There's another whistle=
blower in the Enron case - on Monday, the Houston bureau will speak with th=
e attorney for a woman who says she knew there were problems at Enron.  We'=
