Hey You,

Hope you have a great time at the game tonight...would
really love to be there.  When we we "chatting" the
other day you mentioned something about this dream you
had about me that was crystal clear.....you were
sitting around reading old letters....mmmmmmm I think
you should let me in on your dream...and how it was
reading old letters....what you were wearing, where
you were, any favorite parts, any effect they may have
had on you, anything they may have caused you to
do????

I have this fantasy going that I'll have to find the
time to sit down and write out.....there is a couple
of variations...I hinted at one variation that day I
finally caught you on the phone....that I was going
crazy thinking about you teasing me with a pair of
your pantyhose.  I'll try to write it all out.....I
really do miss you, I is hard to describe how close I
feel to you, sometimes I cant understand why we dont
keep in touch more....but then I think it would just
make me it even harder.  More than anything I would
love to just spend a day with you in some little room
with a fireplace, raining outside, that we could just
lay around and talk.....about everything!!  I would
just love to get lost in you!

Happy New Year!  Hope to see and hear alot more of you
this year!!!

Love,

Steve

I attached a few pictures of me biking.
