Melba,

Sean sat down with Christian and I and explained his proposed product.  The=
 product works like this:  EPMI and a counterparty agree on a day-ahead bas=
is to a quantity of power, a price for that power, a delivery point, and th=
e hours at which the power will be scheduled.  The seller does not schedule=
 the power as a day-ahead schedule, however.  Instead, the supplier schedul=
es the power on a real time basis on the day of delivery.  I made a small m=
odification to Sean's proposed definition, which I think will clear up any =
ambiguity.  With this change, Christian and I approve of the definition of =
the product.

Hi Kevin,

I think this answers our question. Lets go ahead and get it through legal.

You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahe=
ad DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would =
mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART off=
peak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day.

Hi Sean,

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. If I understand cor=
rectly the only difference between day ahead and the DART product is that i=
t does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. Also a DART t=
rade for the 3rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the 3rd?

Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

Sean,

The language is below.  Also, Savita wanted to conference call you this aft=

Kevin

A US Power Transaction with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. under which the Sel=

Kevin,

Could you e-mail me the contract language we currently have for the Mid-C p=
hysical product so I can work with it?  (I don't have an electronic copy).

Thanks

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=
t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
t language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.
