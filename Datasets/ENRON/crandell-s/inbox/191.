Kevin,

Could you e-mail me the contract language we currently have for the Mid-C p=
hysical product so I can work with it?  (I don't have an electronic copy).

Thanks

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=
t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
t language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.
