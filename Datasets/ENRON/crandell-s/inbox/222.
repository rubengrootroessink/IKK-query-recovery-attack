Good Morning,

NOB is derated to Zero for HE 5-12 for Saturday July 28th.  Our Downstreams at NOB are cut to zero for those hours, and the deal numbers have been changed and noted in scheduling.

The deals are:

Nevada Power 423713.1 

BPA  459815.1

LADWP 579025.1 and 548842.1


Special Conditions on LDWP deal 541395.1 require that we re-supply them at a different and mutually agreed upon delivery point. Sean and Art from LDWP agreed that this alternate delivery would be COB, and this deal has been adjusted to show HE 7-12 is at COB N/S now.


Please see me if you have any questions regarding these deals.
