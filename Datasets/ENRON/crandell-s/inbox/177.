Arun is going to have to bring down the Curve Manager due to these issues:
No 10/31/01 or 11/1/01, due to this ST is having to mark 12/1/01.
Arun is going to fix these issues: he will have to bring it down and then back up.
In about 20min (10:45) please log out and login -> then check to see what needs to be remarked.


Thanks,
Heather
