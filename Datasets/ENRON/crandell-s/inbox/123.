Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL called regarding the setup of Mid-C "Dart Product" ( I might be mis-spelling).  He advised you have been asking IT to get this created.  Would you let me know the nature of this new "product"?  Risk might need to set you up in some systems in order for everything to be working right.

Thanks,

Fran
