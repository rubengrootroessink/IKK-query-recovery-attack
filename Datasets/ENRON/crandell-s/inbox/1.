Hello, Everyone -
 
RTO West will hold two days of meetings Monday, February 11, and Tuesday, February 12, 2002 to review, discuss and seek consensus on the draft filing that RTO West is preparing to submit to FERC.  The meetings will give Regional Representatives an opportunity to prioritize and explain their key issues to the RTO West principals before the filing planned for March 1, 2002.
 
The meetings will be Monday, February 11, from 8:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. and Tuesday, February 12, from 8:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. at the Shilo Inn located at 11707 NE Airport Way.  The Shilo Inn is about 2-3 miles east of the Portland Airport and east of I-205.  From I-205 take exit 24 from the north or exit 24B from the south.  If you need overnight accommodations, the Shilo Inn phone number is 503-252-7500.
 
The meetings will focus on discussing the substantive issues that RRG members raise during the meeting.  To the extent possible, Regional Representatives are encouraged to confer with other stakeholders in developing their input.  Because there is also an opportunity to submit written comments on the drafts until close of business February 15, we encourage participants to bring up substantive input at the meeting and rely on written submittals for providing detailed comments.
 
We recognize that there is alot of material to cover during the two days of meetings.  A proposed agenda and proposed time allocation is attached so you can estimate when topics you are interested in will come up.  However, we will be as flexible as possible.
 
A number of the filing drafts are now posted at <http://www.rtowest.org/DraftFilingDocforMar12002.htm> .  By the end of the day, all of the draft materials for the filing should be posted.
 
Thank you,
Christine Elliott,
RTO West Coordinating Team
