Dear Friend and/or Colleague,
 
A summary of the 2001 season, real-time forecasts of Columbia River runoff made weekly with the HyMet model can be viewed at the following website: 
 
<http://www.hymet.com/colnex1.htm>
 
These results show the accuracy of each forecast made at the three main sites (Grand Coulee, The Dalles and Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River) from January 1 to June 30, 2001, and also demonstrate the influence of abnormal precipitation and temperature during the forecast season on the accuracy. 
 
Precipitation in the Pacific Northwest during the 2001 forecast season was near the record historic low in this region, therefore a significant fraction of the forecast error can be explained by subsequent weather conditions.
 
Your comments are welcome.

Regards/Wendell
