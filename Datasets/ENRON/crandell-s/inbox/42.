Dear Sean,

  I have changed 2 deals that were put in as transmission sales : deals # 894692 and 894962 to Buy Resales.  Please make any adjustments necessay to your scheduling sheets, etc.  The new B/R deal numbers are 896676.1 and 896677.1 respectively, to replace the above 2 deals.
  The reason for this change is that the Business Rules of EnPower will not allow the system to recognize a sale of transmission from EPMI to another counterparty.  

  Please contact me with any questions you may have.
  
  Thanks,

  Virginia
