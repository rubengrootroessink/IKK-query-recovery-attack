Greetings, everyone!
 
This e-mail is to let you know that several documents for tomorrow's RRG meeting are now available on the RTO West Website.  You can find them at:
 
<http://www.rtowest.org/Stage2RRG_Upcoming.htm>
 
They include a copy of the TransConnect slide presentation for tomorrow, a "white paper" on planning and expansion prepared by PNGC, an updated congestion model summary paper, and a brief description of the Filing Utilities' proposal to modify certain aspects of the Stage 1 pricing model.
 
Thank you very much!
