Luzenac has suspended its contract for 10 NERC business days, starting Jan. 1.  Therefore, we will not schedule power to Luzenac during this time, or charge Luzenac damages.

A "NERC Business Day" is any day except for a Saturday, Sunday, or NERC holiday.  By my calculations, this means that we will resume deliveries on January 15th.

Andrea, you might confirm with these guys that they agree with this calculation of days.---sch
