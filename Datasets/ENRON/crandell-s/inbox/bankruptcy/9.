Yes, that's the way to handle this.  We may see more deliveries resuming, because under most contracts counterparties can only suspend for a limited time.

Unfortunately, we can't guarantee payment to these counterparties.  The bankruptcy lawyers advise us that contracts signed before December 2 are pre-petition, and deliveries made under the contract are pre-petition.  Counterparties have to do the math and see whether they are better off delivering to us---and not getting paid---or terminating, and paying us for the in-the-money value of the contract.  For some, like EPE, they are better off in the short run by just delivering to us.

Best,

Steve

On Dec. 21 CRC called and wanted to resume deliveries at the Mid-C (they are delivering to us).  I'm assuming this is OK.  Let me know otherwise.
