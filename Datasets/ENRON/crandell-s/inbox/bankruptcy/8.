Just a note to confirm:  Ash Grove Cement has suspended their contract until Jan. 10th.  This means power should not be scheduled for them.  But if no further remedies are taken by Jan. 10th, we should plan on scheduling them starting Jan. 11th.  I will let you know if anything further develops.

Thanks.
