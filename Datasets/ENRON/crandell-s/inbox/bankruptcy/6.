We just had a call with Luzenac, and we came to no conclusions.  We need to try to schedule to them every day for January, even though they will refuse.  Then invoice them appropriately.  If they refuse to pay the invoice, that may allow us to terminate their contract and start the termination payment procedure.  I'll keep you up to date on any changes.

Thanks.
