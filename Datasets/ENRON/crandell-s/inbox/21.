Sean,

Have you heard of this yet?  I am assuming it impacts your planned deliveries.

Subject:	BPA Termination Notice

This morning I received a termination notice from BPA. Effective 2/1/02 BPA is terminating contract numbers 97PB-10123 and 98PB-10227. Both have one way payment provisions. Harlan Murphy is checking the effectiveness of their
notice. We need to make adjustments to west power schedules as soon as Harlan confirms termination validity.
