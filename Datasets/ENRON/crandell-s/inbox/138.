I recommend this presentation to traders and other folks who are involved with transmission and/or market structures.  It is more likley (although far off) that the RTO West may move to a locational (nodal) marginal pricing (LMP) model, akin to the way PJM operates.  Andy Ott is a key manager at PJM and this is a unique opportunity to hear how that system operates from someone who has direct experience.
 
Please let me know if you will go.  I will be going and cam offer to drive.

Hello CMCG - 
 
As mentioned at the recent RRG meeting, RTO West has scheduled an informational briefing about the PJM Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) model on Tuesday afternoon, October 23, 2001, from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. PDT.   The briefing will be in room F on the first floor of the Kingstad meeting center, 5933 Win Sivers Drive (off Airport Way).  Parking is available in spots marked "Kingstad" or across the street in the lot marked "Overflow Parking".  
 
Seabron Adamson, Frontier Economics of Boston, will present the briefing and Andrew Ott, General Manager of Markets Coordination, PJM Interconnection, will be available to answer questions.
