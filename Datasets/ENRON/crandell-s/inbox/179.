QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================
"We are not going to have a bomb fly out of the sky and land
on somebody so that we can say, `Look, there's a bomb, and
we are all dying of anthrax.' It is most likely going to be
a   covert release, and people will get sick and go to
their hospitals, and the public health system will have to
pick up on this."
-ASHA M. GEORGE, who studies biological warfare for the Nunn-Turner
Initiative, a nonprofit foundation in Washington.

Some See U.S. as Vulnerable in Germ Attack

Health experts say new vaccines must be developed, but the
bigger problem is fortifying a fragile public health
system, the first line of defense against biological
threats.
