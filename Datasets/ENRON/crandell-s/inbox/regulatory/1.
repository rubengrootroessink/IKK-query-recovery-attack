This rehearing order is huge, and I will not attempt to comprehensively sum=
marize it.   However, here are my top 9 findings of interest to EPMI/oldco/=
newco and marketers in general.  Given that current prices are well below t=
he cap, many of these FERC findings regarding prospective mitigation are ir=
relevant from a commercial standpoint. (But will become important if the ma=
rket turns up before 9/30/01.)

There will be many more general summaries in the trade press.  For a starte=
r, I recommend reading Gary Ackerman's (attached).=20

1. The underscheduling penalty has been completely eliminated retroactively=
.  The IOUs and EOB won 100% here.  Thus EPMI's $30 million non-invoiced cr=
edit is kaput unless we appeal the FERC decision.

2. FERC affirms mitigation applies only to spot transactions and not to for=
ward contracts.  This comes up in several places in the order (e.g., see p.=
 52 and 55) and is useful in or defense against SPP/NPC complaints.

3. On the refund side, marketers and hydro owners may show that refunds do =
not cause net negative revenues (p. 49; see also p. 169)

" ?the Commission will provide an opportunity after the conclusion of the r=
efund hearing for marketers to submit cost evidence on the impact of the re=
fund methodology on their overall revenues over the refund period. For the =
Commission to consider any adjustments, marketers will have to demonstrate =
that the refund methodology results in a total revenue shortfall for all ju=
risdictional transactions during the refund period. The Commission will con=
sider such submissions in light of the regulatory principle that sellers ar=
e guaranteed only an opportunity to make a profit. To the extent we stated =
in the July 25 Order that we would not allow such a showing regarding selle=
rs' purchased power costs,131 we grant rehearing. We will also allow seller=
s of hydroelectric power to demonstrate the impact of the refund methodolog=
y. "

4. CAISO is required to submit a comprehensive congestion management redesi=
gn and plans for a day-ahead energy market by May 1, 2002.  This is a good =
requirement because it gives FERC cover to NOT extend mitigation past 9/30/=
02.  CAISO must have known this is coming since it is already circulating a=
 proposal.=20

5. Government agency exemptions.  The FERC was firm that government entitie=
s and RUS-financed cooperatives are NOT exempt from the mitigation and refu=
nd requirements if the power was sold to one of the FERC-approved markets; =
namely, the CAISO's R/T market and the PX day-ahead market.  However, FERC =
granted rehearing of government entity requests to be exempt from the West-=
wide cap.  Thus, government entities are now exempt from the WSCC wide cap!=
  However, marketers cannot resell government generated power  above the ca=
p.  The key difference is that government agencies selling power outside th=
e CAISO are not necessarily using a FERC- regulated market.

6. No special treatment for vertically integrated utilities acting as marke=
ters (p. 88)=20

"We will not allow LSEs to justify sales above the mitigated Market Clearin=
g Prices based on their cost of purchased power."

7. Enron wins on certainty of price in mitigated ancillary service markets.=
  In one of the few places a rehearing was granted, FERC approved Enron's r=
equest to make the cap binding at the time the deal is consummated, not whe=
n power flows (p. 94):

"The ISO, Enron and Reliant seek some type of ex ante pricing. The ISO prop=
oses that prices in the Ancillary Services capacity markets in all hours in=
cluding system emergency hours be limited to 85 percent of the most recentl=
y established mitigated reserve deficiency MCP, asserting that such an appr=
oach is more consistent with the Commission's intention to set prices befor=
e they are charged. While Enron and Reliant also seek a price that is known=
 before the price is charged and that will not change, that price would not=
 be capped. This topic is addressed in the order on the ISO's compliance fi=
lings that is being issued concurrently with this order. As we explain in t=
hat order, changes in the mitigated reserve deficiency MCP for the Imbalanc=
e Energy market should have no effect on prices in the Ancillary Services m=
arkets. Thus, we agree with Enron and Reliant that the price for the hour a=
 transaction is entered into, and not the hour of delivery, is relevant for=
 establishing the market-clearing price for ancillary Services. We will gra=
nt rehearing of our prior orders on this point, to the extent needed to all=
ow this modification."

However, EPMI asked for similar certainty in the mitigated market price in =
the R/T energy market  (p. 62).  FERC raised the question but I could not f=
ind a response. (?)

8. Marketers (still) cannot sell above the cap. Marketers were denied rehea=
ring in several places (e.g., p. 46).  Marketers cannot be treated like gen=
erators even if they own or control generation.  In one of the more ambiguo=
us passages:

"The Commission denies clarification that marketers that own or control gen=
eration and engage in marketing through a portfolio of resources, or that p=
erform scheduling or tolling functions on behalf of generators, will be tre=
ated as generators; they must be price takers. By contrast, entities that a=
re able to trace a transaction to a specific generating unit will be treate=
d as generators. With respect to Calpine's request for clarification, the C=
ommission will require marketing affiliates of generators to be price taker=
s. Furthermore, marketer-to-marketer transactions in the bilateral spot mar=
ket are subject to price mitigation and marketers selling outside of the IS=
O's single price auction will receive the price up to the mitigated Market =
Clearing Price."

I am not sure how the second sentence jives with the first.  If market pric=
es rise, we will need to research this issue.

9. Option contracts are forward sales (yeah, we won!) (p. 152):

"Similarly, with respect to Enron's request for clarification that option a=
greements exercised for spot-market sales are not themselves spot-market sa=
les, we clarify that such sales are entered into for future periods and the=
refore are not subject to mitigation."
