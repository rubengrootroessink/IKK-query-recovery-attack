Is Cigarette Smoke in Your Establishment an Issue? Options Can Help.

If your establishment accommodates both non-smokers and smokers, you
know that cigarette smoke drift and odor can be a challenge.  To help
you address this issue and find reasonable approaches to public places
smoking, Philip Morris U.S.A. created Options.

The Options initiative is designed to help hospitality business owners
find effective, practical ways to minimize second-hand smoke and create
more comfortable environments for both non-smokers and smokers in public
places. *
