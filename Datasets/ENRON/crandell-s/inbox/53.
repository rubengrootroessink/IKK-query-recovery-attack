Doesn't the 10 NERC days mean we start delivering on Jan. 16th, not the 15th?

Luzenac has suspended its contract for 10 NERC business days, starting Jan. 1.  Therefore, we will not schedule power to Luzenac during this time, or charge Luzenac damages.

A "NERC Business Day" is any day except for a Saturday, Sunday, or NERC holiday.  By my calculations, this means that we will resume deliveries on January 15th.

Andrea, you might confirm with these guys that they agree with this calculation of days.---sch
