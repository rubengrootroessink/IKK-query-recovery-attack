Diana and Sean:

Attached please find the latest prior month adjuments to be entered in your P&L for 10/31/01.  The total amount will be -$206,492.82, primarily due to demand charge liquidation adjustment (-$204,999.92) for deal 555367.1.  I have researched on this item and believe it is valid.  

Please also note the attached file is preliminary.  There could be more to come from Settlements between now and month-end.  I'll update you if that happens.  Please take a look at the items listed now and let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Fran
