In this case PPM, the purchase, was cut. The sale side, PNGC did not get any power and are sending us LD's. Both sides are affected and both sides need  an annuity put into the system.  Sale annuity to PPM and a purchase annuity for PNGC.  The sale is LT NW and the purchase is ST NW.

Was the purchase cut or the sale cut?  Which ever it is, it should correspond to the book associated with it.

Diana,

Here is the same question I had the other day.  When we have a cut and  the purchase side of the deal  is ST NW and on the sale side the deal is LT NW how do you want us to enter the annuities.  If I put them on one book then we should be fine.  

Thanks
