Fall Recruiting for Associates & Analysts is here once again and you have been elected to participate in our Super Saturday Event!  

This year, the onsite interviews are scheduled for two Saturdays in November.  On each Saturday, the top 9 - 12 candidates from our local schools will be present.  This will help tremendously with our cross-calibration process.  The dates and schools are as follows:

	Saturday, November 10, candidates will be drawn from:  
		University of Portland
		University of Oregon
		University of Washington
		Washington State University

	Saturday, November 17, candidates will be drawn from:
		Portland State University
		UC Davis (Associate candidates only)
		Oregon State University

We will need you to participate in at least one of these Saturday events.  We will also need 5-6 people to overlap and attend both Saturdays, so please volunteer if you are able.  (PS:  If we don't have enough overlap, we will have to begin "drafting", so please help out where you can.)

TASK ITEM:  Please respond to this message, indicating which Saturday(s) you will be able to attend.  

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thank you in advance for your help.  It is very much appreciated!
