 TMT members and participants: 
       This is to inform you that, at the Implementation Team meeting this morning, the Action Agencies agreed to provide summer spill for fish passage at Bonneville and The Dalles Dams, beginning today, Tuesday 24 July.
       At Bonneville, the Corps and BPA will make best effort to spill 45 kcfs each day for 5 hours.  The spill hours will be 2000 - 0100 hours, as recommended by NMFS.
       At The Dalles, spill will be provided on an hourly basis, when the hourly projection is 71 kcfs or greater, from a minimum 15 kcfs spill up to 30% of total discharge.
       Spill began at 1400 hours today at The Dalles, and is expected to begin at 2000 hours tonight at Bonneville.  The action agencies may change the operation if the spill operation results in unacceptable risks to power system reliability.  The Action Agencies will coordinate changes with TMT.
       Thank you for participating in the TMT and IT discussions over the past few days that led to this operation.
