Kroum has developed a new Forward Obligation Report, which will allow us to capture all term deals, desk-to-desk and all scheduling changes.  Both Heather Dunton and I have tested it in stage and will be pushed out to production soon.  Once I have the date I will forward it to all of you.  It should be within the next couple of days.  I will also show all of you how to run the report to capture the criteria we need to do our swaps.
