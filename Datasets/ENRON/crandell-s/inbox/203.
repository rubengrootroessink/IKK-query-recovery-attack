Here are the phone numbers you can call if you need any help this evening (or tomorrow, I'm sure).
 
Mike Duchow-Pressley   503.246.4862
Tom & Barbara              503.557.3371
Judy Cochran (Brian)    503.656.8659
Bruce & Becky              503.650.6500
 
I'll have my cell phone, but it doesn't get good reception right at the convent.
If you need to get ahold of me quickly, you can call Father Theodore and get the number of the convent.  His number is 503.292.3737 @ church; 503.641.2370 @ home.  (His wife's name is Stacy, in case you've forgotten).
 
I'll print this out and leave it at home.  I'll also call you and make sure you got it.
Finally, I'm going to put the Voice-mail # you need to call into the phone (speed dial #2) -- then you just need to enter the security code.
 
See you tomorrow.  I love you.
