Attached are UAMPS Comments on the FU Proposal for Facilities Inclusion. We are reserving judgment and not commenting at this time on the balance of the proposals made by the Filing Utilities until further details are made public and the relationship with other promised proposals are produced.  If there are any questions, please contact me at 801-327-6605.
