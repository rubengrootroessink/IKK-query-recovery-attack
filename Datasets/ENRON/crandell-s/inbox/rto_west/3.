RTO West is working on a March 1, 2002 Stage "2" FERC filing.

A recent draft laid out the current thinking on congestion management and access charge pricing.

A coalition of generation interests filed the attached comments. Basically, from the perspective of an independent marketer/generator, the current proposal discriminates against nonincimbents and gives existing contract holders few incentives to convert.
