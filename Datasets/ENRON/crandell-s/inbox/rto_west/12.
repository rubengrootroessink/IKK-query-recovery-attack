Hello, Everyone -
 
At the December 19 meeting, a schedule of Key Dates and Milestones was presented, then posted on the RTO West website.  Several of the key dates and meeting dates have changed; we have reposted the "Key Dates and Milestones" on our website at <http://www.rtowest.org/Doc/Calendar_Dec14toMar1_DatedJan92002.PDF>.  The revised Key Dates and Milestones are also attached to this email.  The meeting date changes have been made in response to requests that RTO West meetings not conflict with the market design workshops FERC has tentatively scheduled in January and February.
 
January 25 Stakeholder Clarification Meeting.   The next Stakeholder Clarification Meeting will be held Friday, January 25, 2002, from 8:30 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. at the Kingstad Meeting Center, Room F.  The Kingstad Conference Center is located at 5933 NE Win Sivers Drive, about three miles east of the Portland Airport.  The purpose of the meeting is to clarify, answer questions and take comments from stakeholders and interested parties on two groups of drafts that will be presented at the meeting and posted in advance on the RTO West website.  Paying Agent, Scheduling Coordinator and Credit draft documents will be posted on January 15 and a another group of drafts will posted on January 22.  When documents are posted, we will send a notice of the posting and a reminder of the January 25th meeting to you.
 
RTO RRG Days.  The RTO West RRG days originally scheduled for February 5th and 6th have been delayed until February 11th and 12th to avoid the potential for a conflict with FERC workshops planned the week of February 4-8.  Delaying the RTO RRG meetings avoids potential conflict with FERC's tentative workshop schedule but also results in less time for incorporating the results of the RTO RRG days in the March 1 Filing.  For this reason, if FERC's final workshop schedule changes and does not conflict, the RTO RRG meetings may be held on February 5th and 6th as originally planned.  We expect FERC to firm up the schedule for its Februa! ry workshop in the next week or so, at which time we will be able to finalize when the RTO RRG meetings will be held.  We appreciate your patience in this matter.
