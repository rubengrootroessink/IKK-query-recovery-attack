Hello, Everyone -


At the December 19 meeting the filing utilities explained and answered questions about RTO West proposals on congestion management, pricing, facilities inclusion, market monitoring, and planning.  You are invited to send written comments about these draft filing elements to me at chrisrtowest@earthlink.net <mailto:chrisrtowest@earthlink.net>.
 
Hearing your comments on our work plan schedule, we have extended the deadline for submitting comments until Thursday, January 10, 2002.
 
Materials from the December 19 meeting, are at <http://www.rtowest.org/Stage2RRG_Upcoming.htm>ww.rtowest.org/Stage2RRG_Upcoming.htm <http://www.rtowest.org/Stage2RRG_Upcoming.htm>.   You will find the papers on congestion management, pricing, facilities inclusion, market monitoring, and planning.  Because we are currently having trouble posting documents, I have attached the power point presentations, key dates and an updated version of the facilities inclusion paper to correct misinformation about PSE's exempt class C facilities.  
 
As mentioned in previous notices these documents are preliminary rough drafts and represent work-in-progress on these subjects.  None of the documents have been approved by the filing utilities.


Christine Elliott,
RTO West Coordinating Team
