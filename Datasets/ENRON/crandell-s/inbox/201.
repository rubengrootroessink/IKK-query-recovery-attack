Sean:  Per Gary's instruction, please sign and notarize this additional
declaration.  Then fax to me at (202) 662-3910 as soon as it is notarized
and deliver to CRA by next day air.  We must have a faxed copy no later than
noon Portland time and it would be great if it was earlier.	

Thanks,
Amanda
