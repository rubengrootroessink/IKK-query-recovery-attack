CAISO is essentially suspending 10-minute dispatch for energy supplied on the ties!  If you get dispatched at the beginning of the hour, you will stay on for the entire hour.

Alan Comnes


Beginning at 2359 on December 12, 2001, the ISO will alter the way it  pays inter-tie bids for Energy.  Specifically, the ISO (1) will continue to pre-dispatch an inter-tie bid in merit order in the BEEP stack before the beginning of the operating hour but (2) now ensure such a bid is dispatched throughout the entire operating hour (i.e., never reversed), thus paying the bid the Instructed Energy Price for all ten-minute intervals in that hour.  As before, the ISO must continue to comply with the Commission's June 19 Order and so the  inter-ties can not set the Market Clearing Price.
