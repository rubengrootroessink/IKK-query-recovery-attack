	  Hello again,  [IMAGE]  Houston-bred vocalist Steve Tyrell returns  from L.A. for a party celebrating his fabulous new CD, Standard Time.  Tyrell's performances in each of the Father of the Bride movies  led to the 1999 release of A New Standard, a smash hit that put  him among Billboard's Top 10 jazz artists last year.  (Click  on "PLAY CLIP" to hear a sample from the new album.)  STEVE'S  SHOWS ON TUESDAY ARE SOLD OUT, SO WE'VE ADDED TWO MORE SHOWS ON WEDNESDAY,  OCTOBER 17. Show times will be 7:30 & 9:30 and thanks  to support from Columbia Records, tickets are only $10. Call  713.224.5299 for reservations now!  ?Tyrell is a welcome addition to  the list of Sinatra heirs?? ? Variety     Best regards,  The Sambuca Web Team
