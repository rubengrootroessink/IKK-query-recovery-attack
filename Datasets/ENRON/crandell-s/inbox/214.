Subject:	UPDATE!!! curve manager problems today

Arun in IT confirmed that the prior day curves are showing up correctly in the database, though they are showing up incorrectly on the front end curve manager.  He said it will take some time to fix the front end problems, and he expects the fix to be done by Monday.  He said since prior day prices are correct in the database, it should not mess up our calcs.  So as long as our traders make sure current day's prices are posted as they wanted, we will be fine.

Somehow today in the curve manager, prior day's prices column is not showing the prices as of yesterday, but showing prices based on today's price changes by the trader.  Driscoll first found out about it, and Arun is working on fixing the prior price now.  I'll let you know when he confirmed the problem is fixed.
