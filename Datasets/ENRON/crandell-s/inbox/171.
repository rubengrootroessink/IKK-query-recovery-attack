>      FERC Chairman Pat Wood said the agency would focus on the 
> Pacific Northwest, Energy Daily reported. While California 
> worried about summer blackouts last year, states like Washington 
> and Idaho could face shortages in the future because of a lack of 
> rain for hydropower coupled with winter peak electricity needs.
>      In addition to making the Northwest the first stop a tour of 
> the power grid regions, Wood said at a meeting sponsored by 
> Energy Daily and the U.S. Energy Association changes would be 
> made to a June price-mitigation plan governing the area. Wood 
> said he is ambivalent about regulations that give FERC power in 
> siting decisions and said pending legislation, if passed, would 
> make transfer of transmission assets to RTOs tax free (Energy 
> Daily, Oct. 1, http://www.eenews.net ).
