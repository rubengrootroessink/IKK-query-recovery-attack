Diana and Sean:

Just wondering if you happen to know how the scheduling volume in these two deals work?  I believe when we liquidate at the beginning of this month (for example, 8/2) , the volume was zero in stead of 50MW/hr in scheduling.  Would you advise how the "timing" of entering the volume in scheduling was determined?  I am asking because it looks like for the first few days of this month we didn't liquidate anything because at the time the volume in scheduling was zero.  If somebody added the volume later, we will need to know in order to correct total liquidations before the "incomplete liquidations" get to Settlements at month-end.

Please advise, thanks!!!
