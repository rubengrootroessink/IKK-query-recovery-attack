Just a clarification.  The new leg 3 is just for onpeak (correct?), and the premium is $2 total, not in addition to premium of first deal.  Is this correct?

Stewart,

Per our discussion I have changed Modesto basis option deal #520328 to reflect the restructured terms:

* original peak deal (leg 1) deal end date was changed from 9/30/01 to 8/5/01. 
* new leg 3 was created for 8/6/01-9/30/01.  All terms stay the same except that strike price was changed to $3 and an extra premium was added for $2/MWh for the new leg.

I have also put a note in the comment field requesting the confirm group to send documents to you before sending to counterparty.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran
