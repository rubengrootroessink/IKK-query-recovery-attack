Hey,

You sound kind of bummed out there, amiga.  Understandable though.  Tough and very weird times that's for sure.  Very sad.  The funerals must have been brutal.  I know I'm depressed by it because I get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically.  Hopefully things will improve.

Our stock has just been munched.  It sucks because we're doing well, but the other "half" of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors.  Everyone was wondering why Skilling left; I guess we know why now.

Enough of the gloom and doom.  Sounds like you are getting opportunities--that's good.  I knew that you would.  Here's some pros/cons for your options (recalling my vast experience;))  Structuring:  Interesting but not alot of dough.  Probably the most easily replaced by those fresh MBAs.  Trading:  Like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed.  Can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times.  Good dough if you make it though.  Marketing:  Low immediate, constant stress, but still competitive.  You have a great deal of charm and brains, so I think you would do quite well in this area.  In addition, there are a number of firms (Calpine, AEP, Coral) who are opening up an office in Portland pretty much geared towards mid-marketing.  Might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home (plus you can buy me beer, which is always a plus for anyone's karma).

As far as your overall attitude towards the industry, I think I disagree.  I think it's a good industry to be in, particularly now, because no matter what, people need electricity.  And it's still changing, especially out West, so there will be challenges and opportunities.

It's great talking with you.  Cheer up.  Call your folks.  Run.  Punch a punching bag.  Do drugs (kidding).  Take care of yourself, and if you need anything, give me a buzz or drop an email.

Sean

Hi Sean, how are things going? I'm jealous about your trip to Europe. I
called you shortly after you returned from the trip and you filled me in on
your castle experience. I would love to do that someday. I had no idea you
were talking to Duke, I hope you got what you wanted and deserve from Enron,
your a great guy, and a good trader I hope they realize that. Life over here
on the east coast is interesting, first it was the attacks of the eleventh,
I took one week off from work and attended 6 funerals in NYC, it was
extremely sad. There were even people from my graduating class from Calgary
that worked in NY, I was shocked at how far reaching the effects were. Right
now we're just trying to live through and survive these biological attacks,
I live close to the white house and the mall, so I figure if anything big
happens I'll go quickly. Are people this messed up in the world, that all
they can think about is spreading pain, suffering, and death. What have we
come to? Sorry, just really philosophical today with all the TV's talking
about Anthrax over and over behind me. Work wise things are well, I'm at a
juncture here where the trading team is asking me if I would like to trade,
structuring is wondering if I'd like to do that full time, and with my
mid-marketing role and contacts, marketing wants me to become a full fledged
marketer, the trouble is I don't know what to do, I'm trying to delay the
decision as long as I can. I really have no regrets at PGET, the people are
great, the work is challenging, and they treat me well. But lately I'm
starting to feel very bearish on the whole industry. I can't tell you where
I'd want to go, when, or what industry I'm optimistic about, but I can't get
too excited on power right now. Anyway, take care, drop a line sometime.
later alligator

In case you don't, hey what's going on?  I haven't talked with you in a
long time, so I was wondering what's up with you?  How's DC?  How's PGE?
I'm doing OK.  I went to Europe in June (whole month).  Very nice.
Italy, Switzerland, France, and Netherlands.  Hard to come back.  Then I
almost went to Duke, but then came to agreement with Enron.  That was
interesting.  Anyway, just wanted to touch base.  Let me know what's
going on.

Sean

Hey Sean, sorry I hung up there. 
I was hoping you could still give me Scott's number, or whoever deals
with
odd lot sp15. 
Thanks so much. Hope your doing well.
