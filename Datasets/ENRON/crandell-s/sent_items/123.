Down to brass tacks, eh?  This is always the interesting part.  Quite frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at two other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract, the second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be around $275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the first to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about $350 to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at about $725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.

In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations for me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not a big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation.  Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the prospects of being on the "ground floor" with Cinergy, I also have to recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would be willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some serious money for the company.

Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you achieve your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is serious money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron.

No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in Cincinnati.

Your meeting went really well, everyone like you a lot.  We are having a
pow-wow tomorrow afternoon, and we should have something for you real soon
after that.  Just as a reference point, what is the compensation package you
have now and what are you expecting?
