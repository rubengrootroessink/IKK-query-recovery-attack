Audrey,

Here is a brief personal work history.  I've been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988.  I started trading for Portland General Electric in 1995.  I've been a trader for Enron for the last 4 years.  I run Enron's short-term Northwest book.  I have market-making responsibility for the cash, balance, and prompt months for the Mid-Columbia and COB specifically, although I am responsible for the entire Northwest.  I also trade Palo Verde, SP15, and NP15.

I have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this:

1.  150 K Base Salary
2.  250 to 300 K Signing Bonus
3.  Various bonus structures, generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary.

Quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing.  The compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Sean Crandall
