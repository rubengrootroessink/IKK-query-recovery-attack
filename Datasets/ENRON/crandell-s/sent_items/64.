In case I did not already say so, this is a great move for us, and hopefully
for you.  We need a big step-up in risk management in PBL and agency-wide.
You will help us get there.

	I'm pleased to inform you that Diane Cherry will be joining the Risk
Management Group on an informal detail to help us get the PBL Risk Strategy
completed.  The detail begins immediately.  Her skills and talents will be
particularly helpful in  acheiving buy-in across the PBL, facilitating
discussions, integrating the risk strategy work with the PBL indicators
project, integrating with the Corporate review of PBL risk practices,
leading change efforts and cultural issues, and generally structuring and
following a process that will be successful in getting a strategy in place
and implementation underway.  She will be accompanying me at first in a wide
variety of risk related activities/meetings to 'get her bearings'.    The
duration of this assignment is open ended but expected to last several
months.  Please welcome her and treat her as one of our team members.
