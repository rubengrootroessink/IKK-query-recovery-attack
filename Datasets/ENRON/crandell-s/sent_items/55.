Hi there,

Thanks for the note.  It is very weird for sure.  I never thought it would happen to Enron.  One of the reasons I didn't go to a smaller shop, even though I was offered more money, was because I didn't want to deal with crap like this.  Lo and behold.  Life is strange.  Anyway, at this point it looks like Dynegy is the suitor for the big E.  I think it will happen.  The question will become, where are we going to be located?  Fortunately, I only have about 8 months left in my contract, so I won't have to put up with too much crap for too long.  We'll see.

Italy is awesome.  Really really is.  I realize it more and more since I came back.  Tuscany is so cool.  If you go there, go to San Quirico, Montecino and Montepulciano.  Very cool little towns and good wine.  Florence is very cool as well.  I may go back there for a month or so this June if things aren't to wacky.  Have a good time there; I'm envious.

Sounds like you are doing better.  Also sounds like work is fun and challenging.  So do you think you are going to stay there for a while?  Do you miss the West?  I don't think I'll live east of the Rockies, but you never know.

Well, it looks like this year might be as interesting as last.  I keep thinking things will mellow out a little, but things keep getting more and more strange.

It was great to hear from you and take care of yourself!

Sean

Hi Seaner,
How are things going? I hope your okay over there on the west coast. I can
sympathize with what your going through, I've been involved with a company
that everyone's watching, questioning, rethinking credit and exposure, and
on top of that friends and family calling to see how you are and assuming
the worst.  No matter where you go you get faced with the same questions,
you have to tell the same story over and over.  I remember from your last
email you had just renegotiated a deal with them, I hope that's going to
turn out the way you want and your not stuck. If there's anything that I can
do please let me know. 

Did I tell you, after hearing about your amazing trip through Europe I've
decided to follow suit. I'm trying to plan a trip to Italy for a week or so
in the next couple of months. I recall you said that that was one of your
favorite places to visit. I get excited jut thinking about it, I watched
'the talented mr ripley' and 'malena'(sub titles) again over the weekend to
get a feel for the place(most recent movies with an italian theme).
Otherwise same old stuff over here, I'm starting to work on some pipeline
and storage deals which are very interesting, modeling the optionality
(especially for interruptible storage) of the products can be very tricky
but the intrinsic value is pretty substantial if you can come up with the
right strategy. Any ways I was thinking about you and thought I'd drop a
line.  Take care, and please let me know if you need anything.
