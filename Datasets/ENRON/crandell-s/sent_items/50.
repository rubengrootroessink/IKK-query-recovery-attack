Fran,

We had a problem with the PGE loss return on that day; I thought we fixed it.  Anyway, I put in a crossdesk (deal 875570).  Thanks.

Diana and Sean:

We are not flat between LTNW and STNW for 11/15 (last Thursday) in Mid-Columbia:

Peak 3MW/hr => total 48 MWhs (LTNW short and STNW long)
OffPeak 1MW/hr => total 8MWhs (LTNW short and STNW long)

Since these volumes are relatively minimal, do you want me to go ahead and put in an interdesk swap between LTNW and STNW to flat you out at the curve price for 11/15 as of 11/14?

Let me know.  Thanks,

Fran
