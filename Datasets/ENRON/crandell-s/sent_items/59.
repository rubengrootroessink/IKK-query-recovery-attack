I believe Stewart is out both Wednesday and Thursday. I would like to meet with you and Diana anyway, so lets meet at noon on Wednesday. Can I take you to lunch?

Diana & Sean,

I understand your trying to set a customer meeting with Grant and Chelan and Douglas. I would be happy to assist in any way I can. Also, I would like to sit down and talk with you about these and other Northwest consumer owned utilities. Will you please take a look at your schedules and let me know a convenient time. 

Jeff
