Kevin,

One more thing.  We'd like to get some more spreads going.  Specifically the PV/MC, the NP/SP, and the PV/SP.  I realize the PV/SP might be a problem from a legal standpoint because of contract language, but I would like to get the others going.  Can you give me a call some time today?

Thanks.
