Audrey,

The other person I was talking about is Diana Scholtes.  She and I have been working together for 5 years.  She has experience in the WSCC cash markets, and has substantial middle-marketing skills and contacts in the industry.  Her email is diana.scholtes@enron.com.  Her number is 503-464-3807.

Thanks, 
Sean
