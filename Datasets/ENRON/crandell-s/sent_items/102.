Sean -

All of your benefits information has been updated.  As you have continued to receive the flex dollars every paycheck but not the deductions, you may see that you have a very small paycheck on 8/15 to make up for your 6/30, 7/15 and 7/31 deductions. 

Sorry for any inconvenience that this may cause!

Amy

Yes, I will forward your message to Synhrgy b/c they never received the reversal information and need to remove the term date also.

Thanks,

Ginger

The following employee termed then didn't and finally never left the company, however the benefits were not reinstated when we reversed the termination.  Can I go in and end date all the Reoccurring Payments IT0014 to 12/31/9999?

Thank You,
