Dow Jones is interested as well.  I really think a hourly index would be very useful; price discovery, financial positions, etc.

Sean,
Bobette from "Powerdex" wants to create an hourly index out west. Do you want to take a look at this and her template and give me your feedback. Would participation in this index accomplish anything for us?
 
Let me know,
 
Bill

It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 

Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you. 
 
Thanks,
