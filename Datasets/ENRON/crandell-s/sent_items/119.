Steve,

Thanks for the dinner and chance to meet everyone Friday.  It actually was a pleasure to talk with Nancy (rare, I think for an interview situation).

I'm sorry to say I'm still in a holding pattern.  There are a couple of bits of information I still need to process, but I thought I would email you with some initial numbers.  I'd also like to confirm my understanding of Duke's compensation program.

Base Salary:  $150K-$175K/year

LTI:  100% of base salary paid out in options that vest 1/3 every year.

Performance Incentive:  2X to 6X base salary.

No contract.  Full relocation package.

This is what I recall from the interview.  If I'm wrong, I'd appreciate clarification.

Regardless of what happens, I appreciate your time and consideration.  I should be able to come to a decision next week.

Thanks,

Sean
