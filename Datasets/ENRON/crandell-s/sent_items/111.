Here are my comments

1.  I wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity.  In fact, in the Northwe=
st at least, they have actually increased liquidity.  Any decrease in liqui=
dity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things (1) uncertainty abou=
t the level of the cap and (2) when the day-ahead prices trade above the ca=
p (removing marketers as sellers).

I would propose the following cap timelines.  First of all, I think it's im=
portant that FERC realize the "spot" market really is two separate markets,=
 what we call the "day-ahead" cash markets, and "day-of" real-time markets.=
  The 24-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timeline=
s and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and disp=
atch of power plants.  For example, day-ahead cash typically trades from 6:=
00 am to approximately 7:00 am for next day deliveries.  However, on Thursd=
ays the WSCC OTC market trades for Friday and Saturday deliveries, and on F=
ridays, we trade for Sunday and Monday (all of this can be adjusted for var=
ious reasons, but this is the typical schedule).  If we held to the 24-hour=
 spot cap literally, then Tuesday thru Friday the cap would apply to the da=
y-ahead market, but would not apply to Saturday and Monday.  This obviously=
 cannot be an intended consequence.  I recommend the cap timeline be consis=
tent with the day-ahead WSCC OTC trading timelines.

In addition, there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the=
 day-ahead market.  What if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures=
 and it is assured that real-time markets will be trading above the 85% thr=
eshold?  Assume that stage I, II or even III is a certainty.  It seems prud=
ent that a higher day-ahead price cap be established (still consistent with=
 FERC's guidelines).  Why?  Because you would want units prescheduled to ha=
ve high reserve margins going into real-time, rather than scrambling to dis=
patch units real-time.  It seems like it would be prudent for some independ=
ent board to set the day-ahead price cap equal to either the 85% or Stage I=
 limit prior to trading time.  This board would have to have regional repre=
sentatives in order to be truly effective.  Establishing the cap does not h=
ave to be cumbersome or time consuming, in fact, it should be fairly easy.

The cap governing real-time transactions is clear.  However, what isn't cle=
ar is what happens when the new Stage I cap is actually lower than the exis=
ting 85% of stage I cap.  For example, during the first couple of days in J=
uly the real-time cap was operating under the 85% of Stage 1 criteria, appr=
oximately $92.  The ISO hit a Stage I and Stage II and the price actually f=
ell to the $70s.  This created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen=
.  As a result supply was apparently affected in California and the Southwe=
st for a few hours across the peak.  It seems odd that prices should fall r=
eal-time as reserve margins decrease.  One could argue this is a good reaso=
n why caps should be tied to daily gas prices, but assuming that isn't an o=
ption, I propose something like this:  The DAY BEFORE (around 2200) the CAI=
SO, or preferably an independent body, would determine the real-time non-St=
age cap as well as a Stage minimum.  While in a stage I, II, or III the hou=
rly price would be the HIGHER of the non-stage price cap OR the recalculate=
d Stage price.  If the Stage I price turned out lower, then the non-stage p=
rice would be used for that hour, but the recalculated Stage I cap (and cor=
responding 85% price) would apply for the NEXT operating day, and for day-a=
head cash trading for the next trade day.  This provides information before=
 the trading period (enhancing liquidity) and eliminates strange price move=
ments during real-time.  It also fits the FERC price cap paradigm.

2.  Marketer prices.  I think there is a clear bias against marketers in th=
e order.  But given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketer=
s, there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recov=
er costs that are easily demonstrable.  First would be losses at a tie into=
 California.  If we sell at the cap and incurr losses, then we can't sell a=
t the cap.  Second would be the 10% credit premium.  Credit issues apply wh=
ether you're a marketer or generator.  Third would be call options.  It see=
ms if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option=
, that a party should be able to exercise and sell.  I'm not sure what the =
difference between a peaking plant and a call option is.

All:

Please review the attached rough arguments on what the FERC must do to fix =
it's current WSCC wide price mitigation mechanism.

Enron's (or its trade associations') filing(s) will attack bigger issues su=
ch as whether there should be price controls at all and whether the CAISO n=
eeds to be audited.  However, assuming we are stuck with a cap, I want to p=
rovide FERC with comments that at least allows marketers to stay in busines=
s.  The comments in the attached document are designed to address these "nu=
ts and bolts" issues.  Formal comments are due next week but I need input f=
rom commercial folks like you by WEDNESDAY of this week.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes
