Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

The language is below.  Also, Savita wanted to conference call you this aft=

Kevin,

Could you e-mail me the contract language we currently have for the Mid-C p=
hysical product so I can work with it?  (I don't have an electronic copy).

Thanks

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=
t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
t language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.
