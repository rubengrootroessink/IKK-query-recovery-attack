Wow!  A long time.  I was out June 5 and came back on July 2.  I thought it was 3 weeks, but it was more.

Sean -

Can you please confirm that dates that you took vacation so that I can have payroll update the specific days?

I thought you started vacation on 6/4 and returned on 7/2, but I am not positive.

Thanks!
Amy
