Let's talk about the RTO meetings when we get more information from FERC.  If the entire week is only going to be a panel format, I don't think it will be a very good use of Tim's or Sean's time.  In a panel setting, only the panelists are permitted to speak, and the audience can listen only -- participation from the audience is usually not allowed.  
 
Once we get more information from FERC and find out the exact format, we can then make final plans.  
 
Sarah

Here's the notice on RTO Week.  No real details--they say they are forthcoming.
 
Note that Tim Belden and/or Sean Crandall from the West Desk are planning on attending part or all of the week.
