Bruce,

I haven't had an opportunity to call you directly yet, so I thought I would e-mail you first and sort of lay out the circumstances.

I've been a short-term trader with Enron for about 4 years -- I run our short-term Northwest book.  Prior to that, I cash traded for Portland General for a couple of years.  My contract with Enron is up July 31, and I have a 3-month non-compete obligation.  Theoretically, the earliest I could leave Enron would be May 31, so the earliest I could start with another shop would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  I'm talking to a couple of other outfits and I basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there.  I talked with Matt, and he mentioned you, so I thought it might be a good idea to get in touch.  If you are interested in pursuing anything further, please e-mail me and we'll arrange a time we can talk over the phone.

Thanks,

Sean
