I'm not sure if my first response got through.  The person to talk to about this, this long of a term, is Mike Swerzbin.  If you have question concerning the short-term, let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Sean, thought you may have forgotten my name (I'm horrible w/ names, so I wouldn't blame you) in regards to the midC-Montana basis and wheeling from now to 2024.  I don't mean to pester.  Take care,
