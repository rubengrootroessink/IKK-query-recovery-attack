Hey Bruce,

Thanks for the response.  I think I would like to see Cinergy's bid.  I sort of have to weigh many nonfinancial issues as well.  It would be nice to know where we are at.  If you could provide me a rough number, that would be helpful.

Thanks,

Sean

We have not reached an answer on the head trader.  McCabe is on vacation
this week.  I would say we are not prepared to match any of your offers.
I'm not sure it makes sense to show you an offer that is lower than your
other deal.  If you still interested let me know.  Thanks for coming to see
us.  We sure would love to have you on the team.

Hey Bruce,

   Hope you had a good vacation.  I was just touching base to see where
   we're at.  I leave for Europe on June 5 and I'll be gone until July 2.
   My last day in the office here will be either Thursday or Friday of this
   week.  Some other places you can contact me are:

   cell:  503-805-2557

   private e-mail:  kwampa01@yahoo.com

   Thanks,

   Sean
