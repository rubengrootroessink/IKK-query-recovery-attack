Thanks Steve.  I think we might be interested in pursuing something.  It's kind of hectic right now, so let me give you a call when things settle down a little bit.  Probably next week.  Talk with you later.

Sean:  I must have a bad e-mail address for you, but I think this one might be right now.  See original message below.

Sean:

Thanks for the dinner the other night.  I enjoyed meeting with you and Deanna and getting caught up on how things are going.  It was also good to hear that both of you are optimistic about the outlook with UBS.  I wanted to respond to your offer to meet with Mr. Belden to discuss potential opportunities within your origination group.  Having considered the opportunities relative to the outlook for my consulting business, I am not interested in pursuing the UBS opportunity at this time.  The concept of running the origination from Seattle intrigued me initially, but I cannot personally advocate a geographically segregated origination operation as a viable business solution.  

I would be interested in a follow up meeting with you and Tim, but I think my intent would be framed from exploring potential opportunities to provide consulting services to UBS rather than exploring employment opportunities.  I understand that this may not fit with your needs to prioritize your own time and efforts right now, but if you would like to get together, please let me know.

Also - I don't have Deanna's e-mail address.  If you could forward this on to her, I would appreciate it.  Thanks again for the dinner last week.
