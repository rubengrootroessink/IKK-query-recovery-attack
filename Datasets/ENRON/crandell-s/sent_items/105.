Sean -

I have updated Cara's manager back to you - your login ID for PEP is 90010252.  If you have forgotten your password, just go to the login screen, hit forgot password and it will prompt you for your ID - it will send you an e-mail immediately with your new password.

Let me know if you have any questions or need assistance!
Amy
