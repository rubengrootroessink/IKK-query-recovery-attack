Steve,

I've been talking with James over the last couple of weeks about possible opportunities at Duke.  Just to give you a quick look at my background, I've been running Enron's short-term Northwest desk for about 4 years.  Prior to that, I performed more or less the same function with PGE for a couple of years.  My contract with Enron is up July 31.  I'm under a 3-month noncompete obligation after I leave Enron.  Theoretically, my last day with Enron could be May 31, so the first day I'd be able to start somewhere else would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  My goal is to have 3-4 options to consider by May 31.  I'll be in Salt Lake on May 4, so if you are interested in getting together to talk about any opportunities Duke might have, please let me know.

Thanks,

Sean
