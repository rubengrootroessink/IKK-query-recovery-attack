I have done the following trades to wrap up the Enron Northwest position for the balance of February.

1.  Bought 200 MW Onpeak at the Mid-C from AEP for $20 (Expense of $1,024,000).
2.  Bought 118 MW Onpeak at the Mid-C from Avista for $20 (Expense of $604,160)
3.  Bought 132 MW Offpeak at the Mid-C from Avista for $18.75 (Expense of $495,000)
4.  Bought 200 MW Offpeak of the MC/COB spread from AEP for $0.50 (Expense of $20,000)
5.  Sold 125 MW Onpeak of the COB/MC spread to AEP for $1.0 (Revenue of $32,000)

So we need to send $1,012,000 to AEP and $1,099,160 to Avista (total of $2,111,160).
