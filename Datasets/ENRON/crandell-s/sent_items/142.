Kevin,

Here are the examples we talked about

Assumptions:

1.  EOL and Broker market:  COB $30 @ $40.
2.  We put out a COB/MC market $4 at $7.
3.  In EOL, Product 1 = COB and Product 2 = MC.

Here's what will happen in the broker market:

(A) If someone hits my bid of $4 in the broker market I will BUY COB at something like $35, and I will SELL Mid-C at $31.
(B) If someone lifts my offer of $7 in the broker market I will SELL COB at something like $35, and I will BUY Mid-C at $28.

If you take the same assumptions and show this market on EOL, here's my understanding of what will happen:

(C) If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL COB at $35, and I will BUY MC at $39 (compare this with (A))
(D) If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY COB at $35, and I will SELL MC at $42 (compare this with (B)).

Clearly this doesn't work.

One possible solution, I think, is to examine what happens if you put out a COB/MC product on EOL, but switch the products such that Product 1 = MC and Product 2 = COB, and assume we put the underlying Product 1 market out as MC $30 @ $40.

(E)  If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL MC at $35, and I will BUY COB at $39 (achieves same result as (A), which is what we want).
(F)  If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY MC at $35, and I will SELL COB at $42 (achieves the same result as (B), which is what we want).

I realize (E) and (F) don't jive with our long contract description, but conceptually it works.

If you have any questions, let me know.
