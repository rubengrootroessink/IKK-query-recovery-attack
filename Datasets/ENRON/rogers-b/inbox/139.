QUOTE OF THE WEEK
---------------------
"When exactly will the economy and the stock market rebound?
Like any Fool, I haven't got a crystal ball. I just continue
to keep a focus on the companies I own, making sure that
their competitive advantages and cash-flow generating powers
are not diminished for the long haul. Those companies in a
solid position may take a hit during this economic storm we
are experiencing, but they are also set to shine brilliantly
in the years ahead when the economy gets back on track like
it inevitably will...eventually."

Paul Larson, "Third-Quarter Blues" -- Full Story:

WEEKEND WARRIOR
---------------------
GET STARTED
We get a lot of email at The Motley Fool from people asking us
where to start: high-tech stocks, value stocks, bonds, mutual
funds, index funds? Also, what are the right formulas to use?
Should investors focus on price-to-earnings ratios, return on
equity, or return on invested capital? There's a lot to choose
from, so what's the right investment vehicle and which tools
should you use?

Forget all of it.

If you're new to investing and want to learn more, ignore the
strategies and tools mentioned above, just for a while, and get
centered. What this means is that you have to find out what kind
of investing appeals to you. Where's your center of gravity?

The best way to find your investing center in a hurry is by
hearing the stories of those who have already walked that road.

Richard McCaffery shares his list of the best investment books
around.

One Up on Wall Street, Peter Lynch

The Warren Buffett Portfolio, Robert Hagstrom

A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Burton Malkiel

Stocks for the Long Run, Jeremy Siegel

Common Stocks, Uncommon Profits, Philip Fisher

Common Sense on Mutual Funds, John Bogle
