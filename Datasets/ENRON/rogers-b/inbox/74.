TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

MICRON'S MISERABLE QUARTER
Micron Technology (NYSE: MU), one of the world's top producers
of memory chips, probably wishes it could forget the past
several months. After the bell yesterday, the company reported a
fourth-quarter loss of $576 million, or $0.96 a share. Revenue
plummeted 79% year-over-year to $480 million. Full-year numbers
for fiscal 2001 show a loss of $0.88 a share on revenue of $3.9
billion.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Second-quarter earnings were a bit bubblier for Bed Bath &
Beyond (Nasdaq: BBBY). Not only did the home products retailer
increase revenue by 21% from the same period last year, it also
saw same-store sales rise by 4.8% and maintained its earlier
guidance for the second half of the year.

There's nothing fowl about Tyson Foods' (NYSE: TSN) fourth
quarter. The king o' chicken raised its estimates for the
quarter to $0.18 to $0.22 a share, which is significantly higher
than its previous guidance of $0.08 to $0.12.

AES Corporation (NYSE: AES), one of the world's top power
producers, powered down its full-year earnings estimates in a
big way. Blaming a weakening Brazilian Real, a decline in
electricity prices in England, and the economy, the
Virginia-based company now expects to earn $1.25-$1.45 per share
for all of 2001. That's some 20%-30% below estimates.

Textron (NYSE: TXT) this morning reduced its outlook for the
second half of the year and said it would have to cut 2,500 more
jobs and take large restructuring charges. The maker of Bell
helicopters, Cessna planes, and industrial products blamed the
softening economy and the September 11 tragedy for many of its
woes.

Expect Vans (Nasdaq: VANS) to pull to the side of the road for
the next quarter. Although the "extreme sports" apparel retailer
reported record first-quarter sales and earnings after the bell
yesterday, it said its second quarter would fall short of
expectations. CEO Gary Schoenfeld blamed a sharp slowdown caused
by the September 11 terrorist attacks.

And on this day in 1774, Jonathan Chapman was born in
Leominister, Massachusetts. This apple farmer pioneered the
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) method of giving away the product in
order to gain marketshare. Chapman was better known as Johnny Appleseed.

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

TRUST
"...I bumped into an old friend so often ignored in business --
Trust. The value -- the real, economic value -- of trust is almost always
understated. I value it above all else when making long-term
economic commitments to businesses whose economics and
competitive advantages I am otherwise totally comfortable with."
