I am sending this a week early but just in case the baby decides to come early ... I am better off being prepared!

I will be out on Maternity Leave starting Tuesday, October 23, 2001.  I will return on January 16, 2002.  In my absence, please call:

Customer Service @ 1-800-47-Boise for any questions regarding Invoices, Deliveries, and Product Information.  If Customer Service is unable to help you, they will contact a local representative to assist you.

  am sorry if I was unable to come see you before I left ... Have a Super rest of the 2001 Year ...
