EXPO
The New York City Marathon Expo is moving from its previously announced
location at Pier 94 because the City of New York is using this space in
connection with the World Trade Center disaster recovery effort. The new
Expo location has yet to be determined. Please stay tuned to
www.nycmarathon.org for an announcement of the new location.

PONTIAC COMEBACK RUNNER OF THE YEAR
This year Pontiac and New York Road Runners present the Comeback Runner of
the Year Award. This annual award honors two runners, one elite and one
recreational, who have come back from adversity to compete in the 2001 New
York City Marathon.

In addition to presenting the winner a beautiful trophy produced by Tiffany
& Co., Pontiac will donate $1,000 in the winners' names to the Twin Towers
Fund.

Your entry should explain, in 100 words or less, the challenge you
overcame. Please include your daytime phone number with your entry.

All entries must be received by October 9, 2001.

Entries can be submitted via the New York City Marathon web site at
www.nycmarathon.org, or via mail to Comeback Runner of the Year, c/o NYRR -
Michelle Doti, 9 East 89th Street, New York, NY 10128.

AND ONE FINAL MESSAGE
As always, the safety of the participants, spectators, staff, and
volunteers in the New York City Marathon is of paramount concern to both
the City of New York and New York Road Runners. We cannot publicize the
details of the security effort, which is provided by local, state, and
federal agencies. In light of the recent terrorist attacks, it will be even
more encompassing than usual.
