[IMAGE]  [IMAGE] [IMAGE] The B-School Decision:  Reader Reaction [IMAGE] [I=
MAGE] [IMAGE]  Our article on the decision whether or not to go to business=
 school hit home for many Weekly Career Update readers.  Here's what some o=
f you had to say.   To see the original article, The B-School Decision, go =
here.    ...  I just wanted to point out that there are a few aspects of se=
eking an  MBA that you neglected to mention in your "B-School Decision" art=
icle.   I am a 15 year IT veteran who returned to school to obtain an MBA i=
n  Technology Management from The University of Phoenix Online in 1997.  I =
took a one year break for the birth of each of my two dughters, but am  fin=
ally about to finish. I've been around long enough to know that an  MBA is =
not an instant ticket to fame and fortune, but I also know that  an MBA can=
 pay off, even if you aren't planning to look for a new job  as soon as you=
 graduate.     First, employers are often highly supportive of employees wh=
o wish to  return to school to obtain advanced degrees.  Many employers wil=
l pay  anywhere from half of tuition up to the entire amount of the degree,=
  plus books and lab fees.  With incentives like that, the FIRST place  you=
 should look in financing a degree is with your current employer.   Some em=
ployers seek a contractual obligation that you will stay with  them after y=
ou graduate, but even with this clause, if you are set on  leaving you shou=
ld still be able to leverage a better salary or  position for the stay.  An=
other option would be to negotiate with your  prospective employer to pay p=
art of the obligation to your past  employer.  It's a long shot, but worth =
a try.    Another thing you neglected to mention is that many schools now h=
ave  programs that are geared to adult, full-time employees.  I chose the  =
University of Pheonix specifically for this reason.  Class in the  evening =
or, better yet, online, allow the student to return to school  with a minim=
al impact on work.  Sure, an online degree is not an MBA  from Harvard (yet=
), but an MBA from a school like UOPHX is still an MBA and, unlike the smal=
l college down the street, UOPHX is pumping out  enough MBA graduates on a =
national level to at least be recognized by  employers.     And lastly, whe=
n considering whether to obtain an MBA, you have to  consider the cost of N=
OT pursueing one.  As you get older, credentials  are not as important as e=
xperience, but most employers have bought into the idea that learning is a =
life-long activity and they look favorably  on anyone who demonstrates that=
 they want to keep learning, regardless  of their age or position.  And the=
 percentage of employees who are  seeking some kind of certification or deg=
ree is increasing all the  time. The truth is, if you are not making some e=
ffort to continue your  education in some form, chances are you are at a di=
sadvantage to those  who are when promotion time comes.     ...   I thought=
 that the MBA article made a good point: don't go back to school simply to =
"hide out".    The article however failed higher education in a major way b=
y mostly presenting a short term cost benefit analysis. The most important =
benefit of a graduate level education is the development of the cognitive a=
bilities of the student. This accomplishment is opens then mind, last a lif=
e time, and can positively affect many generations within the graduate's fa=
mily.    While financial factors are reality and should be considered caref=
ully, they should not be the primary deciding factor when determining wheth=
er or not to obtain a graduate degree. I hope that you did not discourage t=
oo many people with your article.   ...  I enjoyed your article on making t=
he B school decision.  I was one that decided not to do it several years ag=
o.  Mainly because I did not see where the curriculum really prepared you f=
or practicing management in the real world.  (My undergraduate degree was i=
n Business Administration).   More importantly, proven experience almost al=
ways out weighs the MBA.  I consistently volunteered for projects at work a=
nd always tried to continuously improve myself and the organization.  This =
led to me becoming a Vice President by age 34.   My recommendation is if yo=
u need the knowledge of how businesses work, look into an MBA but realize p=
racticing management is much more powerful than studying it.  An MBA will n=
ot teach taking risk, overcoming adversity, resiliency and making decisions=
 that has powerful impacts on people.  Those can only be learned through th=
e school of hard knocks.   Regards, Paul    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]          [IMAG=
