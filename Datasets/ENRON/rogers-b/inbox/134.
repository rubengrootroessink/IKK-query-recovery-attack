GATEWAY GUIDES LOWER
The bad news just keeps on coming for Gateway (NYSE: GTW). After
the market closed yesterday, the troubled computer maker warned
investors that it would lose $0.14 to $0.17 a share in the third
quarter, excluding special charges. It had previously expected
to lose only $0.04 a share.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In a moving statement yesterday, eSpeed (Nasdaq: ESPD) chairman
and CEO Howard Lutnick announced his firm's shares will resume
trading today. eSpeed is the electronic brokerage subsidiary of
Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost more than 730 employees when the
World Trade Center was attacked. "eSpeed will never forget,
never settle, and never give up," said Lutnick. "It is our
promise that this company will stand as a testament to those we
have lost and a badge of honor to those who have survived."

Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) stock sweetened up more than 10% in
after-hours trading after the company said it's sticking with
its fiscal 2001 target of $0.46 a share. The world's top coffee
retailer saw same-store sales for the five weeks ended Sept. 30
increase 1% despite the fact all its shops in North America were
closed early on Sept. 11. Starbucks Chairman and Chief Global
Strategist Howard Schultz even said the current economic
conditions "provide a favorable environment to aggressively
pursue our global expansion strategy."

Another company reaffirming its quarterly target was Tommy
Hilfiger (NYSE: TOM). The trendy clothing retailer said its
fiscal second quarter should meet expectations, but "in light of
continuing economic weakness and the impact on consumer
confidence" caused by the terrorist attacks, the company is
lowering its full-year EPS target. CEO Joel Horowitz said he's
particularly concerned about the holiday season.

Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) said early this morning that
third-quarter sales would come in around $766 million, a decline
of 22% from the second quarter. The chip maker expected only a
15% sequential decline. Chief executive W.J. Sanders III said
average selling prices for PC processors fell sharply in the
face of "very aggressive competition," but believes his company
maintained, or even gained, market share.

Grocery giants Safeway (NYSE: SWY) and Albertson's (NYSE: ABS)
are teaming up in a lawsuit against the United Food and
Commercial Workers labor union. The two companies say the UFCS
"engaged in blatant voting irregularities'' in a vote to approve
a new labor contract. According to the lawsuit, some union
locals are attempting to kill the contract offer by various
means, including denying some employees the chance to vote and
allowing others to vote twice.

Standard & Poor's said yesterday that Teco Energy (NYSE: TE)
will be added to the S&P 500 Index next week. Teco will replace
Global Crossing (NYSE: GX), which is getting the boot due to
"lack of representation." Global is trading at just over $1 a
share.

With an upper deck shot in the 9th inning in Houston, San
Francisco outfielder Barry Bonds hit his 70th home run of the
year last night, tying Mark McGwire's single-season record.
Bonds will have a chance to break the record at home now, as the
Giants close out the season with a three-game series against
arch-rival Los Angeles, beginning tonight.

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

MORNINGSTAR ON QCOM
"The report offers one criticism of QCOM which I thought did
make sense, and which I haven't seen any discussion of on this
board, and that has to do with the accounting framework which
QCOM prefers to report trends in earnings and expenses. In
particular, the frequency and regularity of one-time charges
taken struck me as suspect. Since QCOM excludes these charges
from its customary pro-forma income statements, the growth in
earnings gets overstated, and the growth in expenses and related
costs understated. In some cases, the differences between the
pro-forma and GAAP statements for the same quarter are
exceptionally large."
