TOP STORY

FEDERATED'S SEPTEMBER CHILL
Federated Department Stores (NYSE: FD), operator of such chains
as Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Lazarus, said September business
has dropped off dramatically since the terrorist attacks that
targeted New York and Washington on the 11th.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Internet infrastructure firm VeriSign (Nasdaq: VRSN) agreed to
buy wireless communications network services company Illuminet
(Nasdaq: ILUM) in a stock deal valued at approximately $1.2
billion based on Friday's closing prices.

Aircraft maker Boeing (NYSE: BA) agreed to pay $92.5 million to
settle a class action stockholder lawsuit filed against the
company in 1997. Stockholders alleged that the company withheld
information about production problems, hurting the company's
share price. Boeing recently announced broad job cuts.

A story in today's Los Angeles Times cites unnamed sources as
saying file-swapping maverick Napster may soon ink a deal with
an agency that represents many leading recording companies,
which may free up the company to launch a fee-based music
download service. While the company already has deals with some
labels, they won't take effect until the new service debuts.

American Trans Air parent company AmTran (Nasdaq: AMTR) said
Citigroup's (NYSE: C) Citicorp and Salomon Smith Barney withdrew
their commitment to finance the company's planned going-private
transaction. AmTran is currently evaluating its options but is
not sure the deal will go through. Paul Larson covered the
situation facing several airline operators last week.

Internet software vendor Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL) extended its
stock buyback plan through June 30, 2002, and said $400 million
was available for use. Many companies have restarted or extended
their buyback plans following last week's poor market
performance.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=501898

Vacation rental property management company ResortQuest (NYSE:
RZT) said it would cut 100 jobs and institute pay and hiring
freezes as it looks to reduce overhead during what is expected
to be a difficult time for travel companies. Boca Resorts (NYSE:
RST), meanwhile, lowered its guidance for the second half of the
year. Cruise lines were among the companies reporting bad news
last week.

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

BUFFETT SAYS...
"[Bill Mann] Buy and Hold is only defenseless when it is applied
without any view of business realities. Buy and Hold cannot
protect one from bad buy decisions, which JDS Unipahse at $150
undoubtedly was, as Lucent at nearly any price was. That Buffett
makes better buy decisions than most is irrefutable."
