The New York City Marathon Expo and Gift Shop opens on Wednesday, October
31! Come the first day and enjoy shorter lines, less crowding, the best
selection of official merchandise, AND some special offers, starting with:
$20 OFF ANY PURCHASE OVER $100 if you bring this e-mail.* (What can you
buy? Official marathon merchandise, from hats to socks and everything in
between.)

We're also pleased to offer a special membership deal: If you become a

In addition to wine, you'll be treated to samples of a delicious and

celebration!
