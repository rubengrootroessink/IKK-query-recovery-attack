Hey Bro,

Yeah, I got the email from a couple of sources.  Good looking kid.  Yes, we
are getting old but I still like to get drunk and act like an idiot.  I
guess we will never grow out of that.  Last week was bitch but I think it
put everybody back into reality.  I think there will be some good out of
this.  Even though the economy will go into recession, people aren't caring
about money some much anymore.  The recession won't bring people down as
they realize their own mortality.  The recession will end quickly as soon
as Americans can get a sense of security again.  I am just going to sit
tight on my loser stocks.  There will be a huge rally in about a year.
This is going to instill a greater feeling of freedom and capitalism in the
young generation (God I am old for saying that) that we don't have.

Weird things are happenning in DC.   They must have credible evidence of
another possible attack this Saturday.  A battallion of US Army troops are
on there way up to DC from Ft. Bragg, NC.  They are only saying it is for
"added security".  I plan on staying home Saturday and working on my house.
Keep an eye out for your self Saturday.

later
