Dear Member,

It has been more than a month since the tragic events of
September 11.  And I want to express my personal
appreciation to the many thousands of readers from around
the world who have sent in words of sympathy to the people
of this country and in particular of New York City.  The
New York Times on the Web has kept open the area reserved
for these messages, and you are free to read them on our
site.

The unfolding developments on the military and public
health areas are covered in great depth by the Times'
staff of reporters and editors. To make it easier to catch
up on the past six weeks of coverage, we have created a
special section on the Web called "A Nation Challenged."
This includes a day-by-day rundown of events as well as an
archive of past coverage.

With so many correspondents involved in coverage of this
crisis, we felt it might illuminate some of the background
to these stories to have conversations with many of them.
You can listen to conversations with such veteran
correspondents as R.W. Apple, John F. Burns, David Sanger,
Judith Miller, and many others.

In a further effort to provide some unusual background to
the situation, Vincent Laforet, a New York Times staff
photographer, gives a first person account of being among
the refugees in Pakistan in "Photographer's Journal," a personal
multimedia essay.   His photos explore refugees piecing
together a Koran, spending time in an opium den and living
in a Pakistani school. Vincent accompanies the essay with
an audio description.

I have to confess to being a fervent New York Yankees fan,
going back to my childhood as a boy in the Bronx. Many New
Yorkers got a tremendous lift by the Yankees' comeback
against a very strong Oakland Athletics team. By the time
you read this you may know whether the Yankees won or lost
against the Seattle Mariners in the championship series
leading up to the World Series.
