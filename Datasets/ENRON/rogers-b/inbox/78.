Dear Market Participants,

Software changes originally scheduled for September 25, 2001 have been
delayed.  Quality Assurance testing discovered problems which need to be
repaired and retested.

The deployment of BEA's WebLogic application server will be delayed until
October 16, 2001. This server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to
provide bidding and scheduling functions.  It will replace the current
NetDynamics product and will be a more robust and reliable development
platform for future enhancements.

New data postings will be available on the web to provide real-time
internal
transmission limits and flows.  Transmission line scheduled and actual
outages
will also be posted.  These postings are a continuation of the data
requests
made by the Business Issues Committee (BIC) in September 2000.


If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
