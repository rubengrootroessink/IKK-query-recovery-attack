We're on to play on Sunday at 4:30 at River Oaks Country Club.  We're going to meet at Rogers' house at 4:20.  His address is 3011 Ella Lee and his home phone is 713-523-5704.  Directions:

Going north on Kirby, Ella Lee is the 3rd or 4th street north of Westheimer.  Go left (west) on Ella Lee off of Kirby.  His house is about 1/2 a block down on the left (old, red brick house).

See you Sunday.
