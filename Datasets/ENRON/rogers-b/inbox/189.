TOP STORY

KIMBERLY-CLARK OFF THE MARK
Grab a Kleenex, folks. Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) announced that
it would be missing its quarterly mark. While its preliminary
third-quarter take has revenue climbing by 5% over last year, it
now expects operating earnings per share to come in at just
$0.80 a share. That's off last year's $0.84 a share showing and
a nickel below Wall Street's estimates.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to find out what The Rock is cooking this weekend,
you'll need more than DirecTV. After sparring over how to split
up pay-per-view revenue since their contract expired earlier
this year, World Wrestling Federation (NYSE: WWF) and the
Hughes' (NYSE: GMH) owned DirecTV have decided to part ways.
Starting with Sunday night's No Mercy presentation, the
wrestling performance will not be made available to DirecTV
subscribers.

In a New York minute, Central Parking's (NYSE: CPC) earnings
outlook can change. The parking lot operator, which has been an
aggressive consolidator in its fragmented sector, has felt the
pinch of empty parking spaces since last month's terrorist
attacks. The company, which oversees 1.5 million parking spaces
worldwide, is looking at fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per
share to come in between a dime and $0.14. The analysts --
following the company as closely as a mall driver behind someone
heading out of the stores -- were expecting the September
quarter results to come in closer to $0.21 a share.

When you're a semiconductor production equipment maker, the
bright side is often a paler shade of gray. Novellus Systerms
(NVLS) announced quarterly bookings of just $124 million, well
below its summer forecasts of $160 million, yet still managed to
meet analyst targets of $0.24 in earnings per share. While
proclaiming weakness in every region and thinner gross margins,
Novellus is comfortable with fourth-quarter projections given
its cost-shaving strategy. While the company has implemented
salary cuts it is one of the few tech players to have skirted
the layoff process.

One is the loneliest number, and B2B's fallen hero Commerce One
(Nasdaq: CMRC) is getting closer to that number in terms of
headcount. The e-commerce software specialist will be cutting
its payroll by 1300 employees -- 46% of its workforce. Seven
hundred of those will be laid off while another 600 will be part
of the company's attempt to spin-off some of its service
operations. With minority shareholder SAP announcing that it has
no intentions of swallowing the 80% of the company it does not
presently own, Commerce One's mounting losses are troubling for
the company as an independent.

Pro-forma profits have been cut in half but Unisys (NYSE: UIS)
marches on. The e-business solutions provider met Wall Street's
reduced $0.07 a share profit number -- a figure which was as
high as $0.18 a share just last month. Backing out currency
fluctuations, revenue came in essentially flat from year-ago
levels. Recognizing its deteriorating margin levels, the company
will be aggressively cutting costs in the current quarter. The
move will include doing away with 3,000 jobs.

MY BERKSHIRE
"I bought my first Berkshire shares a few years ago with the
money that my grandmother left me in her will. The money that
was left over paid my exam fees for the toughest Actuarial exam
you can take in England. Those Berkshire shares will NEVER be
sold. I may end up on skid row, I may end up being dragged
through the courts, who knows. But those shares will NEVER be
sold. They will have to prized from my cold dead hands. That
certificate is one of my most prized possessions."
