The New York City Marathon is coming quickly, and we've got lots of news
for you. Please read this message closely. If you have other questions, be
sure to visit http://www.nyrrc.org/nyrrc/mar01/about/faq.html.

New York City Marathon Expo
The location of the New York City Marathon Expo, where you must pick up
your race number, has changed. The expo is taking place at the Jacob Javits
Convention Center, at 11th Avenue and 34th Street in Manhattan. You and
your guests must have photo I.D. (passport or drivers license) to enter the
Javits Center. An expo shuttle bus will operate to and from locations in
Midtown Manhattan; see www.nycmarathon.org for a schedule and map.

Registration Cards
The last registration cards went out in the mail October 15. Please be
patient if you haven't received yours yet; it's on its way. If, however,
you don't receive your registration card by October 24, reply to
susana@nyrrc.org with your name and address.

If you can't make it this year
Don't worry--we understand, and we can guarantee you the chance to run next
year. Visit http://www.nyrrc.org/nyrrc/mar01/info/cancellation.html for our
cancellation policy and instructions.

Run for America
The New York City Marathon is a proud part of Run for America, a virtual
run/walk to benefit the victims and heroes of the September 11 tragedy. New
York Road Runners is working with Runners World, USA Track &  Field,
Running USA, the Road Runners Club of America, and many other races and
running clubs on this special event. For more details, and to register,
visit www.runforamerica.com.

Marathon Split Updates
We're making it easier for your fans to find you during the race. Thanks to
our wireless communication partner, Nextel, you can register up to three
people to receive updates on wireless phones, pagers, or via e-mail,
informing them exactly when you arrive at various locations: 10K, 13.1
miles, 20 miles, and the finish line. Look for more information on our Web
site after October 29, or visit the Nextel booth at the expo.

All this and more marathon information can be found at www.nycmarathon.org.
