RELIANT RESOURCES BUYING ORION POWER
Reliant Resources (NYSE: RRI) announced this morning plans to
acquire Orion Power Holdings (NYSE: ORN) for $4.7 billion in
cash and debt. For Reliant, the deal provides an opportunity to
expand its portfolio of electricity-generating plants in robust
deregulated markets, where government disruption is unlikely in
the coming months.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Network equipment maker Sonus Networks (Nasdaq: SONS) got
hammered in after-hours trading after announcing that it expects
a third-quarter pro forma net loss of $0.05 to $0.07 per share
on sales of $40 million. That's well below Wall Street's
expectations for sales and earnings of $54.4 million and $0.01
per share, respectively. Sonus will also take charges up to $466
million.

Allegiance Telecom (Nasdaq: ALGX), a competitive local-exchange
carrier, reported disappointing third-quarter results yesterday,
citing the short-term impact of the terrorist attacks on Sept.
11. The company expects revenue of $135 million, well below Wall
Street's expectation of $147.2 million. Allegiance also lowered
its 2001 revenue target 5% below its previous expectation of
$550 million, but maintained full-year earnings guidance.

Guitar Center (Nasdaq: GTRC) was playing the warning blues
yesterday when the music retailer announced that its
third-quarter sales and earnings would fall short of Wall
Street's expectations. Guitar Center expects sales between $219
million and $222 million, with earnings of $0.04 to $0.06 per
share, versus Wall Street's current expectation of $0.16 per
share. The company attributed its disappointing results to the
terrorist attacks, which hurt sales.

Enterasys Networks (NYSE: ETS), which makes network equipment
such as routers and switches, reported second-quarter pro forma
earnings of $23.1 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with
earnings of $10.2 million, or $0.05 per share, in the year-ago
quarter. Wall Street's consensus expectation called for earnings
of $0.10 per share. Revenue increased roughly 26% to $240
million compared to $190.7 million in the same period last year.

ADVENTURES WITH A MERCEDES 240D
"One thing about the Mercedes is that feeling of elegance. Just
riding around behind that hood ornament is a big boost for one's
ego. It gives me delusions of adequacy...But there is a price
for the elegance, reliability, and convenience."
