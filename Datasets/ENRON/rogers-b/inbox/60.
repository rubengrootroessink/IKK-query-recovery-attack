"Being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's just worry
and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead all
the time." -- Mark Twain, from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

LOST IN AMERICA ONLINE
All year long, leading media giant AOL Time Warner (NYSE: AOL)
had clung to its beefy annual projections that called for $40
billion in revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization) of $11 billion. While its old
media peers buckled under a soft ad market and some of its new
media peers bowed out completely, AOL Time Warner stood firm.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

While we can all use a good massage about now, here's the rub:
Most of Steiner Leisure's (Nasdaq: STNR) spa services take place
afloat on cruise ships, and vacationers are putting off their
bon voyages. Steiner is now talking down third and fourth
quarter projections. The company, which also sells its own line
of spa products and runs a few massage schools, feels it has a
good grip on its long-term fundamentals. Unfortunately, the bad
news in the near term is sure to rub Wall Street the wrong way.

Flat is where it's at. Flat panel display maker Kopin (Nasdaq:
KOPN) bucked the trend by raising its third-quarter projections.
Strong demand for its III-V and CyberDisplay imaging devices has
the company expecting a 25% sequential increase in revenue and a
loss of $0.15 to $0.17 a share. That's on the low end of analyst
estimates.

Recession-resistant and sometimes even caffeine free, soda
investors can have a Coke (NYSE: KO) and a smile this morning as
the carbonated fizz giant is on target to meet its 2001 marks.
Thanks to robust consumption in the Asia and Africa markets the
company expects volume growth to come in between 4% and 5% this
year.

Free in flight, AMR (NYSE: AMR) Chariman Donald Carty announced
that he would forgo all compensation -- including his salary --
for the rest of the year. Given the troubled state of the
airline industry in general, and AMR's American Airlines in
particular, it's more a token gesture than a way to reverse the
company's possible billion-dollar shortfall this year.

There is no easy chair in the office furniture industry. With
sales falling 25% over the past year and orders off by a third,
Herman Miller (Nasdaq: MLHR) reported earnings before charges of
$0.04 a share. While that is in line with analyst projections,
it comes after the company had to talk down earnings twice.
Originally the company was expected to report profits of $0.40 a
share -- essentially what it had earned the year before. Herman
Miller also announced that it would be letting 2,600 employees
go, which poses the question: What will the company do with all
that office furniture?

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

THE WEEKEND
"I have been reading for days now that economists are worried
about "consumer confidence", that a recession is "inevitable".
My wife and I have thought it over and have decided to decline
the invitation to the recession. We won't be attending."
