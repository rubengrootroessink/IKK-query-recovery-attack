future
Virtual Bidding development  These changes will have no noticeable effects
on
MIS performance or functionality, however, these changes will require a
short
MIS outage.  The outage will begin at approximately 11:35 on September 27,
2001
and last for 30 minutes.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.
