Yo Bro,

My brother-in-law (the wantabe day trader) has a good amount of Kinder
Morgan.  The price is down pretty low.  Is it just because of the economy?
Is this their cyclical low period?  Are they feeling some of the heat from
the Enron stock drop?  Let me know because if it is a bargain low. I want
to buy more too.  Let me know what you think.

Ciao
