The New York City Marathon will take place as scheduled on Sunday, November
4, 2001.

In the wake of the terrible events of September 11, the New York City
Marathon will highlight the diversity, energy, and resilience of New York
City as never before, said Allan Steinfeld, race director of the New York
City Marathon and president and CEO of New York Road Runners.

No course changes are planned, as the five-borough New York City Marathon
route does not go near the site of the World Trade Center disaster in lower
Manhattan.

Steinfeld added, New York Road Runners is dedicating the 2001 New York City
Marathon to the victims of the tragic events of September 11, and to the
courageous rescuers who have worked tirelessly to save lives and to rebuild
our great city and nation.

Please join New York Road Runners, our sponsors and partners, and runners
from around the world in our effort to raise $1 million for the Twin Towers
Fund, a united and coordinated effort to assist victims of the September 11
disaster and their families, and the families of the firefighters, police
officers, emergency medical technicians, and Port Authority police involved
in the rescue and recovery effort. To support this initiative, make your
donation to Twin Towers Fund and send it to:

New York Road Runners
Attn: Twin Towers Fund
9 East 89th Street
New York, NY 10128
