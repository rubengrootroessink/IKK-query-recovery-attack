Michael:
Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy 
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that 
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have 
time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you 
already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys 
lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle 
ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its 
worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't 
run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.  
Hope this helps.
Ben
