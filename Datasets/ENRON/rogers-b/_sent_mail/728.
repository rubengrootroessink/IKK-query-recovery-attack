I will have property taxes for Gleason tomorrow and I will be talking with 
Jody Pierce regarding the Fixed Operating #'s and cost numbers as well.  When 
I talked with Kevin Presto he thought that trying to use the 99 actual 
numbers and then escalting them was NOT a good idea, due to the fact that 
these are not "normal" operating assumptions.  Please give me a call if you 
have any questions.
