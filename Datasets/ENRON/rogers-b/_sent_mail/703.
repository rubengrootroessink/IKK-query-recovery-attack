Things are going well here in the States.  Work is very busy right now and i 
am actually training to  do the MS 150 Bike race.  It a race from Houston to 
Austin.  It's a 170 mile, two day ride with about 5,000 bikers.  It's on 
April 16th and 17th.  I rode this weekend only 40 miles.  Yes I am going todo 
the NYC Marathon and for you virgins, I will kick your fat asses.  Darnit, I 
wanted a pet Camel for our apartment.  Yes I got your message last week - I 
had just stepped away from my desk and just missed you.  When do you get 
back?  Sometime in the Summer.  By the summer I hope to be in the 185 range, 
currently I'm right at 200!!!  Not very good.  I have been talking with Mike 
Gioffre lately and were trying to get people together this spring or summer.  
I'll let you know when.  Gotta go, but I'll talk to you soon.
