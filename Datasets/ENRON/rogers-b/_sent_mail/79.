72 hours until G-Day.  I will be in Vegas at 7:30 on Thursday - let me know 
when you are going to arrive so we can be at the tables at our hotel.   I am 
going to get a tee time for Friday around 12 or 1.   I'll call tomorrow while 
I am glued to CNN watching the election.  Martin, make sure you vote for GW, 
your the only one whose vote is going to matter here.   The rooms are going 
to be around $100 per person.

The only planned activity is golf on Friday afternoon, the rest will be up to 
our collective wisdom.
