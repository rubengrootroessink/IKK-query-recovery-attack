Mike:
Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.  These guys mainly care about the gas 
pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to 
increase throughput.  These plants that they want on their lines are 
currently in construction or development.  Their only operational plants are 
in Colorado.  They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not 
want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as 
long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.  If you guys offered to 
buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and 
stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their 
projects to put on their lines.  Hope this helps.
Ben
