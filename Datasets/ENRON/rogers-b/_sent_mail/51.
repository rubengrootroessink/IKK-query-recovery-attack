Raymond:
I work at Enron, in our corporate development group and have been through 
many different analyst reports.  I went through your previous "The Power 
Curve" report and enjoyed it thoroughly and recently heard that the second 
version is out and wanted to get a copy.  If that's possible that would be 
great.  Thanks in advance for this request.
