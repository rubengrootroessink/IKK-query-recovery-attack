Dave:
 I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp 
Development and they would be interested in talking with us about 
contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead 
into a public offering.  We are still under several different CA's with them, 
due to our past conversation's regarding generation.  
 With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if 
Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that 
time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the 
delivery of the turbines.  
 In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation 
business, this JV would give them the perfect "exit strategy".  Also, it 
would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other 
parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate 
the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth 
story to Wall Street.
 If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as 
soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.  Thanks!  
Ben
