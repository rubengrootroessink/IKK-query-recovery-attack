Jon: 
Here is the first of six e-mails regarding the inventories of the peakers.  
Regarding, the output and heat rates on the turbines, we copied for you the 
performance tests, which should have summary information on the output and 
heat rates at the end of each of the performance tests.  Please let me know 
if you do not find them.  Thanks!
