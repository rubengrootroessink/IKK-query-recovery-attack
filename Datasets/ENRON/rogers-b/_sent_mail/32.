Ben,

As requested I have attached BPI's 2nd QTR EDR reports for your review, 
comment and record.  I do not have a "Final" or accepted 3rd QTR EDR from the 
EPA yet.  

Respectfully Mitchell

There is only one quarterly report required for Brownsville. This is the EPA 
electronic data report (EDR) which we generate from the CEMS system and 
submit electronically to the EPA. 

Mitchell - Since you are generating the 3rd quarter reports to the EPA today, 
would you please copy Ben on the submittal. Thanks.

Gus
