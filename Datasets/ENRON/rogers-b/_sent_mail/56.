Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away for 
Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5 sisters.  
M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since college - pretty 
scary.  If "W" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the 
Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get 
together.  I will work on that when the time comes.  Besides, this election 
is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with 
all this contesting.  How is everything going?  What are you guys doing for 
the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to do some skiing in Beaver 
Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all is going well and I'll be 
better next time about getting back to you.  Good to hear from you!
Ben
