I know how e-mail is suppose to work, but its been so crazy here that I 
haven't even been able to do that.  We were here last night till 10:00 and it 
looks to be the same tonight and potentially for the rest of the year.  This 
project is going to kill me.  I glad to see that you are active on the net.   
I'll keep in touch a little better. Love
Ben
