Hey Dan:
Just wanted to drop you a line.  I hadn't talked to you in quite some time 
and wanted to see how everything was going.  I had lunch today with my 
friend, Andrew Slocum, who I think you know.  He talked to his good friend 
Adam Wexslur (sp) and said things were going well with the paper.  He told me 
that everything seemed to be going great and that the paper has been out on 
print for a little while now.  It sounds great!  Please let me know how 
everything is going, because I think its awesome what your doing.  Hope to 
talk to you soon.
Ben
