Bruce:
This is an e-mail from Rochester to Oscar discussing the transaction. Thought 
it would be helpful.

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.
