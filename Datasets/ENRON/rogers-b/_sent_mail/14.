Was that your harse realities of life speech.  I thought you were aa optimist 
just like myself.  I belive I actually should get a lot of credit and not 
just contribution for this deal.  It's not often an Associate helps crate 
$200 MM of value.  Have you checked out how much snow B.C. has gotten 
recently and how much there about to get - its incredible.  This is going to 
be a great ski season.
