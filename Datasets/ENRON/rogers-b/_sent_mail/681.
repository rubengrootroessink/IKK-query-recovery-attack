Just to give you an update, I reeived an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, who is 
currently in charge of my application in the admission's office.  He wants me 
to answer a few questions to make sure I can handle the coursework.  That is 
why I wanted to meet with you and Professors' Titman and Brown, to discuss 
the coursework and to talk to you about my strengths and weaknesses.  I know 
that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance 
background, and the Business' School's team-oriented approach to learning, 
that I will excel in this type of learning environment.  I hope things work 
out and thanks again for your help.
Ben
