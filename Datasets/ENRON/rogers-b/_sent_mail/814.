I just wanted to let you know that I got out UT Business School's application 
on Thursday, so they received it on Friday.  Megan and I are thinking about 
going down to Austin some time soon to see the school and see Austin.  Megan 
has never been down there, so if you guys would be interested in going down 
to Austin with maybe Brandon and Allison, that would be alot of fun.  Let me 
know.  If you could send an e-mail or a letter to the person you know at 
Texas that would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks
Ben
