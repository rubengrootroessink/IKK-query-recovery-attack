Dr. Harris:
Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling with work and I just got back an 
hour ago.  I can try and retake the GMAT exam if this will help my overall 
application file.  I must say, due to my disability, I don't think my score 
would improve dramatically.  I can also send you a summary (or the whole 
report) on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my 
disability.  I can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues I 
work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work.  If you could let 
me know what information would help best  explain my disability, I would 
appreciate it.  Thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay.
