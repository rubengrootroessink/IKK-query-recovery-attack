Lisa:
Congrats on everything thats going on in your life!  I also wanted to 
congratulate you on getting into the NYC Marathon - I think thats great.  I 
am subjecting myself to do this again (don't ask me why) since I found out 
that I got in the other day.  Good luck and hope to hear form you soon.

Regards,
Ben
