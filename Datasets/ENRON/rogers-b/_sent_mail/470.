To All:
Here is the presentation Don and I put together for Dave's meeting with Mark 
Frevert next Thursday.  He has seen it and has signed off on it.  Don will be 
out most of the week coming back potentially Thursday and I will be getting 
back around 3:30pm on Wednesday.  If there are any last minute changes please 
leave me a message or talk to Jinsung.  Thanks and have a good weekend.
