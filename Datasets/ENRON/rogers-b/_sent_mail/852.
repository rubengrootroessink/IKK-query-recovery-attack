I will be getting out my Rice application on Tuesday the 21st, so if your 
able to complete the recommendation form before or on Tuesday I would greatly 
appreciate it.  I leave for a Christmas vacation on Wednesday and wanted to 
get it out before I left.  Thanks again for taking the time to write this 
recommendation for me.
Ben
