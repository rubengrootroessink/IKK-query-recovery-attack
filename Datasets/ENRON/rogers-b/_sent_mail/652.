My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want 
them to get lost in the mail.  We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving 
over Sat and Monday for the games.  The best thing to do is meet at a certain 
gate # or the "will call window".  I will call your Dad next week and set 
things up on a meeting place before the game.  Leave me your Dad's home 
number so I can call him next week.  These guys are going to have a great 
time that weekend.  Talk to you soon.
