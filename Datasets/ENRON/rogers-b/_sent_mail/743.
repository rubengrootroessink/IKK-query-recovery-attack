It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts.  I got some 
really good feedback from all the people I talked with.  I think that UT 
would be a good fit for what I'm trying to do afterwards - with there 
energy-finance concentration and investment fund.  Plus it would be fun 
living in Austin for a couple of years.  When your in Houston next time wh 
can grab some drinks and go to dinner.  Talk to you soon.
