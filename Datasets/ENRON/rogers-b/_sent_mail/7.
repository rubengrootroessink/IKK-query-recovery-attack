Press release looked good.  You probably haven't had a chance to talk to 
Dave.  Yesterday he was in the PRC meetings all day and today is the Enron 
board meeting, where he is giving a presentation.  I did talk to Kay, his 
assistant, and he was planning on returning your call today.  Again, congrats 
on the release.
Ben
