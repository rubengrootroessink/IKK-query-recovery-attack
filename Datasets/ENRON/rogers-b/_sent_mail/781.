Mr.Jemison:
Thanks for the fast reply.  That time sounds great.  I have an information 
session at 1:00 pm and a meeting with someone in the Admissions office at 
3:00 pm, so that works out perfectly.  I'm really looking forward to coming 
to Austin to visit the school and to visit with you.  See you on Friday the 
18th at 2:30 pm.  

Ben
