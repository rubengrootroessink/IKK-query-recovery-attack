Dad:
The industry is getting beat up a little bit, but I hope this isn't slowing 
you guys down at all.  I talked with Mike M the yesterday, he said that his 
meetings with you guys seem to go well.  I think that doing that deal would 
be quite beneficial to both companies over all strategies, regarding power, 
gas and cash flow.  Megan and I will be in NYC this weekend for a wedding.  I 
would like to talk to you pretty soon anout a couple of things.  I have 
decided to stay at Enron at least till this project is over, which will be 
early next year.  The more experience I have with another company, like Enron 
the better.  I am also going to reapply to just The Texas Business School.  
Things are going well with my communication with them this year.  I have 
already talked to one of their professors that I talked to last year and have 
gotten an e-mail from the director of the admissions program.  The both feel 
I have and are currently doing the right things to get into the school next 
year.  So things are going well so far.  I am contining with my other class 
and going to take the GMAT one more time.  
I have said a little more than I would have liked but I just wanted to give 
you the laod down of what I have been thinking.
Regards,
Ben
