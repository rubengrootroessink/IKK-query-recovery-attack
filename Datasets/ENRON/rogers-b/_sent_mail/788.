Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I 
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the 
"preliminary answer" to your question and should be treated as so. Please 
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal 
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept 
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's 
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average 
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the 
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we 
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval 
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers 
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project 
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at 
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed 
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, 
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at 
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot 
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, 
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described 
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks
Ben
