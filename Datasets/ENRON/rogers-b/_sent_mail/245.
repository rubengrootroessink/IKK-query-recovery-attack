Yes you have passed the test - Congratualations.  We have been working very 
hard on our sale and wanted to let you know that your guys came back with a 
very good bid.  We will inform you probably this afternoon or tomorrow that 
you will be making the short list.   We will probably have a short list of 
about 5-7 companies.   You guys are in the top three! I think you guys have a 
very good chance at getting these plants, which I think is an excellent 
opportunity.  Hope all is going well and your other talks are going in the 
right direction.  On a side note, from what I've heard from my parents in 
Boston, Kara seems to be doing pretty poorly.  She is clearly going through 
some very difficult times.  Talk to you soon.
Love,
Ben
