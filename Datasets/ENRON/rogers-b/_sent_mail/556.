Hey Bruce,
Oscar and I are looking to have the first 2 questions answered.  If you could 
look at these and get back with me that would be great.  I'm working on the 
3rd question now.  Thanks
Ben

Ben,

On the Wisconsin Public Service deal (WPS) please consider the following:

1.  One LM-6000 to be sited near Green Bay Wisconsin
2.  Will be configured in combined cycle mode with a HRSG
3.  100% of the output will go to an industrial customer of WPS


Key Questions

1.  What is the heat rate and Mw rating of our turbine at site conditions (20 
degrees winter and 90 degrees summer)

2.  What is the water consumption with Sprint verses water injection

3.  What is a 10 year fixed gas price at chicago starting 6/1/01 on a 
baseload volume of 10,000 mmbtu/d
