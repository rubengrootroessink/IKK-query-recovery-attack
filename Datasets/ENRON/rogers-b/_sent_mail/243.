Dale:
I will be sending you the CA's some time this morning.  I needed to wait till 
we had our conference with the investment bankers, CSFB, to know which 
companies were going to the second round.  I did not want to send you the 
CA's of companies that were not going on to the second round.  Please give me 
a call if you have any questions.
