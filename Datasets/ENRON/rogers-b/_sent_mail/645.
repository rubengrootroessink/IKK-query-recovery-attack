First of all, I am going to run the NYC Marathon and kick both of your 
asses.  Lets put a little wager on this.  I headed to the Final Four this 
weekend and for a little opening day at Cinergy Field to see Ken G. knock 
some homers.  A lot is going on with work and I'm also trying to figure out 
about grad school.  I potentially have an offer to go work at an investment 
bank in NYC (Merrill and CSFB)  Need to figure this out soon.  Those pictures 
looked great from Bahrain and those other places.  Hope all is going well and 
keep in touch.  See ya
Ben
