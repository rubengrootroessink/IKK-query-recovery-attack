Bill:
Here are the two CA's we are currently working off of.  The first one is 
Enron's latest draft and the second one is Cinergy's latest draft.  Enron 
usually does not get into stand-still agreements, but we decided to in this 
case.  We have been exchanging comments for two weeks and now we need to sit 
down and discuss these points from a commercial stand-point to get over these 
differences.  Please give me a call when you get this so we can go through 
these issues.  Thanks for your time with this issue.

Regards,
