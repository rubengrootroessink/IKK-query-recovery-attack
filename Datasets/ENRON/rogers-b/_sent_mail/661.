Hey!  How was DC?  Did JV get to meet the woman of his dreams?  Megan went to 
NYC for the week - its her spring break.  I am finding out whether I can send 
your parents the tickets early or if we will meet them at the "will call 
window" at the RCA Dome.  These are box seats so I don't know if we can get 
them earlier or not.  Looks like it going to be a very interesting Final 
Four.  See ya!
Ben
