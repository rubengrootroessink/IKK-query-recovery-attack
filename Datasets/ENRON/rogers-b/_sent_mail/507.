Mike:

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  I left you Rich 
Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.  
Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look 
at.  I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings 
the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the 
development team, Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, 
trading and operating expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work 
togther with regards to the trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I 
just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be 
helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman, Dave's assistant informed me that you were 
coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not 
or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting.  

Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.
Regards,
Ben
