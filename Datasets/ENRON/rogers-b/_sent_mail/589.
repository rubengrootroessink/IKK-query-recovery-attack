I am working with Kinder/Morgan on pricing a 3 year deal off of one of their 
facilities.  These are the facilities that we looked at late last year for 
buying 2 of their plants.  The plants have a configuration of: 6 LM 6000's, 2 
GE 7EA's and steam turbine.  They are able to run in at peak, swing and base 
load levels very easily.  They are looking for a 3 year  term deal for 510 
MW's, with $1.00 VOM and Heat Rate of 8,531 located in Little Rock, ARK..  
Pricing starts June 02 and goes to Cal. 04.  Anyway, I want to know if you 
guys are able to meet tomorrow at 2:00pm to talk about pricing up this 
deal.   It should only take about 15-25 minutes.  Thanks for your time.
