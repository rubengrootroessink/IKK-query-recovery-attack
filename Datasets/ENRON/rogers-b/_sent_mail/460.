Dr. Ueng:
I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn't have 
time.  I was taking this course because I am applying to another business 
school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide 
the other schools with a recent academic record.  I was trying to get an A in 
the class, but my first test was not my best work. I feel that I did much 
better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my 
class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.  That 
said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly 
appreciate it.  I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in 
touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.  Thanks for 
making the class educational and quite enjoyable.  Hope to talk to you soon 
and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers
