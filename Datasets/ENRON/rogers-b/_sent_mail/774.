Thanks for the fast reply.  I changed it online, but I wanted to make sure I 
wasn't booked for two different times.  Also, are you able to tell me who I 
will be meeting with?  I am meeting with a couple professors before my 
Admissions Visit and just wanted to know who I was going to meet with from 
your office.  Thanks!
Ben
