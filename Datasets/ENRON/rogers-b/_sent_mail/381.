Ran into Ed this morning and he said that he ran into your ugly ass this past 
weekend.  I told him that it sucks for him but its over so all the better.  
He said he was taking notes from the way you dress, thats if he ever went 
back to being single again.  Biked, ran and workedout this weekend.  I am on 
the path to kicking ass and taking names.  Bring it!!
