I wish I had taken the Bar with that special treatment - sign me up!  The big 
race is this weekend, so I hope I don't break a leg.  We leave Friday 
afternoon and get back on Monday.  I will be walking very slow next week.  
Let's try and get together next week sometime for a little dinner.  See ya
Ben
