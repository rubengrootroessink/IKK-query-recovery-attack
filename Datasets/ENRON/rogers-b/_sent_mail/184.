Thanks for the quick reply.  I live within inside the loop on Buffalo 
Speedway near 59.  I think lunch next week sometime would be great.  I can 
come up to the Woodlands and we can meet up for lunch.  Let me check to see 
what day is best and I will send you an e-mail later today to confirm.  Hope 
that works and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben
