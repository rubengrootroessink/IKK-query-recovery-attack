 Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also, thank 
you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application 
and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty and 
staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to 
attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the 
career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be 
able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my 
experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the 
GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have 
proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. 
Enron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the 
many people I talked with at the Texas B-School.  
 Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and 
it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in 
Texas, such as myself.  

Regards,

Ben Rogers
