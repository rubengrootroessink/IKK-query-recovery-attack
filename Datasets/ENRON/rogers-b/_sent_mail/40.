Hey Warren:
Here are a couple of questions we are working on for Duke on the 99's.  If 
you could take a look at these that would be great.  Thanks!

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

Thanks.

Swati
