Here is the e-mail that Bruce just sent me.  Make sure that you do not use 
this for any binding agreements or client discussion purposes.  These are the 
numbers I have used in my model and here are the new Plano numbers.  If you 
have any questions please give me a call and I will walk you through the 
changes.  Thanks
