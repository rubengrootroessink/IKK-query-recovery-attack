The guy you are talking about left CIN under a "cloud of suspicion" sort of 
speak.  He was the one who got into several bad deals and PPA's in California 
for CIN, thus he left on a bad note.  Let me know if you need more detail 
than that, I felt this was the type of info you were looking for.  Thanks!
