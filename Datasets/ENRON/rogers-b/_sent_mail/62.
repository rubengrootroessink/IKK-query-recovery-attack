Mitch,

Please provide this information to Benjamin Rogers.   I am on vacation this 
week and don't have access to the data.

Thanks,
Rick

Rick:
Here is the file with the performance data we worked on for the 2000's.  A 
Brownsville tab has been added - could you please assist us in putting this 
data together for Brownsville.  Please give me a call if you have any 
questions.  Thanks!
Ben
