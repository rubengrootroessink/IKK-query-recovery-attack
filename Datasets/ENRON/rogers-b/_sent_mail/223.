 Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site 
visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday 
and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In 
terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the 
following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and 
Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the 
next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.
  While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take 
any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.  
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per 
day.
 I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling 
please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues.
Regards,

Ben
