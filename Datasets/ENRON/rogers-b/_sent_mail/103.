John:
With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in 
these cost figures - everything is expensed.  With respects to the 
Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up 
approximately 50% of the cost.  The rest is attributable to energy costs.  
These costs are levelized for the full 12 months of the year.  Please let me 
know if you have any other comments.  Thanks!
Ben
