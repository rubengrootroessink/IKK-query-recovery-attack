Hey Dan:
It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to send 
you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great eveything 
is going well.  I'm running the NYC Marathon in two weeks so my weekends are 
mostly about running, but after that I would like to get together for some 
golf.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
