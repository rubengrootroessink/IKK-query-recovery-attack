Yes still in Texas, but thinking about moving back up East to New York.  I 
have applied to B-School so I'm waiting to here from them.  What a process 
this has been!  I have talked to Mike G. a couple times lately and we were 
thinking about trying to get alot of people together probably in the spring 
sometime.  We'll see how that goes.  Hope all is going well and next time 
lets keep in touch sooner.  See ya
Ben
