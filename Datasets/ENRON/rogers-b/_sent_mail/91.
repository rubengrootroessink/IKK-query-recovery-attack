What are you doing sending me this crap!  I want some dirty jokes!  I want 
some stories of wild, drunken nights, not this stuff.  We are getting into 
NYC on late on Friday night.  I am picking up my number early on Saturday 
morning.  Would you be interested in going to dinner with a group of us to 
Tony Dinapoli's on upper east side on Saturday night?  Were getting there at 
approx. 7:30pm.  Give me a call about this.  See ya
Ben
