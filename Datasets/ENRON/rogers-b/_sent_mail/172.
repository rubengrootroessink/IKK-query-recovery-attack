Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring (" CEM") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.
