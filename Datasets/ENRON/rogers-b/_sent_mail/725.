Here is a presentation I need by 12:00 this morning.  I need 1 set of 
transparencies and 40 color copies, where these copies are stapled and 
three-holed punched at the top.  If graphics can "clean it" up a little bit 
that would be great..  I am trying to finish one more slide in this 
presentation but please go forward with this due to time constraints.  Please 
give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks
