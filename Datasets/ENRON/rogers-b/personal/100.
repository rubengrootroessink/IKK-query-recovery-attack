it could be today, but with the nasty weather it is probably better to
postpone, as for tomorrow i have a meeting all morning and then we could
meet for a late afternoon lunch or even early evening happy hour to
celebrate bush's victory. so let me know if sometime late tomorrow works,
otherwise possibly friday. although i may be down in houston since i need to
go to a pool table place off of the southwest freeway near Gessner and then
in town to meet a buddy from el paso.
