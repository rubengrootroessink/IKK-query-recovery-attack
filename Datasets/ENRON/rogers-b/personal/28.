Ben,

I am in the process of re-negotiating the Multex contract.  If you would like to keep your ID the cost will be $2,400.00 per ID per year.

Please let me know no later than April 27, 2001 if you would like to keep your ID.

If you have any questions, please call me at 3-9135.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Susan
