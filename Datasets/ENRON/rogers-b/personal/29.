Dear Ben,
We had a meeting at your offices last December where I expressed my interest in pursuing a rotation in your division. As you may remember, you set me a meeting with Jeff Donahue that same evening. I understood back then that it was a bit early in the process.

In August I will be joining the firm as an Associate and now that the management at your division might have a more clear idea of your needs, I would like to reaffirm my interest in pursuing a rotation at your department. I am confident that the skills that I have built in the past constitute a good basis for dealing with the demands of the group in the present.

I would also very much appreciate if you could give me any suggestions in order to maximize my chances.
I would fly to Houston in order to meet with and whomever you think appropriate at your request.
I am attaching my updated resume. Please pass it around.

I will give you a call in a couple of days.

Best regards,

Teseo Bergoglio
