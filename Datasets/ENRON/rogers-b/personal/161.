Hey Ben!? I just saw your message from 9/26. I  guess I'm one of those who is 
lazy about checking e-mails {or just not used to  it.}? It has been busy 
around here. The SNCARC dinner was a success, but  I'm glad it is over now.? 
Kara seems to be doing a bit better. I was there  today and we went out for a 
walk. It was good.? I think she has a ways to  go though.? I'm glad to hear 
that you are going to be staying in  Houston.? I'd like to hear more about 
how that all went. Well, I'd better  get dinner started.? Hope you had a good 
weekend.? Love ya!
