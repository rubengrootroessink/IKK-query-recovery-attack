<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>I am o.k. So is Kiernan, Dimino, Lytle,
Romano. I am at work today at
<DIV></DIV>the Empire State Building. Security is
tight. Only employees with
<DIV></DIV>picture ID allowed in. Must go through
metal detectors and police have
<DIV></DIV>all streets around Empire State Building
blocked off. F-16 fighter jets
<DIV></DIV>flying overhead to protect building and
make me feel a little safer.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Please let me know if all CUA people are
O.K. I am not sure if you know
<DIV></DIV>her, but my wife's best friend Amy Callahan
from CUA, I believe lost her
<DIV></DIV>boyfriend who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald
on the 105th Floor of Tower 1.
<DIV></DIV>He was a really nice guy. Fitz's
brother-in-law alo worked at Cantor
<DIV></DIV>Fitzgerald on the 104th floor. No Cantor
Fitzgerald people have
<DIV></DIV>reported in and Dimino says no one above
the plane crashes were able to
<DIV></DIV>make it out. Please say a prayer for them.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Good luck, and let me know if you hear
anything.

<DIV></DIV>Dear Friends,
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>I have been lucky enough to speak with a
few of you today. I wish that
<DIV></DIV>it was possible to speak to all of you. I,
fortunately, have not heard
<DIV></DIV>any grave news of my friends as of 2am
9/12/01. I would love to hear
<DIV></DIV>from everyone posted to this note, whom
I've not spoken to as yet. I am
<DIV></DIV>thinking and praying for all of you, your
families, and co-workers.
<DIV></DIV>Please know people everywhere are thinking
of everyone in New York. I
<DIV></DIV>hope you all are well, and will be waiting
to hear anything from anyone.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Your Friend,
<DIV></DIV>Joe
