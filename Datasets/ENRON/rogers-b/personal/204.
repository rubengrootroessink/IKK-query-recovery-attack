1. To all A/A Pool members: it is important that you let us know of any time 
you have taken off. To those members who are sending time on to your 
assistant, please make sure they forward that information on to the A/A 
program. With the Roll Out of SAP, you have the ability to go on-line and 
input your time. I will continue to email for timesheets regardless if you go 
on-line. This is to let you know it is time to input your time or fill out 
your timesheet.
2. If you have moved recently, please provide the following and indicate the 
new changes when sending your timesheet.
