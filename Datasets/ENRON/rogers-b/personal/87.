Hi everyone.  Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving.
We had a great time in Chicago and are waiting to see
if it will happen again next year :-)  Just kidding
Michaela!

Okay, we need everyone to put in their wish lists so
some of us can start our shopping.  Please try and
give a couple of suggestions for yourselves-not just
one-in case we can't get something!  Also, I don't
think all adults have put in suggestions for their
children.

Once again, is it $125.00 per couple and $30.00 for
children??????  Also, what about the gift for Mom and
Dad??  Hope to hear from you all soon!
Megan

By the way, some suggestions for Ben and I---
anything we registered for that we didn't get
(Ross-Simons)
Any Spode stuff (except glasses)
I'll think of some other stuff
