Ben,
Hello... It was good speaking with you earlier. Thank you for the time.
I
wanted to send you an email with my contact information so we can stay
in touch
over time. At some point it will make sense to look outside you current
employer
for your next career move, and I hope you will consider me for
assistance.

Also, if you come across anyone that could utilize my services, please
refer them to me. We do offer a $500 referral bonus for accounting and
tax professionals that are hired by our clients. Thank you in advance
for doing so.

John
