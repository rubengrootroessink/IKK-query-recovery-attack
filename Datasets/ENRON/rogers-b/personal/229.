 The Educational Assistance Forms for  the GMAT Preparation class are 
available outside EB1197 and attached below.  After you have completed the 
form, return it to Brad Stewart, EB1181A, for approval and processing.  
Reimbursement will be made after you have completed the course and provide 
Brad Stewart with a certificate and your receipt.

For all other questions regarding the GMAT (i.e., test results, space 
availability, logistics, etc.) please contact Patricia Slaughter at x36908.



For your convenience, we now have a Form Center located adjacent to EB1197.
