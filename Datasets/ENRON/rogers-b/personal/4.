B, 
Per our conversation I am sending my resume. 
As we talked about I would like to continue down the finance path. I have  
several years of internal financial experience (raising capital, preparing  
models and valuations for presentations), I believe I could learn a great  
deal from the companies you spoke of and gain specific industry knowledge. 
I greatly appreciate your input and look forward to speaking with you in the  
future. 
Best Regards, 
Cliff Carnes
