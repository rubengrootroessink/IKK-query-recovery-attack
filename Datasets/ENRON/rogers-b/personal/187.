I would love to have lunch one day.  Call Cindy and get on my calendar.  It 
was nice to hear from you!  I am glad everything is going well.

Stan


P.S.   Hello, Ben!    This is Cindy.    I just wanted to let you know that 
Stan has recently decided to open up, print, and reply to all of his own 
e-mails.    He did receive your initial e-mail and had typed up this message 
but saved it as a 'draft' and never sent it to you.   I just so happened to 
look in his 'draft' folder yesterday and saw this message, asked him about 
it, and he said to forward it on to you.     So, he hasn't been ignoring you 
(ha)...he just forgot to send the draft message.   This is just between you 
and me, okay?    ha ha     Don't joke with him about this....he's trying to 
become more knowledgeable in the technical area.    I just hope he doesn't 
decide to get rid of me!  ha ha      Have a great day and call me to set up a 
lunch with Stan.
