Everyday that we are on the front cover of the journal our stock will go lower.  I have said this the past three weeks and everyday I have been right.  I think it could continue to go lower, because their is going to be no good news for a little while.  Getting access to cash from private equity firms is a double edge sword.  It doesn't look good for the small E.
