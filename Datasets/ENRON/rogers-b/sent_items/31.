Unfortunately yes.  The traders and finance folks were kept on to perform u=
nwind and liquidation functions.  The trading group, the group I am in, is =
really the only group with value besides the pipleines, thus we will probab=
ly be sold off to a bank like Citi or JPM.  I wouldn't mind that because th=
ey understand the trading business of commodities as well as equities and f=
ixed income.  This as been an amazing experience and taught me alot about o=
ver leverage and strategic, really about what not to due, which can be as i=
mportant as what to do in business.  99% of the folks are good hardworking =
people, but its the few finance guys at the top that brought this company d=
own.  It really is a shame to see all these people yesterday get laid off. =
 It was so sad.  Luckily, by accident I had sold off most of my options las=
t year, but still lost a little 401 k dough, but I still have my health as =
my mom likes to say.  On a good note we got your picture of the little tike=
, looks great.  I hope all is going well and thanks for the e-mail.  Talk t=
o you soon.
Regards,
Ben
