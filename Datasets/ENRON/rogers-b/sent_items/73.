Dad:
Did you see that Dynegy is spinning off a MLP called Dynegy Energy Partners.  Exactly what I have been talking about could be happening and that is still a very good idea, with maybe some of the players in your area.  Also, John Rowe as been named sole CEO and Chairman of Exelon. They came out yesterday and said they were interested in merging with a midwest utility.  Talk to you soon.
