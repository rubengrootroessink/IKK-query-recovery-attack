It's been a really tough day.  I need a beer.  We may get one beer pretty soon or maybe not.  I'll let you know soon.

Hello it's me again-
Why don't you write back
I know, I know, you are busy.

Listen, wishful thinking, I looked up flights for
February (hoping you will want to go Feb 6th-Feb 10th)
That is a Wed. through Sunday with 3 full days of
skiing.
Anyway, there is a promotional flight to Vail
for $631.22 fo both of us roundtrip
Think about it!!!
Megan
