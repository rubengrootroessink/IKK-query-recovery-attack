thinkgs are bleak but not as dire as other groups (the credit of our counterparties are even sketchier than ours) but our trades have dropped off since last wednesday  -Shankman is coming tomorrow -I think to deliver the proverbial ax -the question is will the market deliver it sooner. I thought Ch. 11 would be first? (it may be moot anyway)

what are you thinking about doing?

David:
Whats up?  I think tomorrow seems to be a big ax day over here for many of the groups in EIM and EGM.  It's getting pretty grim here on the trading floor.  Most people seem to think that this deal will not go through and that we will go into Ch. 7.  Trading has really slowed down.  How do things look over there?
