Enron Venture Capitalism

You have two cows.

You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity
swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back,
with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by
the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your
listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an
option on one more.
