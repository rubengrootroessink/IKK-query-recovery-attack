Joe:
Thanks for taking the time to talk with me regarding the opportunities at Cinergy.  I enjoyed my discussions with the other guys on the trading floor.  There is clearly money to be made trading in the right regions with the right people.  I would like to continue trading, but also learn Cinergy's assets to better understand how to effectively trade around these types of assets.  It seems that everyone I talked to is enthusiastic about growing the business in the right regions.  Let me know if you guys need me to come up and visit again.  Thanks again and I'll talk to you soon.
Regards,
Ben
