I needed the CPN lifeboat three weeks ago.  This ship is going down, takeover soon or bankruptcy later.  No joke!  Let me check with Megan, but that sounds good.

My parents are in town for Laura McHenry's wedding this weekend.  They want
to invite you and Megan for tennis and lunch at the raquet club on Sunday.
My dad and I can beat you and my mom, while Megan teaches Susan the basics.


Let me know when you need a CPN lifeboat to come rescue you from the sinking
ship.....
