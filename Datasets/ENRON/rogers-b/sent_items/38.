Yes - I think so.  I am still employed, just waiting to be bought out by a bank like Citigroup or UBS.  It's been crazy to live through all of this shit.  This has been an incredible learning experience of what NOT to do in business.  These guys at the top are complete crooks.  Anyway, enough bs, Megan and I are heading up to Boston for X-mas, were getting together with Jon and Kati one day.  Well be out in Colorado for New Year's.  I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.  Thanks for the e-mail.
Ben
