Willis,
 
I have spoken with our contact at Dynegy -  Danskammer and found out that they will be starting a overhaul on the #4  unit on Oct 14 (for 35 days).
We have not found anything yet for this weekend,  but we will continue to call.
 
Outage ID: 18592         Date:  10/14/01 to 11/17/01     239MW 
 
If you have any questions please let me  know.
 
Thank you,
Amy Brashear
