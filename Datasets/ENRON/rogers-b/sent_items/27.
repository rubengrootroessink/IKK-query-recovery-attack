Michael:
I just had another brief conversation with Harry.  He had not heard from Bruce yet.  I think coming down here sooner rather later would be important to get Harry and his team convinced.  Harry is talking to other folks and it seems that those talks are moving along quite quickly.  Hope this helps.
