What's up buddy?  How's school going?  Did you get this e-mail on the Dolan's?  Are we getting that old that our friends are beginning to have kids. Say it ain't so!!  I am stillin shock over everything that happened last week.  I think our economy that is in for a beating for quit some time.  Our stock has gotten hammered.  The safe havens are the yield stocks.  Gotto go trade the power.  Talk to you later.
