Dad:
I heard that CIN summer is down to $32 - $33.  Gas is going to be below $2.00 for the summer by March.  Looks like your idea to short the whole year at $32.00 was a very good idea.  Again make sure your guys are looking at it right.  I think summer CIN will get to be around $28 before April and thats when you start buying it up.  Let me know what you think.  Merrill came out with a good report on you guys today.  I need to talk to you about a couple of things.  Please give me a call at home when you get the chance.
