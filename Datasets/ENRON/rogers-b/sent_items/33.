Sorry about that - I had to get a name and number from Mike for a guy at Goldman Sachs in New York, to arrange a potential meeting with those guys in NYC for a trading position.  I already paid $3,000 to ML today.  So its not an increase in Margin, plus you will write me a check for the current Margin balance tonight.  See you at home.
