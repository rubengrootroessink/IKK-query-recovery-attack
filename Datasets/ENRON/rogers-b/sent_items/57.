Greg:
I went to the meeting to look at valuing some of the outstanding contracts.  It will take some time to make sure that we have the correct forward prices on some of these contracts.  I will report back to you soon how all that is going and prepare written summaries to you asap.  Hope this helps under these specific circumstances.
Regards,
Ben
