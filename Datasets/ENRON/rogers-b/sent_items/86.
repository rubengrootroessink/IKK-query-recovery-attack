Dad:
Cliff sent you his resume.  Cliff is the guy who is married to Megan's sister Dierdre.  They currently live in NYC.  He is looking to do corporate development type work with you guys in Cincy.  Let me know what you think.  I left a message for Brian Terp to send me his resume so I can send it to you.  Let me also know about your conversation with Michael about what we talked about yesterday.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
