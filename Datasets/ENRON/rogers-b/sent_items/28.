Harry:
What did you think of the presentation thus far and what other type of info are you looking for.  The rest of the presentation is not that strategy oriented like the pages I gave you, but I will go through it and see if any of the other pages will help.  The key is to get an idea of what they are trying to do so that you can craft in that fashion.  I am playing tennis at 3:00, but will call you later to talk more about the presentation and tomorrow's meeting.

1. Bruce Sukaly did call me and I am having  lunch with him tomorrow.
2. Could you share more of the presentation you have? It is very informative about their thought processes and ideas. It would be nice to gloss through that whole thing (I dont need to keep a copy or anything)
