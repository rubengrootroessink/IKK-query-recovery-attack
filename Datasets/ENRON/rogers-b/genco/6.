Ben,
 As far as Georgia is concerned, we should have a total of five dots on the 
state.  The Doyle project actually needs to be changed to "In Operation" as 
it is now going through its run tests.  The Athens, GA site should be labeled 
"Development (Site Secured)".  Then, their should be three other dots all 
labeled for "Development (Site Under Construction)".  These three dots are 
sites in Hart, Jefferson and Washington county, GA.  

Stephen
