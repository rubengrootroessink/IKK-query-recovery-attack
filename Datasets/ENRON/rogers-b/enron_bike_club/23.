This is a message from Jim Gramke, our very own Enron #1 fundraiser for the 
MS150 tour.  Any of you interested in participating with him, might just pick 
up some fundraising tips, or maybe some of his success will rub off - worth a 
try!   Please respond to Jim at the address below.

Anyone in the club who is interested in having a fun day with kids, I'm 
conducting a Bike Rodeo at the Oaks Elementary School in Atascocita, Friday, 
March 10th. I need some volunteers to work in the AM, PM, or both, to run 
about 750 kids through a skills course that  teaches safe riding habits.
