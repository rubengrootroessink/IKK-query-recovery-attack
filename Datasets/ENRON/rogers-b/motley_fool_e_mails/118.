ANALOG DEVICES' STRONG Q4
Circuit maker Analog Devices reported estimate-beating Q4
results yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Integrated circuit maker Analog Devices (NYSE: ADI) reported
fourth-quarter and fiscal year-end results yesterday after the
bell. The company earned $0.54 a share in the fourth quarter,
ahead of the First Call/Thompson Financial consensus estimate by
$0.04. In last year's fourth quarter, Analog Devices earned
$0.20.

Sales for the quarter were up 87% to $806 million from $431
million in the year-ago period. Net income increased to $206.5
million, compared to $73.2 million last year. The company's
gross margin improved during the quarter to 58.6% from 52.2%.

For the fiscal year, Analog Devices earned $588.8 million on
sales of $2.58 billion. In the previous fiscal year, the
company's sales were $1.45 billion, and its net income was
$204.8 million. On a per-share basis, Analog Devices earned
$1.54 a share in fiscal 2000, versus $0.57 in fiscal 1999.

The company also announced yesterday that it will be
repurchasing up to 15 million shares of its common stock.
Currently, there are about 356 million shares of Analog Devices
common stock outstanding. The shares are being bought back for
use in the company's stock option plans, as well as other
employee stock-based benefit plans.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of its new fiscal year,
Analog Devices expects 7-10% sequential revenue growth. The
company sees first-quarter earnings per share to come in between
$0.58 and $0.60 a share. The current consensus estimate for
Analog Devices' first quarter is $0.54. The company says it
believes its revenue growth will be constrained by supply, not
demand.

Analog Devices' President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman said, "Our
first look for the entire year of fiscal 2001 is also very
encouraging. We currently believe that fiscal 2001's revenues
could exceed fiscal 2000's by more than 50%, which would result
in fiscal 2001 revenues of more than $3.8 billion."

NEWS TO GO

In an SEC filing yesterday, it was disclosed that the man who
has for so long believed in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) also apparently
believes at least a little in Pepsi (NYSE: PEP). Warren
Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) has acquired
about a 1% stake in Tricon Global Restaurants (NYSE: YUM), the
Pepsi spin-off that includes fast-food restaurants Pizza Hut,
Taco Bell, and KFC. Close to 98% of those restaurants serve
Pepsi products. Buffett owns 8.1% of Coca-Cola and is also a
director for the company.

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) said yesterday that it will allow
customers ordering new 2001 Explorers to elect to have Goodyear
tires on their vehicles over the standard Firestones. This move
formally allows customers to have the new Explorers delivered
with Goodyear tires, as opposed to switching off the Firestones
for the Goodyears before the purchase. It's estimated that
between 5-10% of Explorer customers have been asking dealers to
change the tires on their new trucks before driving them off of
the lot, thanks to the Firestone recall of 6.5 million tires. In
states where the tire problems were the worst, up to 40% of
customers have been asking for the switch.

E-commerce software company BEA Systems (Nasdaq: BEAS) reported
third-quarter earnings yesterday after the bell. The company's
pro forma net income was $31.3 million, or $0.07 a share. Last
year, the company's pro forma net income was $10.4 million, or
$0.03 a share. BEA beat the consensus estimate according to
First Call/Thompson Financial by a penny. Revenues grew 77% to
$244 million, from last year's $126.5 million.

Optical networking company Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR)
announced fiscal first-quarter results after the market's close
yesterday. Sycamore's pro forma net income was $6 million, or
$0.02 a diluted share, for the quarter. Last year, it lost $4.1
million, or $0.02 a share, in the first quarter. The company
earned a penny more than analysts had expected. Revenues grew by
517% to $120.4 million, compared to the year-ago period's $19.5
million.
