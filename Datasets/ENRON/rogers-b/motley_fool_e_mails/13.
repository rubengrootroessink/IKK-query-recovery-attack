CISCO: SUMMERTIME BOTTOM?
Some market watchers are calling the bottom for the business
performance of networking equipment maker Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:
CSCO). However,&nbsp;the company didn't provide much in the way
of new forward guidance after turning in fiscal third-quarter
results after last night's market close.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) matched General Dynamics' (NYSE:
GD) bid for Newport News Shipbuilding (NYSE: NNS), the nation's
leading maker of nuclear submarines. Although General's offer
was in all cash and Northrop's was 75% cash and 25% stock, they
are for essentially the same amount. Northrop claims its offer
poses a better chance of getting past U.S. regulators.

News reports have Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) buying a 2.9% stake,
valued at $1.11 billion, in Italy's Assicurazioni Generali,
Europe's fourth-largest insurance company.

Tony women's apparel retailer Chico's FAS (NYSE: CHS) turned in
April sales that rose a remarkable 68.5% to $32.1 million.
Same-store sales for company-owned outlets improved 32.5%.
Fiscal Q1 (ended May 5) sales jumped 64.4% as "comps" ran ahead
27.7%. "Our increased marketing efforts and new television ads
in concert with great product and excellent customer service
continue to drive strong sales increases," said CEO Marvin
Gralnick.

Leading video game manufacturer Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS)
will make games for Nintendo's unreleased GameCube, the Japanese
company's bid to reclaim its once-dominant position in the
console business. GameCube will compete with Sony's (NYSE: SNE)
PlayStation 2 and the on-the-way Xbox from Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT).

Researchers from voice-user-interface company Sound Advantage
and Lucent's (NYSE: LU) Bell Labs will team to develop a speech
recognition engine for Sound Advantage's messaging systems.
Lucent will receive warrants to purchase Sound Advantage stock
under the terms of the deal.

Food distribution company Fleming (NYSE: FLM) said fiscal Q1
(ended April 21) EPS was $0.41, up from $0.30 last year as
cost-cutting measures helped the firm overcome a 4% drop in
sales to $4.16 billion.
