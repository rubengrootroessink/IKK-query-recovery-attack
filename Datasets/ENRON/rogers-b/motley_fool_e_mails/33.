WALDENBOOKS NOT BORDERS' GOLDEN POND
Bookseller Borders Group (NYSE: BGP) said fiscal first-quarter
(ended April 29) earnings, before charges, were $0.01 per share
-- net income was essentially flat with last year's levels --
and in-line with estimates as companywide revenue rose 7.4% to
$729.9 million.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Broadband and optical networking equipment company Redback
Networks (Nasdaq: RBAK) said it would spend $57 million in stock
to buy privately held Merlin Systems, a company developing
optical equipment for metro networking. The deal is expected to
close in Q3.

Interactive television company TiVo (Nasdaq: TIVO) said
yesterday that fiscal Q1 subscribers topped the 200,000 mark as
revenues jumped sixfold and losses doubled to $1.20 a share,
three cents better than analysts had projected. The company also
earned patents for recording during playback, streaming, and the
ability to pause and scan through live television. Look for
further coverage of TiVo in Fool News & Commentary later today.

General Electric's (NYSE: GE) financing division and Goldman
Sachs (NYSE: GS) are taking on Buffett. The companies are
teaming up on an offer to take troubled commercial lender Finova
(NYSE: FNV) out of bankruptcy, and give it $7 billion in
funding. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A), in tandem
with Leucadia National (NYSE: LUK), in March offered $6 billion,
as reported by Todd Lebor.
