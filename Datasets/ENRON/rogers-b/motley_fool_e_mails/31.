TOP STORY

FRANCE LUCENT?
Last month, Alcatel (NYSE: ALA) CEO Serge Tchurek said that a
Lucent (NYSE: LU) asset sale "is a determining event for all the
actors in this market." Apparently, the French
telecommunications equipment giant wants to play more than a bit
part in this epic.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It's a day that will live in blockbuster infamy. Disney's (NYSE:
DIS) Pearl Harbor failed to live up to the hype as the film that
would finally topple 1997's Jurassic Park's The Lost World from
the top slot of the four-day opening weekend. The movie still
nailed a respectable $75 million in estimated box office ticket
sales. I'll be taking a closer look at how the summer multiplex
season is playing out later today.

Talk about your Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) pilots! Hewlett-Packard
(NYSE: HWP) and accounting titan PricewaterhouseCoopers
announced that they would team up to provide consulting services
to the airline industry on how to introduce handheld computers
and the Internet into the work space. Is improving communication
services the key to air carrier efficiency? Maybe. Now let's see
them do something about that bland airline food.

The chips are down. That might not be much of a surprise to semi
watchers, but a closer glimpse into the industry's slump was
warranted. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics
group, global chip sales are expected to fall by 14% this year
from last year's $204 billion showing.
