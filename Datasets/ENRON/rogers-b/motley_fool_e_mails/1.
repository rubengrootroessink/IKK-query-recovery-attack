"What the customer demands is last year's model, cheaper. To
find out what the customer needs, you have to understand what
the customer is doing as well as he understands it. Then you
build what he needs and you educate him to the fact that he
needs it."

IS DELL'S PRICE CUTTING WORKING?
PC maker Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) yesterday lowered guidance and
reported fiscal first-quarter (ended May 4) earnings in-line
with Wall Street's expectations. The company's aggressive
pricing continues to yield additional market share, but it's
also hurting earnings growth.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Handheld device maker Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) expects fourth-quarter
sales of $140 million to $160 million, compared to earlier
guidance of $300 million to $315 million. That lowered outlook
means it will post a loss of $170 million to $190 million,
versus earlier guidance for earnings of $80 million to $85
million. Palm is also taking a $300 million inventory charge and
canceling its merger with Extended Systems (Nasdaq: XTND) due to
market conditions. The Fool covered the handheld market this
week in an article entitled "Game Over for Palm and Handspring?"

Test and measurement equipment maker Agilent Technologies (NYSE:
A) posted lower-than-expected second-quarter profits yesterday,
citing slowing customer demand and a number of large order
cancellations. The company reported earnings of $0.26 per share,
a penny below Wall Street's consensus expectation. Agilent's
sales were $2.7 billion, compared to $2.5 billion in the
year-ago period. Next quarter, it expects a loss of $0.20 to
$0.30 per share, well below Wall Street's earlier estimate for
earnings of $0.25 per share.

Embedded software vendor Wind River Systems (Nasdaq: WIND) beat
lowered first-quarter estimates yesterday, but said sales would
fall 10% next quarter. The company posted earnings of $0.06 per
share, compared to $0.11 per share in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue came in at $110.2 million. Next quarter, the company
expects sales of $96 million to $99 million and earnings of
$0.01 to $0.03 per share. Wind River is also cutting its
workforce by 12% to 15%. The Fool covered the company's warning
earlier this month.

Clothing retailer Gap (NYSE: GPS) said its first-quarter
earnings were in-line with Wall Street's expectations. Earnings
fell 2% year-over-year to $0.13 per share. Revenues increased
16% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, but same-store sales, which
measure sales growth at stores that have been open for more than
a year, fell 7%. Gap failed to give any guidance, instead
reiterating earlier comments that same-store sales will fall in
the second quarter. Two Fools Dueled over the future of the
retailer earlier this month.
