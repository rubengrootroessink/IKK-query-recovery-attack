"If you can't pay for a thing, don't buy it. If you can't get
paid for it, don't sell it. Do this, and you will have calm and
drowsy nights, with all of the good business you have now and
none of the bad. " -- Benjamin Franklin

INTUIT'S DOING MORE WITH LESS
Personal finance software vendor Intuit (Nasdaq: INTU) beat
lowered third-quarter earnings expectations yesterday, but said
full-year revenues would come in at the bottom end of earlier
guidance. Intuit posted pro forma profits of $0.55 per share,
beating Wall Street's expectation by two pennies. Revenues were
$425.2 million, below Wall Street's estimate of $435 million.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL), best known for its server operating
system, announced a second-quarter pro forma loss of $0.03 per
share, versus earnings of $0.02 per share in the year-ago
period. Wall Street expected earnings of $0.03 per share.
Revenue was $240.8 million, compared with $302.3 million in the
year-ago period. Novell is also cutting 5% of its workforce. The
layoffs, coupled with additional savings in travel, advertising,
and recruiting, are expected to return the company to
profitability.

Business-to-business software vendor Agile Software (Nasdaq:
AGIL) announced a fourth-quarter pro forma loss of $0.05 per
share, compared with a loss of $0.02 per share in the year-ago
period, and in-line with Wall Street's expectations. Revenue
increased 140% year-over-year to $26 million. Agile makes
software that allows companies to exchange information over the
Internet. Last month, Ariba (Nasdaq: ARBA) called off its
acquisition of the company.

Computer Associates (NYSE: CA), the world's third-largest
software company, posted pro forma pro rata income (i.e.,
results that are adjusted to allow the effects of a new sales
model to be compared against past numbers) of $0.47 per share,
compared to $0.34 per share in the year-ago period. That beat
Wall Street's estimate by a penny. Pro forma pro rata revenue
increased 3.6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion.

Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) maintained its
full-year guidance and reported first-quarter earnings of $0.40
per share, compared with $0.24 per share in the year-ago period.
Sales came in at $240.9 million, compared with $148.5 million in
the year-ago period. While other chipmakers are struggling,
shares of Nvidia have grown nearly twofold since January. In the
press release, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the company's
entrance into the mobile and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) markets.
