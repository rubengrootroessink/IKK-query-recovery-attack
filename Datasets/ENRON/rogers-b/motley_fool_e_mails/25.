"My riches consist not in the extent of my possessions, but in
the fewness of my wants." -- J. Brotherton

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

COMPAQ DOES NOT COMPUTE
Hardware specialist Compaq (NYSE: CPQ) reported lackluster
first-quarter results. Sales and operating profits of $9.2
billion and $200 million, respectively, declined during the
period with Compaq falling short of analyst earnings estimates.
Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) continued to eat away at the company's
computing market share. Compaq also announced 2000 layoffs, on
top of 5000 jobs that were slashed just last month.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Call waiting? Third-generation (3G) cell phone services will be
put on hold as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NYSE: NTT)
subsidiary DoCoMo will be delaying its May 30 launch until
October in order to fully test the network. Enabling faster
rates of wireless data transmission, 3G is the key to
revolutionary information services through your handset. Until
then, it'll just be another space on the Battleship grid.

The quest for success ends at Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX). The
lab diagnostics specialist reported that earnings more than
doubled to $35.7 million -- or $0.74 a share. That was 11 cents
higher than analyst expectations. The company sees 50%
bottom-line growth this year on a modest 5-7% uptick in sales.
In other words, the lab results are in and the prognosis on
margin expansion looks pretty healthy.

Chips and dips. Novellus (Nasdaq: NVLS) reported an 8.7% slide
in sequential income growth while still managing to quadruple
profits. The microchip equipment maker announced that shipments
fell by 13.5% during the quarter. The semi stocks continue to
feel the hurt as the book-to-bill ratio -- the gauge for
determining chip demand by pitting orders against actual
shipments -- sank for the seventh consecutive month.

Once a data-munching beast, Informix (Nasdaq: IFMX) will now be
selling its database unit to IBM (NYSE: IBM) for a billion in
cash. The asset sale was reported along with first-quarter
results, which fell both sequentially and year-over-year for the
Massachusetts-based company.

So happy together, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) -- the result of
the merger between Glaxo Pharmaceuticals and SmithKline Beecham
-- reported its first quarterly financials since its union.
Results came in ahead of expectations, and -- given merger cost
savings -- GlaxoSmithKline is comfortable with its 13% earnings
growth guidance for the full year.
