SCHERING FIGHTING FDA PANEL, MERGER RUMORS
It will no doubt be a busy day for investors following
drugmaking Rule Maker Schering-Plough (NYSE: SGP), as the
company was thrust into the news for several reasons. First
among them: On Friday, an advisory panel recommended to the FDA
that Schering's Claritin allergy drug -- and similar offerings
from other companies, including Aventis (NYSE: AVE) and Pfizer
(NYSE: PFE), which make for a multibillion-dollar business --
should be cleared for over-the-counter, non-prescription sale.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Canadian networking equipment company Nortel (NYSE: NT) will
lose CEO John Roth to retirement next year. Likely successor and
COO Clarence Chandran, meanwhile, is quitting for medical
reasons, and so Roth will stick around to lead the search for
his replacement.

SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI) surprised investors by making a $14.7
billion bid for Wachovia (NYSE: WB), which is already betrothed
to First Union (NYSE: FTU). SunTrust's offer is 17% more than
First Union's based on Friday's closing prices for the competing
stock swap bids. For more on the First Union deal, read Brian
Graney's mid-April article.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A), Warren Buffett's insurance and
investing conglomerate, said first-quarter net earnings per
share were $397, down from $531 last year. Operating earnings,
meanwhile, improved to $462 million from $354 million. The
company's report can be viewed at its website.

Telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE: T) reportedly said in an
SEC filing that it will saddle its broadband business unit with
more debt than any of its other units, or approximately $28.4
billion, when it splits into four separate companies later this
year. For more on the company's current exchange offer of shares
of AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE), check out Bill Mann's column of
last week.

Pizza mover Papa John's (Nasdaq: PZZA) said April comparable
sales fell 5.3% even as total revenues rose 27%. Last year
comparables rose 7.3%. The company said some of the difference
can be attributed to its anniversary promotion, which ran in Q2
last year but Q1 this time around.
