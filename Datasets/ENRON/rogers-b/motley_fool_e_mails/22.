TOP STORY

VERIZON: LONG-DISTANCE BUSINESS RISIN'
Telecommunications services giant Verizon (NYSE: VZ) said
first-quarter profits from operations were $0.72 per share, up
from $0.69 a year ago. The company, formed when Bell Atlantic
bought GTE last summer, turned in revenues of $16.3 billion for
the quarter. The EPS figure was a penny better than the
consensus expectation of Wall Street analysts.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Shrewd cost-cutting at Disney (NYSE: DIS) helped the company
turned in fiscal second-quarter profit growth even as the top
line took a dip. Revenues fell to $6 billion from $6.3 billion.
Analysts were expecting an uptick to $6.4 billion. However,
higher margins propped operating profits to $0.19 a share, well
ahead of analyst estimates and last year's $0.14-a-share
showing. Look for more coverage of Disney in Fool News &
Commentary later today.

Contract electronics manufacturer Flextronics (Nasdaq: FLEX)
said fiscal Q4 EPS was $0.22, up from last year's $0.17 but down
$0.02 from Wall Street's projections. The company is cutting
about 7,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, and trimming
production capacity 15% in the face of slowing demand.

Mainframe software company BMC Software (NYSE: BMC) said it
earned $0.26 per share in fiscal Q4, beating the Street's $0.24
consensus estimate and its own preannounced $0.23 to $0.25 range
as revenues fell year-over-year to $422.8 million. The company
pointed investors toward full fiscal-year sales growth of
between 12% and 15%.

Pay-for-performance Web search service GoTo.com (Nasdaq: GOTO)
announced first-quarter losses of $0.13 per share, better than
the year-ago $0.20 per-share loss and well ahead of the $0.31 to
$0.33 range Wall Street was looking for. Revenues jumped more
than 200% to $50 million for the quarter.
