TOP STORY

ALCATEL, LUCENT CALL IT OFF
In a short joint statement that nevertheless said it all,
Alcatel (NYSE: ALA) and Lucent (NYSE: LU) said last night that
ongoing merger talks between the companies were terminated.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Computer networking equipment maker Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:
SUNW) lowered fiscal fourth-quarter (ending June 30) financial
forecasts, saying it expects to earn $0.02 to $0.04 per share,
missing First Call's $0.06 consensus estimate, as revenues come
in between $3.8 billion and $4 billion.

A U.S. district judge yesterday approved Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO)
proposed $192.5 million settlement for a race discrimination
lawsuit filed by 2,200 black employees. Coca-Cola had denied the
charges in the lawsuit, which included discrimination in
promotion and compensation. The settlement, according to
Reuters, is the largest ever for a race discrimination case.

Diversified manufacturing company Tyco International (NYSE: TYC)
agreed to buy medical products company C.R. Bard (NYSE: BCR) in
a $3.2 billion stock swap expected to value the company at $60
per share, or about a 30% premium to last night's close. C.R.
Bard's revenue in 2000 was $1.1 billion and makes equipment used
in vascular, urological, and oncological diagnosis, among other products.

Consumer electronics retailer Radio Shack (NYSE: RSH) announced
that slower-than-expected Q2 sales will result in EPS from $0.25
to $0.27, missing Wall Street's $0.34 consensus projection and
last year's $0.38. Same-store sales look to come in flat
year-over-year.

Internet career search giant TMP Worldwide (Nasdaq: TMPW), which
operates the Monster.com site, said it bought the FlipDog.com
job site from WhizBang! Labs on May 25. Terms of the deal were
not disclosed.

Athletic footwear company K-Swiss (Nasdaq: KSWS) formed a joint
venture with Rugged Shark to develop and market a line of
National Geographic-inspired outdoor and casual footwear.
K-Swiss expects it'll cost $1 million to get the line up and
ready for a fall 2002 launch. K-Swiss will own 75% of the
venture.
