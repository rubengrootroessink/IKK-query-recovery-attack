Online retailer Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been
"dramatically" scaling back the engineering and business
development resources devoted to its "Amazon Anywhere" mobile
commerce unit, according to The Wall Street Journal, despite
broad proclamations about the growth potential of wireless
commerce.

Optical network operator Qwest Communications (NYSE: Q)
announced four contracts for broadband Internet communications
services worth "more than $30 million."

Networking equipment giant Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) will provide
China Telecom with more than 500 high-speed routers over the
next year as the Chinese company works to establish a network
that spans the country. The equipment will be used in ChinaNet,
China Telecom's Internet service provider. Financial terms were
not disclosed.

Retailer Kmart's (NYSE: KM) BlueLight.com Internet service
operation agreed to an expanded service pact with broadband
carrier Level 3 Communications (Nasdaq: LVLT). Bluelight.com is
part-owned by Softbank, an investor in The Motley Fool, and
Martha Stewart Omnimedia (NYSE: MSO), the latter covered in Fool
