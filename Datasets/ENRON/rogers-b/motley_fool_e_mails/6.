KRISPY KREME HOPES TO KEEP DUNKING
What kind of visibility is there in looking through donut holes?
Quite a bit, apparently, as Krispy Kreme (Nasdaq: KREM) today
issued guidance through the end of fiscal 2003 even as it
reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2002
(ended April 29).

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Preppy apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF) said
fiscal Q1 (ended May 5) EPS rose to $0.20, up from $0.16 last
year and three pennies better than Wall Street's consensus. The
company pointed investors toward EPS of $0.22 for Q2, in-line
with current projections.

Gallium arsenide telecommunications chip maker TriQuint
Semiconductor (Nasdaq: TQNT) agreed to buy wireless
communications components company Sawtek (Nasdaq: SAWS) with
stock valued, as of last night's close, at $1.29 billion.
TriQuint's $29.92 per-share offer was a 15% premium over last
night's close for Sawtek.

Sporting equipment company Rawlings (Nasdaq: RAWL) sold its Vic
Hockey division to Vic Hockey Co. Terms of the deal were not
disclosed. "We now look forward to focusing our energy on
building our core brand equity," said Chairman and CEO Steve
O'Hara.

Leading jewelry retailer Tiffany (NYSE: TIF) said fiscal Q1
(ended April 30) net income rose slightly though EPS was flat,
year-over-year, at $0.20. That was a penny better than expected
by Wall Street. Revenues fell 2.5% to $336.4 million. While U.S.
and international retail sales fell year-over-year, direct
marketing revenues actually improved, though the base upon which
they grew was relatively small at less than 10% of total sales.

Middleware software vendor BEA Systems (Nasdaq: BEAS) turned in
fiscal Q1 (ended April 30) EPS of $0.05, up from last year's
$0.03 per-share loss. That figure included acquisition-related
costs, without which BEA came in a penny ahead of the Street's
$0.07 per-share estimate. The company also boosted its full-year
EPS guidance to $0.43 from $0.41.
