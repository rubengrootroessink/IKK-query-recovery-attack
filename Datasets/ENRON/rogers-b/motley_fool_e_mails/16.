PEPSI BOTTLING CAPS THE S&P 500
PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) is the choice of the new S&P Generation.
Pepsi Bottling Group (NYSE: PBG), the cola company's leading
bottler, will be joining its sugar-water daddy in the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index over the weekend. The move is fitting since
both Coke (NYSE: KO) and its largest distributor, Coca Cola
Enterprises (NYSE: CCE), are already on board.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Terra firmer? Online giant Terra Networks (Nasdaq: TRLY)
reported a smaller-than-expected loss as cost-cutting helped
offset a sluggish advertising market. The Spanish standout,
whose buying spree eventually included the popular and then
profitable portal Lycos, saw revenues take a 6% dip. The company
also announced that it will lay off 15% of its workforce. I'll
be back to scratch beneath this story's surface later this
morning.

The Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) tolls, as the company announced that it
is cozy with first-quarter sales and earnings estimates but will
lay off some of its workers in the process. The company will let
go 3000 to 4000 employees -- as many as 10% of its workforce --
to offset falling demand and pricing pressures in the personal
computer space. Our own Mike Trigg (TMF Tonto) will take a
closer look at Dell's report later today.

Comcast's (Nasdaq: CMCSA) billion? The country's third-largest
cable television operator reported a cool billion-dollar
quarterly profit this morning -- but the 10-figure showing was
actually the result of large investment gains. Sales clocked in
13% higher, at $2.2 billion. Comcast is beginning to reap the
rewards of its costly buildout of digital broadband as
entertainment-starved consumers clamor for more cable channels
and faster Internet speeds.

In the beginning, Genesis Microchip (Nasdaq: GNSS) announced
earnings, and they were good. The company reported a 75% uptick
in revenue and a narrower-than-expected loss of $0.15 a share.
Catering to the flat-panel monitor market, which is anything but
flat nowadays, the integrated circuits maker also announced that
top-line growth would exceed projections over the next few
quarters.

CELERA AT A CROSSROADS
"Over the course of the next 8 to 12 months Celera is going to
have to make some choices that will be very telling of what
shapes this company for the long term."

HAS STARBUCKS "TWEENED"?
Now that McCafes are confronting Starbucks in the marketplace,
does this mean that the company has lost its status as a Rule
Breaker?

WHAT MAKES A GOOD INVESTOR?
Followers of Warren Buffett are forever examining the attributes
that give investors an edge over the S&P 500. So what makes a
winner?
