HUMAN GENOME'S Q3
Biotech company Human Genome Sciences announced a cash-rich Q3
yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Rule Breaking biotechnology company Human Genome Sciences
(Nasdaq: HGSI) reported third-quarter (ended September 30)
earnings yesterday after the market's close. Revenues climbed
for the drug development company, while losses widened.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=185959

Human Genome's third-quarter revenues increased to $8.1 million,
compared to $7.4 million in last year's third quarter. Included
in this amount is a licensing fee the company received from
MedImmune (Nadaq: MEDI), related to a SmithKline Beecham (NYSE:
SBH) vaccine development deal.

The company lost $147 million in the quarter, including a
onetime write-off related to the $134.1 million acquisition of
Principia Pharmaceutical. Excluding this charge, Human Genome
lost $13 million, or $0.12 a share. In the year-ago period, it
lost $9.7 million, or $0.11 per share. Analysts as polled by
First Call/Thompson Financial had expected Human Genome to lose
$0.13 a share, excluding charges, so the company beat that by a
penny.

Human Genome Sciences had $849.5 million in cash and short-term
investments as of the close of the quarter. This compares to the
$466.2 million it had in cash and short-term investments at the
end of December 1999.

After the end of the third quarter, the company sold more stock
to the public and raised an additional $950 million in cash.
Counting that amount, Human Genome's current amount of cash and
short-term investments is about $1.8 billion. The company now
has about 124.8 million shares of outstanding common stock,
compared to 112.1 million at the close of the third quarter.

William A. Haseltine, Human Genome's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement, "We are pleased that our
recent efforts have brought several HGS drugs closer to the
patients who need them. At the same time, we focused on enabling
scientists at HGS and our partners to discover and develop
additional drugs that may aid more patients to lead healthier,
more active lives."

NEWS TO GO

Online auction house eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is cutting some of its
offline workers. About 15% of the employees at the eBay-owned
Butterfields fine-art auction company will be losing their jobs.
That equals about 32 people. eBay cut 13 jobs at the Chicago
Butterfields office back in July. eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove
said, "The management team at Butterfields came to the
conclusion that they will continue to move the business to the
online area."

Good-bye, MotherNature.com (Nasdaq: MTHR). Just after we lost
Pets.com (Nasdaq: IPET) and that annoyingly cute little sock
puppet, MotherNature.com announced that it, too, is shutting its
doors. MotherNature.com is the second venture backed by CMGI
(Nasdaq: CMGI) to go belly-up this week. The other, online
furniture retailer Furniture.com, announced that it's closing on
Monday. MotherNature.com spent time looking for a buyer for its
online vitamins and health products business, but could find no
takers. The company's board of directors approved a plan to
liquidate and dissolve the company on Tuesday.

Preppy-chic designer and retailer Polo Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL)
announced second-quarter results this morning. The company's
sales grew by 8% to $586.2 million, compared to $543.9 million
last year. Net income, before restructuring and other special
charges, was $48.8 million, versus $55.3 million in the year-ago
period. Earnings per diluted share on this basis were $0.50,
down from last year's $0.56. The company said the reduction in
net income and earnings per share was expected because of a
delay in recognizing some European sales results, as well as a
shift with the timing of some of its shipments.

AOL Latin America (Nasdaq: AOLA) reported first-quarter results
yesterday. The Internet services provider, which is a joint
venture between America Online (NYSE: AOL) and the Cisneros
Group of Companies, lost $0.36 a share, or $98.1 million.
Analysts had expected a loss of $0.37 a share. Revenues in the
quarter were $4.6 million. AOL Latin America said it added
191,000 users in the quarter, bringing its total number of
members to 314,000.
