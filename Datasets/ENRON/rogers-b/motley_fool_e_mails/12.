"GAME ON" FOR ACTIVISION
Video game software publisher Activision (Nasdaq: ATVI)
announced better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter (ended
March 31) results after the market's close yesterday and raised
its full-year guidance. The company earned $0.03 per share,
beating Wall Street's estimate by two cents. Meanwhile, revenues
increased 22% over the year-ago period to $127 million.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fiber optic telecom firm Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) beat Wall
Street's first-quarter expectations after the market's close
yesterday, though its loss nearly doubled from the previous
year. The company posted a loss of $675.4 million, or $0.76 per
share, compared to a loss of $348.1 million, or $0.45 per share,
in the year-ago period. That was well ahead of Wall Street's
estimate for a loss of $0.88 per share. Revenue grew to $1.1
billion from $906.6 million year-over-year.

Network storage firm EMC (NYSE: EMC) announced plans to
repurchase 50 million shares of stock. With 2.2 billion shares
outstanding, the repurchase translates to about 2.2% of the
total float. According to the company's press release, stock
purchased under the program will be available for various
purposes, including employee stock option and employee stock
purchase plans. The company said the news indicates the shares
are a good investment.

Holding company Internet Capital Group (Nasdaq: ICGE) posted a
pro forma net loss of $185 million, or $0.66 per share, compared
to a net loss of $35 million, or $0.13 per share, in the
year-ago period. The company cut 30 jobs in the quarter and will
slice another 15 next month. Moreover, Internet Capital Group
took a $1.2 billion charge because the value of its holdings has
plummeted. For example, ICGE saw a $700 million drop in
privately held software vendor Rightworks, which was recently
acquired by to i2 Technologies (Nasdaq: ITWO).

Bar code maker Brady (NYSE: BRC) said yesterday it expects
third-quarter earnings between $0.42 and $0.45 per share, well
below the $0.51 per share it posted in the year-ago period. Wall
Street's estimate calls for earnings of $0.49 per share. The
company expects sales of $134 million, versus $142.5 million in
the year-ago period. Brady also expects 2001 sales of $535
million to $550 million and earnings of $1.60 to $1.75 per
share.
