PEPSICO'S REFRESHING Q1
Soda and salty-snack giant PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) reported
first-quarter financial results this morning, turning in
earnings that beat Wall Street's forecast by a penny at $0.34
per share, up from last year's $0.29. Companywide revenues
improved 8.5% to $4.5 billion including international currency
effects, which hurt results.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price (Nasdaq: TROW) said
first-quarter net income was $0.38 per share, down significantly
from last year's $0.58 and missing Wall Street's consensus
forecast by two pennies. Revenues fell to $280.5 million from
$316.3 million a year ago as declining assets under management
cut into the fees the company could collect. For more on mutual
funds, check out our recent special by Chris Rugaber.

Internet security solutions company Entrust (Nasdaq: ENTU) named
former Nortel (NYSE: NT) executive William Conner its president
and CEO. A member of Entrust's board since 1997, Conner was
chairman from October 1998 to May 2000.

Oil company Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) said first-quarter net
income, before items, was more than $5 billion at $1.44 per
share, up from last year's $0.95. Wall Street's consensus
estimate was $1.35 per share, but the company beat that handily
because of high oil and gas prices. Revenue was $57.3 billion.

Irish drug company Elan (NYSE: ELN), profiled in a December
feature by Zeke Ashton, said Q1 net income was $0.41 per share,
up from last year's $0.24 and a penny better than estimates as
sales improved 27% to $429 million.
