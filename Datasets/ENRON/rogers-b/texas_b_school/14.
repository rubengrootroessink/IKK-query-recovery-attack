Ben

At this point there is nothing more I can do.  Your application is close to
a decision as I understand it.  I have forwarded the message below to Dr.
Harris and trust that he will evaluate it as he sees fit.

Regards
Meg

Meg:
I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my
GMAT score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on
this disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is
not a good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned
in my work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will
be able to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me
know what I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly
appreciate it.  If you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I
will do that.  Thanks again for taking the time to help me with this issue.
Ben
