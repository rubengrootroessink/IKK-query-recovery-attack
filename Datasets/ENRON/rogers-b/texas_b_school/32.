Mr. Jemison:

My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently applying to The Texas Business
School for the Fall of 2000. I was referred to you by David Martin, graduate
of the Business School and the son of John Martin, former Finance Professor.
I have worked with David at Enron for a couple of years and have learned a
great deal about the School.  I was also referred to you by Kyle Kettler,
who graduated from the Business School in 1998 and who worked in the
investment fund. I have been working in several different finance positions
within Enron for the last two and a half years.  Before coming to Enron I
worked for three years in a portfolio management group with State Street
Bank in Boston. I am very interested in the combination of energy and
corporate finance and have the desire to continue working in these
industries after business school, specifically with an Investment Bank in
their M&A department. I am coming to visit the school on Friday, Feb. 18th
and was wondering if you had time to talk to me about the Business School.
I have also read  "Managing Acquisitions"  and I am very interested in your
courses.  If you could please let me know if your available, I would greatly
appreciate it. If your not available that day, I would still like to talk
with you about the program and your courses. You can either e-mail me back
or you can reach me at Enron in Houston at (713) 853-7998. Please let me
know if you want me to send you my resume, so that you have a better
understanding of my background. The admissions office has my complete
application with my resume. Thanks in advance for taking the time to talk
with me. Hope to hear from you soon.


Ben Rogers
