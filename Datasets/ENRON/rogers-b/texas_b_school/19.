It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts.  I got some
really good feedback from all the people I talked with.  I think that UT
would be a good fit for what I'm trying to do afterwards - with there
energy-finance concentration and investment fund.  Plus it would be fun
living in Austin for a couple of years.  When your in Houston next time
wh
can grab some drinks and go to dinner.  Talk to you soon.
