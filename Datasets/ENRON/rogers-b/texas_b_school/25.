Ben:

Thanks for the e-mail message.  I'm sorry for the delayed response, but I've 
been out of the country for over a week.

I will be in the office on Friday morning at about 9:00 am.  Unfortunately, I 
have a seminar to attend later in the morning and then I have to teach all 
afternoon so my time is a little tight.  If that is convenient for your 
schedule, however, please stop by my office.

Regards,

Keith

Mr. Brown: 
My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently applying to The Texas Business 
School for enrollment in the Fall of 2000.  I was referred to you by David 
Martin, graduate of the Business School and the son of John Martin, former 
Finance Professor.  I have worked with David at Enron for a couple of years 
and have learned a lot about the School.  I also was referred to you by Kyle 
Kettler, who graduated from the Business School in 1998 and who worked in the 
investment fund.  I have been working in several different finance positions 
within Enron for the last two and a half years. Before coming to Enron I 
worked for three years in a portfolio management group with State Street Bank 
in Boston. I am very interested in the combination of energy and corporate 
finance and have the desire to continue working in these industries after 
business school. I am also very interested in the investment fund.  I feel 
that with my prior experience with State Street Bank, I could contribute a 
great deal to the fund.  I am coming to visit the school on Friday, Feb. 18th 
and was wondering if you had time to talk to me about the Investment Fund.  
If you could please let me know if your available, I would greatly appreciate 
it.  If your not available that day, I would still like to talk with you 
about the program.  You can either e-mail me back or you can reach me at 
Enron in Houston at (713) 853-7998.  Please let me know if you want me to 
send you my resume, so that you have a better understanding of my background. 
The admissions office has my complete application with my resume.  Thanks in 
advance for taking the time to talk with me. Hope to hear from you soon. 

Ben Rogers
