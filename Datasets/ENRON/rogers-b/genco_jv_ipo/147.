I'm just going to say that a permit app has not been submitted, then.

Mitch - Whether or not we qualify to even apply for an NPDES permit is 
contingent upon the results of the mercury sampling. If the Mercury 
concentration is greater than 12 ppt, we can not apply for a permit. This is 
a very low threshold and it is likely that we are not going to meet it. The 
sampling was done last week, but the results are not out yet. If the results 
show that we can meet the mercury limit, we still need to assess the cost of 
building a 3-mile pipeline to the white river. We have not yet given 
authorization to do this study. Ross Newlin is taking the lead on this.

If everything goes well, we may be able to submit an application by middle of 
December at the earliest.

Thanks Gus.  Does 4.g.  look right?  If so, do you have an estimated date?  
I'm assuming you're working on it, not Dave.

Protocol for CEMS approval - CEMS must be installed, certified, and quality 
assured as per the acid rain requirements contained in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 75. The process involves performing a series of 
initial tests, including Relative accuracy test audits (RATAs), linearity 
checks, cycle/response time checks, and calibration drifts.  It also involves 
significant recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

Subject: FW: Questions

> 4.  Initial Wheatland Visit Questions:
>
>  a.  Please provide copies of the Westinghouse performance data.
Rick, have we been able to come up with a summary sheet on the performance 
tests?

>  b.  Confirm that all warranties are in name of LLC or transferable
> to LLC.
Stuart, this one is probably more in your bag. I would suggest that we state, 
all bidders should assume that warranties will be placed in the LLC's name 
prior to closing and that all warranties are fully transferable.  (Note that 
currently, the warranties are not in the LLC's name, but are in ENA's name).

>  c.  What is the protocol for CEMS approval.
Gus, can you take a stab at this one?

>  d.  Provide water quality test results.
Don, this should now be in the DD room.

>  e.  Provide all outage reports.
Rick/Brent, do we have all of these?  Any problem with providing them?

>  f.   Provide overhaul budgeting.
Don, not yet developed.  Overhaul budgeting will be completed as any 
scheduled overhaul reaches the near-term horizon.  Our method of budgeting 
for overhauls is to accrue maintenance dollars for every start (approx $1500 
per start).  We continually re-evaluate whether we are starts based or hours 
based.  Currently, we remain starts based maintenance.

>  g.  Provide copy of application for discharge permit.
Application has not yet been submitted.  We have only entered initial 
discussions with the state.  We will submit the application once developed - 
- currently expected by xxxxx date (Gus, please verify this is true).
