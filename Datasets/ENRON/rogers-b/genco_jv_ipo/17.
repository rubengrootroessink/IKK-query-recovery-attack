Subject: Schedule of Personal Property

Although we have not yet had an opportunity to visit about this, attached is 
a schedule of "personal property" that I would appreciate your reviewing to 
verify that all items listed are in fact at the plant.  I will give you a 
little more to work with in our call this afternoon.  Thanks in advance and I 
look forward to talking with you later.

All the best.

Stuart
