Don,

The following questions/requests came out of our visit yesterday:

1.  Provide forecast for the overhaul budget.
2.  Provide forced outage (trips) reports since inception which should
include details of hours out, reasons, etc.  From the limited info we have,
we are surprised by the higher than expected trips, at least at one of the
units.  Any proposed solutions?
3.  What is the latest info on complaints on noise from neighbors?  New
petitions; responses; etc.
4.  What were the hours of operation in 1999 and 2000?  There were some
conflicts in the various info provided.
5.  Was PSD every applied for?
6.  Unit #4 seems to be running right at the 25 ppm for NOx.  If it does go
over 25 ppm, does it violate any regulations, permits, promises, etc.?
7.  The actual O&M numbers are higher than budget (almost twice the budgeted
number).  What cause this?
8.  High bearing temperatures have cause trips.  We understand that Enron
recommended this to be considered a Warranty Item.  Was it ever resolved
under warranty.
9.  Why was utilization much higher with unit 1?

Thanks.

David
