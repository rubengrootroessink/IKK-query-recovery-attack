Subject: Question 2


More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Start-up emissions vary and can not accurately be measured due to the 
inherent delay time in the CEMS system.  Additionally, start-up emissions are 
not required to be and in fact were not measured during the stack testing.  
There are no limitations on emissions during start-up evolutions, since the 
permits at both plants allow exceptions to exceedences during start-ups and 
shutdowns.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?


Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?


Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?



5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?
