I reworked the debt section to eliminate tranche 1.  Tranche 2 now amortizes 
years 1-10 and pays 11% interest.  Tranche 3 amortizes years 11-20 with 
interest of 11.2%.  I re-solved for optimal amortization schedules and face 
amounts to get a minimum coverage ratio of 2.25x and an average coverage of 
3.25x.

I removed some references to the amortization of the power contract that 
Jinsung pointed out.  I also re-hardcoded the state franchise tax for Gleason.

Let me know what else needs re-working.
