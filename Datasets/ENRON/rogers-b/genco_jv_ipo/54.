1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Normally, there is a short period during startup when the NOx goes to 
approximately 35 ppm.  This is very short in duration and occurs while the 
gas turbine is loading.  Our site is permitted to normally operate between 
70-100% turbine load.  These emissions have subsided within the few minutes 
required to attain 70% load.  Our permit constraints require that we do not 
exceed our emissions limits on a 3 hour rolling avarage.  Therefore these 
short-term startup emissions are not an issue.  

CO is a calculated value.  I do not have short-term CO2 numbers at present.  
However, I don't believe they are at issue since they are related to excess 
air which is pretty high during startup.

There is a condition called lean-lean firing which can and has occured from 
time to time.  A transition takes place above 40MW when the nozzle gas 
arrangement normally goes to a firing state called "premix steady state."  If 
this transition fails for some reason, the machine goes into a lean-lean 
state and the NOx level can rise to 40-50 ppm.  The turbine activates and 
operator alarm when this happens.  We can count the number of occurances that 
this has happened on one hand at Caledonia.  When this conditions occurs, the 
operators correct the condition by reducing the load to about 35MW and then 
increase the load again.  Typically this resolves the faulty transition and 
it configures the nozzles correctly on the second attempt.



2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No industrial stormwater permit is required at Caledonia.



3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

The fuel sampling schedule for both sulphur content and heating value at 
Caledonia is once per month.
