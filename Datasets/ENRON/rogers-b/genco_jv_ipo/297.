Katherine,

I am unsure of the direction Ross would like for me to take with the Central 
Office (Purchasing & Maintenance).  As you will see I have one ORG for all 
people associated with New Albany.  If Ross would like for it to be listed as 
two, let me know and it will be no problem to generate the second chart.  Let 
me know if I can be of anymore help.

Barbara
