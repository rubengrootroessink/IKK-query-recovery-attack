Here are the highlighted versions of the plants I've gone through.  I'm sure 
that not all the info I've flagged needs to be pulled, but I'm not sure 
exactly what the guidelines are for whether information is sensitive or not, 
so I tried to flag it all and let someone more knowledgeable than myself make 
that call.

I'm due to arrive back in Houston at 9:00 this evening (space permitting).  
I'll plan to be in late tomorrow morning (11:00 or 12:00) to continue the 
fun.  See you tomorrow.

I can be reached here for the next hour or so at 503-464-7751.

PS.  Jinsung, be careful when boxing up the stuff in my desk!  I'll bring in 
my car for you to wash tomorrow as well!
