Stu--Both were filed with FERC.  The remote control agreement was filed on 
5/8/00 ER00-2447.  The interconnection agreement was also filed with FERC, 
however, the FERC website just went down.  I will be out in the morning, so 
if you need the interconnection agreement between Westfork and Indianapolis 
Power & Light, please call my para legal  Linda Lawrence 36872 to pull for 
you.

On a conference call today dealing with the sale of the Wheatland, IN peaking 
facility, I was asked whether either the IPL Interconnection Agreement or the 
Remote Control Operating Agreement with IPL was(or should have been) filed 
with/approved by the FERC.  Do any of you have any insight into this issue?  
I was not involved in either of these agreements.  Please advise ASAP.  Many 
thanks.

Stuart
