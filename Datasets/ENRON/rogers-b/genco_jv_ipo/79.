I spoke with Gavin Gaul just now about the GA drawings for the 99 peakers.  
He said that he would have to do some poking around, because those drawings 
would have been archived a year ago.  But he thought he could get me the 
as-built site layout drawings for the plants.  The version of the Brownsville 
layout from the CD-ROM is not as-built, so maybe we should hold off on the 
layouts until we get the as-builts from Gavin.  I'll let you know as soon as 
I hear back from him.
