Let us wait until Mitchell signs and sends out the letter. Then, we can get 
them a copy of the signed letter. As far as the info in Mitchell's e-mail, I 
do not see any problem in sharing this with them. It certainly helps make our 
case that the NOV issue is resolved.

Gus.

Should this go to Cinergy?

Thanks,

Don

Gus,

I spoke with Mr. Jack Wade, TDEC concerning the Multi-Sector General Permit 
for Construction, New Storm Water Permit and NOV Status at Brownsville Power..
 
The Multi-Sector General Permit was issued for construction in lieu of Storm 
Water Permit by TDEC direction on August 7, 1998
If by July 1, 2000 the construction activities were not complete, BPI would 
have had to transfer the TMGP to a new Storm Water Permit for Construction 
that was promulgated this summer.  
 The soil erosion control & countermeasures taken and completed by BPI on 
June 15, 2000 has completely satisfied TDEC  concerns outlined in the NOV's 
dated 2-28-99 and 5-1-00.   Mr. Wade asked my opinion of vegetative 
stablization, which was the last condition by TDEC before allowing BPI to 
terminate the construction permit,  I responded that, in my opinion, the 
stablization throughout the facility was excellent.


I have attached a "Draft" letter to TDEC requesting the termination of the 
TMGP.  Please review and comment at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully Mitchell
