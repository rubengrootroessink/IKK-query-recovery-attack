Sheila:  Just in case you were wondering why you had not received an e-mail 
from me in the last hour, attached is the chart I referenced.  Please note, 
however, that it is very general and makes a number of assumptions so I would 
not treat it as "gospel."  Speak to you later.  Thanks  John

PS:  It is in WordPerfect, but hopefully you can still open it. If not, let 
me know and I'll fax it.
