NOTICE OF ROOM CHANGE AND LIST OF QUESTIONS

The meeting will now be in EB3335. The start time is still 1:30 pm.  It 
should be over by 4:00 pm.

You have been invited to attend this meeting because you posses certain 
knowledge about the peakers.  Below are the questions that DUKE has dropped 
on us.  Please take a stab at your relevant questions.  

I assume everyone on this email needs to be at the meeting.  If after reading 
the questions, you don't think that they apply to you, please call me at 
3-0492. 

If you are calling in for the meeting, call 877-322-9648 code # 809407.

I assume that after we move through a plant, the manager, developer, etc will 
be free to go.

Thanks for your help and I look forward to tomorrow's meeting. 

Don
