I think I have cleaned this one up.  I removed the PPA portion (2001-2003).  
I haven't played with the debt too much; I just reduced it to give us roughly 
the same coverages as we had in the previous model.  Please review and let me 
know what I missed -- I'm sure there are a lot of things.  I have to take off 
around 3:00 this afternoon to turn in the keys from my old apartment, so 
e-mail your changes, and I'll get on it first thing tomorrow morning.

Jon
