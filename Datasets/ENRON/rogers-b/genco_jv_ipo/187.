Don,

Below are additional questions and data requests regarding technical,
operational, and environmental aspects of the Wheatland project.  Please
respond to us at your earliest convenience.

Duke Energy North America


            Duke Energy North America Additional Data Requests
                            Wheatland Facility

1.   [Wheatland] Please provide any and all studies related to the adequacy
of the plant's water supply.

2.   [Wheatland] During construction and commissioning of the plant and
switchyard were there any spills of oil or similar events that could have
resulted in soil or groundwater contamination?  Please provide details of
any incidents. Have there been any incidents since the plant achieved
commercial operation?  Please provide details.

3.   [Wheatland] It is our understanding that the switchyard will be owned
by the project and maintained by Cinergy.  Please provide a copy of the
proposed contract with Cinergy.  What indemnification will Cinergy provide
the project related to environmental incidents in the switchyard?

4.   [Wheatland] It is our understanding that the quality of the plant's
water supply in operation differed from the level assumed during
development.  Please provide all reports and documentation related to water
quality, including original design assumptions, testing during
commissioning, and problems as a result of quality differences.

5.   [Wheatland] Please provide a listing of all Enron affiliates involved
in the development and operation (physical and commercial) of the facility.
Such listing should include a one-sentence description of the role of the
entity, whether the role is terminated or continuing, and whether a formal
contract existed between the project and the entity.  [N.B.: We would like
to have this informaiton for Lincoln and Gleason as well.]

6.   [Wheatland] Please provide a listing of all non-Enron organizations
involved in the development, design, and construction of the facility who
may have a continuing relationship with the project, including outstanding
warranties, service contracts, as well as other rights and obligations.
Indicate how the organization was engaged, role of the organization and
whether there is any currently outstanding issues with the organization.

7.   [Wheatland] Are there any formal contracts between West Fork Land
Development Company and Lake Acquisition Company? Please provide.

8.   [Wheatland] Are there any currently enforceable warranties running
from the project to the EPC contractor (We understand it to be Enron
Engineering & Construction.) or NEPCO as subcontractor?

9.   [Wheatland] Please provide all engineering studies that discuss the
structural stability or integrity of the shoreline of the "Lake".  During
the site visit it was observed that one shoreline on one side of the Lake
had been reinforced.

10.  [Wheatland] Provide any studies discussing the seismic activity in the
vicinity of the Wheatland facility.

11.   [Wheatland] Were transmission upgrades required of Wheatland by
either Cinergy or IPL? Were transmission service credits credited to
Wheatland for the upgrades? Will these credits be transferred to the
Wheatland buyer?

12.  [Wheatland] Have any outages of the plant's interconnection occurred
as a result of high wind, blowing dust or lightning since commercial
operation?  If yes, how many incidents and for how long was the
interconnection out of service?
