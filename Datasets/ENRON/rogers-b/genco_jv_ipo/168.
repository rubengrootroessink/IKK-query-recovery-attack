I have split out section 4 of the DPL since I received two copies of DPL's 
request.  Please cut and paste as you will.  In my attachments I have added 
some comments in all the documents.  Please cut and paste as you will if I'm 
off-base.  I have attached a excel spreadsheet which details the start ramps 
of the units for those who asked the question.  Basically the units take 
about 25-26 minutes to be at baseload.  I will be sending much of the DPL 
information via fax (CEMS reports and many documents they have asked for but 
I don't have electronic).  Please have your fax machine printer cartridge 
ready Monday AM first thing.  On the CRP and SOP-Ramiro Garcia has those and 
can forward those to you very early Monday AM.
