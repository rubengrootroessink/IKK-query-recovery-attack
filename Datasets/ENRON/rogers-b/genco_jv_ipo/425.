My comparison stops at Operating Margin because our analysis is done on a 
pretax basis and the debt service schedule are identical.  The primary 
difference is due to their assumptions with regards to annual merchant sales 
of available capacity after meeting contractual requirements.  We tried to 
value the merchant sales and it dragged down the value of the plants so we 
left it at 0.  Not suprisingly they are more bullish about their ability to 
sale the available electrons.  Take a look at the attachment and if you have 
any questions my cell # is (713)503-3107.  Thanks!
