Subject: Dave Delainey's Additional Requests

As per the presentation with Dave yesterday and a follow up conversation with 
him today, we need the following:

Kate:   Run the model based on the "break even cost #'s" in comparison to 
GENCO's #'s assuming a 6 1/2% fixed interest 
  rate. (As per Dave Don Miller's GENCO group should be able to supply us 
with their comparable #'s).
 Also run the model based on MAIN and ECAR curves ( we have already run the 
#'s on Cinergy and West NY).   
 Produce a graph showing the different curves, including ICF-Kaiser.  
 Also show a graph comparing Moore's tariff build up (based on the 30 yr 
curve) for Fixed and Variable O&M,    principal, interest. etc.  (Jonathan 
Hoff should be of great help here).

Miguel:  Get market comps from the Confidential-CSFB study that Don Miller 
has giving Asset Pricing comps for Power   Plants (GENCO related).  Also look 
to get any other market/asset sales info. we showed to Orion.
 Meet with the desk to get the MAIN and ECAR curves Dave has requested we 
run. (for Kate's proforma).  
 Since Miguel is out after Thursday, Adam  should coordinate and follow up in 
Miguel's absence.

He also gave us go ahead for the DASH and RAROC. Kate was cleaning up the 
DASH and the model to pass on to  Underwriting.

Joe D. and Lisa B. are following up on the Syn. Lease structure getting with 
the banks.  

Eric will of course address all the other issues including technical, 
transmission interface, turbine purchase, permitting, etc.

As you know, Dave wanted this done in tandem with all the other development 
projects, which means ASAP.

Thanks, Thomas.
