I have a meeting with Dave on Monday at 8:30am. We will be bringing the deal
guys (Bill Grealis, Chuck Winger, Art Vivar, myself and possibly one other)
so we're ready to listen and make something shake loose. I am also going to
contact Rich Kinder this week to talk about the possibilities.

I very much appreciate your input and your insight and would welcome your
help when the time is right. As a side note you may have heard that
Madeleine Ludlow has left to pursue other business interests and we are in
the hunt for a corporate CFO and talent as I mentioned is my number one
priority. As to your inclusion in this meeting I will inquire with Dave as
to the attendees and mention your name as a good participant. (Dave's call
obviously). Thanks again....

Mike:

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  I left you Rich
Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.
Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look
at.
I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings the
growth
story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the development team,
Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, trading and
operating
expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work togther with regards to
the
trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I just finish reading regarding
generation spinoffs - I think it will be helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman,
Dave's
assistant informed me that you were coming up next week, and I wanted to
know if
you wanted me to be there or not or if you wanted me to prepare anything for
you
for the meeting.

Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.
Regards,
Ben
