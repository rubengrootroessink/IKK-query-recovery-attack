=09=09=09 1.  The correct answer is choice (B).  Statement (1) tells us how=
 many more=20
people were in City X than in City Y, but since we don't know the total=20
population of either, we can't definitively answer this question. We can=20
eliminate (A) and (D), and we're down to (B), (C), or (E).=20
=09=09=09
=09=09=09At first glance, statement (2) may not seem helpful since it talks=
 about=20
Mormons and Buddhists, but in fact, this statement is sufficient. The 300,0=
00=20
Mormons make up 20% of the population of City X, meaning that we can comput=
e=20
the entire population (five times 300,000, not that we needed to know the=
=20
exact figure). The 141,000 Buddhists make up 30% of City Y, meaning that we=
=20
can compute the entire population of City Y as well.=20

=09=09=092.  (E)  This is a causal argument. According to the experts, high=
 prime-time=20
ratings cause the ratings of the evening news show to increase as well.=20
However, at Channel NTR, this was not found to be true. What conclusion can=
