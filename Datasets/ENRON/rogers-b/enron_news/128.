Enron recently introduced its Global Information System (GIS) as the first of 
a series of activities designed to enhance and improve the accuracy and 
accessibility of employee data. 4,578 employees responded and provided 
up-to-date information on themselves.  This represents a response of 
approximately 55% of the employees asked to participate. 

 Accurate data will play an important role in several key company-wide 
initiatives in the coming months, such as the SAP implementation and an 
expert directory, which will include a new on-line phone directory and 
employee skills.

The GIS provides you a vehicle to use in updating your personal information 
including your phone extension, office location, home address, current job 
responsibilities, as well as, existing skills and educational background.   
You are the best source of accurate information about you!  

Since you have not yet updated your information, I urge you to do so today.  
The GIS system will be available for your use through Friday, March 31.



You can access GIS from the Enron Intranet in one of two ways:
1. from the Enron Home page (home.enron.com)
2. from the HRWeb Home page (hrweb.enron.com)
Look for the link to GIS in the "New" section of either page.

As a first time user, please click on the "New User" button to enter your ID 
and set your password.  Your individual login ID is either your SSN (Social 
Security Number) or your SIN (Social Insurance Number - Canada).  To prevent 
someone from accessing or altering your GIS file without authorization, 
please keep your ID and password private.

You can contact the HRIS Helpdesk at (713) 853-5666, option #1 for 
application assistance.

Please update your personal GIS file by FRIDAY, MARCH 31.
