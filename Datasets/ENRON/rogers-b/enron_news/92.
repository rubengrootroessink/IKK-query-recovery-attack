? The Associate/Analyst Participants have been selected this year to be the 
pilot group to utilize a new software package that Enron has purchased.  Your 
input and participation is important in piloting this new environment.  Your 
answers will be compiled with the rest of Enron.  In order to pilot the 
functionality of this new software, the Program Participants will be 
accessing the survey through a different URL, which will be distributed in an 
email message. 

Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience 
at Enron and what we can do to help make it better.  That's why we want to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's "Excellence 
Through Communication" employee survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse 
more accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will help 
us correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to 
work.

There are a few things we want you to remember about "The Pulse."

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.

2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best 
to  cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action 
preventative   processes that will help identify smaller problems before they 
become major ones.   We will be asking people for help in resolving some of 
the issues that are collected  in the survey - your active role will help us 
identify the best solutions.

So take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think and how 
you feel about your job and about Enron.

We look forward to hearing from you.
