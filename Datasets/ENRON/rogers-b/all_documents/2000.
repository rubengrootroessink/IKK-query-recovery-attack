Attached is the BaseModel3 which a note/questions page has been added to 
highlight changes made to the basemodel3 as well as questions regarding the 
specifics for the LES project. The Bernstein model is also attached with 
changes made to reflect the LES project.  In some cases, numbers have been 
changed to zero in places where LES specific information is needed in both 
models. Marilyn
