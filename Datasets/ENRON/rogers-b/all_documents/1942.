Best data we have for a 7FA simple cycle is the East Coast Power Linden #7 
that NEPCO did.

EPC cost for single unit was $63,000,000 based on a $34,000,000 7FA cost. 
Scope was for 7FA with CO catalyst and stack, generator breaker, main power 
transformer, 4160 V switchgear, 480 switchgear, small control room, light oil 
tank and pumps for backup fuel, natural gas heater.

Best data we have for 7FA combined cycle is Pittsburg.

This is better data than what Ben Rogers got on Paducah. I was able to get a 
better CCTG model run so performance is better than my wild guess Monday. EPC 
cost is roughly same basis, did do some adds and subtracts based on your 
memo. May not have captured everything but should be in the ball park. 
Numbers should be useful for conceptual screening proformas to see if we are 
in ballpark, we should do a tasking letter and a complete conceptual 
scope/performance/estimate if you need any numbers that we might base 
something we put on an offer table. Obviously not reviewed or approved by 
anybody.

Ben

I will rerun your data in same form for Paducah - should look better

Thanx Bruce

Subject: Request for 7FA estimate

Bruce,

Per my voicemail, I am requesting an estimate for 7FA capital costs and heat 
rate for a proposed expansion of an IPP acquisition. We will be putting 
together a model to come up with an all-in capital cost ($/kw) for a single 
cycle, and possibly combined cycle facility with 1-3 7FAs and 0-1 steam 
turbines.  The maximum MW of the site would be approximately 500 MW, so we 
would like to consider the following configurations: 

1, 2, or 3 gas turbines single cycle, for a total of 170, 340, or 510 MW.
2 gas turbines plus one steam turbine in combined cycle, for a total of 510 
MW. 

Here are some specifics about the facility:
located in Lakewood NJ (east PJM)
primary fuel is natural gas, with a back up fuel of heavy fuel oil
expansion on site of current 238 MW combined cylce facility (2 ABB GT 11N1, 
w/ ABB KT Steam turbine )
for option 1: peaking facility, 25% dispatch
for option 2: baseload facility, 90% dispatch
total capacity of pipe is 150 MMcf, and current project uses only 30 MMcf 
(e.g. sufficient gas pipeline)

From my discussions with Ben Rogers, I understand that the numbers were 
approximately $34-36 MM/turbine and installed capital cost was $571/kwh for 
27FAs in combined cycle, at a heat rate of 7300.

Please let me know if this information is enough to get an estimate of the 
turbine costs, heat rate, VO&M, start-up costs, and fuel requirements.  
Please give me a call when you get this so we can pick a time to discuss the 
project further. 

Regards,
Tracee
