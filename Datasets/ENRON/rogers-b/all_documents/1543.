We are now the "ENRON 400" and have been officially notified that we have 
earned first position in the Super Team Start.  That means we are the very 
first out the gate again this year!  AWESOME !  Thanks to all of you for your 
recruiting efforts. We've gained 125 riders from last year.  MEET YOUR TEAM 
IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF TULLY STADIUM.  

To start this adventure, just show up with your bike and all your gear at 
Tully Stadium, I-10 & Dairy Ashford no later than 6:00 AM on Saturday, the 
15th.  The feeder road going east on I-10 from Dairy Ashford leads you to 
Tully Toad, dedicated as a one-way street that morning.  Turn right onto 
Tully and enter Tully Stadium grounds in the first 3 gates.  No vehicles of 
any kind  will be allowed into the parking lot from Dairy Ashford, so save 
yourself some time and just follow the crowd in from the feeder road.   
Please park your vehicle and then go ask questions if needed so that you 
don't jam up the entrance.  There are 3 drop-off points for your luggage.  
Each rider should have 2 luggage tags which are the same numbers as your 
helmet and bike numbers.

7:00 AM The "Enron 400" out the gate!

(You have a Tully Stadium map in your rider manual)

The Top Team Start will be at 7:00 AM, staging at 6:30 AM, and it's very 
important to be there on time.  If you're not in the staging area in time for 
our start, you'll be stuck back with the crowd and it could take you as long 
as two hours to get out the gate.  Allow enough time to park, unload luggage, 
and get geared up, remembering that the freeway will be jammed up even that 
early.   We want you there for the team picture, and we don't want to leave 
without you, so please be there plenty early (I recommend arriving at 5:30 
AM).  Please wear your Enron jersey the first day.  This helps us to quickly 
identify who should be starting with us.  I did consent to let five IZUZU 
riders start with us.  Since they're sponsoring the whole event, I figured 
you guys wouldn't mind.  So just be nice!

If you have any questions about any of this, please email me or call me at 
713-646-6569.  I'll be out of the office the rest of this week in attending a 
conference,  but will be checking messages and email when possible.  My home 
number is 713-977-1527 and cell phone is 713-503-6313.  On Friday I'm picking 
up my kids who are flying in and getting their bikes ready, etc., but call if 
you need anything.
