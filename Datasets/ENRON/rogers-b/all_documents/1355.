Don,

Attached are three docs: (1) the revised PPA term sheet which I believe has
all of the changes, (2) the General Terms and (3) a redline of the General
Terms highlighting my questions/comments.  Generally Delainey was a genius
as expected but a few things really ought to be tightened down before the
doc is sent.
