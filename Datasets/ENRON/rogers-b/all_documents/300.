I sent this guy your credentials - he emailed back and said tomorrow he will
let us know if his phantom crew ever called him back! As of today he had 
heard nothing.

I'll get back to you

Well,

Laurel told me you are interested in crewing in the upcoming Circuit race
(11th & 12th).  Sounds good.  How much experience to you have on the pointy
end of the boat??

I have a tentative crew but he would like to do middle and tactics.  He was
supposed to get back with me over the weekend but has not done so yet.

Laurel mentioned that you know someone else.  They have any experience??

How are you on tactics??

Greg
