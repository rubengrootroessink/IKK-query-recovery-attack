It appears as though you are scheduled for a 4 pm visit currently - you may
have changed it without realizing.

My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently signed up for AdmissionVisit for
Friday the 18th at 3:00 pm and I would like to change it to 4:00 pm because
I am meeting with a professor at 2:30 pm and it would run into the 3:00 pm
appointment.  Please let me know if I can move it to the 4:00 pm time as
soon as possible.  Thank you!
Ben
