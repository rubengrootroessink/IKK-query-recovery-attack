Thomas,

Here is a Calpine deal summary.

ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from EE&CC.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw/month) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, dispatch, and cite of the plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

Money making scenario: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of 
ENA curve.

I think it will be helpful if Scott or Thomas call EE&CC to get VOM ASAP, so 
that we can talk to Structuring group. If someone just needs to have Eastern 
PJM curve, we can try to get from Structuring group. Thank you.
