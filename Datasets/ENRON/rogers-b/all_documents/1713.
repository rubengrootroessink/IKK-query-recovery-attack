Greetings, Mr. Rogers

We are now in possession of your TEXASMBA admission application.  Though it
has not yet completed the formal review process, you are correct in your
assessment that your GMAT score may prove to be a tremendous negative in
your overall competitive profile.

Before I conclude our final review, I would ask that you further clarify to
me the nature of the learning disability you mention in your fourth essay.
I am especially interested in how this disability directly affects your
performance in a timed, test situation, as well as the traditional classroom
setting.

Also, you mention in your essay that you have "... overcome this disability
..."   I would ask that you cite for me the specific steps you have taken to
accomplish this feat, and by what measures you may make this claim.

Finally, I would ask that you summarize for me the reasons why you feel your
level of academic performance at Catholic University of America will not be
replicated in the graduate business classroom here at The TEXAS Graduate
School of Business.

As you consider your responses to these questions, I am placing your
application on "hold".  No final decision will be made until you are
satisfied that you have provide whatever additional information you feel
appropriate and merited.

I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you for your interest in The
TEXAS Graduate School of Business.

Dr. Harris:

    After receiving an e-mail from Meg Brooks, she has informed me that she
as sent my e-mail on to you.  I wanted to make sure that I have properly
provided enough information to the Admissions office regarding my low GMAT
score.  Three weeks ago I visited the school to participate in a information
session, Admissions Visit and to visit with Professors' Sheridan Titman,
Ehud Ronn, Keith Brown and David Jemison.  The discussions I had with
Professors Titman and Ronn were to discuss the Energy Finance Program, which
I intend to pursue at the school and as a career after graduation.  After
talking with them, they seemed to think that I would be a good fit with the
School and especially the Energy Finance Program.  Due to my disability
towards tests such as the GMAT, I feel that the GMAT is not a good indicator
of how I will perform at UT.  Through the experiences I have had with State
Street Bank and especially with Enron, two very competitive environments, I
know that I will continue to be successful at the Texas Business School.
    Please let me know if  you want me to provide this documentation on my
disability or if you what to meet in person I will come to Austin to meet
with you.  I know that UT would be a perfect fit for the skills I have
attained to help me contribute to the program as well as learn the skills I
need to build on and further my career in the energy-finance industry..
    Thank you in advance for taking the time to review my application.  I
hope that I have provided all the information you need to make an informed
decision.  Hope to have a chance to meet you in the near future.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers
