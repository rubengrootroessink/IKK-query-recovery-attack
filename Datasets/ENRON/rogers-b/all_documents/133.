On second thought, please forward this, along with the gas volume info., to 
the appropriate parties at Cinergy.  Please send the below as opposed to the

Responses to Cinergy's Gas Transport Questions

Brownsville
1)  Verify Type of Transportation Service and Identify location of 2 hour 
notice.
Transportation is provided  under  ITS Service Agreement Contract No. 10290 
.  This contract  is ANR's  pro forma ITS Agreement from its FERC Gas 
Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the various rate letters 
(most recent dated September 20, 2000), the Operating Agreement (dated March 
31, 1999) and the Additional ANR Transportation Service letter (dated March 
30, 1999).  These three agreements were assigned to Brownsville Power I, LLC 
per the Assignment Agreement dated December 1, 1999.  

Specific to the question of the two hour notice, Brownsville's rights are 
identified in the Operating Agreement under Article 1 on page 2 of the 
agreement (See Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03).  ANR's two hour notice rights 
are also identified under Article 1 (See 1.05).  Please note that ANR's two 
hour notice right is subject to the plant having taken delivery of gas 
volumes per Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03.

2)  On ETS Conversion right, is ETS service seasonal or annual?
The seasonality of the conversion is not addressed under the Additional 
Transportation Letter dated March 30, 1999.  ANR's FERC Gas Tariff does not 
preclude a seasonal application of the ETS service.  
3)  Provided gas volumes burned at plant.
To be provided under separate cover.

Caledonia
1) Identify location of FT-BH rights in transaction documents (FT-A Contract).
Transportation is provided  under  Gas Transportation Agreement Service 
Package No. 29230.  This contract  is TGP's  pro forma Agreement from its 
FERC Gas Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the Firm 
Transportation Discount Letter dated April 7, 1999.  Additional 
transportation rights negotiated by Caledonia, such as FT-BH (page 4) and the 
FT-A replacement contract (page 5), are included in a letter dated March 31, 
1999 titled "Commercial agreement with:  CALEDONIA POWER I, L.L.C., Natural 
Gas Transportation". 
2) Identify location of 4.5 Bcf/yr obligation in transaction documents (FT-A 
Contract).
This provision is included in the  Firm Transportation Discount Letter dated 
April 7, 1999 (See page 2 and 3, Article 3).
3) Provide gas volumes burned at the plant.
To be provided under separate cover.
