Ben,
Are you loking more for focused refresher work?
I can certainly try and get something set up. The main problem I may have is
staffing.
I will send out an email to my GMAT instructors and find out if my really
good teachers have any time outside of their jobs and teaching. Evenings are
best? How about your weekends? When are you planning on re-testing?
I will return your call as soon as I can. We are a little short staffed so I
am on the phone a bit more than normal.
Thanks!
Amy

Amy:
I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get
into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from
the Princeton Review.  I have realized that I need  one on one  sessions to
help me really prepare for the GMAT.  If you can point me in the right
direction, I would greatly appreciate it.  I was looking to start sessions
as soon as possible. Again, thanks for your help with this issue.
