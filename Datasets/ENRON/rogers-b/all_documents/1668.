Greetings, Mr. Rogers

Your initial response to my request for a information regarding your
disability  is adequate at this time.

As for your comment regarding the prospects for an improved GMAT exam
score -- if you do not feel you will be able to improve your score through a
retake, I am unclear why you are making the attempt.  We have no interest in
you retaking the test just to retake the test.  Only if you strongly feel
your score can be improved should you even consider the attempt.  Only you
know if your first score is truly reflective of the best score you can
receive -- disability or not.  That is the reason the option to retake the
test was presented to you as it was.

My advice is do not retake the test if you feel your current score is the
best examination result you can achieve.  If, however, and for whatever
reason you feel your current score does not reflect your best examination
results -- then do proceed with the reexamination.

Regardless of your decision, I remain available for whatever assistance I
might provide as you now continue to consider the options before you.

Dr. Harris:
Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling with work and I just got back an
hour
ago.  I can try and retake the GMAT exam if this will help my overall
application file.  I must say, due to my disability, I don't think my score
would improve dramatically.  I can also send you a summary (or the whole
report)
on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my
disability.  I can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues
I
work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work.  If you could let
me
know what information would help best  explain my disability, I would
appreciate
it.  Thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay.
Ben
