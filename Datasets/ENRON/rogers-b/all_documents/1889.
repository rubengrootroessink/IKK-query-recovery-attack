 assumptions based on following with Bruce's notes

Development of 1 LM 6000 facility in a urban area for the purposes of=20
supplying the rapid load growth.  ENA will contribute the turbines to=20
Rochester and build the facility, while Rochester will own, operate and=20
finance the facility.  Rochester currently has a Westinghouse 251B=20
(oil-fired), which is dedicated to =01&SMPA=018.  ENA will receive 100% of =
the=20
output through a PPA for the first year (summer 01) and 50% of the output=
=20
from 2002 through 2005.  The following are the project specifics:
? 1 LM 6000 Turbine
? Rochester actually needs only 23 MW=01,s from the facility - assume want =
full=20
Enhanced Sprint and maximized output for summer conditions
? Needs substation and compressor=01,s (NNG is only 400 psi). - Substation=
=20
estimate of $5.8M to $6.0 looks really high. I would usually assume single=
=20
transformer and connection to an existing bus - so one breaker/switch combo=
 -=20
maybe $935,000 for a greenfield - maybe 775,000 on the way high side for th=
is=20
opportunity unless RPC needs some sort of major expansion and this really=
=20
includes transmission lines, .....I will assume 115 kV on a transformer and=
=20
we will add as Owners cost the $5.8M.

will do compression to 700 psig from 400 psig
? Peoples is the closest LDC
? No SCR Needed; Water-injection with water on-site - assume trailer demin,=
=20
12 hours of storage
? Non-PSD
? Main fuel will be natural gas (100% of the time) with Fuel oil #2 as back=
up=20
- will have as dual fuel unit, assume no storage based on existing at site,=
=20
will have forwarding pump
? Water source will be from a local muni water system -need to get water=20
analysis so we can get good cost/1000 gal estimate

Assume that we want bidable performance numbers - we need tasking letter to=
=20
cover Engineering pulling the ambient weather data and running performance=
=20
(capacity and heat rate - will generate new & clean with EPC margins along=
=20
with expected heat rates for first 4 years based on 1500 hours operation pe=
r=20
year)

Assume we want cost estimate - Nepco just did a single unit estimate and is=
=20
going out with a proposal (cost is $26,000,000 starting from what they=20
indicated was the ENA LM pricing - no scope list so Mike and I will see ifn=
'=20
we can sweet talk Redmond out of a copy). Probably should get a Nepco two d=
ay=20
version - I will fill the shett out and work through Mike Coleman to get=20
Nepco on cost.

Likely will special noise considerations. we don't have an estimate -=20
probably should engage consultant to do quick study and see what we might b=
e=20
faced with.
Any site data available? plot plans, substation one-lines, ....????

Here is the summary of the Rochester deal.  Oscar, Russ and I would like to=

sit down with you tomorrow to discuss the specifics of the deal. Please let=

me know if you need anymore info than this and let me know what time is bes=
