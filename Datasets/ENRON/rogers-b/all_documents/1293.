Good to hear from you.  Happy Anniversary.  Arianna is growing everyday.  I
have been working long hours,
so she looks different every time I come home to her and Kati.  Kati is
well, trying to adjust to motherhood and
constantly watching over the baby.  She is off until September 1.  No major
plans for the summer.  Going to
Boston the third week in July for 5 days.  My golf game is barely treading
above water.  Don't play enough.  Such
is life.  Say hello to Megan and your family for me.  I hope we can get
together when you are in town. Until then, go sox.

Jon

Hey Jon;
Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.  Megan and I are going over to
Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.
I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of
graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the
weekends as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Go Sox!
Ben
