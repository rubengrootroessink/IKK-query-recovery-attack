Ben, 
Following up with our conversation earlier in the week regarding changes to 
the LM6000 model, I had tried speaking with Clement before he left for Asia 
but nothing materialized.  George and myself would like to have the model in 
suitable form with these chages (I have attached the file) in working shape 
quickly, ideally no later than the end of next week.  I am more than willing 
to help you with this in any way - especially explaining our proposed changes.

Why don't you review the changes and I'll drop by tomorrow to discuss a 
timeline.
