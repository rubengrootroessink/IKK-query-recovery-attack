Regarding Question #8 on the Wheatland section...
 LMS-MA is a service we did not elect to participate in - therefore the 
number in the 'blank' that
was illegible was zero.  We keep all balances on OBA - which has no daily 
charges and a mth end cashout.

Regarding question #8:
   
   Wheatland has a zero for "DDQ" under our LMS-MA balancing agreement 
because Wheatland has elected not to have storage
  or "swing" rights associated with the LMS-MA service.   If Wheatland would 
have elected the storage option associated with the LMS-MA
  schedule, a number > zero would have been entered and would constitute the 
amount of "swing" in which variance charges would be 
  assessed.
