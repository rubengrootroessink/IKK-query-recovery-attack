Lou,

OK...I've decided to skip the formal presentation tomorrow but I do suggest 
we publish an agenda.  I do have to prepare something for the rating agencies 
Monday but those are entirely different meetings.  Proposed agenda:

Concepts behind development of Enron's product
Questions regarding Enron term sheet
Integration of Enron into CCC's financing
Preliminary Enron due diligence discussion
Rating agency strategy
Timeline and decision points
Next steps and deliverables

I would like to send this around so please comment this AM.  I quite sure 
you'll have some constructive criticism.

regards,

Don
