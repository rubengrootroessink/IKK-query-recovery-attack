1. Do the cost of linears (gas, transmission, and system upgrades)
include tax grossups relating thereto?

2. Is the cost of backup power (for startup and station service)
included in the variable O&M estimate or is it included in one of the fixed
charges.  Please tell us where it is and how much it is expected to be
annually.
