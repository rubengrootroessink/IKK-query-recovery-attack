All,

This morning I provided the following info and documents.  I will correspond 
with all of you but am sending the documents to Mitch Robinson's fax machine 
unless requested to do otherwise by Mitch.

1.  I fax'd to Mitch and Stuart Zisman the results of the "Personal Property" 
inventory.
2.  I fax'd Mitch the most recent water bill.  To the best of my knowledge 
there is no contract with the Town of Caledonia for water.  We utilize an 
industrial user account.  The account number (14670) is on the bill. 
3.  I fax'd Mitch the Emergency Action Plan.  This plan is under revision.  I 
sent the existing plan as well as the portion of the plan where revisions are 
complete.
4.  I also sent the Semi-Annual Excess Emissions Report.

After lunch I will send the CEMs QA/QC documents and CEMs data which has been 
requested.

Site personnel, under my direction conducted a spot check of spare parts 
utilizing the most recent inventory list provided by Jim Meyer.  I certify 
that the spare parts inventory, based upon this spot check, is substantially 
complete including the high-dollar components.

Regards,
Pat Cathers
