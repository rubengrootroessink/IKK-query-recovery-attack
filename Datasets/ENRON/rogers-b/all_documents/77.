Michael:
Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't
have time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As
you already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see
you guys lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to
some middle ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for
what its worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the
lawyers don't run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the
commercial side.  Hope this helps.
Ben
