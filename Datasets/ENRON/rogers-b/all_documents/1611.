Mr. Black,
Tom Zenner asked me to follow up with you regarding the Delmarva Heat rate,
as he is out of town for the rest of the week.  Pursuant to the proforma
you have, the heat rate is estimated to be 9,579 Btu/KWh HHV.  I hope this
is what you are looking for.  If not please don't hesitate to contact me at
713-546-2578.

Regards,
Patrick Smith
