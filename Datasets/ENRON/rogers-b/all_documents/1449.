Maybe the message is garbled but 4 7FA's and 2 STG's (probably two 2 X 1 
CCGT's) should be nominally $470,000,000 based on the Pittsburg CCGT out in 
California (but includes no real EPC contractor margin/contingency so will 
not match what Nepco or other third parties might bid), would nominally be 
480 MW at 95F for each 2 X 1 so about 960 MW for all. I think this works out 
to about $489/kW. This based on about $34,000,000 for each GE7FA so pricing 
will adjust if market price higher or lower.

I honestly don't and have not seen a 501G price. I did see 701G prices in 
Asia and they appeared to be about 5% lower per kilowatt than 701F and 
GE9FA's. In this hot market they maybe at a premium due to better heat rate 
and larger unit size. I would suggest $515/kW as a go by. I have called John 
Garrison to see what current pricing and delivery is - also to see if 
performance might be a touch better than our maybe two year old model. Do we 
want to get an estimate from Nepco or a benchmark from my estimator's? I 
would need a charge number/tasking letter.

We are still looking for capital costs for a 730 MW plant in Texas, which 
comprises of 4 FA's and 2 STG's.  We are currently using $450 MM for a total 
project cost number, which comes out to be $616/Kw.
Thanks
