Hey there,

How is it going in Texas?  Did you go skiing this year?  Did you get the
message that I called from Hong Kong?  This has been one incredible
adventure.  The workday is long but the time flies.  It is also great to
work with people who are so dedicated and willing to try new things.  We are
now in the Persian Gulf so keep an eye on the news, if anything happens here
we either caused it or are caught in the middle of it.

What does your apartment look like?  I am getting your wedding present from
the Mid East and no, it is not your own pet camel.  That is for me.  I need
to know the colors you like or better yet the colors Megan likes in a rug.
I also need the size you want.  Think of what and where you would put it
when buy a house.  These things last forever and appreciate in value (as
long as you don't have a dog!).

I talked with OB via email and we are both going to try and enter the NYC
marathon this fall.  Are you doing this?  Its Saturday morning on the ship
and it is just like any other work day.  I am going for a 75 minute run.
Talk to you later.
