Don,
Attached are the Gleason and Lincoln presentations.  Other than some 
polishing on the Lincoln audio and the final framing these two are 
complete.    I will be back up here later this afternoon to finish the rest.  
Please review these and let me know if the quality of the imaging are 
satifactory.
I will need to get with you and discuss the final delivery format later 
today.  There are some issues with using Real vs. SWF.  Will explain later.  
If you have questions or concerns please contact Pam Rosen.  I will call you 
when I get back in the office.
Thanks,
Chris
