Scott,

Here is a Calpine update. 

Deal summary:
 - ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
 - Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
 - ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
 - Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of 
ENA bid curve.

Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from Scot Chambers.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, heat rate, gas curve, dispatch, and location 
of the plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

While we are waiting for VOM from Scot Chambers, we will use VOM number from 
other LM-6000 deal (please see attached email sent to Structuring group by 
Ben). As soon as we hear from Structuring group, I will give you indicative 
numbers. Sorry for the delay. Thank you.

PS: If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not sure 
what exactly this is for.
