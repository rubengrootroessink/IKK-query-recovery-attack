Ben:

I don't know exactly what to recommend because I am not involved in the
admissions process.  I think that you may need to give them some sort of
documentation about the nature of your disability and demonstrate that this
will not carry over to your class performance.

I think the question is the following: Can you explain why you cannot
perform on a GMAT test but will be able to successfully perform on the
tests in your MBA classes?

I hope this is helpful and apologize for the stress we put our applicants
through.

regards,


Sheridan
