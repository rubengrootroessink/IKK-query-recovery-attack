Quick question:

Do the heat rates you have in your spreadsheet change with the addition of 
chillers?  We are looking at an LM6000 deal in Entergy in which the customer 
would add chillers (no cost to us) and I wonder if this changes heat rate.  
Thanks for your time,

Claire

Here are the Regional Heat Rates that should help you with the structuring 
models.  Give me a call if you have any questions.
