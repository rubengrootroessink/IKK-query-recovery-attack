  Jesse,

  You should have four books via FedEx by Friday morning.  We
look forward to
  seeing you guys on Monday.  I assume we are to come to your
office on Redwood
  Street.

  Let me know if you have any problems getting the books or if
I can answer any
  preliminary questions.

  Thanks,

  Don
