Ben and Jinsung,

We have not had time to pass this information by the traders.  If we resolve 
the issues regarding location, unit contingency, etc., we can get a better 
number from the traders.  For now, these are indicative prices only.  Once we 
understand the deal better, we can talk to the traders and get a firmer 
price.  Also, Jim Fallon has requested that his traders receive a term sheet 
prior to agreeing to a price.

Here is the information you requested, based on the assumptions sent in the 
e-mail below:

Further assumptions:
180 MW
Priced at PJM East hub, no cost is added for any transmission
Must be called in 16 hour blocks
Total start costs: $1200 per start ($300 per turbine)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability

3 year capacity:  $3.80 kw/mo
5 year capacity:  $3.74 kw/mo

We are looking for a 3 and 5 year capacity number ($/kw-mo.) one number for

regarding the project.  Thanks for your help.
