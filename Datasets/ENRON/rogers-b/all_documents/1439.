Attached is a revised and updated 2000 Weekly Cost Report.  Please review the 
changes, which I have summarized below, and call if you have any questions.  
Thanks Amy 3-7805

1.  For the Wilton and Gleason projects,  the Current Forecast was overstated 
by the amounts paid to Nepco on April the 28th.  This resulted in a 
significant erroneous variance of about $27 million.  In other words, I 
didn't reduce the forecast by the amount of the payment.

2. The unapproved Acceleration Scope change on Lincoln, approximately $14 
million , has been broken out separately to be consistent with the other 2 
projects as a separate variance explanation.

3.  The EECC Fixed Fee of $3 million per project has been removed from both 
the Original Budget and Current Forecast. as requested by Dave Delainey.
