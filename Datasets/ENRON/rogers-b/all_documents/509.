This info was asked on another.  Here is what we supplied and this is per the 
design not empirical.  Martin Dick is the design engineer at Nepco.  425 415

Based on the plant design (not measured values), the Full Load Parasitic
would be about 4,600 kW, the "Stand-By" Parasitic load would be about 385 kW
(power backfed through GSU Transformers). If the plant is held in "Stand-By"
without the GSU's energized, then the parasitic drops to about 85 kW.

Mike Connelly is expected back in Bothell tomorrow. He should be checking
his e-mail so you might want to sent him a message (if you haven't done so
already).
