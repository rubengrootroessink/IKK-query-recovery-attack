Ben,

I just wanted to follow up with you and see if there was any progress in 
updating the White Paper.  Also, please let me know if there is any way I can 
assist in developing the White Paper further.  We are still waiting to get 
some input from insurance players as to how to best address their needs and 
concerns.  Further, I would appreciate if you could forward me any materials 
that you or Don have collected on the economics of the transaction and Enrons 
role in managing the position.

Thanks.

Gaurav
