Ben,

Another issue I have in my mind is how we handle revenue after 3 and 5 years. 
Since Calpine will have only 3 or 5 year tolling agreement, it is appropriate 
to assume Calpine's revenue will come purely from market. Therefore, we may 
just need one line of revenue, rather than breaking into capacity payment and 
energy payment. Let's talk to Scott when he gets back to Houston.

Yes I am working on that with Bruce Golden to reduce that.  It should be more 
like 5 to 6 months for the construction.
