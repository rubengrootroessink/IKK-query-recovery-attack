Don:  your list doesn't reference Ben J's request for Chicago:  based on LM 
6000's and the ABB's.  I know we have not been able to sit down with Clement 
to extrapolate on what he already has on Chicago (MAIN).  

BenT & Ben R:  let's get together heat rates for each of the referenced 
plants (there should be very little variable with inlet chilling on the LM's) 
but I have very little info on the West Coast projects.    
Thanks, Thomas.

I have scheduled a call at 10:00 Houston time on Monday to talk with ICF 
about a new curve for LV, Pastoria, Louisiana, Florida and Missouri.  They 
have said that they can get a preliminary curve to us within 3-5 days with a 
full market study to follow.  For this, they have ask for $95M.  They usually 
charge $37,500 per region, and usually give us a 12% discount for a total of 
$33,000.  So in their minds, they are shaving off $70M from the standard 
discounted price. 

Let's talk before the call if at all possible. We need to be in a position to 
give them the go ahead on Monday, if we are comfortable with the proposal.  
Otherwise, we risk not getting the results until the following week.

Thanks,

Don
