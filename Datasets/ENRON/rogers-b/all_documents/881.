Don:
I put in a call to Kinder/Morgan this morning.  I have not heard back from 
Anthony Lannie, who will be heading up this process for them.  Again, I think 
they will be interested, but probably through a joint bid with Southern.    I 
will continue to follow up with these guys to measure there interest.
