We are still working with the schedule and do not know for sure right now.
It will be a 2nd year student who is part of the TEXAS Admissions Committee.

Thanks for the fast reply.  I changed it online, but I wanted to make sure I
wasn't booked for two different times.  Also, are you able to tell me who I
will
be meeting with?  I am meeting with a couple professors before my Admissions
Visit and just wanted to know who I was going to meet with from your office.
Thanks!
Ben
