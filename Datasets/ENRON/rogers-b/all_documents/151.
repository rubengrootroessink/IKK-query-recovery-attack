Yes, those are the numbers I have gone by and I have
already done my shopping!!! :-)  Anyway, we really
have to get going on MOm and Dad's gift so I can feel
like I am getting somewhere.  Anyone interested in
taking responsibility for the shopping around????
Speak up now!  Also, did I hear besides shopping for
the kiddie KK, we can/should shop for our
godchildren???  Someone please let me know.

Where should adult KK gifts be sent??  To the couples
home or if they live in NY, to Mom and Dads???

Ben and I got our first tree this year--how exciting!!
 We got it and put it up today.  It looks beautiful if
I do say so myself.  Here is a new list for Ben and I
since Maeve doesn't think it is appropriate for me to
ask for china and things Ben probably doesn't want---
Ben-- a BROWN snap on Tiffany belt (for the silver
buckle)  they will know what you mean.  Dee-maybe your
friend can get this at a discount???  Any Beatles
CD's--  I think one is called Beatles One--  or a
Beatles box set (if there is one)---or camel color
cordeuroy's from POLO (don't know how much they are)
in a 38 X 32--
Now for ME--spode china 5 PPS,  anything from Tiffany
(if you are going there for Ben's gift) again,
Dee-maybe you can get at a discount???-- earrings
(silver balls) or bracelet (silver balls),  tiffany
heart necklace, etc., I also saw at POLO (if you go
there for Ben's gift) a tea pot to go with our
everyday Claire Pattern,  there are these miniature
stand up figures called "The Carolers" (I know Talbots
has some), that I am collecting (department stores may
have them also) about a foot tall--they all look like
they are singing.
Anyway, I hope this gives some more ideas for our
KK's.  Hope you all had a great weekend!  Oh, I have
our address for Colorado (but please send to arrive
after the 16th)
Rogers
114 Bermuda Drive
Edwards, CO  81632
Thanks so much!!  Meg and Ben
