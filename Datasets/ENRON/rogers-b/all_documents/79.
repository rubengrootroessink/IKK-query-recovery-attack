Ben - did I correctly read the last transitional heading "Deal Maker".  
Further, did I correctly not see my name listed in BOLD next to this item.  
For shame.  For your info, PRC is over.....you can stop kissing Don's butt.

Everyone:
Attached is the list of the preliminary Allegheny/Enron transition team 
members for the 2000 Peaker assets.  If you think you should not be on it or 
that someone else is better suited for the task then please let me know.  
Please check over the information to make sure everything is correct.  We are 
trying to plan for a kick-off meeting with Allegheny within the next couple 
of weeks.  Thanks for your assistance with this very important project.
Regards,
