Dear Ben:

Its nice hearing that you are doing well and that you are taking MBA
finance classes --- are these at U. of Houston?

The admissions people mentioned that your GMAT score was too low when you
applied last year.  They said that if you had a higher GMAT score we could
consider you as a special case because of your background in energy
finance.  Basically, my impression was that you didn't need to have a score
close to the 660 median, but you need to improve a lot.  I would also
recommend that you work more on the quantitative sections, since it is
clear to me that your verbal skills are quite good.

Keep in touch.

regards,

Sheridan
