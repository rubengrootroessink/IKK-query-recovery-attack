Ben:

I reviewed the attached questions.  Due to their technical nature, I should 
defer to Ross's judgement for the appropriate answers.

Ross:
Please cc me on the answers so that I can become more familiar with these 
issues.  I will be at the Lincoln plant by 8:00 tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Fred

Here are some more questions.  These guys are only bidding on Lincoln, so all 
of these should be just Lincoln questions.  Thanks again for your help with 
these.
