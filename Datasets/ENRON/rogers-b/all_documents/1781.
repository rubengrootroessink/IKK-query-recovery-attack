First of our stuff coming to you.

Following attachment is chilling calc for Ft Devens - which was the nearest 
site we thought might be representative of Lowell. I will confirm the 1% 
occurance basis we used (80F DB, 63.5F WB and 40% RH). I calc 790 tons/unit 
hour, we used 812 tons/per in our performance run. Design basis of chilling 
plant in our conceptual EPC would be maybe 3600 total tons (at the 80F/40% 
point) so there would be some margin to meet 50F inlet air at slightly higher 
ambients.



Obviously if you have different design point due to your owm plant data or 
your own criteria, we would be glad to rerun/size based on your suggestion. 
Balls in your court on this. Ft devens data coming to you by epressmail - we 
can also fax (fax number ???)- just 6 sheets - I need to find the procedure 
and/or worksheet on how we got the 1% point - I can't see it in this package.

Water data sheet is attached - obviously list is exhaustive but my water 
doctor asks if your team could fill out as much as possible so we can give 
you our best shot a suggesting a treatment system - might be helpful to have 
my water guy talk with your water guy so they conceptualize the new to fit 
well with the existing



I did get the voicemail, but managed to scribble unintelligebly (can't spell 
either) early this AM - I have Paul B.???? at 978-454-6166 (also hit the 
earse on my mail in my automatic mode this AM. Likely Ron Smith 713-345-5768 
will call.

The following is the data we developed and provided to a possible Austin, 
Texas job. Obviously water is different so unit cost may change but probably 
will keep same pecking order.

 Water options as follows

1) Rental mobile demineralizer    $10.57/1000 gal based on 1500 hrs/yr
2) Rental mobile demin with lease degasifier  $9.75/1000 gas for 5 yr then 
$7.85 on
3) Rental mobile RO with exchange tank mixed beds $7.22/1000 gal
4) Purchase RO with exchange tank mixed beds  $4.75/1000 gal
5) Purchase demineralizer    $5.77/1000 gal

Options 3, 4 and 5 require wastewater discharge. All systems assume on-site 
water storage. design is that system would run 22-24 hrs per day to make 
enough water for 10 hr daily run. Can run 24 hr+ with tank dropping. 
Generally these should be concidered as 1 X 100% unit (capable of supporting 
10 hr day) - if run more, truck water from Decker, call for emergency trailer 
demin, can operate units on limited water but would see NOx increase 

I need to run performance by our management and then get Tom's blessing 
before I send.

Best data I have on water consumption is that with 50F CTG inlet air at 
sealevel, nozzle water flow will be 22379 lb/hr and Sprint flow will be 2,206 
lb/hr. Our S&S guarantee says +/- 20% on nozzle flow, no info on possible 
+/-% on Sprint - I will ask S&S for clarification ASAP. Cooling tower water 
consumption obviously follows chilling load and cycles of 
concentration/blowdown program - water dependent!! we are conceptually using 
about 60 gpm/unit for demin.

Subject: LM6000 - Summary of 2/28/00 Discussion with Enron


Attached are our notes from the discussion we had yesterday on your LM6000
units:

COSTS
     Each unit contains the following cost breakdown ($13.5m base unit,
     $0.45m bank fee, $0.31m carrying charge, $0.45m Enhanced Sprint
     upgrade, and $62,000 cooler)

     Other Options that are not applicable to UAE: Dual Fuel $280k ea.,
     chiller system ~$1.12M ea. @ 2200 tons with two cell tower

DELIVERABLES
UAE needs to send water quality data to Enron.

Enron to provide heat balance and water balance information for the units.
Information to include guaranteed performance values adjusted for site 
elevation
and various ambient conditions, water consumption and discharge data, and
cooling tower requirements. Water consumption to include water injection for 
NOx
control, Sprint water requirements, and cooling tower makeup water.

ADDITIONAL POINTS

- WATER QUALITY FOR INJECTION: if operating greater than 1000 hrs., short
payback on permanent RO/mixed bed system
- CHILLING: with Enhanced Sprint, chilling reduced from ~2000 tons to ~800 
tons
- WATER BALANCE: water demand assumed to be 60 gallons/min per machine for E.
Sprint and NOX control
- DESIGN: UAE center line of 58' exceeds Enron minimum of 52'

     Let us know if we overlooked something or if you have any changes
