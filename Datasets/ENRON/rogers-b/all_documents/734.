Mr. Rogers,

As you may have noticed from the auto-reply to your email, Dr. Harris is
no longer with the University of Texas.  I have taken the position of
Interim Director until we find a permanent replacement.

While I do not know what conversations you have had with Dr. Harris, I
can assure you that the steps you are taking to improve your application
are the correct ones.  Congratulations on your class and I do hope that
you get a positive response from GMAC regarding the GMAT exam.

I am glad to hear that you are still interested in our program and we
look forward to receiving your new application.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Miller

Dr. Harris:
     I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly,
as I
felt mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much
interested in attending the Business School.
     I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance
class
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.
I
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.
     I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into
GMAC
to try and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT.   I am
currently waiting to hear back from them with their decision.  When I
hear
back from GMAC, I am planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase
my
score.
     As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the
Business School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I
can to increase my application profile.
     Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do
to
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I
look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Ben Rogers
