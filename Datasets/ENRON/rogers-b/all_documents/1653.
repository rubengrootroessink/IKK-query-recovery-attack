You are invited to attend
Isuzu MS150 Bike Tour
Media Day

Monday, March 20, 2000
11:30 am - 1:00 pm
Quebedeaux Park
Adjacent to the Family Law Center
1115 Congress @ San Jacinto in downtown Houston

We need your help in spreading the word abou the Isuzu MS150.  Your story 
could go a long way in driving up attendance and generating pledges.  The MS 
Society is hosting the MS150 Media Day for journalists from Houston to Austin 
in order to encourage their coverage of this spectacular event.  The more 
people that know about the Bike Tour, the more that participate.....and 
ultimately the more funds that are raised to unravel the mysteries of 
multiple sclerosis.  We would like you on hand to share your story about why 
you are riding the MS150 or past experiences on the Tour.  All we ask is that 
you stop by Quebedeaux Park Monday, March 20, and if possible, wear your bike 
jersey.  It is a casual, outdoor event and lunch  will be provided.  We will 
also have training tips, cycling pros and veteran advice available - you 
can't lose!

It will be a fun time for all and a great way to gear up for this year's 
event.
