The following is an update, including several additions to DealBench.

1.  The Purchase and Sale Agreement ("PSA") for each asset has now been 
posted to DealBench under the New Document section.  Please review the 
instructions attached to each PSA.

2. The Management Presentations (with audio) have now been posted to 
DealBench under the Management Presentations section.  When attempting to 
view the presentation, please log onto DealBench using Microsoft Explorer. 
Once in DealBench, you will most likely need to download "Flash Player" (free 
download).  You can do this by clicking "Macromedia Flash Player download 
center in the Linked Documents section of DealBench.  The download usually 
takes less than 30 seconds.  After the download, return to the Management 
Presentation section of DealBench and click on the Management Presentation 
(with audio).   A power point presentation has also been included in the 
Management Presentation section of DealBench.   A detailed instruction guide 
"Instruction for Viewing Management Presentation" has been posted in New 
Document section of DealBench.

3.  Please be sure to consistently review the New Documents section on 
DealBench for any new documents that have been added to DealBench.  Also, a 
running black line Due Diligence Index is posted in the Due Diligence Index / 
Plant Pictures section of DealBench.

4. Any drawings or CDs that you need from the Due Diligence Indices may be 
requested by sending an email to don.miller@enron.com or jhoff2@enron.com.

5.  Any problems or issues that you may be encountering may be directed to 
Jinsung Myung at 713-853-7330.

6.  We are prepared to schedule Q&A sessions.  Please contact Don Miller at
