Andy Johnson (Mgr Business Development)with El Paso is double/triple checking 
the max flow rate,
but it  is believed to be 190,000 mmbtu/day or 7,900 mmbtu/hr.
Currently at 500 Mw and 11.5 heat rate, our  flow rate is approx 5,750 
mmbtu/hr

I have calls into El Paso again today...Also John Hodge (from Stephanie 
Miller's group) has 
replaced the calls he made on Friday, at my request.  The only reference any 
documents that I have make is to the
current max flow rate of the plant.  However I am sure the interconnect was 
built larger than required.
I will for ward the respones ASAP.
