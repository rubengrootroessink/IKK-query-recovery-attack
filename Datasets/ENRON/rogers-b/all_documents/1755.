Subject: City of Austin 4 x LM6000 O&M Estimate

Jason, please find attached the O&M estimate for the City of Austin 4 x 
LM6000PC gas fired, simple cycle power project. It shows the estimated cost 
for the Operator's Mobilization Period ($/kW) and Annual Operating Period 
average FOM and average VOM for both 3 year and 20 year periods. The estimate 
assumes the addition of operating staff at the project, but that maintenance, 
supervision and administration services can be performed by existing staffing 
at Austin Energy. The staffing is such that the peak periods could be manned 
for round the clock availability and eased off in the non-peak months. I have 
shown an O&M fee during Mobilization and Annual Operating Periods designed to 
cover this service, as well as the Operator's risk for meeting Availability 
requirements.



Per Sandra's request, I have not shown the GT and SCR reserve calculations in 
the estimate, but for purposes of documenting with our team, they are 
estimated to be:
GT Reserve = $54/fired hour (20 year term)
SCR Reserve = $25/fired hour (assume 40,000 hr life)

Please review and call if you would like to discuss further.

regards, Scot
