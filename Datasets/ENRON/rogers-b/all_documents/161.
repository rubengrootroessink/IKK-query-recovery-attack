Subject: Updates to Caledonia and Brownsville Schedules


Chris and Gus,

I have open items remaining in connection with updating the attached
schedules.

Chris, could you please provide me with some information regarding each
schedule.  You will note in the attached schedules that your name is
contained in brackets in the places where I need your input.  Please
confirm whether these contracts exist and, if so, please send Don Miller
and me a copy of the contracts at your earliest possible convenience.

Gus, in a prior e-mail, you had noted that the schedules needed to be
updated on Schedule 4.1(n).  I sent you an e-mail with a request for
further explanation and a summary of the required update.  Please
respond to that e-mail at your earliest possible convenience.

Thank you in advance.
