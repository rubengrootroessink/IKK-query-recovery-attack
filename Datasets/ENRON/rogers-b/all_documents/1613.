Just some shocking news about Enron's fundraising stars.  Would you believe 
this?

 Dan Lyons -  $8810
He's not too far from doubling what he raised last year, and he has three 
weeks to go.

Ray Sylvester - $6000  

Jordan Hunter - $4500
Another huge increase over last year

I hope this is incentive for all of us to get cracking - we have a larger 
goal this year - $350,000, but I know we can do it.  I know there are more 
good stories out there in the pledging jungle, so shoot me a note and let me 
know how you're doing.  

I want to tell you about a new friend of mine.  I met her just last weekend.  
She has MS, diagnosed in 1996.  She walks very slowly with a cane and needed 
help negotiating her way across a thin throw rug on the floor.  When she 
found out about our bike ride she pledged $500 to me and let me know how 
important this activity is to her.  Research is very important, client 
services to MS patients are very important - giving them hope is very 
important, and that's what we do when we're out there raising money for their 
future.

My new friend asked me to pass along
 to each and every one of you her very grateful appreciation for all you 
do.   

If you have any fundraising questions, or I can help you in any way - please 
give me a call at 713-646-6569.
