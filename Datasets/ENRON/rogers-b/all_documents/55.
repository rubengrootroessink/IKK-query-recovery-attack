Ross & Mitch
Per your request, attached is a listing of p.o.s in regards to our earlier 
conversation, I will update it periodically to keep you informed of any 
changes.  I will strive for a seamless transition if need be.
Sincerely,
Jim Meyer
p.s.do you both want me to fax Ben Rogers a detailed physical inventory as of 
12-8-00, I have already printed it out for such an occasion.
