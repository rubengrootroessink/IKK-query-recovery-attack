Hi Ben,

Many thanks for your thoughtful email and thoughtful visit.  It's very
important for everyone to put names with faces and to understand the nuances
of individuals' circumstances.

My colleagues and I very much appreciate your enthusiasm for the Texas
Business School and I wish you the best with the application process.

I hope to see you next fall.

Cheers,

Dave

David Jemison:

    Thank you for taking the time to meet with me last Friday afternoon.  I
really enjoyed meeting you and talking about the Texas Business School.  My
meetings with Professors' Brown, Titman and Ronn were extremely helpful with
regards to learning about the energy-finance program and the investment
fund.
    In reference to our discussion about my low GMAT scores, I do not test
well on these types of tests, thus I have always had to work a lot harder
than most to get where I want to go, therefore I am accustom to working hard
to reach my goals.  Enron is based on a team-oriented approach, where people
with diverse skills come together to formulate innovative ideas and
financial products and to solve difficult problems for our customers.  The
Texas Business School seems to work on this approach, thus I would be able
to provide my skills as well as learn from others.  I have excelled in this
type of environment at Enron and feel that I would continue to excel at the
Texas Business School.  I am fully committed to become successful and do
well within the energy-finance program and will work hard to be able to
learn from and contribute to the program.
    After talking with you and others at the School, I am certain that the
Texas Business School would be a perfect fit for me.  With my experiences
from State Street Bank and Enron, I would be able to contribute a great deal
to the program and continue to add to the program after graduation.  Thanks
again for taking the time to meet with me and to show an interest in my
career goals.


Sincerely,


Ben Rogers
