Attached is the MS150 Training Ride Schedule.  The first ride is this Sunday, 
Jan. 30, at 9:00 a.m. (not 8:00) at Memorial Park.  I spoke to the folks at 
West U Schwinn and they verified the time change.  The meeting area is at the 
large parking lot before you enter the picnic loop.  The picnic loop is 
located on the other side of Memorial (across from the running trail).  If 
you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks!

P.S. This ride is for all levels of riders.
