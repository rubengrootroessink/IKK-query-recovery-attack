B, 

Hey a sale here looks imminent, so I am going to take you up on your offer to 
get me in front of the venture side at Cinergy. ?Attached is my resume. Let 
me know if you can't open it or the margins get thrown. 


Other than that,...... what are you guys up to? ?By the way what are you guys 
doing for New Years? 

Thanks again. 


????--CBCIII
