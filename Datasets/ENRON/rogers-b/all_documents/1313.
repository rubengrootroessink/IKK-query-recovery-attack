Excellent time! Look forward to keeping it going at the wedding, Elizabeth
will be so impressed. Speaking of keeping it going, our good friend, Mr.
Kimzey, called me last night drunk as rodeo goat at about 10 PM asking me to
go out and party a little bit more. Did I miss something or did we not get
our share this weekend?

Apparently the weekend only caused Bryan to reflect on his current state of
affairs. By chance it was just the welts on his forehead from crushing cans
that caused him to start boozing all by his lonesome yesterday. Or perhaps
he just wanted to enjoy the perks of first class. Let's hope it was the
latter and had nothing to do with the frightful prospect of being a married
man in just 6 weeks.

Oh, by the way, I can assure you all Kimzey has not read a single one of
these emails yet, and likely won't till about noon. Damn slackers over there
at CSFB!

I lost the camera - hopefully you're referring to the silver one in the blue
case? - thanks L.B.!  I had a great time as well, and I still have the
shakes to prove it.

Great weekend - thanks to Miquel for getting us all there and hopefully
Kimzey
will now not miss the wonders of bachelorhood too much.

Found a camera - digital one in 317 - also have the elvis sun glasses - if
the
rightful owner would like to step forward - and yes we know who you are.

Cheers
Nick
