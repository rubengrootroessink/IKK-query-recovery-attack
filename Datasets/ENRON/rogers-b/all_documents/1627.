We have 3 rides this weekend, all on Saturday - two of which you've already 
received, and one official MS150 training ride. 

Saturday - March 25   (Ride Coordinator - Stephanie Strong - 713-853-1653)

Come one, come all to conquer the treacherous hills at Bastrop State Park on 
Saturday, March 25.  Bastrop IS the toughest part of the MS150.  We will be 
meeting at the large parking area which is located at the entrance of the 
park where you pay $3 entry fee.  Look for my green Toyota pickup truck with 
the camper top.  Meeting time is 10:00 a.m.  It takes approximately 2 1/2 
hours to drive to Bastrop from Houston.  I will bring water and gatorade.  
You're on your own for food.  The route is about 12 miles through the park, 
but it's a very important 12 miles because the hills are such a challenge.

Please RSVP to me so I'll have enough water and gatorade for everyone.

Things to bring:
Stuff to change a flat tire
Water bottle (filled with your favorite beverage)
Food (fruit, power bars, whatever else)
Helmet
Bike
Yourself

Here's a map of the park.  Let me know if you have any questions.


Directions:
Take I-10 West to 71 West towards Lagrange/Austin
Travel down 71W about 50 miles.
Turn right onto Loop 150
Travel .7 miles
Turn right onto TXP1 (Park Road 1A)
You'll be at the entrance to the park.

Saturday - March 25

Dan Lyons' training ride series leading up to the MS150 continues this 
Saturday, March 25, as described below. The terrain will range from what Dan 
considers to be light hills, through moderately hilly to hilly, and the 
traffic on each ride will be light to moderate.  The rides will not be sagged 
(although each of the rides will have stores at various distances) and riders 
should come prepared with water, food and the equipment necessary to repair 
flat tires.  The goal will be to ride these rides at a pace between 14-16MPH 
and to get in a little hill work before the MS150.  Although prior commitment 
is not a requirement, Dan would appreciate some kind of a head count, so if 
you plan on doing one or more of these rides, please email him at 
dan.lyons@enron.com or leave him a voice mail at (713) 853-1648.  All rides 
will leave promptly at 8:00 a.m. so be sure to arrive in time to be ready for 
a wheels up departure at 8:00 a.m..  Look for Dan in his electric blue 
Explorer of ancient vintage.

This ride will start from Royal Jr. High School in Pattison about three miles 
north of Brookshire off of either FM 359 or FM 362.  This is a moderately 
hilly ride that goes up through Burleigh and Racoon Bend to Belville and back 
by way of FM 529 and FM 359.  Mileage; low 60's.
