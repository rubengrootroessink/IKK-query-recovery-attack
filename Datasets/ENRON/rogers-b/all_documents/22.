Ben,
I would appreciate if you could forward my resume to Tim Detmering, just in 
case he has not received it already from Jeff.
I have tried to reach him but he was in a meeting, so I left a message in his 
voice mail.

Thanks for everything.

Teseo

Dear Ben,
I want to thank you for receiving me, for all your time and suggestions, and 
for arranging me a meeting with Jeff Donahue.
I am very anxious to see what happens. He told me that he was going to 
discuss it with Tim Detmering.

As we agreed, I am attaching my resume.

I will call you soon.

Regards and thanks once again.
