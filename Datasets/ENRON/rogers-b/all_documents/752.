Enclosed is a copy of the new certificate for the Oxy ERCs.

The certificate names "Enron North American Corporation" as the holder.
Barry and Joan, can you confirm this is not a problem.  Also, could you
please review the certificate to make sure it is otherwise OK (looks that
way to me).

The agreement with Oxy contemplated a live closing where we would swap wire
confirmation info for the original certificate.  Oxy is proposing Enron pay
first and they will then FedEx the certificate when the transfers have been
"verified."  Sheila, is this OK?

The last day to pay is Monday October 9, which is Columbus day.  I have not
verified whether that is a bank holiday.  Perhaps the payment should be made
on Friday October 6 in any event.

We are waiting to get a file endorsed copy of a financing statement
termination from Chevron.  I will remind them of that.
