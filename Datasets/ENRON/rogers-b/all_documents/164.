Dear Ben,
Its been a long time. I hope you have been well.
In case you do not remember me, we have met on the Super Saturday Dinner and 
we had an interesting conversation before heading the tables.

I am participating tomorrow of the Sell Weekend and I have arranged my 
traveling to Houston for early in the morning.
As you may remeber, I am very interested in the Corporate Developmet Group 
and it would great if we could meet tomorrow for 15 minutes or so in the 
early afternoon. Your advice would be extremely helpful.
Please let me know, so we can coordinate the time.
Thanks for all.
