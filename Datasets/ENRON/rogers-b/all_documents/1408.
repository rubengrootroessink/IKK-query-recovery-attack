Hi Benjamin,

Winston Cheng asked me to forward to you the attached schedule of development 
projects for the west.  Note that these projects are not firm - for example, 
most have not got firm site commitments etc.  No doubt, many of the projects 
are expected to fall through or be terminated for one reason or another.

Cheers

Christian
