Oh fine day!

You have sent my heart soaring with news that you have agreed to receive
some of this Fool's earnestly penned electronic missives!

I hope you will find my correspondence entrancing but I shall be honest:
what these notes occasionally lack in charm they make up for in
convenience and persistence. The word passed along to me is that you have
elected to receive the following note(s):

FoolWatch
Breakfast with the Fool
Investing Basics
Fresh Stuff
Special Offers From The Motley Fool

I shall do my best to make sure the letters are dispatched with both
substance and speed. Shall you ever change your mind and decide to select
more notes or (gasp!) fewer, simply click the link below and you shall be
transported to a page where you can change your choices.
