DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 Al Gore and 
Constitution 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com 

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
"Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech." While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

"Oh, Farah," you say, "you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: "More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States." 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.
