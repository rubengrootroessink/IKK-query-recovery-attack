Hey there; 
"Do you know who your "big toe" is yet?  Do you swallow alot of aggression 
along with alot of pizzas?  Well if you do, then you are going to be a lean, 
mean fighting machine.  I finally finished all of my applications and have 
had several interviews with Columbia and Rice.  Duke is in a couple of 
weeks.  I'll probably here from NYU in the next couple of weeks.  We were in 
St. Barts for New Years and it was awesome.  We need to have a huge party 
when you get back in the summer.  I talk to Gioffre quite a bit now and we 
are trying to get a lot of people together this summer.  Hope your trip is 
going well and Keep in touch.  I'll let you know how the B-School results 
come in.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
