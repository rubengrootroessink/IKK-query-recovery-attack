Professor Titman:
Thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office.  I wanted to 
ask you what you think I could do at this point to help the admission's 
people understand the reason for my GMAT score.  I know that this is a poor 
reflection of what I can actually achieve and I know that I will do well and 
be successful in the learning environment at UT.  If I need to, I can provide 
the admissions office the documents stating the disability.  If you can let 
me know what you think I can do, I would appreciate it.  Thanks agin!
Ben
