Just to clarify, if you are an Enron Cycling Club member, Enron will pay for 
your registration.  Contact me or Stephanie Strong and we'll get you signed 
up.  For non-Enron people who want to be on the MS150 Enron team, they can do 
so by registering themselves and listing "Enron" as their team.  However, 
they're not officially on the Enron team until we are notified, and we must 
have their email address and phone number, also exact spelling of the name as 
it appeared on the registration, or fax the registration form to 713-345-5755.
