We and my family are going to Beaver Creek for x-mas but are going on a 
cruise which travels to different Virgin islands and will be in St. Barts for 
New Years.  We have never been to these Islands or on a cruise before so it 
should be pretty interesting.  I'll let you know about the tics.  See ya
