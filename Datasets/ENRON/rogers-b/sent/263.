It wasn't like I was neglecting you.  You must understand that e-mail is 
faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there 
is not always an immediate return.  Some people are lazy with returning 
e-mail.  It has been really busy here.  We are working long hours and this 
project is trying to close by the end of the year.  It's a $1 Billion 
project, so it takes alot of work.  Talk to you soon.
