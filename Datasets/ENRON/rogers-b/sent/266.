I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said 
that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this "billing 
separately plan" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.  At that 
point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.  Regarding the balance 
sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been 
amortizing it each month as its been paid.  

Let me know if you need anything else.
