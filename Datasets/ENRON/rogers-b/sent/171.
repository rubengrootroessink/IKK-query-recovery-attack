Ashley:
Thanks for sending this e-mail so quickly.  I would like to suggest a couple 
of changes to your resume just to "tighten" it up a little bit.  These are 
just minor changes that will make it look more consistent.  I also talked to 
a women who sits two seats down from me, who is a recruiter for another 
group.  She wanted to take a look at your resume once it was ready.  Let's 
try and talk about this later today or this weekend, so you can make these 
changes. Once we get things going internally, I know we can get you over here 
at Enron pretty quickly.  If I don't hear from you later today, please try me 
at home which is (713) 355-8738.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
