Shelly:
I received your e-mail regarding this years Super Saturday's.  I am currently 
an Associate, but as an Analyst I participated in a couple of Super 
Saturday's, but haven't done any in a little while, so I wanted to offer up 
my services.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do, because I'll 
be more than happy to help out again.  Thanks!
Ben
