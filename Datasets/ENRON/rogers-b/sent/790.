Back when, Susan transfered all the files to me and we went through the 
entire reg.risk process.  For the year I was in ISG, I never had to adjust 
the reg.risk book.  I did not hand over the files to anyone else because the 
group was breaking up and figured it was better that I keep them. I was in 
yesterday going through all my files and the boxes under my desk and did not 
come up  with them.  In rotating down to East Orig. I lost a box of stuff, 
but I didn't think it had those files in it, but it looks like that was the 
case.  Let me know what you want me to do, if anything at this point.  Again, 
sorry for the delay.
