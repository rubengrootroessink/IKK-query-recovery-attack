This weekend is out of the question - the BIG race is on Sunday up in the Big 
Apple.  Megan and I leave for NYC on Friday afternoon.  We will be getting 
back on Monday.  Watch ABC between 10:00am and 3:00pm, they play it down 
here.  Good deal with KMI.  I sent Susan a congratulations email this 
morning.  I'll talk to you soon.
