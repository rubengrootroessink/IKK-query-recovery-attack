Good to hear from you!  It's been a while.  I am also going to work for 
another year.  My undergrad grades were what held me back.  I have already 
enrolled in a summer graduate finance course for the summer.  How Fun!  I am 
also retaking the GMAT.  But what I am looking forward to is kicking your ass 
in the NYC Marathon since I signed up and will hopefully get in.  Megan will 
is almost done with school and will be spending most of July in NY.  So I 
will be coming up to NYC quite a bit this summer.  Would you be interested in 
going out to Colorado this summer to play some great golf.  They have some 
fantastic courses.  Other than that - work is going really well and Enron 
stock and company culture is really getting noticed by Wall Street, which is 
great for future job opportunities.  I'm playing a lot of tennis, golf anf 
basketball as of late and its been quite fun.  Hope all is going well and 
lets get together when you get back.  See ya soon.
Ben
