Here is a presentation that I need by 11:00am Thursday.  The presentation is 
almost complete,  but if you can clean it up that would be great.   I will 
need 8 coler copies and bound. Please give me a call before you have someone 
run the copies, because we may have some early morning changes. Thanks
Ben
