Amy:
I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get 
into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from the 
Princeton Review.  I have realized that I need  one on one  sessions to help 
me really prepare for the GMAT.  If you can point me in the right direction, 
I would greatly appreciate it.  I was looking to start sessions as soon as 
possible. Again, thanks for your help with this issue.
