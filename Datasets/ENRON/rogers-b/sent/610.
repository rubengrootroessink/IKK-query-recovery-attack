Here is a brief list of the projects I have worked on in the first quarter of 
this year.  Just to let you know, I am technically in Mike MIller's IPP 
origination group.  I moved over to this group last week.  I am still going 
perform the same function as I did in CTG, but now from the IPP group.  
Thanks!
Ben
