How the hell are ya?  Wanted to drop you a line and see how you were doing 
and let you know that Brandon and I continued the tradition and went to the 
DMB concert last night.  Must say that it wasn't the same as being with you 
in a limo, but we still had fun.  Wanted to get your number up there, b/c I 
will be up in Chicago for Thanksgiving and was hoping to meet you in Chicago 
then.  Gotta run, but I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben
