Cliff:
Do you have Dierdre's address in NYC.  Megan and I are staying there next 
weekend and are getting picked up at the airport and need to tell the driver 
where were going.  How is everything going?  Slow down the traveling yet?  
Make sure you include yourself in the Turkey Run on Thanksgiving in Chicago.  
Talk to you soon.
