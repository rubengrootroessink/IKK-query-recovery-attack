Charlie:
I just got back from NYC - I ran in the NYC Marathon yesterday.  It was a lot 
of fun and pretty good weather, but my time was a little slower than I would 
have wanted (4:27).  If Wednesday or Thursday works for you, I would like to 
come up to the Woodlands and meet with you over lunch.  I hope all is going 
well and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben
