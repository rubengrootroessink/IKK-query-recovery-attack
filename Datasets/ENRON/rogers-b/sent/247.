This is a test to see if you are checking your e-mail these days.  I have a 
feeling that you have not been, due to your board presentation last week.  
Mike M. tells me he will be up there today - hope that goes well for you 
guys.  I really think there could be something there.  Please give me a call 
sometime soon.  Things are going well here and we have been quite busy.  Give 
me a call sometime.  The number is (713) 853-7998. See ya!
Ben
