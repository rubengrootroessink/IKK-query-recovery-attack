Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

Hey Bruce,
Oscar and I are looking to have the first 2 questions answered.  If you could 
look at these and get back with me that would be great.  I'm working on the 
3rd question now.  Thanks
Ben

Ben,

On the Wisconsin Public Service deal (WPS) please consider the following:

1.  One LM-6000 to be sited near Green Bay Wisconsin
2.  Will be configured in combined cycle mode with a HRSG
3.  100% of the output will go to an industrial customer of WPS


Key Questions

1.  What is the heat rate and Mw rating of our turbine at site conditions (20 
degrees winter and 90 degrees summer)

2.  What is the water consumption with Sprint verses water injection

3.  What is a 10 year fixed gas price at chicago starting 6/1/01 on a 
baseload volume of 10,000 mmbtu/d
