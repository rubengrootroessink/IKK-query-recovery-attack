Just wanted to say congratulations on the close.  I hope you had a good trip 
back to Cincy.  Again, I think that both companies are getting a very good 
deal, with you guys getting excellent assets at a very good price.  Hope to 
talk to you soon and I look forward to seeing the press release.
Regards, 
Ben
