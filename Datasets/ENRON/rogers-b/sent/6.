Dad:
Congrats on the press release.  People that found out about it were amazed 
that we did it so quickly.  I was thinking, if you could call Ken, that would 
be great.  I know Michael is talking to Dave, but talking to Ken would really 
help my cause.  Let me know what you think.  I also am sending you a 
presentation that you will really enjoy.
Regards,
Ben
