Don:

To confirm that we have scheduled a nominal two hour call on Monday (10/30)
at 1:30 CST to warp up the Peaker operational due diligence.  Duke has
arranged for a call in number  800/473-8492.  The conference host is Joe
Synnott.

Our focus on this call will be to review the status of our outstanding
requests and open questions.  An example of the former category are the
inspection reports at Gleason and the gas questions.  In the latter
category we still have some confusion about the units actual vs. guaranteed
performance data, status of the warranty items, historic transmission
performance, and relationship between the facility operations team and the
asset management function in Houston.    In addition our insurance staff
will be participating and will have some questions about the casualty loss
histories at the facilities.

Organizationally: please make available people on your team knowledgeable
in the operation and asset management of the facilities.  I would suggest
Ross, the plant managers, Mitch, and your environmental team.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call at 713-627-6579.
