Bruce did give us project cost numbers and I will have him e-mail them to 
you.  Also, you and I already went through the project eval. form on USEC.  
Tom and I were trying to get numbers by Wednesday, but give me a call once 
you get the project cost numbers.  Thanks for your help with this project.
