Just wanted reiterate my comments on Raul and his skills fitting in with what 
you guys are looking for.  I really think he would be a good long term in the 
corp. dev area and/or investor relations.  Let me know if your around for 
lunch this week at Ninfa's.  I'm meeting up with Andrew sometime this week as 
well, maybe we can make it the same day.  Let me know.
Ben
