Were all set.  You and your dad should fly into Indianapolis Saturday morning 
or early afternoon.  You need to look on a Website for when the games begin 
that day.  We are actually flying into Cinci and driving over.   Again, look 
at a website to see what time the Final game is on Monday night.  Give me a 
call so when can go over meeting before the game to get you the tickets.  
Talk to you soon.  Work number is (713) 853-7998.
