Dave:
Just wanted to remind you about the call I received from Paul Cavicchi with 
Tractebel.  He was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the 
assets.  I basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that 
are strong bids that come in on Monday or Tuesday of next week.  He sounded a 
little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed 
interested in the assets.  Hope this helps. 
Ben
