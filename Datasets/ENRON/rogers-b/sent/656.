Professor Titman:
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate my disability.  After talking with you and 
Professors Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to 
continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do what 
ever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking a couple of graduate 
level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to 
demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I also 
plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, this will be a 
monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions committment 
that I can do the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business.
 Also, I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an 
Energy-Finance Private Equity Fund at UT.  I know that with my industry-wide 
and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund.  
I am very interested in energy-finance and think that your idea is a very 
good.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure to meet with you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.  
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers
