I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently.  Work has slowed down 
a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two.  I have traded 
calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven't talked to her in some time.  
Anyway, I hope your figuring out where we should go for a trip this sping.  
We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or 
not.  We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to 
Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world.  Or maybe 
you have been thinking about going to Paris to visit the city of love.   
Anyway, these are just some of the thinks we have been thinking about.  Talk 
to you soon.
Love 
Ben
