Mike:
Just wanted to let you know how everything went with the Marathon if you 
haven't heard already.  My time was a little slower (4:27: 53), but I 
finished and my goal of not walking was kept.  I now want you to focus in on 
is the MS150 in April.  We are both doing it and yes, I will give you your 
bike back to do it.  I think this would be something really fun to train for 
and to participate in.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
