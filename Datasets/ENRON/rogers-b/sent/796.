With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks
Ben
