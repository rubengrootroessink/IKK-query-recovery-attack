Sorry for the late reply, I was in NYC and Boston on one of my deals.  The 
two companies I talked about was Relient and Entergy.  Relient ended up 
buying 19 LM 6000 turbines and Entergy ended up buying 28 LM 6000 turbines.  
They both plan to put them into customer deals, just as we are doing - so 
there is a little competition.  The delivery dates are a little further out 
than ours but they all are probably delivered by 2003.  Hope this helps. Talk 
to you soon.
Ben
