 Thanks for your quick reply.  With regards to the classes, I looked into U 
of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer 
classes.  The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the 
University of St. Thomas.  It would have been nice to take these classes at U 
of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business 
School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there.  
 Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.

Regards,
Ben
