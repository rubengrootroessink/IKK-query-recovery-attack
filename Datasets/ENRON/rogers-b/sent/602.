Hey David:
Megan and I are thinking of moving and I wanted to know what you had done 
with your place.  Give me a call when you get a chance.  Also, a person you 
worked in the past now sits next to me - Michelle Parks.  Give me a call.  
Hope all is well and lets talk about going up to the Vineyard the same time 
this summer.  See ya
Ben
