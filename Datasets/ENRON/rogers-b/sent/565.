Hey, sorry its been a little while but I've been traveling and keeping some 
late hours on these generation projects.  With regards to UT, I am going to 
stay at Enron for another year.  I feel that the thing that hurt me from 
getting in the schools I wanted to get into were my undergraduate grades.  So 
I have decided to take a couple of graduate level finance courses this summer 
and re-apply next year.  Actually, I'll apply to Columbia this Sept to get 
into their January program, which goes for a year and half.  

So lets get together for lunch before you head off for B-school this summer.  
Talk to you soon.
Ben
