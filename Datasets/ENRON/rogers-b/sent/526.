Great PICS.  When do you get back?  I want to see if we can get together up 
in NYC or DC with OB and Mike.  I will be in the Hamptons for July 4th 
weekend.  It's starting to get hot down here in Houston.  Things are going 
well.  I have moveed into a new group (Enron's M&A Group) - were looking at 
some interesting deals.  We are looking at taking a company public which I 
may go work for if I can get enough equity in the deal.  The other thing that 
might happen is finally going to my pops company at a much higher position 
than I am at now, which would be great, but I would be in Ohio, booooooo.  
That way Megan and I could buy a house and potential go and get an executive 
MBA from Kellog, but these are all scenarios and if any of these play out I 
would be amazed.  My golf game is ok, but my training is starting to get 
better.  I did see that none of us made the NYC Marathon on the first go 
around.  Did you see that Jon and Kati had their baby-I didn't even know she 
was pregnant.  Shit were getting old!!!!!!!!!!   Hope all is going well and 
I'll see ya.
Ben
