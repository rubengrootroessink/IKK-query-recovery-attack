I'm trying to find good in this announcement but not much is coming from it.  
I did have a good interview at Duke Business School last week.  I should be 
hearing from NYU-Stern and Duke in the next couple of weeks.  What is my next 
option?  Any suggestions regarding writing letters to anyone you know at Duke 
or NYU?
