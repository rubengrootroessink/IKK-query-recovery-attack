Guys:
Don Miller and I would like to set some time up with you, today if possible, 
to talk about state and local tax issues for the 2000 peakers.  I will talk 
with Don about a good time to meet and let you know.  But let me know what is 
a good time for you this afternoon.  Thanks for your time.
Ben
