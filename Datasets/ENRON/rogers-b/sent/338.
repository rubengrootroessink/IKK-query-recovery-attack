Thanks for the note, except of course for the last comment, why don't you 
just go seat in row 100 - alright.  Megan and I had a great time and enjoyed 
having you guys come out..  I love going out there during the summer.  We are 
going to arrange a ski weekend on President Day Weekend this February - so 
make plans to be laughed at while skiing.  I didn't mean laughed at - I meant 
having a fun time.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
