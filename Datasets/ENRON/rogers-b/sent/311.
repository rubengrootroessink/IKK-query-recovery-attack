Hey Mike:
You won't believe whose wedding Megan and I are going to in early Oct. - 
Marlon and Marissa's.  As well as OB, Choby, Mike and like Patty Donahue, 
Sammy, Amy, etc.  It should be pretty interesting to say the least.  I am 
also running in this year's NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in 
November.  So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough 
to arrange.  How was Patty's wedding -it looked like alot of fun.  I still 
want to meet up with you guys somewhere, but I'm just not sure where at this 
point - I still think DC.  Let me know what you think.
Ben
