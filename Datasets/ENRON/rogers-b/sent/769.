Thanks for the reply!  I will be driving to Austin Friday morning and 9:00 am 
looks like a good time to meet.  My afternoon (1:00-5:00) is full with a 
information session, meeting with other Professors (Titman, Ronn and Jemison) 
and an Admissions interview.  I would appreciate it if you could send me your 
office location, so I can meet you at 9:00am on Friday.  Thanks again for 
taking the time to meet with me.  Look forward to meeting you.

Ben Rogers
