Stan:
I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know I am still with Enron 
and still enjoying the experience and currently working on selling some of 
our power plants with the Generation Investments Group.  I also wanted to say 
congratulations on the birth of your twins - thats great!  If there is any 
chance to have lunch I would greatly look forward to having lunch with you.  
By the way, I had a really good conversation with Rocky Storie the other 
day.  He was my representative for my performance review and I felt he did a 
great job and I greatly appreciated it.  Hope all is going well and I look 
forward to talking to you soon.

Regards,
Ben
