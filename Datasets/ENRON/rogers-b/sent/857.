Mr. Pushaw:
Whats up my friend.  It's been a long while-too long.  The last time I saw 
you was when I was in New York for the marathon and saw you at that Italian 
rest.  I've been keeping up with gioffre (sp) as of late and noticed your 
e-mail address, so I wanted to give you a shout.  How's everything at law 
school going?  Will you be staying in NYC after you graduate?  I may be in 
NYC next year going to B-School at Columbia.  I'm down here in Houston 
working with Enron.  It's been a great experience but I'm ready to go back to 
school to get my MBA.  Please give me a call when you have some time and lets 
catch up.  My work number is (713)853-7998 and home is (713) 355-8738.  Hope 
all is going well and talk to you soon.  See ya
Ben
