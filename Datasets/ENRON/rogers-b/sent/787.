Tom Swank, the originator and I sat down with Bruce Golden and went through 
the porject cost numbers for the GE 7FA combined cycle facility.  At this 
point we need to claculate FOM and VOM and other operating expenses.  We feel 
pretty good about the project cost numbers.  Let me know if you need more 
info than I have already given you.  Bruce Golden has the soft copy of the 
project cost numbers.  Thanks
Ben
