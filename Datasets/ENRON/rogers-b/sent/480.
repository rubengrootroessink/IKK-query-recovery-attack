Randy:
I have a couple of items I am working and wanted to know from you.
1.  How will the annoucement of the 55 MW plant in R.I. and the potential 
stake in the 1,650 MW plant in Texas effect the current asset portfolio?
2.  I am working on a spreadsheet identifying all the current and the coming 
on-line merchant MW's in detail.  Can you provide me a detail list of which 
plant assets are merchant or are going to be merchant.  
Thanks,
Ben Rogers
