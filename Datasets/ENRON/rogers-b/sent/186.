Charlie:
 It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business 
School information session.  As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, I 
really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron.  
Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.  I 
am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of 
transaction with you guys.  It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that 
we might be interested in.  If you could send me a business proposal or 
summary of what your doing, that would be helpful.  
 With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not 
get in due to my GMAT score.  I decided to take a graduate level finance 
class this summer, which I received an A.  I am currently taking another 
graduate finance class this semester.  I am also retaking the GMAT, with the 
hopes of increasing my quantitative score.  
 Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign.  
I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to 
improve on was my GMAT score.  Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean 
of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my 
continued interest with Columbia.  I hope that these actions will help me get 
into Columbia this year.  My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their 
network, location, reputation and curriculum.  Since growing up in Pelham,  
it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while.
 As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.  I hope this 
brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into 
Columbia.  I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the 
Woodlands or downtown.  Again, thank you for your interest and I look forward 
to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions.
Regards,

Ben Rogers
