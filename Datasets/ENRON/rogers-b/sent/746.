I will let you know by tomorrow what the exact times of the games begin on 
Saturday so when can fly in on Sat.  We ended up working around the apartment 
and getting things in order.  Pretty boring but nice.  I ran this morning and 
played outdoor b-ball, it was really nice outside.  Hope we can get together 
soon b/c it was good to see you and Susan for dinner last week.  Talk to you 
this week.
