Subject: Additional PG&E Question and an Aquila Question - all on Pastoria


I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don't want more capacity there.

Aquila's question:

They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC's.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs


PG&E's question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Since we do not have to accept the NEPCO contract, can you break out the
cost and scope of equipment (Enron uses the term "power islands")?  Can we
get this information tomorrow?  Both cost and scope of this is important to
be able to assess the "EPC" price and determine bid price.
