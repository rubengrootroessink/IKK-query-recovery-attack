I talked to Bruce on Friday around 5:00pm and they are getting us, as well as 
Nepco, the scope document on Wednesday.  Nepco will take till the following 
Monday to turn the doc. around.  I told him we need it sooner than that, but 
he seems to think that is the standard time of return.  We need to find out 
from Reed more information regardin the configuration, noise, water, etc.  We 
will meet with Bruce on Wednesday.  We also may want to think about going up 
there with an Engineer to visit the site.  We can talk more on Monday.
