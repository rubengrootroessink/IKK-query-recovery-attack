I will be getting out my Rice and Texas applications on Tuesday the 21st, so 
if your able to complete these recommendation forms before or on Tuesday I 
would greatly appreciate it.  I leave for a Christmas vacation on Wednesday 
and wanted to get it out before I left.  If your not able to please let me 
know and I'll adjust my time frame.  Thanks again for taking the time to 
write these recommendations for me.
Ben
