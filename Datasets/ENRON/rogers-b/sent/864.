Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?  
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you 
and your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that 
is Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to 
www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending 
the New Year?  Talk to you later.
Ben
