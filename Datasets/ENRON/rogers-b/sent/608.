Dr. Harris:
 In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have 
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to 
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this 
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most 
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was 
planning on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your 
suggestion with this matter.  
 I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride, but 
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from 
you soon.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers
