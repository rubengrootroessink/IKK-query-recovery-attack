First of all you may be skinny, but your a skinny geek - oh does that sound?  
I am sending in my application in this week.  Regarding grad school, I have 
gotten a couple of no's, but haven't heard from all the school's, but I am 
considering a position with an investment bank in NYC in their global power 
M&A Group.  Good money but I would put off grad school a couple of years and 
by that time who knows, maybe night school at that time.  I am training for 
the MS 150, which is th 170 mile bike race to Austin.  And you call me 
fatty!!  I'm heading the the Final Four next week - I ended up getting Mike 
Gioffre's Dad a couple of tickets, so he will in Indy.  OB and I went out to 
dinner in NYC when I was up their last week.  We went to a really expensive 
sushi place - it was awesome.  He seams to be doing well - he is considering 
going to a dot.com.  Gotta go!  I'll talk to you soon.
