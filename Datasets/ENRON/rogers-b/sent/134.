Charlie:
Sorry for the delay with the e-mail, I just got back into the office from 
traveling.  We are working hard to sell these assets before year-end - 
they're a beast.  This Friday does not look good for lunch, but I think 
Tuesday or Wednesday of next week works.  I hope this works for you as well.  
Talk to you soon.
Regards,
Ben
