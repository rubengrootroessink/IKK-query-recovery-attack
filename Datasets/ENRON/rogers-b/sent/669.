Dr. Harris:
Since I am a eternal optimist, I always feel I can strengthen my skills in 
most everything I do, but under these circumstances with the GMAT (timed 
exam) combined with my disability, I feel this is my best representation for 
this exam.  Also, I know that you would not what me to take the exam just to 
retake it, but due to my strong desire to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of 
Business, I would try to provide any additional information you needed to 
help strengthen my overall application file.  Again, thanks for the fast 
response to my e-mail.  Hope to hear from you soon!

Sincerely, 
Ben
