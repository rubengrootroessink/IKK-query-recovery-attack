Charlie:
I got your message this morning.  Since we were so successful in selling some 
of our peaking plant last time, we have decided to some some more - so we are 
running like crazy to close these deals this year.  I want to let you know 
that I talked to both people at KinderMorgan and Cinergy about your company 
and the types of transactions that you guys are doing.  I have not had the 
chance to follow up, but plan to real soon.  I just tried to call you about 
10 minutes ago, thus the e-mail response.  I will try again in a little bit.  
Hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben
