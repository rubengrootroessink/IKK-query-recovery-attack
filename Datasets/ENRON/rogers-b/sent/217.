Hey Mike:
Marlon and Marissa's wedding was alot of fun.  Megan and I sat at the married 
table, which had Pete and Amy Fullem, Kit and her husband, Marc, Sammy and 
her husband, Jon and Dana Corpina, Dana Schuster and her husband - so as you 
can see it was pretty interesting.  The other table was Mike, OB, Choby, 
Tina, and Patty Donahue.  Mike, OB, Choby, Patty, Megan and I took a limo 
from the city to the wedding and had the limo tell 12:00, then went out till 
5:00am.  I love going to that evil city, but I love leaving it even better.  
Overall, it was fun and seems like everyone is doing well.  Dana and Jon just 
had their baby, its a girl.  I also ended up seeing Alan Waugh and Tim 
Hurley.  Hurley has gained about 200 pounds - the man is huge.  Anyway, I 
hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben
