Hey man - good to hear from you.  It must be rough house sitting in River 
Oaks, just remember to leave the furniture before you go back to school.  
Next week would be great to get some brews.  My wife and I are moving this 
weekend so it is quite hectic this week.  I will need a lot of booze after 
this move!  How's Chase?  I'll talk to you soon.
Ben
