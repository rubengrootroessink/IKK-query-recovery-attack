Subject: a few more questions

1) do the capital cost of linears (gas, transmission and system upgrades)
include tax gross ups relating thereto?

2) Is the cost of backup power (for startup and station service) included in
the variable O&M estimate, or is it included in one of the fixed charges.
Please tell us where it is and how much it is expected to be annually?

Thanks.
