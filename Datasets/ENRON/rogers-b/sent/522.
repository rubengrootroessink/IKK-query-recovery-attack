Megan will be at the wedding that weekend, but I will not be able to make 
it.  Megan is going to spend most of July up in New York.  How is the 
fundraising business going?  I heard that Clinton's fundraiser tonight will 
bring in $23 million which will be $2 Mil. more than George W., which would 
be pretty impressive.
