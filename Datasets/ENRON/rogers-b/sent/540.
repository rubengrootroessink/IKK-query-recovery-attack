Here is a revised CA with CINergy.  They also sent a clean version thinking 
that we might not have any changes other than what we had before.  I am still 
trying to talk to Jeff about paragraghs #5 and #6.  Thanks
Ben

Ben, thanks for getting back so quickly with comments on the Confidentiality
Agreement.  Attached is a revised draft of the agreement blacklined from the
May 10 draft to show the changes you and I discussed and some slight
modification to address the concern I expressed to you.

I am enclosing a clean version of the blacklined agreement.  If the changes
are acceptable, please print out two originals for execution by ENA and
overnight to me for execution by Cinergy.  Please call me if you have any
questions or comments.
