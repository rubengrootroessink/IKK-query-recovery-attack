Hey Jon;
Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.  Megan and I are going over to 
Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.  
I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of 
graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the 
weekends as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Go Sox!
Ben
