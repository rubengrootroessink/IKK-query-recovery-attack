Dave:
Just wanted to say thank you for the invitation to Cafe Annie next Wednesday, 
unfortunately I will not be able to make it.  I can't tell how much I enjoy 
working within ENA and in particular the East Origination Group and with 
Genco.  Thanks again for the recognition and for giving me this opportunity 
to work in ENA.

Regards, 
Ben
