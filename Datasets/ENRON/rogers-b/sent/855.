Attached is an Excel Spreadsheet, worksheet 1 is a list the documents I think 
maybe available in whole or part now - we should make a request at our 
earliest convenience to Delmarva/TECO/???? I would be glad to call (probably 
following an introduction call) to get this going.

Worksheet 2 is a start of the Table of Contents of the Due Diligence - I will 
try and finish it today - we are modeling this on some Stone & Webster 
efforts we have copies of - I can get you an example as a go-by.

I have also started on the tasking letter, deliverable list, schedule, 
resources and estimated cost.  I should have that available either tomorrow 
or Monday (I won't have complete buyin on the numbers but should be close 
enough to get going).

If you have a list of our team on this project, it would be helpful. Sounded 
like Lou had a fairly complete list of the Clients people.
