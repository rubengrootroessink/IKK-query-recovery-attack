This is the model from KN regarding their 4 LM 6000 Plant and their other 
plant which has 6 LM 6000's and I EA.  These numbers are hard to follow so 
they probably won't make a lot of since, without me going through them with 
you, which we can do when I get back.  I will be back tomorrow night and will 
be checking my messages.
