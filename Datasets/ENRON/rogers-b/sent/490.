Stuart:
I'm heading into a peaker meeting at 9:00, but will be out in 30 minutes or 
so.  I talked to Jerry this morning and the best time to talk with him is 
this morning before 10:00 our time.  Let's try and talk with him about the 
remaining issues this morning so we can work on them from our end to 
eventually talk with him later today.  Thanks!
Ben
