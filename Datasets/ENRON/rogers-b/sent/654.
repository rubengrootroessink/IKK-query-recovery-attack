Dr. Harris:
 I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review 
my application. Though I am disappointed with the results I am still 
determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year.  I 
understand how competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my 
work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, 
etc. that this would compensate for my disability.  After talking with 
Professors Titman, Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that the School was 
the right place to get the education I was looking for.  
  I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the 
graduate level. I also plan on retaking the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee 
that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.  I would 
like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss 
my application file and to personally meet you.   
  If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application 
file for next year, please let me know.  Take care and hope to hear from you 
soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers
