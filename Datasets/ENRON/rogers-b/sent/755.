I am finally getting some responses on the Final Four tickets.  I will know 
by next week the final numbers.  As of now it looks very optimistic.  I am 
trying to get two tickets for you and your Dad.  I think my dad and I are 
going and a buddy of mine and his dad.  It will be a lot of fun.  Let me know 
where you guys will be flying into and where you might stay.  See ya
Ben
