Just wanted to let you know that I received an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, 
who at this point is in charge of my application.  He wants me to answer a 
few questions, making sure I will be able to handle the MBA coursework.  That 
was one of my main reasons for meeting with you and the Professors' Ronn and 
Brown, is to talk to you about the course work and inform you of my strengths 
and weaknesses, to make sure I could do the work.  I know that with my 
financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance background and the 
Business School's team-oriented approach to learning, that I will excel in 
this learning environment.  I will convey this message and others to him by 
tomorrow.  I hope things workout and thanks again for your help.
