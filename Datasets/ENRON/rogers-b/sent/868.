Fabian:
The July and August Operators report for Gleason are out on DealBench at Doc 
# 04.01.04.  The July Operators Report for Wheatland is also in DealBench at 
Doc. # 04.01.04.  The September reports for both plants are not out yet, but 
will be soon, probably next week.  I am working on getting you the hourly 
operational data for the months of August and Sept.  Please let me know if 
you have any more questions.
Ben
