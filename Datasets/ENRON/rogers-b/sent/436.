Michael:
How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a weekend 
in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming weekend.  I 
want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out with, but will 
take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to everyone informing 
them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to rent out for Saturday 
night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a bunch of different 
e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a list of the e-mails 
you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks for the help and lets 
talk about this further.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
