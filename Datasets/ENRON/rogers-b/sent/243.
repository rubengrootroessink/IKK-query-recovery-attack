Dr. Harris:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt 
mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class 
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.  When I hear back from GMAC, I am 
planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon. 

Regards,

Ben Rogers
