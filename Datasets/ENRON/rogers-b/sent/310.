Luke:
How are ya?  How is the DC area these days?  Houston is still fucking hot and 
Enron is still doing well and the price is still screaming so things are 
good.  In response to your inquiry regarding Homecoming.  Megan and I are 
actually, if you can believe it, going to Marlon and Marissa's wedding the 
first weekend in October in NJ.  Also, OB, Chobu, Mike, Corpina and Danny, 
Patty D, Sammy, Amy, etc. are going as well - should be interesting.  I 
haven't seen some of those people for quite awhile.  I was trying to set 
something up, but that came up as well as I'm running in this year's NYC 
Marathon, which is the first Sunday in Novemebr, so trying to arrange 
something became even harder.  I still want to get together with you guys, 
but trying to figure out when and where.  Suggestions are welcomed.  Hope all 
is going well and talk to you soon.
