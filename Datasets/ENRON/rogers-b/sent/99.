Teseo:
It was a pleasure meeting you.  I enjoyed our conversation, which I hope was 
helpful with regards to understanding how Enron operates.  Enron is truely a 
great place to work.  It's a lot of hard work, but your having a lot of fun 
doing it.  I hope all your interviews went well on Saturday.  Good luck with 
the second year and please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any 
additional questions.
Regards,
Ben
