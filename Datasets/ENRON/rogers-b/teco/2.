George,

As I mentioned, I may have to give a presentation Thursday to some Japanese 
utilities re. the North American power market.  I was hoping your group could 
help me with some generic market background information.

Wholesale volumes (sale for resale) by quarter, by NERC region since 1995 if 
possible.
Power marketer rankings, national volumes 1995 - 1999.
New plant (MW) coming on line by NERC region by year ... 1995 - 2005.
Load and reserve margins, 1995 - 2005 by NERC region.
Measures of wholesale power price volitility by region since 1995 ... 
possibly overlayed on reserve margins.
Do we track instances of line loading relief by region?

Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated.

regards,

Don
