I wanted to welcome you to the Transaction Analysis & Execution - Capital 
/CTG group.  Some of you I have met, others I look forward to meeting soon.  

Could you please fill out the attached data sheet and return to Sarah Reyna 
or myself by noon Wednesday (3/15).  I need to begin preparing for our move 
on the 29th floor.  I believe that some of you may have already received this 
when you started the group.   



If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call at x36583 or 
Sarah at x58035.


Thank you,
Tamara Davis
Assistant to Andrea Reed
V.P.  of the Transaction Analysis & Execution - Capital group
