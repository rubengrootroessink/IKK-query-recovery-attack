Hi Anabeth - Ben and I were wondering about the results of your call to HQ regarding a possible financial deal at this point

also - do you any kind of indicative offer so we see if we are even close

we would have to work up a specific confirm for this deal but that is fairly easily doable

pls reply to both of us

thanks

Woody and Ben
