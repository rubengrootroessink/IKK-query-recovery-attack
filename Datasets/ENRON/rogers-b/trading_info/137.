More Sector Thoughts After the WTC/Pentagon Disasters

* Defensive posture means stocks should outperform
With European markets sinking and political talk turning
towards a protracted military response we expect electric stocks
in general to see sector inflows.
* Precedence
The sector has outperformed in the wake of other crises and
industry wide fundamentals appear stable.
* Large-cap integrateds may be the best place
Regulated utilities more well known as a defensive sector while
volatility benefits merchants - big integrateds with merchant
exposure like DUK, AEP, and D offer both.
* Direct impacts limited
Little capital invested in a potentially volatile Middle East;
industry is primarily domestic; lower NYC demand transitory
and likely immaterial, in our view.
