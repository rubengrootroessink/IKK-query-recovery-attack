Ben, 
Hope you had fun in Martha's Vineyard.  Bet you are glad to have Megan back.   
I am sure CBCIII could not survive without me for more than a couple of  
days..... 
Can you send your dad and MA's and your mom and Dale's address.  They sent us  
a wonderful and very generous gift. 
Stay cool in that Houston August. 
Hope to see you soon. 
     Deirdre CARNES!
