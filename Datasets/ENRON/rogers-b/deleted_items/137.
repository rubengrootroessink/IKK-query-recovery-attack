We want YOU to join New York Road Runners! And if you join or renew your
membership this week, you'll receive 20% off all merchandise, double the
usual 10% member discount! Remember, if you're a member for the full year
(starting by January 31, 2002) and complete nine qualifying races, you'll
be guaranteed entry to the 2003 New York City Marathon.

To join or renew your membership, please visit
http://www.nyrrc.org/membership. Then, go to our online store
(http://www.nyrrc.org/merchandise) and take advantage of a 20% discount off
everything from technical gear to books and gifts to Official New York City
Marathon merchandise. Enter code #386 under "special instructions" with
your shipping info to receive the 20% discount.

(Since it will take us a few days to process your membership application,
you might not yet have a membership number when you shop online. That's OK;
simply enter code #386 under "special instructions" with your shipping
info. We will then apply the 20% discount at fulfillment and deduct that
amount from your final bill.)

This merchandise discount is also available for phone orders. Just be sure
to mention code #386 to our phone operators at 800.405.2288 after you join
or renew your membership at http://www.nyrrc.org/membership.

Offer valid only until January 31, 2002; no other discounts apply.
