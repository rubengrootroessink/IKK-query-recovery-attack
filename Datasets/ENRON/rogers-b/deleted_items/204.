Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO has decided to delay the Round 1 Sale of One-Year TCCs in the
Spring 2002 TCC Auction by one day due to the Presidents Day holiday on
Monday February 18.  No other changes to the Initial Spring 2002 TCC
Auction Time Line will result from this action.

The five days allocated for the Round 1 Sale will occur February 19-23 with
the following activities:

     Feb 19:  Market Participants submit TCC bids and offers, if
applicable.
     Feb 20-22:  ISO processes bids and conducts TCC Auction analysis.
     Feb 23:  ISO posts Auction results for Market Participant review.

NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience that this delay may cause.


Regards,
Customer Relations
518-356-6060
