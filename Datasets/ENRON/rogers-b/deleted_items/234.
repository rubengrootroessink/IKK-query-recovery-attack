 Two couples were playing cards one evening. John accidentally dropped  some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed that Bill's wife's legs were wide apart, and she  wasn't wearing any underwear!

Shocked by this, John upon trying to sit back up again, hit his head on the table & emerged red-faced. Later, John went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bill's wife followed & asked, "Did you see anything that you liked under there?"

Surprised by her boldness, John admitted that, well, indeed he did.   She said, "Well, you can have it but it will cost you $500."  After taking a minute or two to assess the financial situation as well as the moral costs of this offer, John says that he is indeed interested.  She tells him that since her husband, Bill, works Friday afternoons & John doesn't, that John should be at her house around 2pm Friday afternoon.  
When Friday rolled around, John showed up at Bill's house for the planned time at 2pm sharp & after paying her the agreed upon $500, they went to the bedroom & completed their sexual transaction as Sue had promised. Afterwards, John quickly dressed & left.  
As usual, Bill came home from work at 6pm & upon entering the house, asks his wife abruptly, "Did John come by the house this afternoon?"

With a lump in her throat, Bill's wife answered, "Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon". Her heart nearly skipped  a beat when her husband curtly asked, "And did he give you $500?". In terror, she assumed that somehow he had found out, & after mustering up her best poker face, replied, "Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500".

Bill, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by saying,"Good, I was hoping he did. John came by the office this morning &
 borrowed $500 from me. He promised me he'd stop by our house this afternoon on his way home & pay me back."

 NOW THAT'S A PLAYER! ! ! !
