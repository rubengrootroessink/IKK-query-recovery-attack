The following revisions have been made to the 2/15/2002

1)   In Table 2, the peak load, ICAP LCR and UCAP LCR for
     New York City and Long Island have been revised
     to correct typos in the peak load values that effect the
     calculation of the ICAP LCR and UCAP LCR

2)    An explanation has been provided for the large
     reduction in the Long Island locational requirements
