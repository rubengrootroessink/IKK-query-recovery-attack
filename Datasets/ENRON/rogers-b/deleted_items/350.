B,

Good talking to you.  I will email your dad today to get his advice.

Does he have a junior executive type that works directly for him?  In my
ideal fantasy world I would really like to work for someone like that and get
that type of exposure to corp finance/ industry......

I am probably dreaming, but didn't know if CEO's had people like that working
directly   for them.  Obviously not an assistant, but someone in a junior
execuitive role that goes with them to all the meetings and handles follow-up
etc..... I would love to be exposed to they type of knowledge.

Just a thought.
