Joe has brought up some great  points once again. As Tom has pointed out that
the NYISO should be in the forefront in addressing this. Since 1999 the PAR
issue has been brought up time and time again, both in committees and in direct
complaints to the NYISO. The ball is squarely in the NYISO's court. I, would
like to see on this forum, an update/discussion from the NYISO addressing Joe's
concerns. If nothing else it would bring everyone up to date on where we are on
this issue. All too often good points are brought up on this forum, just to die
because there was no NYISO imput or the answer was off line.
