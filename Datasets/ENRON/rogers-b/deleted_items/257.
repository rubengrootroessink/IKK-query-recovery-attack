Ben I spoke with your dad last week.  We had a good conversation and I look
forward to meeting him when the GS team next gets to Cincinnati.  Many
thanks for your help.  Regards  Jack

Jack:
I hope that you remember me.  We played golf together at The Breakers
course about three weeks ago.  I am currently working in Enron's power
trading group, but prior to this I was in Enron's corporate development
group.  I mentioned to you that my Dad is Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO of
Cinergy Corp., which is a mid size ($5.4 Bil.)  utility located in
Cincinnati.  He has been CEO of this company for over 13 years and is
always looking for ways to grow his company through strategic acquisitions.
In the past he has talked to some of your bankers, but I would like to try
and get you two together, to see if there is something your companies can
work on together.  I really think the two of you could have a successful
meeting.  He is very  forward thinking and is quite open to new ideas and
creative structures.  His contact information is listed below.  I hope all
is going well and again, it was a pleasure to have met you and play golf
with you at your club.  Please let me know if you need any additional
information.
