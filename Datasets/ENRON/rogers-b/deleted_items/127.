Dear Benjamin C Rogers;

Because you canceled your entry last year, you assured yourself a spot in
the NYC Marathon on November 3, 2002 without having to enter the lottery.
All you need to do is register by May 1, 2002, in order to enter the 2002
marathon.

You will be able to register online beginning January 31st. To do so, log
on to http://www.nyrrc.org/nyrrc/marathon-guarantee.html, type in your
unique entry number and password--your entry number is  8782 and your
password is 13ROG68782 --and then follow the instructions. You'll have to
verify or correct your personal information and then enter your payment
information.

If you'd prefer to register by mail, print out this message and return the
bottom portion (or copy your entry number, name, and address onto a
separate sheet of paper) along with a self-addressed, stamped,
business-sized (#10) envelope to: New York City Marathon Guaranteed
Entries, P.O. Box 1388 GPO, New York, NY 10116. We will send you a special
application to fill out and return by May 1, 2002, for guaranteed entry.

Having guaranteed entry to the New York City Marathon is an enviable
position. We hope you will take advantage of this opportunity and we look
forward to congratulating you on a successful marathon next November.

Best wishes,
Allan Steinfeld
Race Director
