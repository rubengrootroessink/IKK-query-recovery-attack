Prices in the January 8, 2002 Real-Time Market are correct.

Prices in the January 9, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to automate the
ECA-B price replacements.  Current real-time prices reflect any necessary
changes due to ECA-B.
