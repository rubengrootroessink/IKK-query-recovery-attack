Dear Market Participants,

Software release for December 4, 2001

The ability to simultaneously offer fixed block schedules at
biddable prices will be introduced to the NYISO market.  This
Multi-Hour Block Transaction (MHBT) functionality will allow
users to specify a minimum run-time characteristic to their
external transactions.  SCUC will account for the minimum run-
time parameter of MHBTs in determining the least production cost
evaluation for the day.  As a result, if SCUC schedules the MHBT,
it will be scheduled at the full requested MW and requested time
frame.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
