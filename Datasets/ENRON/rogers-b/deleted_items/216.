Dear Market Participants,

The ISO is reviewing its financial assurance policy
with regard to collateral requirements for participation
in the T.C.C. market.  The ISO will advise market
participants of the results of its review and will
present proposed modifications, if any, in advance
of their adoption.

The ISO expects this review will be completed in March.

Regards,

NYISO Market Relations
