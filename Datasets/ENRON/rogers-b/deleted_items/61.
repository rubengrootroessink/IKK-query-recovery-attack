The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 10:00 and 16:00 in the January 7,
2002 Real-Time Market as well as the following hours at the external proxy
buses:

HQ:  12:00

Prices in the January 8, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to automate the
ECA-B price replacements.  Current real-time prices reflect any necessary
changes due to ECA-B.
