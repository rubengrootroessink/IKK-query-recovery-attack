Dear Market Participants,

The following changes to the NYISO OASIS/MIS/CSS systems will be released
on February 26, 2002.

Preliminary changes to the MIS database will be made in preparation for
future testing and implementation of the Open Scheduling System (OSS).
These changes will have no functional effect on the current system.

Minor enhancements will be made to the Consolidated Invoice.  The date
selection box will be modified to a drop down format and negative values
on the PDF output will be represented with parenthesis instead of a minus
sign.

Bidding and Scheduling pages will be updated in style to match the look and
feel of the public web site.

The process for posting prices will be updated to make it more efficient.
This will have no effect on how prices are calculated or presented.

Changes will also be made to the real-time system in preparation for the
move of the Rockland Electric load to the PJM control area.
If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representative or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
