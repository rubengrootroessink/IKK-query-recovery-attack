[IMAGE] "I'm writing to tell you about a flight I just purchased through my Active Advantage membership. A last-minute trip came up where I needed to fly from New York to San Diego.  I checked a bunch of online travel sources and found fares between $2,257.50 and $2,263. When I checked through Active Advantage, the same flight was $698 - that's almost 70% off.  I booked my flight and my trip went off without a hitch.  This is a great program. Thanks." Scott C.
