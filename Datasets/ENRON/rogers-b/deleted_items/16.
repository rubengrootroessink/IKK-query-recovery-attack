Bryce,

	I have a couple idea's for this model and I'd like to know what you think. I would like to create one model which would have the potential to encompass a larger amount of information. I could create a similar model which would have basically the same format but allow you to select which zones you would like to view. We could even allow the selection of which region if needed. This could save us alot of time and energy by not having to make small changes which take too much time. I'm free pretty much all morning tomorrow if you would like to get together for about 30 minutes or so and discuss. 

Thanks,
Mike
