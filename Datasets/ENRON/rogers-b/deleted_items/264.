Mike-
What a day! I didn't hear from Tara until 4:00 and she worked next door.
She's pretty upset. She said she saw things that she will never forget. I'm
going to pick her up in NJ today. Jean is getting married on Saturday and
most of Jamie's friends are flying in. Have you heard from everybody? Hope
everyone is ok. Talk to you soon.

Michelle
