-- This week TWST has an interview with the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
of PDG Environmental, Inc.  He states, "PDG Environmental is an environmental
and specialty contractor. We've been in business since 1984. We have offices
in 14 cities across the country. We are a national contractor with - what we
like to call - a local presence because we are capable of doing the largest
projects as evidenced by a recently awarded $13 million contract with Con Edison
and TRC Companies, but we are also able to respond very quickly to even the
smallest projects in the $10,000 to $50,000 range. Our main lines of work include
asbestos abatement, lead abatement, toxic mold remediation, demolition and
insulation. We are the third largest asbestos abatement contractor in the
country and the thirty-fifth largest environmental contractor."
He continues, "We have been making one or two acquisitions a year for the
past several years. We've recently completed an acquisition of a company in
Southern California, which was our largest acquisition to date. Tri-State
Restorations completed the nationwide geographic presence that we wanted.
There are many opportunities for acquisition out there, and we are looking
to acquire companies with a diversified revenue and customer base."  To read
