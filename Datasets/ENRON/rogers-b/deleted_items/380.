[IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  November 26, 2001     New Power Plant Planned fo=
r New York City  By Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis   [N=
ews item from Energy Info Source] New York state's siting board approved As=
toria Energy's plans to build a 1,000-megawatt power plant in New York City=
, clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January. Astoria E=
nergy hopes to have the natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle plant that will b=
e at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service b=
y 2004. The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepara=
tion before it can begin construction, and still must receive some local pe=
rmits from New York City. Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC, a pri=
vately owned energy development company based in Concord, Mass.    Analysis=
: The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City are=
a should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply problems th=
at have been identified within this region. Like California, New York also =
suffers from a supply / demand imbalance. However, even if or when power su=
pply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New York City st=
ill suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue to take t=
heir own toll on the stability of the market. In other words, transmission =
capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the extent th=
at power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported. The fact that Ast=
oria Energy has received approval from New York state's siting board to pro=
ceed with this New York City-based plant is significant, but it should not =
be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city gov=
ernment. This could be easier said than done, as other planned power plants=
 in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the last year =
by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who ardently =
voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new plant con=
struction.   The problems within the New York power market have been well d=
ocumented. The state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant onl=
ine since 1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost =
seven years since a 1,000-MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to=
 open upstate. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new=
 capacity in the next three to four years. Consequently, concerns about the=
 state's ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum. =
Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval st=
eps for siting new plants in the state. However, at the same time, environm=
ental and community groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and o=
ften lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce powe=
r.    While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the probl=
em appears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 repor=
t issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) entitled "Inves=
tigation of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region," highlighted specific cap=
acity problems in the New York City/Long Island community of 11 million peo=
ple. These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from=
 most of the state's grid, the study said. Like Northern California, which =
suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints, New York City a=
nd Long Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained t=
ransmission lines. Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New =
York, but cannot reach the city. Being both densely populated and heavily r=
esidential, it is difficult to site new power plants in the area. Consequen=
tly, 80 percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the cit=
y. New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because =
New York City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at =
times during the course of 2002. The projected shortfall is expected to inc=
rease by another 200 MW by summer 2002.    Increased demand is causing addi=
tional problems for the energy markets of New York City and New York State.=
 Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from 1995 to 2000, or 2.5 times as fa=
st as new generation capacity was added. Demand over the course of 2001 was=
 expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 percent above regulators' earlie=
r forecasts.    It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will p=
roceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City. Astoria Ene=
rgy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energy-eff=
icient and environmentally sound technologies in the New York City area. Th=
e company is a subsidiary of SCS Energy, a privately owned energy developme=
nt company formed in 1998 for the purpose of developing and owning new elec=
tric generating facilities. Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds =
some additional light on the proposed plant. As noted, the 1,000-MW unit wi=
ll be a natural gas-fired facility, which will obtain natural gas supplied =
from the ConEd/New York facility pipeline. The capital cost for the plant r=
eportedly will be $600 million. Commercial operation, pending the necessary=
 approvals on the local level, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003.=
 Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for =
the new plant because it will be using a technology that is specifically ge=
ared toward the reduction of air emissions.    However, despite this optimi=
sm, the community opposition factor should not be discounted, and there are=
 several examples that may foreshadow the opposition that Astoria Energy co=
uld face. Take Sithe Energies, for example, which hit a roadblock with its =
construction plans in the New York area earlier this year. Sithe Energies o=
riginally planned a 827-MW combined-cycle facility fueled by natural gas in=
 Ramapo, N.Y. Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramap=
o plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand, and as a=
 result would use local water resources for cooling purposes. Community res=
istance thus became an issue for the company, which altered its plans and b=
egan to consider a 510-MW peaking unit (also powered by natural gas) that w=
ould only be operated in times of increased demand.     As another example,=
 environmental and community groups won a victory in court just last week t=
hat essentially will block construction of small power plants in the South =
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island areas. Each is a 44-MW plant, thou=
gh at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than 80 MW.  A=
 coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in =
these areas and sued the New York Power Authority, claiming (among other th=
ings) that the state had failed to perform adequate environmental-review st=
udies. The groups claim that the state should test the plants for their out=
put of fine particulate matter. A lower court had ruled in favor of the sta=
te, but a judgment last week in the New York Court of Appeals was clearly a=
 win for the environmental and community groups. The new ruling, which repo=
rtedly cannot be appealed further, says that the state must do unprecedente=
d air tests at the 10 plants or shut them down by Jan. 31.     In a report =
issued earlier this year, New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG), one =
of New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have enough megawatt=
s to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until 2008. NYSE=
G, in a report issued late Wednesday, warned there are "serious problems wi=
th (New York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline i=
nfrastructure." According to data included in a separate report by the New =
York ISO, which manages the state's transmission grid, between 1995 and 200=
0, while statewide demand in New York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity=
 under contract in the state reportedly increased only by 1,060 MW.    Cons=
equently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York remained s=
trained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of new g=
eneration capacity. However, Astoria Energy, which seeks to bring new gener=
ation online in New York that will be based on clean technologies, may stil=
l face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the const=
ruction of any new plants in the region (with the exception of peaker units=
, whose output would be closely regimented). If plans for this plant are bl=
ocked or significantly altered, following the experience of Sithe Energies,=
 the options to resolve New York City's supply / demand imbalance will once=
 again become focused on a combination of other approaches, including conse=
rvation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives.    An =
