An audit of the price verification and correction process has revealed some
instances of problems related to coordinating the ECA-A and B end-state
process with the price reservation and correction procedures carried out by
the NYISO's consultant.  The affected days were 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 21, 29, and
31 January 2002 and 1, 7, and 8 February 2002.  There were two problems of
coordination, each distinct but related to the other.  In certain hours on
days requiring internal price corrections, tables containing the ECA-A
adjustments at the external proxy buses were inadvertently joined to the
real-time tables, overwriting some real-time information with the BME
information.  The overwrite took place prior to the posting of the
corrected prices on the web.  The consequence was that a database that was
supposed to contain only real-time information contained a mix of real-time
and BME information.  The second problem resulted from the NYISO
consistently using an "hour-beginning" timeframe for the ECA-A and B
end-state and other processes, while the correction process that overwrote
the information (see above) used an "hour-ending" timeframe.  The
consequence was that certain top-of-the-hour intervals were corrected
inappropriately and not subsequently overwritten by the NYISO-originated
end-state ECA correction.  The NYISO apologizes for any confusion that
these correction adjustments have caused.
