Ben!
Whats happening down in HOuston?  Got some big news on my end - I am moving
out to San Diego to start a job with Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management.
I've been on vaca, working on my golf game and tan since graduating Cornell
in May and move out this week.  Looking forward to the job and the
lifestyle - I'll be living a few blocks from the beach and never have to see
snow again!  I'll send along full contact info once I get fully settled in a
couple of weeks.  COme visit if you are ever out that way.  Hope all is
well.
Pete
