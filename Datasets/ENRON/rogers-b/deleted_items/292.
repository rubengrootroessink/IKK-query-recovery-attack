Dear Market Participants,

NERC announced a delay in the implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7 from
March 6, 2002 to April 10, 2002.  This delay is necessitated by vendor
inter-operability problems experienced during dress rehearsals on
February 14 and February 21.  These problems could adversely impact
reliability and hamper the marketplace.

The NYISO will implement E-Tag Version 1.7 in tandem with NERC.  NYISO
Market Participants should ensure that their respective Agent Services
are upgraded to the new version, should complete their TSIN registration,
and are encouraged to participate in the remaining dress rehearsals to the
extent possible.

NERC is conducting a survey of the preparedness of Industry Participants
for the planned implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7.  Market Participants
are also asked to complete this survey.  The responses to the survey
received thus fare are posted on the NERC website.

Attached below are additional details and instructions for the
implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7.  If you have questions about
New York- or Northeast-specific issues, please call the Customer
Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060 or email Karl Tammar at
ktammar@nyiso.com.  Vendor-specific issues should be reported directly
to E-Tag vendors.  NERC has requested that general problems be reported
to TISFORUM.

Regards,

Customer Relations
518-356-6060
