Upon audit of price reservations, the NYISO has noted an inadvertent
omission of one hour from the February 15, 2002 Real-Time Market
reservations.  The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience this may have
caused.  The correct reservations are as follows:

The NYISO is reserving hour beginning 8:00 in the February 15, 2002
Real-Time Market.

This reservation is in addition to the previously announced reservation of
hour beginning 21:00 in the February 15, 2002 Hour-Ahead market.
