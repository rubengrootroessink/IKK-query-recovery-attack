Dear NYTimes.com Member:

After the events of Sept. 11, it's more important than ever
to stay informed about terrorist activities occurring around
the globe. To help, we've created two special online Topics
of the Times offerings that we'd like to share with you.
Each contains a series of up to nine archived Op-Ed columns
by Thomas Friedman, National Book Award winner and foreign
affairs columnist for The New York Times.

Priced at only $4.95 each, these riveting collections put at
your fingertips the insightful, Pulitzer Prize-winning
perspectives of America's foremost commentator on the Middle
East, terrorism and globalization.

"Thomas Friedman on Terrorism" contains six pre-Sept. 11
columns about the threat of terrorism and the conflict in
the Middle East:

-- Digital Defense
-- A Memo From Osama
-- Angry, Wired and Deadly
-- Motives for the Bombing
-- The Terrorist Question
-- Beirut, Oklahoma
