The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 17:00 and 18:00 in the January 29,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 15:00 and 19:00 in the
January 29, 2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 30, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.
