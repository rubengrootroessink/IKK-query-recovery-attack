JSavitt@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Prices in the 18 November 2001 DAM and the 17 November real-time market are
correct.
The NYISO is reserving hours-beginning 4, 10, and 14 at the PJM proxy bus.

This notice was posted to the OASIS and the TIE earlier today, but has not
yet appeared on the TIE, so we are posting it again.
