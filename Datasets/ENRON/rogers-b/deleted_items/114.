The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 08:00, 10:00, 17:00, 18:00, and
20:00 in the January 21, 2002 Real-Time Market as well as hour beginning
08:00 at all external locations.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 19:00, 20:00, and 23:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 22, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.
