Sorry I didn't get back to you.  We were on the go all weekend.  Two
engagement parties for Susan's brother and my 29th birthday on top of that.
I'm available after work anytime this week besides tonight.

PS...my parents got me the same racket as you got for christmas.  It should
be ready for domination this weekend.
