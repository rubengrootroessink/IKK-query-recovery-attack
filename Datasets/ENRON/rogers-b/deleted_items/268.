X-Stn-Info:


It's now 4am on the 14th, and I saw Sheila Brown on NBC holding a missing person sign.  That is the only CUA person I've seen or heard of.  If anyone knows anything please let me know.  Sheila has been very special to me since the first day I met her.
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone!!

Joe: 
I am o.k. So is Kiernan, Dimino, Lytle, Romano. I am at work today at 
the Empire State Building. Security is tight. Only employees with 
picture ID allowed in. Must go through metal detectors and police have 
all streets around Empire State Building blocked off. F-16 fighter jets 
flying overhead to protect building and make me feel a little safer. 
Please let me know if all CUA people are O.K. I am not sure if you know 
her, but my wife's best friend Amy Callahan from CUA, I believe lost her 
boyfriend who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th Floor of Tower 1. 
He was a really nice guy. Fitz's brother-in-law alo worked at Cantor 
Fitzgerald on the 104th floor. No Cantor Fitzgerald people have 
reported in and Dimino says no one above the plane crashes were able to 
make it out. Please say a prayer for them. 
Good luck, and let me know if you hear anything.

Dear Friends, 
I have been lucky enough to speak with a few of you today. I wish that 
it was possible to speak to all of you. I, fortunately, have not heard 
any grave news of my friends as of 2am 9/12/01. I would love to hear 
from everyone posted to this note, whom I've not spoken to as yet. I am 
thinking and praying for all of you, your families, and co-workers. 
Please know people everywhere are thinking of everyone in New York. I 
hope you all are well, and will be waiting to hear anything from anyone. 
Your Friend, 
Joe
