-- This week TWST has an interview with the President and Chief Executive Officer
of Automodular Corporation.  He states, "Automodular Corporation began in
1989 when it entered a very specialized field called sequencing. Sequencing
is the assembly of modules for the automotive assembly plants in sequence
with the final production. What's unusual about the business is that our plants
have to be located within a few kilometers of the final assembly plants and
receive orders every few seconds."  He states, "Our strategy is to continue to
expand our sequencing business, both at the current level, which we call
Tier-Two, where we only bill our customers for the services we provide and not for
the materials we handle and at a Tier-One level. So when we dress an engine, we
don't buy the engine and then sell it to the customer; the engine comes to us on
consignment, and we just bill for the cost of the value-added we're putting on it.
We're bidding on contracts now that are in what, in the industry, is called a
Tier-One level, where we would purchase the material, perform our operations and
assembly and then sell it to the final customer."  To read more of this interview
