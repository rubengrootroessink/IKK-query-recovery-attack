-- This week TWST has an interview with the President and CEO and
a Director of CDI Corp.  He states, "CDI today is an outsourcing and staffing
company. We are leaders in several of the areas we participate in. We've got
four major lines of business or reporting segments. Our Management Recruiters
International business is the world's leading recruiting company. Our Today's
Staffing business is a regional player in clerical and administrative temporary
staffing. Then we have our Professional Services business, which is higher-end
technology and technical services staffing in targeted industries; we're one of
the leaders in those spaces. And we've got our Project Management business,
specializing in engineering and information technology outsourcing."  He states,
"Clearly, there's huge opportunity in the Project Management businesses.
Outsourcing is a trend that's going to continue and, in fact, accelerate. Most
corporations are becoming more disciplined at sticking to their core
competencies and outsourcing the rest. They're getting more financially
disciplined in looking to manage on a steady run rate of staffing and, for
peak-and-valley effects, to outsource projects. I think there's a tremendous
boom coming in outsourcing in general. And then there are some specific
industry sectors that I think are very attractive, some targeted vertical markets,
a good example being health care, where there's going to be a tremendous
opportunity for us."  To read more of

-- We also have an analyst interview with the Director and Senior Analyst in the
Equity Research department at Robert W. Baird & Company.  He highlights Manpower.
"Manpower is another interesting pick, for reasons I discussed earlier -
improved mix, management, and margin potential. The current estimates are
depressed. I think Manpower can potentially do $2.50 per share in 2003, and
trade at 20 times that number - and the stock is only mid-$30s today."
