Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO has encountered delays in the posting
of the Initial Spring 2002, TCC Auction Bid and Offer
Forms.  The NYISO will post the forms as soon as
possible.  Please note that the initial timeline which
requires the forms to be submitted to the NYISO by
close of business February 13, 2002 has been extended.
These forms must now be submitted to the NYISO by
close of business, February 14, 2002.

NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience that this
delay may have caused.
