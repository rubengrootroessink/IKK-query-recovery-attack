Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO encountered problems with SCD last night as a result of the code
changes to transfer the Rockland Electric load to PJM.  The NYISO entered
Back-up Dispatch System mode around 4:30 a.m.and remained there until about
8:00 a.m.  We are currently using SCD for dispatch, and the transfer of the
Rockland Electric load has been completed.

Market Monitioring will place additional monitoring focus on the HAM to
ensure competitive market results in the event that problems with SCD
re-occur.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Customer Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
