"May, Tom" <Tom.May@ENRON.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As usual, Joe has cut directly to the issue and I could not agree more.
While there has been progress made in New York, the NYISO and the New
York market will never gain credibility or the confidence of the market
as long as these situations exist.  While the NYISO may not have the
ability to unilaterally change this, they would at gain some credibility
if they were the ones raising the issue and aggresively and publically
advocating for change.
