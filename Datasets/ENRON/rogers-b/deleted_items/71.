Ben,

Good Morning!  I work for Joe Toussaint and I'll be making your travel
arrangements and scheduling the meetings for January 3.  I wanted to
check with you before I scheduled the flights.  Please call me at your
earliest convenience.  I'll be leaving the office today at Noon.
Thanks!

Missy Sturgeon
