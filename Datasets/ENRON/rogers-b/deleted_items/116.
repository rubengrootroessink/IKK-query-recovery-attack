B,

In San Diego right now with the US Navy. Heading into the field with Marines
M-Thu this week, so will be incommunicado.

Wanted to check and see if your dad got the email I sent him about 1 days
ago....wasn't expecting an immediate response as I know he is very busy, just
wanted to make sure he got it.

What's the latest with you and your plan?
