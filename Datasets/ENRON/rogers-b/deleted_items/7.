-- This week TWST has an interview with the President and CEO of Xchange, Inc.
He states, "Xchange is a business that started in 1995, a private company,
a profitable business that worked its way to a public offering in 1998. And
through that period of time it assembled a pretty marquis base of customers.
The company has over 300 customers, names you may know such as Ford Motor
Company; J.P. Morgan Chase; actually, 10 of the top US banks; retail companies
like Staples; consumer package companies; big investment houses like Fidelity."
He continues, "At Xchange we focus on the largest customers in the Global 2000.
We believe that our history and our customer base there gives us an opportunity
to continue to build a product that's going to perform and scale for a company
the size of Ford. As an example, Ford, last year, did with us over 100 different
marketing campaigns: they want to double that this year. And their biggest worry
is performance, scalability, being able to take the same amount of people and
being able to double the companies and our technology is really the way they do
that. So, competitively, we've done very well at big customers. That's our
focus."  To read more of this interview

-- This week TWST also has an interview with the President and Chief Executive Officer
of Prophet 21, Inc.He states, "Prophet 21 develops enterprise software
solutions, including an Internet trading network, and offers supporting
professional services for durable goods distributors that enable them to
increase sales and improve customer service while reducing operating costs.
Ever since our founding by John and Dorothy Meggitt in 1967, Prophet 21 has
positioned itself as a leader in serving the technology needs of durable goods
distributors in North America. We currently have nearly 2,000 customers - each
with an average of five stocking locations - that utilize Prophet 21's
technology and technology services. Our core target markets include industrial,

a very successful history of bringing enterprise software solutions and the
associated professional services to distributors and that will continue well into
the future. In addition, we recently expanded our offerings to include an Internet
trading network, Trading Partner Connect. Trading Partner Connect streamlines the
