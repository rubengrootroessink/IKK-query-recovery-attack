Dear NYTimes.com Member,

One of the most meaningful features to appear in The New
York Times and on NYTimes.com is Portraits of Grief. This
feature first began running on September 15 and presented
brief profiles of World Trade Center victims. On December
31 the final daily edition of Portraits of Grief appeared
in The New York Times newspaper. A book will be published
this year, and the feature will continue to appear from
time to time, as more names become known and more families
agree to interviews.

In the meantime, we invite you to visit the Web site to
see a complete collection of Portraits of Grief,
alphabetized and listed by day. This archive represents
all the Portraits published to date. They will remain at
NYTimes.com indefinitely.

Another recent special feature has been the multimedia
photo essay. We have already talked here about the essays
done by Vincent Laforet and James Hill. I would now like
to direct your attention to the newest, this one by Times
staff photographer Ruth Fremson about the women in
Afghanistan. The essay features a very strong audio
commentary, which makes the point that not all the women
feel the same about the head-to-toe veil they were
required to wear under the Taliban's rule: in fact, many
are very comfortable dressed as they are.

We have enjoyed participating in almost daily
"conversations" with correspondents of The New York Times.
In these unstructured talks, each correspondent provides
information not only about the news he or she is covering,
but on what life is like in the particular place he or she
is located. There are over 50 discussions now available
for listening in audio format.

The Winter Olympics games at Salt Lake City begin soon and
NYTimes.com already has started covering this event. Our
Olympics section covers security concerns, athlete
profiles and an interactive map of the torch relay.
Special e-mail updates are now available, and include
periodic countdown reports and details of the torch run,
athlete profiles and event previews. When the games begin
on Feb. 8, we'll send daily dispatches with event results
and exclusive "postcards" from Salt Lake City by Times
sports reporter George Vecsey.

6. Best of 2001 in the arts

The critics of The New York Times review the year in the

7. For students, "TEST" doesn't have to be a four-letter
word
------

The Learning Network's Word of the Day and Test Prep
Question of the Day help students build their vocabulary
for upcoming standardized tests in ways that are fun and
interactive. Every weekday there's a focus on a different
word -- its definition and an example of its use in the
context of a recent Times article; and students can then
test their understanding online with the day's analogy or
sentence completion question.
