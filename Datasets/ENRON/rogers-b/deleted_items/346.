JSavitt@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has been experiencing difficulties in posting price reservations
to the TIE.  The postings have from time to time been extraordinarily
delayed.  Our internal process identifies such delays in enough time so
that we can generate another posting by COB of the appropriate day.
Several times the originally delayed posting has shown up on the TIE as
well, resulting in dual postings.  The NYISO apologizes for any confusion.
The NYISO notes that the price reservations are also posted to the OASIS,
and that there have been no problems in tghe latter process.
