Scott,
This should fit your purposes.  Please call me if you need any clarification 
or if it does not meet your needs.

Ben,
This is the same model I sent you back at the beginning of December for your 
scenarios with Rodney.  You may be more accessible to help Scott with any 
questions that he has though I'm happy to help should you need me.

Thanks
Grant
