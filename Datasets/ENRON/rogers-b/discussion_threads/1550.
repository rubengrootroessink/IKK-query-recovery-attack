INFOSPACE MAKES MONEY FROM WIRELESS
The company reported a tripling in sales and estimate-beating
earnings yesterday.

By Chris Rugaber

Internet content aggregator InfoSpace (Nasdaq: INSP) reported
third-quarter financial results after yesterday's market close.
The company almost tripled revenues, and posted operating
profits of $9.47 million, or $0.03 per share, up from $2.97
million, or $0.01 per share, in last year's third quarter.
Analysts expected the company to break even, before acquisition
and amortization costs. Including those expenses, InfoSpace lost
$48.7 million, or $0.17 per share.

Revenues jumped to $57.7 million, from $19.9 million in the
year-earlier period, thanks in part to increasing sales to
wireless service providers, such as Verizon (NYSE: VZ), Alltel
(NYSE: AT), and Cingular Wireless, the partnership between SBC
Communications (NYSE: SBC) and BellSouth (NYSE: BLS). InfoSpace
enables wireless carriers to provide content and services such
as news, maps, and email for their wireless Web offerings. The
company reported that it counts 20 wireless carriers worldwide
as its customers.

InfoSpace also provides broadband and wireline Internet
services, and the company recently expanded its reach with its
purchase of website operator Go2Net, which closed during the
quarter. "InfoSpace is better positioned than ever to leverage
four parallel areas with massive promise: wireless, merchant,
broadband, and wireline consumer services," said CEO Arun Sarin
in a prepared statement.

After skyrocketing last winter, the company's stock fell almost
as swiftly, declining 62% so far this year. Nevertheless, shares
rose in overnight trading as high as $24.50, from yesterday's
close at $20.31.

NEWS TO GO

Just as PlayStation 2 units go on sale in the U.S., Sony Corp.
(NYSE: SNE) reported a 57% drop in profits for its fiscal second
quarter. Net income was down to 19.8 billion yen ($183 million),
from 46.5 billion yen ($430 million) in the year-earlier period.
Analysts' estimates were for 26.6 billion yen in profit. Revenue
rose only 3.7% to 1.69 trillion yen. Sales of the company's
electronic products were strong, and accounted for 80% of sales
in the quarter, but were offset by a 17% drop in revenue from
game operations and an 18% drop in sales from the music
division.

Electronic manufacturing services company SCI Systems (NYSE:
SCI) announced a 22% increase in sales and a 24% jump in
earnings yesterday for its first quarter 2001 (ended September
24). Net income reached $50.5 million, or $0.34 per share,
compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period. "Continued
telecommunication product diversification and a lower sales
concentration in PC finished products led to higher operating
margins in the quarter," CEO Gene Sapp noted in a prepared statement.

Biotech company Chiron Corp. (Nasdaq: CHIR) reported a 30% jump
in third-quarter profits after yesterday's market close. Net
income reached $43.1 million, or $0.23 per share, up from $33
million, or $0.17 per share, in the year-earlier period, and
ahead of analysts' estimates of $0.17 per share. Sales of the
company's vaccines rose 11% to $78 million, while the company's
lead drug, Proleukin, brought in $21 million in revenue,
compared to $19 million in last year's third quarter. Some
analysts expected sales of Proleukin to reach $30 million. The
company's shares dropped about $2, or 4%, in after-hours
trading.

Internet security and name-registration company VeriSign
(Nasdaq: VRSN) blew away third-quarter estimates, reporting an
operating profit last night (excluding acquisition costs) of
$38.4 million, or $0.18 per share, significantly higher than the
$0.06 per share analysts expected. Sales leapt to $173.1 million
from $22.8 million a year ago. The company benefited from a full
quarter of business from newly acquired domain registrar Network
Solutions, which VeriSign purchased in June. For more
