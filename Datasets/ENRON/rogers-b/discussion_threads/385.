Ben,

I found that you should have considered that power plant will operate from 
June 2001, which means we can only realize the spread option value of 7 
months, not of a whole year. Please make the changes as well as clean up the 
"Opion" page. We should start to think about going to RAROC and to scrub the 
model.

What is the source of the financing assumptions?
