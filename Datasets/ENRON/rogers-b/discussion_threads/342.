I just wanted to let you know that I sent this letter to Dr. Harris addresses 
his concerns and stating my commitment to succeeding at The Texas Graduate 
School of Business.  I hope I have done what it takes to prove that I can 
succeed at the School.  Thanks again for your help and interest. 

Sincerely,
Ben
