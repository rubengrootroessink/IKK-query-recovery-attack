Clement,

Here is the first run on the FPL Map and Excel grid.  I found some additional 
plant information on the FPL home page, and I aligned the presentations with 
the home page as my main source.  

I plotted the locations by city and net MW, because that was in the key to 
the Enron asset page.  Please let me know if you would like me to change it 
to plant name.  Also, there are several wind projects in the cities of 
Altamont and Tehachapi, CA.  I totaled the projects' net MW and listed them 
under their respective city.  

Finally, the only pages that I altered on the PowerPoint presentation were 
the map pages.  The rest of the presenation is still in the Reliant format.  

Regards,

Ben
