Dave:
Here is a recent draft of our presentation on the ENA/FPLE JV, which we are 
presenting to the banks in tomorrow's meeting here in Houston.  This recent 
draft has been looked through by Jeff Donahue just this morning.  Don Miller 
is expecting your call with comments.  Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Ben
