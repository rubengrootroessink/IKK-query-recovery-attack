Ben, thanks for getting back so quickly with comments on the Confidentiality
Agreement.  Attached is a revised draft of the agreement blacklined from the
May 10 draft to show the changes you and I discussed and some slight
modification to address the concern I expressed to you.

I am enclosing a clean version of the blacklined agreement.  If the changes
are acceptable, please print out two originals for execution by ENA and
overnight to me for execution by Cinergy.  Please call me if you have any
questions or comments.
