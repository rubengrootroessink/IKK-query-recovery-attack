First of all, our operations representative, Barry O'Brien, mentioned how
pleasant and congenial your employees are at the plant. Thank you for your
hospitality.

Don, we would like some additional information as follows:
Could you please provide a complete asset listing that will be conveyed to
the new owner (including spare parts).


Questions

* There are currently 12 permanent staff assigned to Wheatland. Is
this a requirement due to switchyard interconnects or any other contractual
requirements?

* Do we understand that you are entering into a switchyard maintenance
contract for five years? If so, may we have a copy and what is the annual
cost?

* Are you willing to enter into an agreement to provide turbine
maintenance after the warranty?
