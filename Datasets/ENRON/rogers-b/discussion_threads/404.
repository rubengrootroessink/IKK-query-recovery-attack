Anything over 250, in my book is "DREAM TEAM" status, as those of you who 
were with us in '98 will remember how excited we were to get to that level.  
It's happened again! - as of this moment, we have 293 registered riders, and 
we have room for more - so please be in touch if you have anyone else to add 
to the team.  (A handful of you who've told me you're not riding are still on 
the list - we're hoping you'll change your mind, and  also we get numbers 
credit for the amount of people registered.)

The deadline has passed for registering for $25.  As of today, registration 
is $35, and if you are a member of the cycling club, you will from this point 
forward need to register yourself and request a reimbursement from Stephanie 
Strong.

Many thanks to Becky Pham, Uniform Officer, and Stephanie Strong, Treasurer, 
who are handling jersey distribution.  It's going very well under their 
supervision.  And thanks to John Norden for chairing the jersey design 
process.  Please get in touch with Becky Pham at 713-345-7094 or Stephanie 
Strong at 713-853-1653 to get your jersey reserved and/or picked up.  The 
jerseys have caused quite a "stir" and it'll be great to see them on the road.

HERE'S TEAM ENRON 2000 !
