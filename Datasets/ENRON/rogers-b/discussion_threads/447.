I have attached the pitch book.  I think its a good start.  I didn't get
into the proposals as much, but we can kick that around in more detail.

 I think the more important thing is who (as in exact individuals) gets the
sales pitch.   This will be the key to getting a major deal completed.

Call me with questions, I'll be in and out the today and Monday.  On Tuesday
I start my journey across the country.  If you need me those days call me at
my home number and my wife will relay the messages to me.
