Thanks for the response.  According to my records, the outstanding
questions are as follows:

Wheatland

We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

Gleason

You indicated in the response to the Gleason questions that the variance
request for Subpart GG had been approved by TDEC and the approval would be
faxed to me.  To date, I have not received it.

LV Cogen

Earlier today, I asked a follow-up question on the coverage under the storm
water permit from 1998 to 2000.  I did not see an explanation of this gap
in the attached responses.


Given the approaching bid deadline, we would appreciate receiving this
information as soon as possible.
