9:30 AM it is - we will meet in Mike Coleman's office on 3AC13

Thanx Bruce

It 9:30am OK for you? I will go over to your office for the meeting, and 
maybe get Doug and Ben to join us.

His data was LHV. roughly multiply by 1.11 to get HHV. For some reason 
several of the ENA proposals used LHV, so I though that LHV maybe usual for 
ENA deals.

If you are modeling a long term Enron owned deal then we should model 
degradation on heat rate (Santee Cooper, ReBox). If it is a EPC directly to a 
host (ElectriCities, Springfield, City of Austin), the sale would be new & 
clean but we would model our three year power transaction with just the 
initial heat rate degradation. You and I ought to look at the degradation 
curve that most closely matches and eyeball the year 1, 2 and 3 average 
degradation.

How 'bout in the morning - you pick the time - I have an 11AM tech meeting.

Thanx Bruce

Subject: Heat rate and Capacity table

Bernstein's model has a table that provide the heat rate and capacity based 
on ISO/90 degrees, chiller/no chiller, gas compression, etc. I am not sure 
whether I should go with these numbers, but I know the heat rate is off 
because I heard that the heat rate is 10,300 HHV instead of 9,300 HHV (unless 
Bernstein's model is in HHV, which I was told was not).

I got your message about not modeling capacity degradation. Should we still 
model heat rate degradation?

Please tell me when you would be available to discuss further. Thanks.
