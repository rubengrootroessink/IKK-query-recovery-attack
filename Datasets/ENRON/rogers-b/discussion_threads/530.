Here are the responses to my CIPCO questions

1.  Henwood Energy is a third party evaluation consultant.  They will review 
the RFP responses

2.  Burns & McDonald has assisted in site selection/review and will 
participate in evaluation of any self-builds that CIPCO does.

3.  CIPCO has a preference to purchase from the market or from plants that 
Enron would develop.  They are not big on wanting to build their own plant or 
JV.

4.  CIPCO has identified a key site in Iowa that has direct access to their 
own system as well as the Mid-Am system.  They would make that site available 
to us if we needed it.  They will not reveal the site unless we get into 
negotiations.

5.  CIPCO will consider terms longer than 5 years.  They would consider a 
15-20 year term if there was a capital project involved.

6.  CIPCO does have their own transmission system as well as point/point 
transmission agreements on Mid-Am and Alliant.  The point to point agreement 
are from plants where CIPCO owns a partial share to CIPCO's system.

7.  CIPCO appeared to not value the LM-6000 technology to any higher degree 
than other machines.

8.  CIPCO was not sure of how things would be financed.

9.  If CIPCO decided to self build, they would certainly be interested in 
working with Enron on the gas deal.
