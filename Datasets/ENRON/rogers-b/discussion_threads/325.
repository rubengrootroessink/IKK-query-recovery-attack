Meg:
I was wondering if you are able to give me an idea of when I would hear
from the Admissions Office.  My application has been with the office since
Jan. 21st.  UT is my first choice and I am very interested to hear form the
School.  Thank you for your help and hope to hear from you soon.  Thanks!
Ben
