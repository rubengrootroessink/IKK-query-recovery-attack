Thanks for the help.

Don, based on our conference call last week and the fax sent to me, I am
still in need of the following:
* The air permit to construct application as submitted to IDEM and any
correspondence related to the application.  I do not need the actual permit
as issued by IDEM.
* Petition for Alternate testing.  The cover page was faxed.  Dave
Kellermeyer was to Fed Ex the remainder.  If this has been done, let me
know.  I will have to track it down.
* Determination of EPCRA reporting requirements for lead acid
batteries.

Additionally, we discussed yesterday a request for any analytical data
associated with the Lake Acquisition property, particularly sediment samples
from the lake bottom.

Thanks for your help.
