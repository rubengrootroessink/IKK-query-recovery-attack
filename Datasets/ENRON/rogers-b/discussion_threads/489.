Okay, team!  This is your last chance to train, and what an opportunity to 
train with Dan Lyons who knows the ropes and wants to help you train.  Not 
only that.....he's good for a laugh.  The guy who loves Hawaiin shirts and 
loves to cycle - interesting combination.  He's also a big-league fundraiser, 
and has now just crossed the $20,000 mark.  My wish for you is that you get 
to $6,000 so that you can can enjoy the Tour of Champions in Sedona with Dan 
and the gang.  It'll be a trip you'll never forget -- the mountain biking 
maybe -- but the Hawaiin shirts never!  100 miles or 50 miles - your choice 
for this weekend.

Saturday - April 8

    1. The 100-mile ride will start at 8:00 AM sharp from Tomball Middle 
School/Jr. High on FM2920(which is the main street of Tomball) about a mile 
east of TX249. To get there either take TX 249 north to FM 2920 and turn 
right and go about a mile east or take I45 North to FM 2920 and go west until 
you hit Tomball and go through town to the start point.  It will go north 
through Egypt and Honea up to Montgomery and then north and west to Richards 
in Grimes County via the Sam Houston National Forest.  It will then loop west 
and south coming back via Dacus and Dobbin.  This century will get you ready 
for the big ride. 

   2. The main ride will be a fairly hilly century, designed to get you ready 
for the150 the following weekend, but the map provided at the start will also 
show a 50 mile route that is only lightly hilled.

P.S. - Dan won't be in the office this week, so if you have any questions, 
too bad!  Just kidding - call me and I'll see if I can help.
