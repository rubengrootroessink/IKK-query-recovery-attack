Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you
and
your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that is
Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to
www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending
the
New Year?  Talk to you later.
Ben
