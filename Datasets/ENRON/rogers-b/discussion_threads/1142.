Mitch,
The attachments below indicate OEC/ENA safety records for calendar years 99' 
and 00', for your use in the data room if you see fit. Let me know if you 
need more on this topic.
Hard copy of Brownsville's annual EPA inspection will be forwarded under 
seperate cover today. Unfortunately, New Albany and Caledonia inspections' 
just occurred and we will not have hard copy for roughly 30 days. I will 
forward upon receipt.
Gus is currently expediting draft copies of all RATA test for your 
consideration to include in data room. I will forward upon receipt.
Anything else, let me know,
Ross
