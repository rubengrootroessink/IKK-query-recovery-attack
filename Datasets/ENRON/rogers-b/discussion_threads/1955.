Sorry, I had not printed the documents. Since the June and Aug reports for 
Wheatland were in seperate documents, I assumed all monthly reports would be

The July and August Operators report for Gleason are out on DealBench at 
Doc # 04.01.04.? The July Operators Report for Wheatland is also in 
DealBench at Doc. # 04.01.04.? The September reports for both plants are 
not out yet, but will be soon, probably next week.? I am working on getting 
you the hourly operational data for the months of August and Sept.? Please 
let me know if you have any more questions.
