To all

rough pass at EPC draw schedule in attached Excel for 2,3,4,5 and 6 unit 
plants - assumes two week spacing on start up - based on normal simple cycle 
deal. If we need to do major LM6000 payments up front then we should have a 
front end weighted curve (I will go ahead and generate a front-ended curve 
for each config) - depends on how we really extract each from WestLB deal - 
above my pay grade to know those lofty things.

Data is based on ElectriCities installation schedule from Nepco, we are 
working to see if we can compress actual time in field as part of reducing 
project anticipated cost so might be better once Mike Coleman and Bruce work 
our magic. % are from my vast experience and would be challenged and derided 
if a real cost engineer looks at them but at least they add to 100% (I hope) 
and sort of match our Hainan experience with three of these LM6000's.
