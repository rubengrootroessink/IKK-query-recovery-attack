Ben,

Per my voice mail, I am with PECO Energy and am the PECO team lead on the
Enron opportunity.  CSFB (Lou Iaconetti) has informed us that PECO has been
selected to proceed into Round II of the bidding process on the Lincoln,
Gleason and Wheatland peaking units.  I would appreciate it if you could
let me know what dates are available for site visits.

Thanks for your help.
