Rishi:
We are not going to send back this investor list anymore.  I am going to send 
both you and James an update each night that we send something out, but only 
you guys make changes to the Investor List.  Also make sure that you still 
send the signed CA down to us even if there are not any changes to the CA, we 
need to have our legal team go through it first.  Thanks!
Ben
