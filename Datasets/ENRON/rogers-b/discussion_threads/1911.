Michael:
If you can let me know when you have talked with Dave, that would be great.
I am trying to talk with Don Miller and wanted to make sure that you had
already talked with Dave.  Enron's PRC is going on and I am trying to get
promoted to manager and this deal should enable me to do just that.  Thanks
again for your comments to Dave.
