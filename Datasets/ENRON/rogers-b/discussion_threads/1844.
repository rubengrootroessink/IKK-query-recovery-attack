Gus & Ben,

I will copy the CEMS documents and try to have them to your office on Monday 
12-11-00.  I have attached the Emergency Response Plan, the TDEC monthly logs 
and Semi-Annual report.

Respectfully Mitchell Hurt

Ben:

Brownsville SPCC plan - The plan is currently in draft form. It will be 
finalized and signed by the end of the week.
Emergency Response Plan - We are not required to have one by law. However, I 
believe we do have one for the site. Mitchell- - please have your assistant 
make a copy and send it to Ben.
CEMS QA/QC - Available at the plant, Mitchell will provide a copy
CEMS certification report - Should already be on DealBench
Monthly log of emissions as required by condition #4 of the permit, Available 
at the plant, Mitchell has already given Duke a copy for the month of October 
when they were on-site yesterday.
Annual Emissions Report (condition #11)  - We submitted two semi-annual 
reports for the site so far, one on January 31, 2000 and another on July 31, 
2000. Mitchell will provide copy of the July report and the January report if 
available. The January report covers emissions for the third and fourth 
quarters of 1999.  This is really the annual report for 1999 because we did 
not operate in the first and second quarters of 1999. Duke already saw the 
July report covering January through June 2000.
