Mitch,

Per your request, I am having copies of the 2000 budget for the 1999 and 2000 
Peakers delivered to you and Clement.  You should receive them within the 
hour.  I contacted Tom and informed him you are requesting a meeting to 
discuss the current estimate for each site.   He indicated he would be 
available for a conference call tomorrow morning.   He was in the process of 
catching his flight and stated he would contact me in the morning.

Thanks,
Chaundra
