"It is human nature to think wisely and to act in an absurd
fashion." -- Anatole France


AGILENT EARNS ITS "A"
Agilent tops estimates and moves to the head of the class.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

If there were truth in ticker symbols, Agilent (NYSE: A) would
be holding up its "A" report card proudly. With quarterly
estimates pegged at $0.53 a share, the electronics testing
equipment maker powered up expectations with a $0.69-a-share showing.

That was a 77% surge in bottom-line growth before charges on
$3.4 billion in revenues for the September period. That's
welcome news for a company that has seen its shares fall sharply
since peaking at $162 back in March.

However, a slowdown in microchip testing equipment as well as
weakness in the wireless market has the company warning of
slower growth ahead. With a healthy backlog of orders, Agilent
still expects to meet estimates of $0.45 for the current
quarter.

Spun off by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) last year, Agilent will
be deploying new capital into areas where it sees higher growth:
communications and life sciences. I guess that gives the company
an "A" for effort too.

NEWS TO GO

Chipped off the old block, semiconductor distributor Avnet
(NYSE: AVT) announced that earnings for the current quarter
would come in between a nickel to a dime below the $0.85-a-share
forecast. While acknowledging the cyclical ways of the chip
industry, the company believes that earnings for the rest of the
year will remain on track.

Attention holiday shoppers, Nieman Marcus (NYSE: NMG.A) reported
stronger-than-expected profits but warned of slow action at the
registers so far this month. That's critical as the upscale
department store chain heads into the important buying season.
Nobody wants to see the Grinch steal Christmas (well, OK, it did
top the box office this past weekend, but that's another story).

EDGAR Hoovered? The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)
site for electronic financial filing and data retrieval will go
down on Friday for a "major upgrade." The Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system -- thankfully better
known as EDGAR -- will be back up on Monday morning.

Has Ozzy Osbourne bitten off more than he can chew -- again? The
legendary showman is suing Hughes Electronics (NYSE: GMH) and
MCY.com (Nasdaq: MCYC) for broadcasting an Ozzfest 2000 concert
tour stop to Hughes' DirecTV subscribers. Osbourne claims that
tour sponsor MCY.com only had rights to a Web cast of the rock
event. Mr. Crowley will not be his legal counsel.

Deere (NYSE: DE) John? An epic Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL)? Hit the
Fluor (NYSE: FLR)? These questions and more will be answered as
the companies get set to release earnings today.
