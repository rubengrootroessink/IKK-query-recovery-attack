Good Morning!
Wanted to see how this quarters earnings report was going to look like.  Many 
of analyst are reporting that its going to be around $.57 for the qtr.  Hope 
you guys beat that estimate.  By the way, how did that deal go that you were 
working on with the company down here?  I saw that Convergent was bought by 
an independent oil and gas company from Houston.  It's up big today.  Hope 
all is going well and that you might give me a call before the end of the 
year.  Thanks!
Ben
