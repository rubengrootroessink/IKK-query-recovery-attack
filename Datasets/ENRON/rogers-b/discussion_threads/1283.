Subject: 2000 Peaker Plant Tours

As all of you know, we will begin the plant tours on Thursday, Oct. 12., and 
they will last through Friday, the 27th.  Mike, Mitch and I have met with 
everyone except Dave and Chris about the tour and sales process.  At that 
meeting, the following scheduling conflicts were identified.

Mike Miller - 12,13,14
Jeff Keenan - 16,17,18
Mitro- 12,13, 16

We will begin scheduling today.  If anyone has any other conflicts, please 
let me know ASAP.

Thanks for your help with this process.
