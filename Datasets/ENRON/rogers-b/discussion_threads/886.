Stuart,

Attached are a clean and a blackline version of each of the due diligence 
indices for the six plants.  As you know, I have recently made several 
additions to each of these indices based upon my time in the data room this 
past week.  This includes recent documents for the 2000 peakers as well as 
other previously unseen documents that came from the boxes that were given to 
me by Don Miller.

I understand that Jinsung and Ben Rogers had previously given the prior 
drafts to Ben Jacoby and others to review for redacting purposes.  It will be 
necessary and useful to give these blacklines to those persons doing that 
review to note the recent additions and review these as well.

I also understand from Carolyn Gilley that she will coordinate with Lorie 
Leigh regarding the creation of the due diligence files on Live Link.  It 
seems relevant that Jinsung and Ben Rogers are also aware of how this process 
would work.

My understanding, and I will confirm that this is done, is that Carolyn's 
scanning personnel are to be scanning in the additions into Live Link today 
per my request.  There is also some filing and re-filing that will need to be 
done in the data room and I have alerted Lorie Leigh to this fact via voice 
mail on Friday.

I seem to have left Don Miller's, as well as Ben Rogers' and Jinsung's, 
e-mail addresses at my home over the weekend.  By copy of this e-mail, I am 
asking Lorie to please forward it to Don, Ben, and Jinsung.  She has 
confirmed to me via telephone that she will do so.

If you or any of the others involved in this project have any further 
question, please do not hesitate to call me.  Thank you.

Best regards,
