Attached is the turbine report we discussed yesterday.  We will continue to 
prepare the LM6000 list you have seen in the past, but this will replace the 
master turbine list and will be updated bi-weekly.

Regards, 
Tammy

Subject: First Turbine Position Report

Attached is our first Turbine Position Report.  We intend to issue this 
report every other Friday going forward.  This report contains a detail 
report by turbine as well as three summary reports:

Summary by Status
Summary by Controlling Region
Summary by Turbine Type

Some of the financial data in this report is preliminary.  I will be working 
with the respective regional accounting groups to establish procedures for 
financial updates on a regular basis.  In the meantime, I welcome any 
corrections / suggestions you may have.



Thank you,
Stephanie
