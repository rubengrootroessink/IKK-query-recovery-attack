Come one, come all to conquer the treacherous hills at Bastrop State Park on 
Saturday, March 25.  Bastrop IS the toughest part of the MS150.  We will be 
meeting at the large parking area which is located at the entrance of the 
park where you pay to get in.  Look for my green Toyota pickup truck with the 
camper top.  Meeting time is 10:00 a.m.  It takes approximately 2 1/2 hours 
to drive to Bastrop from Houston.  I will bring water and gatorade.  You're 
on your own for food.

Please RSVP to me so I'll have enough water and gatorade for everyone.

Things to bring:
Stuff to change a flat tire
Water bottle (filled with your favorite beverage)
Food (fruit, power bars, whatever else)
Helmet
Bike
Yourself

Here's a map of the park.  Let me know if you have any questions.


Directions:
Take I-10 West to 71 West towards Lagrange/Austin
Travel down 71W about 50 miles.
Turn right onto Loop 150
Travel .7 miles
Turn right onto TXP1 (Park Road 1A)
You'll be at the entrance to the park.
