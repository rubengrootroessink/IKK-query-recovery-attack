Don,

For response #3, I have additional comments:

The ambient conditions were such that output was limited by the MW limiter in 
the WDPF.  Unit #3 was only operated at 96.2% of base load.  Since the 
guarantees were met during the test, no additional testing was done.

Rick

1.  The correction curves are not published with the Test Reports.  The 
calculations are given using the correction data only.  The curves and 
detailed explanations are located in the purchase contracts.

2. The run hours are estimated based on the emissions limits, the guaranteed 
emissions output of the equipment and average heat rates.   

 For example at Wheatland:

 The NOx cap is 249 tons/year * 2000 = 498,000 lbs./yr.  (permit limits)
 The NOx output of each unit is 0.092lbs /MMBtu  (Mfg. guarantee)
 The Fuel Use is 1,486 MMBtu/hr HHV   (Based on avg. heat rate)
 NOx /hr = 0.092 lbs/MMBtu * 1,486 MMBtu/hr
  = 136.7 lbs/hr. 

 Plant NOx = 136.7 lbs/hr * 4
      = 546.8 lbs/hr

 Run Hours = 498,000 lbs/hr / 546.8 lbs/hr
        = 911 hrs.
 These numbers are approximate and are conservative.

3. Regarding the performance issue with Wheatland Unit#3;    I did find a 
reference in the test report stating that units 3 & 4 were underfired due to 
the MW limiter in the WDPF.  Unit 3 was loaded at only 96.2% of base load and 
Unit 4 at 98.4%.  This along with Mitch's comments (The output guarantee was 
for the facility and each unit could have been fine tuned differently) more 
than likely contributed to the output differences.

4. The gas pressure issue at Wheatland in June was a one time excursion per 
Chris Norris.  There have been no pressure problems since then.
