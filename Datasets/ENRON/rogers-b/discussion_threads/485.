Coming back to browse through our notes on why we do this crazy thing called 
the MS150, we find that the primary inspiration is to assist the MS Society 
in its mission to encourage and provide for the needs of MS patients and give 
them the hope of endless possibilities.

PEDAL FOR PARTNERS is a new program this year designed to help MS patients 
feel part of the trek.  It creates a bond with them that is much appreciate 
and it gives them hope to know that we're out there.  Those who could ride,  
would ride, and some of those who can't are waiting at the finish line in 
Austin to tell you how much it meant to them to see you come in on your bike.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WEAR A RIBBON ON YOUR RIDE WHICH HAS BEEN SIGNED BY AN 
MS PATIENT, IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  THAT PERSON'S ADDRESS IS 
PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE RIBBON SO THAT WHEN YOU GET BACK YOU CAN MAIL IT TO 
THE INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM YOU RODE.

You can pick one up at the meeting tomorrow, get one from me in 3AC3120, 
Stephanie Strong at EB2414, or Becky Pham at EB2422A.  For you non-Enron 
riders, if you'll let us know this week, we can mail it to you.
