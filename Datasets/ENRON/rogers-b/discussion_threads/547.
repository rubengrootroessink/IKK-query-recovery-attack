Greetings, Mr. Rogers

My apologies for the delay in responding to your last inquiry - but the
entire TEXASMBA Admissions Team is still intently focused on the still
remaining pool of fall 2000 applicants requiring consideration for this
year's class.

However, let me briefly respond to your note by suggesting that you also
address one of the more visible point of need in your competitive admission
profile -- that being your GMAT.  I believe you had indicated previously
that you chose not to utilize GMAT's services and accommodations for
non-standard test takers such as yourself.   I suggest you consider the
merits of changing your position in this decision.

As one of the competitive points of consideration within your application
profile, it could be to your benefit to address your currently
non-competitive score by accepting GMAT's accommodations.   I suggest you
request a copy of GMAT's "Supplement for Testing with Disabilities" for
additional insights into the nature and personal acceptability of these
accommodations.

Best wishes as you again consider your options.

Carl

Dr. Harris:
     In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was
planning
on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your suggestion with
this
matter.
     I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride,
but
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from
you
soon.

Regards,
Ben Rogers
