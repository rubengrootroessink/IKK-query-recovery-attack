Ben,

I am sorry that I missed you.  I have been out of the country for the past 
two weeks.  I just returned this afternoon.  Please feel free to call me at 
(512) 471-5788 if you want to talk about the MBA program.

Bob

Professor Parrino: 

My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently applying to The Texas Business 
School for enrollment in the Fall of 2000. I was referred to you by David 
Martin, graduate of the Business School and the son of John Martin, former 
Finance Professor. I have worked with David at Enron for a couple of years 
and have learned a great deal about the School. I was also referred to you by 
Paul Burkhart, who graduated from the Business School in 1998 and who worked 
in the investment fund. I have been working in several different finance 
positions within Enron for the last two and a half years. Before coming to 
Enron I worked for three years in a portfolio management group with State 
Street Bank in Boston. I am very interested in the combination of energy and 
corporate finance and have the desire to continue working in these industries 
after business school, specifically with an Investment Bank.   I am coming to 
visit the school on Friday, Feb. 18th and was wondering if you had time to 
talk to me about the Business School.  If you could please let me know if 
your available, I would greatly appreciate it. If your not available that 
day, I would still like to talk with you about the program and the venture 
capital fund that you are heading up.   Please let me know if you want me to 
send you my resume, so that you have a better understanding of my background. 
The admissions office has my complete application with my resume. Thanks in 
advance for taking the time to talk with me. Hope to hear from you soon.
