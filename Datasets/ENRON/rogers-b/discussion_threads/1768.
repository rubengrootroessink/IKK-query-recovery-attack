Richard,
Pat just informed me that you need numbers for starts and hours on Unit 3. 
Unit 3 had MarkV problems in the past that needed to be corrected by shutting 
down the system.  This erased any historical information that the machine had 
stored.  Unit 4 and 3 were started up within one or two days apart. There 
should be minimal difference between the two of them. We ran units 3&4 as 
brother and sister during the first year of operation, so I would feel very 
confident with the following numbers.
Fired Hours- 738
Fired Starts- 105
Emergency Stops- 5
Peak Fired Hours-8
Total Starts- 123
If you need further assistance please let me know. Ron D.
