As a follow up to our conversation yesterday, I need indicative pricing for a 
three (3) year and a five (5) year tolling option for a peaking plant to be 
located in eastern PJM, which would utilize 4 (four) LM-6000 turbines.  
Assume a 6/1/2001 start date and a location near Parlin New Jersey.  The 
structure of the transaction would be as follows:

1.  ENA would sell four (4) LM-6000s to Calpine.
2.  ENA would permit, construct, own and operate the project.
3.  ENA would take back a short-term tolling agreement for the project.

I would like to send Calpine a brief proposal in the net couple of weeks.  
How quickly can you come up with indicative pricing for me?
