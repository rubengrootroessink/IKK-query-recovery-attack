Attached are the 2000 Cost Reports.  These reports only include actuals 
through 12/31/1999, January cost will not be posted until all year end 
Project Tracking has been purged which will be the week of the 17th.  
Therefore the next report will be 1/25/00, which will include January 
activity.

I have also updated the Scope Change tab for Wilton to include the amounts 
that ENA has approved for each scope change.  However, Nepco's Current 
Forecast still has the original amount of each Scope Change and therefore is 
overstated.  As soon as Nepco's forecast is reduced by the agreed to changes, 
I will reflect the reduced cost in my Forecast.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks Amy 3-7805
