Dear Ben:

I am very disappointed to learn that you will be unable to join our energy
finance program next fall.  However, I'm pleased that you are willing to
keep trying.

I suggest that if possible, you take an MBA level finance class at U of
Houston this summer.  If you can get an A in the class, I will personally
argue your case to the admissions Dean.  I was also told that your chances
of getting in would improve considerably if you raise your GMAT over 500.

Its clearly a long shot, but we should still try to get you into the
program next fall.

Let me know how things are going.

regards,

Sheridan
