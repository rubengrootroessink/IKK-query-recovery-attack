Ben, 
Attached is the latest draft of the Beck report. I'm attaching a list that I 
prepared that generally has the items that are outstanding; however, the 
priority items are the back up information on performance testing (& curves) 
of the inlet fogging system and the peaking testing (output) of the three 
units and the confirmation of the data in table 5 (long term performance of 
the projects).
I have the O&M contracts, the monthly reports, and the contracts between OEC 
and Caldwell for the inlet fogging system, but these do not contain what 
Conrad (RW Beck) is looking for. My understanding from the operations guys is 
that there is data for the above items.
As discussed, Conrad will be here Monday morning, so if we could have the 
back up information for these items by then, it would expedite the process 
tremendously.
You can reach me at 54426 if you have any questions.
Thanks for your help.
Joana
