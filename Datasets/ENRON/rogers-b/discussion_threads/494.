Just wanted to point out some very important people who are riding on our 
team:

ALL 378 OF YOU !!


Some of us are better known than others, however, and you may enjoy knowing 
that you're riding with:

Jeff Skilling, President & Chief Operating Officer of Enron
Wendy Gramm, Enron Board Member and wife of Senator Phil Gramm
Pauline Chiou - Channel Two Morning News (the early-bird MS150 rookie)
Judge Robert Eckels (don't bother him with your parking tickets- he will be 
busy surviving) 
Judge Mike Fields (the man with a mission - has a very good friend with M.S.)
Senator Phil Gramm's entire staff (back for the third year.  If '98 didn't 
scare them off, nothing will.)

And here's the latest team list - be sure to let me know if we're missing 
anyone!
We have 378 registered and 366 riding!
