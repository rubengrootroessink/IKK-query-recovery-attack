I have hard coded all volmes, prices and revenues related to merchant sales.  
A blend of Hennwood and our desk curves were used to price the merchant or 
excess sales.  I am also using a 9% discount rate which is what FPL had in 
the model they sent over to us.  We may want to take this out entirely and 
let them do their own.

Be prepared the model that I had to work with was 14 Mbs and a big mess.  I 
have cut it down to around 4 Mbs but the cash flow sheet is confusing 
at best.  It is manageable and should be sufficient.  Give me a call with any 
questions.
