After reviewing the CIPCO RFP, Enron has questions that we would like to have 
answered.  I will call you on Friday to follow-up on these:


1.  Who is Henwood Energy Services and what aspect of the RFP will they 
review?

2.  What role will Burns & McDonnell play in the RFP and subsequent project.

3.  Enron controls several development sites in Iowa that provide direct 
access into Alliant.  Does CIPCO's transmission arrangements with Alliant 
allow for a network service whereby energy injected anywhere into the Alliant 
Grid in Iowa can be returned to CIPCO under the present transmission 
arrangement.

4.  Enron also controls sites on Mid-Am in Iowa.  Does CIPCO have network 
rights on Mid-Am or direct ties with Mid-Am.  Would generation on the Mid-Am 
system be of value to CIPCO.

5.  CIPCO states they will consider proposals beyond the 2005 timeframe.  How 
many years would CIPCO consider under a transaction where new generation is 
being built in a jointly developed project.?

6.  CIPCO states they have reviewed several sites for generation 
development.  Can CIPCO provide Enron with a list of preferred sites?

7.  Does CIPCO own separate transmission facilities or is the CIPCO system 
assumed to be CIPCO's network transmission contract on the Alliant System?

8.  Would CIPCO consider a project utilizing the General Electric LM-6000 
technology as we described in our previous meeting in November 1999.

9.  On a new capital project, would CIPCO finance the project with RUS 
financing, internal sources or be interested in financing through Enron?

10.  If Enron is not successful in the RFP and CIPCO elects to build a new 
plant, would CIPCO work with Enron to structure a delivered gas supply 
transaction whereby Enron would provide a new connecting gas lateral, gas 
transportation service and physical gas supply.

I would appreciate you insights on the above.


Thanks
