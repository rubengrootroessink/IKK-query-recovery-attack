How did you do on the test you took right after your class ended?
Because if you are interested in refreshing and are within the guarantee,
you can sit through again for free and get extra help from your instructor.
You have the right to re-take the course as long as you have taken all of
your practice tests, attended all classes or made up if you missed, done all
homework and took your actual exam within 30 days.
If you did all of that and are unhappy with your score for whatever
reason....you can repeat for free. I have classes starting Nov. 18 here at
the office that I can get you into and you could test either in late January
when they end or if you feel comfident before that then certainly
mid-January.
Let me know what you think.

Thanks for the reply.  I can understand your position.  I am looking more
for a refresher course.  I am planning on taking it around mid December or
as late as mid January.  I am beginning to start studying again on my own,
but I wanted to get a little more help.  Thanks for your call!
