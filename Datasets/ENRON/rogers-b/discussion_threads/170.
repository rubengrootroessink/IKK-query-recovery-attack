Many thanks for your strong referral, David.  Glad to have you continuing
your alum referrals this year.  I have added your note to Mr. Rogers'
application file, and his file will receive priority handling once it
reaches the MBA Admissions office.

Margaret,

My name David Martin.  I graduated from the MBA/MPA program at UT in May
1998
and I am currently a Manager at Enron North America in the Restructuring
Group.
I am writing to you in reference to a Fall 2000 MBA candidate named Benjamin
Rogers.  He is an Associate here at Enron and in my opinion an excellent
candidate for the UT MBA program.  He has already submitted his application
and
is anxiously awaiting a response.  Ben came to Enron as an Analyst and was
recently promoted to an Associate, something not many Analysts are able to
do.
He has worked in several groups throughout Enron and is very serious about
the
possibility of attending UT.  Please take my highest of recommendations into
consideration when you assess his entrance into the program.  Thank you.

Regards,
David Martin
