Ben -

 Here are my comments to the CA.  The only substantive comment has to
do with the procedure to follow in the event of a legal proceeding that
requires disclosure.  The procedure you proposed is a pretty tough standard
for us to follow, and I would prefer a procedure more along the lines I have
proposed.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Mike:
Here is a DRAFT version of the CA between Enron and KM Power Co.  Please
comment, mark-up, etc. and send back so that we can get to a final version.
Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
