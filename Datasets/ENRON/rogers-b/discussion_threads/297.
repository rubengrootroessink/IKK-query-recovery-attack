Jinsung,

Below are the indicative prices for the Calpine deal assuming there are no 
additional gas costs related to 
the transport of gas from the Transco Sayreville meter point and the 
potential site.

We have passed this by the trader, Paul Racicot.  If we enter the next round 
of negotiations where specific information
has become available, a stronger price is possible but we would need to deal 
more specifically with the Unit Contingent
aspect and the gas cost from meter to site.

Here is the assumptions and the prices:

180MW
Priced at Sayreville (discount to  Eastern hub)
Must be called in 16 blocks
5x16 product
Total start cost: $1200 per start ($300 per unit)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability
Gas priced at NY zone 6 with $0.03 physical premium in summer, and $0.07 in 
summer.

Prices are June-May yearly calculations
3yr $3.89kw-mo
5yr $3.84kw-mo

At this stage, the desk does not have a different price for the 4hr block 
product

Edith,

- Substation location: Sayerville
- Gas: Transco Zone 6 (no additional cost for LDC)
- Unit contingent call
- 97% availability: It should be OK since we can assume 97% during summer 
time and 90~93% during non-summer time, for example.

Could you get the pricing for following scenario based on above assumption?

Flat and annual capacity payment for 3 and 5 year
With 16 hour block and 4 hour block

Please call me, if it doesn't make sense.
