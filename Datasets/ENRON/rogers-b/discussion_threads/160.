Margaret,

I graduated with my MBA in 1998 from UT and am participating in the Graduate
Business Network prospective student recruiting effort.  I currently work at
Enron Corporation in Houston.  A fellow colleague of mine at Enron has
applied for the full-time MBA program for Fall 2000.  The applicant's name
is Ben Rogers and I believe that he would be an outstanding contribution to
the program.  He is very well respected at Enron from a commercial
perspective as well as analytically.

He is planning to be in Austin on February 18 to attend the Q&A session and
will also be meeting with several professors.  I think that it would also be
helpful for him to meet with you or another member of the admissions
committee.  In case you need to contact Ben directly, his office phone
number is (713) 853-7998 and email is brogers2@enron.com.

Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Thank you,

Paul Burkhart
