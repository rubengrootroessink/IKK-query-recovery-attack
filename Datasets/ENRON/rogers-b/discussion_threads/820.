 Congratulations Benjamin C  Rogers !

 You are a 2000 New York City Marathon Lottery winner. Cheers!

 YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, DON'T YOU??

 You have earned the right to run 26.2 brilliant miles through the streets of 
New York City on Sunday, November 5, 2000! (Only 115 days to go.)

 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU??

 It's time to start training!

 Start RIGHT NOW by outfitting yourself with the official "Training for 2000" 
t-shirt! Why train in silence?! Let the world know your goal and wear a 
t-shirt that keeps your training on track.

 AND . . . because today is your lucky day, we have a great deal for you: 
order your "Training For 2000" t-shirt before 11:59pm* on Sunday, July16th, 
and the shirt is your's for the special price of $15 (regularly $18), or the 
Training for 2000 tee shirt and cap for $29.95! (Just note code #332 in the 
shipping instructions, and we will adjust your price!). To check it out,

 Sincerely,
 Your friends at the New York City Marathon.

 *Hey, wait a minute! 11:59pm! What are you doing AWAKE? Get in bed and get 
some rest! You're a Marathoner in Training!

 **Also, now that your geared up, why not register for an NYRRC race and get 
acclimatized to the racing experience. Run with others, consume water on the 
go (not necessarily as easy as it looks), and start dress rehearsing for the 
big day. For information on our June favorites, visit www.nyrrc.org.
