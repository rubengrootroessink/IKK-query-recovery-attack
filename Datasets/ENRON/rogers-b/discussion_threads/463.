It's not too late to train for the MS(180), regardless of what some people 
have told you - and if you're struggling with the "whole" reality of actually 
getting all the way to Austin - just think of it as 10 miles at a time.  That 
will get you there.  Another tool is visualizing - every night before you go 
to sleep, shut your eyes and visualize yourself on your little bike, going 
across the map from Houston to Austin - over and over and over.  It works!  
I've done it!

If virtual training won't be enough, get out this weekend on your bike - and 
here's some great ideas for you.  Of course, we have the Tour deCypress, but 
don't try to keep up with CHARLA REESE - she got a brand new bike and she is 
SMOKIN.'   This is a great ride - the first 40 miles is wonderfully scenic, 
and that last 40 miles is great resistance training in the wind.

Sunday  - April 2 - 7:30 AM - 50, 62 or 85 miles
Cypress Spring High School - FM 529 and Fry Road  
Sponsor: Northwest Cyclery - 713-622-1240

Saturday - April 1 - 8:00 AM - 32, 45 or 63 miles   (HBC ride)

Cypress-Prairie View - Flat roads through ranching and rice farming country 
around Waller and Hockley.  Very little traffic.  Eat after the ride at The 
Kettle at US290 & FM1960.  MEET:  29 miles NW on US-290 to Cypress-Rosehill 
Road, north 2 miles to Huffmeister.  Park in HL&P's parking lot on west side 
- farthest from the building.  Ride Starter:  David Dick @ 713-781-6052.

Sunday - April 2 - 8:00 AM - 40 or 62 miles

Chappell Hill - One of the prettier rides for wildflowers in the spring.  The 
short route heads north on FM1155 for 7.5 miles to the stop sign at FM2193, 
then heads east on FM1155 another 12 miles to Washington on the Brazos State 
Park.  The long route turns left at the stop sign, travels west on FM2193 and 
takes a winding route through some minor hills before ending up at the 
Washington on the Brazos.  There are bathroom facilities and water/soft 
drinks available at the park.  MEET:  Take Highway 290 from Houston, about 65 
miles (12 miles past Hempstead) until you come to the flashing light at the 
intersection of Highway 290 and FM1155.  There's a sign that says "Chappell 
Hill" to the right.  Turn right on FM1155 and go about 1 mile to the center 
of town.  The 2nd street on the right is "Poplar."  Take a right and go a 
block or two past the church and park on the side road connecting Poplar and 
Providence.

Happy Pedaling!   Amelia
