Roughly speaking if you use absorption chilling, you would save (at max 
summer conditions) maybe 1.2 MW per LM or about 2.5% on capacity which would 
be nominally a 2.5% improvement in heat rate. To get this you need a source 
of steam. For Lowell, we possibly could get steam from UAE (I don't know how 
the transaction would work). We would need about 180,000 lb/hr of steam at 
least at 15 psig. The chillers would cost about $400,000 total more than the 
mechanicals we have discussed.

If UAE can't supply the steam, then we would need small HRSG's behind each 
CTG and would most likely also try and steam injection for NOx control. Heat 
rate would improve by maybe 6-7%, plant net output would increase by maybe 2 
MW per LM. Capital cost would grow by maybe $8,000,000 (this is wild guess, 
we did get HRSG quotes for this steam injection/absorption version but have 
not done a detailed capex).
