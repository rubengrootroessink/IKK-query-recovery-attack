Subject: IPP Matters


1.  I need to speak to you about some associate help that Don Black needs 
with his projects.  Basically, Don needs an associate assigned to help him 1) 
in the assembling/summarizing of some short position information that he has 
located and 2) with analysis on his TECO deal.
2.  FYI--The IPP group is going to regularly have meetings at 4:00 pm on each 
Monday.  You are welcome to participate if you would like.  Please let me 
know if you would like to be invited.
3.  FYI--I am meeting with Tammy Shepard and someone from your group at 1:00 
pm to day to discuss the outstanding deal list.  
4.  What is the status of the Fiatt model?
5.  Here are the projects that I need assistance with:

      1.  TBG Gas Restructuring (assistance in process)
      2.  Fiatt model (assistance in process)
      3.  Pricing of a 3 year and 5 year tolling option for a 4 unit LM-6000 
plant in Eastern PJM (per our discussion yesterday--who is my contact person)
      4.  Illinois and Mississippi Tax Deals (lets discuss)
       5. IPP Contact tracking sheet (lets discuss)
