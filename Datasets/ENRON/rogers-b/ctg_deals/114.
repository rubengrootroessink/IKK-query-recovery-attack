Ben,

Concerning the deal list.  I have been updating part of the IPP and QF 
portions from the IPP and Generation deal list sheets.  They are located on 
the O:drive at O:\Portland\Dna\Generation Deal Sheet and IPP Deal Sheet.  The 
password to IPP Deal Sheet is rust, and to Generation Deal Sheet is music.  
These list are updated once a week by the respective groups.  Thanks for your 
help.  

Ben Thomason
