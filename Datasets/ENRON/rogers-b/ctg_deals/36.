Attached is a short form estimate I had on Pittsburg which is a 2 X 1 GE7FA 
plant. Also included is Linden 6 (which is a 7FA with an HRSG supplying steam 
to an existing facility, i.e. no steam turbine). Pittsburg is an outdoor 
plant so should represent a fairly competitive deal.



I also have some place a 1 X 1 that we just got on Coyote Springs.
