Sandra

Attached is our best guess at a likely EPC cost - full disclosure on our 
margin(profit) guess. I added gas compression per Janet's note - I still 
think we should pitch this without compression and add it if we need to. I 
think that is Charles' plan also. Has Jim heard anything from Lone Star????


Jason - I can't get Billy's address to work through email - would make sure 
he gets a copy???

gracias
Bruce
