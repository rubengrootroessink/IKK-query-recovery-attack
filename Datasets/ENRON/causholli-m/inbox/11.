Martin,

Subsequent to my last e-mail I discovered an additional detail which may po=
ssibly clarify why ENCE prefers to purchase the Chilean E. globulus species=
 to the Brazilian species for pulp production.  It would appear that the E.=
 globulus species holds up better than the various Brazilian species during=
 the refining process.  While most papermakers generally don't refine hardw=
oods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are=
 unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingl=
y do use a single refiner for all grades.  This is particularly true of the=
 Italian mills.  Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining req=
uired for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opaci=
ty, etc.), these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suit=
ed for this type of processing.  Accordingly, the globulus species (which i=
s also the predominant species in the Iberian peninsula) holds up much bett=
er under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus.

In any case, I hope this helps shed additional light on this issue, and, as=
 always, please feel free to revert with any questions you might have.  Tha=
nks.

Karen
