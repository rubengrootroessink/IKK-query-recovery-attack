He publishes it rather sporadically.  Unfortunately, there's no fixed schedule for the downtime summary.

Dear Warriors,

Mark Wilde has just published a great summary of industry downtimes.  Your teams might find it very helpful.  It may also be a good chance to see if our respective databases match Dr. Paper's records.

Thanks!
Vikram
