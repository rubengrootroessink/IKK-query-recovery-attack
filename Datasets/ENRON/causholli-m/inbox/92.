> The investigation focused on charges that Canadian producers sold lumber
> into the U.S. at prices that were below their production costs.  Six large
> companies were investigated, with each assessed an individual anti-dumping
> duty.  Those investigated, and their duties were: Weyerhaeuser (11.93%),
> Canfor (12.98%), Slocan (19.24%), Abitibi-Consolidated (13.64%), Tembec
> (10.76%), and West Fraser (5.9%).  All other Canadian companies will be
> assessed an anti-dumping duty of 12.6%, which is the weighted average of

> Duties are Now 31.9%
> The anti-dumping duty will be added to the 19.3% preliminary
> countervailing
> duty, which was assessed in August, for a total duty of 31.9%.  Maritime
> provinces are exempt from the CVD. The bonding requirements for the
> current
> 19.3% CVD will end Dec. 17th. Until then, Canadian lumber exporters to the
> US will face the 31.9% duty.

> Lumber Producers Not Expected to Accrue Anti-dumping Liabilities
> We believe most Canadian lumber producers will not book duties imposed as

> the export pricing practices of Canadian lumber producers for the period
> after the "Final" Determination, expected in May 2002, and the "First
> Administrative Review" date, one year later, in the spring of 2003.

> Outlook Remains Negative
> We expect to see considerable confusion and uncertainty over both the CVD

> underweight position in Canadian lumber producers going forward, despite
> the
