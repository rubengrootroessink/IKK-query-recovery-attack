Hello Mr. Hughson,

Ronald Melicher adviced me to contact you about the PhD program. 
I am interested in the field of finance and I wanted to learn about the
PhD finance program at the University of Colorado. 
Can you summarize the main points of the program, its requirements,and
the deadlines? 

Two years of coursework, economics, econometrics, and finance seminars are what most people normally take.  Math skills are important initially.  Later on, it depends what you do.  Then you take comps and write a thesis.  I think that the deadlines and such are on our website.  The program starts in the fall, and you are advised to start then.  As far as admissions requirements, take the GMAT or GRE, and do well.  We have many applicants with >700 on the GMAT, for instance.



I have finished a finance degree from Oregon State University and have
two years of work experience.

Work experience is not much help, unless it specifically relates to what you are working on.  Abstraction is an important skill, and at best, work experience can help you with getting rid of extraneous detail.

Sincerely,
Monika Causholli
