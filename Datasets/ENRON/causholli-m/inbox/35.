Monika:

Thanks for your excellent analysis on the pulp market.  One question I had was why Metsa-Botnia (2.5 million tons NBSK per year) was not included?  Metsa-Botnia is a joint venture between M-Real (formerly Metsa Serla) and UPM-Kymmene.  Have these volumes been included under UPM and M-Real?

Let me know when you get a chance.  thanks

Regards,

Jonathan
