Subject:	newsprint mill conversion

Hello Team,

Tembec Inc. may back a controversial $450-million project to convert the mothballed Chandler newsprint mill in Quebec to make high-quality magazine paper.  The Chandler mill was shut in 1999 by the former owner, Abitibi, due to high costs.   The Quebec government and the union-backed Quebec Solidarity Fund now effectively own Chandler and are negotiating with Tembec to tie up the conversion project by year-end.       A comfort to newsprint producers as potential newsprint capacity is diverted else where at a time when the market is sitting in a supply glut.
