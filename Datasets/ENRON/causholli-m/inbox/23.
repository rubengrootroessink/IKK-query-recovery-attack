David, i just joined the group and will be looking at financial risk management for industry players .. maybe you could help direct me where to go/look for info in the following areas ..

- general s&ds for forest industry (pulp,recycle/recovered,news,lumber etc..)

- major products historical pricings

also, if there is any daily/weekly s&ds/info produced internally for forest products, could i get on copy ??
