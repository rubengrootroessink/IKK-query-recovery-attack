Hey Monika,

Do you know how to get access to FOEX Pulp and Paper Comments-Market Comments?  It asked me for a password and no one seems to have one, not even Avril.  Come over if you need to see what it looks like, or I can drop it off by your desk.


Thanks!!!

Hello,
 << File: Foex Prices.xls >> 
The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week. 

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%)

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. 

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.   


Thanks,
