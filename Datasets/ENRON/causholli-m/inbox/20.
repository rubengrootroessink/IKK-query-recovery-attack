WOW! This is a great industry overview. I haven't vetted the numbers, and I understand Karen wants to sit down and go over it in detail, but it appears to be exactly what we wanted and a great tool. Of course it will always be a work in progress, being improved and updated as we get better information. 

Good work.

Dave
