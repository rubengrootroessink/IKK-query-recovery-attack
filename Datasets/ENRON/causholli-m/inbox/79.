Monika, I thought that was a great writeup. I don't know if I've every mentioned it, but you write very well.

I took the liberty of changing a few things, and I think you'll be able to see the changes I made. Nothing substantial. I suggest you look over what I've done, and if you agree with the changes, send it out to your team, and cc: our team.

Thanks,

Dave
