Hello Mr. Temple,

This is a follow-up email to what you talked with Dave Allan on the
subject of Fiber morphology. Attached you will find the fiber
characteristics spreadsheet - the most updated version. 

We also have an additional question which is - why each quality
parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use
(paper grade) application.

You can contact me for any further questions.


thanks,
Monika Causholli
