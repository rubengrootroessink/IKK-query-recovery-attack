Subject:	October 23rd and 24th Market Pulp Team Meeting

As many of you already know, we have scheduled an offsite market pulp planning meeting for October 23rd and 24th.  We intend on addressing a range of strategic objectives as well as cover specific customer related issues.  The meeting will be held at the Doubletree Hotel in the Austin Room.  We will begin promptly at 8:00 am on 10/23 and 10/24.  Lunchs will be provided   Please make sure your calender is clear for both days.

October 23rd will focus on a technical issues relating to pulp fiber characteristic, product end uses and marketing strategies for a range of N. American grades.  We are bringing in an outside consultant to run this session (agenda to follow).

October 24th will focus on business strategy issues (see attached 10/24 agenda).  I have taken the liberty of volunteering some of you to run specific portions of the session.  We will need to manage our time carefully if we are to successfully complete the agenda.    

It is also important that you develop an acocunt plan for each of the accounts you are responsible for prior to 10/23 (account assignments attached, ENE Universe).  I have already asked each of the pulp originators to get with the appropriate pulp cash trader to develop these plans.  Each plan should be concise enough to fit on one page, and contain three sections - key account goals, financial and physical products targeted to achieve account goals and an activity plan.  You will be expected to present each during the meeting.
