Dear Team,

The fundamental analysis group is working on developing marketing strategies and effective communication tools for each of the product segments.  

Our objectives are to determine:

the business model for each market segment
who our counterparties are
how approach to pricing differs between counterparties i.e. consumers vs. producers vs. retailers
economic and financial needs of our existing and prospective clients
effective prospecting and communication tools for each market segment
the behavior of each product segment related to the forest product industry and to the other market segments
and develop standard presentations
cohesiveness between origination groups


To help us with this effort, I would like to set up a meeting to discuss the following:


1. How do you define your universe of prospective companies?

2. How does each product segment view our services?
	What are your customers' views on risk management?

3. How does pricing affect the economics of your particular product segment?

4. What communication tools do you need and what are you currently using?

      5. What are the 3 major objections you hear from potential counterparties to a) getting involved in the spot market, 
          b)doing derivatives, or c) doing business with Enron?




I would appreciate any comments or suggestions. I will be sending a notice for a meeting time and place for sometime next week.


Thank you,
