I figured out what the problem was -- ten minutes after tech support told me there was no solution.

We definitely need to practice before we present the Yaks to the world so we will try again today.

I have the room reserved so that I can set up half an hour early.  If I again have problems setting up, we will cancel the meeting, so no time will be wasted.

I will see everyone promptly at 4:00.
