The following report shows which Registered, Guest, and Internal Users logged onto Clickpaper and how many days they logged on between Monday, October 22nd and Friday, October 26th.  Please keep in mind that some of the Guest User logons are from me logging on with their IDs to preset filters or testing their IDs to ensure they are functional before I call them to encourage them to become Registered Users.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  This report will be issued weekly.
