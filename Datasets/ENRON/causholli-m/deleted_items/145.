The renaming and moving of the O:\Pulp&Paper directory to O:\Industrial Markets\Forest Products may have caused some problems to those files which have macros that are still looking for the O:\Pulp&Paper directory.
 
If you have a model, graph, spreadsheet which was affected and need help, we have a solution available.  All we need to know is what files to fix.  So if you're experiencing a #Ref! error or anything relating to linkage to O:\Pulp&Paper, please let me know and we'll resolve it as soon as possible.
 
Thanks,
Avril
