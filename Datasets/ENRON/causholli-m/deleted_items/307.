Hello MR. Conde,

As I told you over the phone there are a couple of numbers in June Executive report for Communication papers that do not match the numbers in the time machine. For example:

June Demand for Canada for Coated woodfree papers is 39 000 in the report whereas I get 41,296 from the time machine.
Also, for the Uncoated Woodfree the report says that demand is 72,000 whereas the time machine says 74,123.

Can you help me figure out which one is correct? Also, How much time after the Monthly Executive reports go out does it take before the Time machine numbers are updated?

thanks,
