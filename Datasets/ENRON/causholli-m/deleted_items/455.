Hey Stacey,

Here is the info you requested:

O://industrial markets/fundamentals/paper/pulp/data

This spreadsheet has a lot of the data you requested. Check all the tabs. The most updated one is the RISI Prices tab. 

capacity sheet: O://industrial markets/fundamentals/paper/pulp/capacity

O://industrial markets/fundamentals/paper/information for all/Pulp-Newsprint-Corrugated. This sheet is updated monthly from Valos reports.


Again, we are still in the process of gathering data for pulp as we will purchase a lot of the data from PPPC, which we think is the best source. 
But you can start with the above spreadsheets.

Let me know if I can help further
