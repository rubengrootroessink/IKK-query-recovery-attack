VANCOUVER, July 31, 2001 (PRNewswire) - Further to its announcement of July 5, 2001 that it would curtail production of approximately 8,500 tonnes of lightweight coated and telephone directory paper, Pacifica Papers Inc. announces that it has extended the downtime at its Port Alberni operations until August 5, 2001 to curtail production of an additional 5,000 tonnes. The extension of the curtailment will further enable the Company to maintain efficiency in the balance of inventory, order flow and machine capacity in response to weaker economic conditions in the key U.S. market.
Pacifica is a high-margin producer of value-added groundwood printing and communications papers including lightweight coated paper, soft nip calendered paper, telephone directory paper, machine finished hibrite paper, and newsprint. Pacifica's operations include two paper mill complexes at Powell River and Port Alberni, British Columbia, with a combined annual production capacity of close to 900,000 tonnes.
