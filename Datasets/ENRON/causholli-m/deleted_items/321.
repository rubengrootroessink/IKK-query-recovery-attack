Dave,

At a number of the pulp meetings we have had discussions around information we would like to gather in the marketplace.  Until now I had been erring on the side of smaller meetings to facilitate better discussion but I think it would be more helpful to have one person from fundamentals present at the pulp meetings on Mondays at 9:00.  This should be the person that is doing most of the work on pulp.  Please let me know who you think the best person to attend would be.

Thanks,
Rodney
