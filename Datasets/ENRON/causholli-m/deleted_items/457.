Hello Mr. Cose,

I have found some information on harwood Pulp and BEK. So far I only have production, and capacity numbers for each country as well as some forecast that RISI has done on the hardwood.
I am still waiting to get some demand data from RISI and I expect that to come next week. 
In addition, I have a powerpoint presentation on BEK and I can send that one over to you as well.
Do you want to have this information now or do you want to wait until I get the demand data? Also, is better for you to have these faxed or by mail.

let me know,
Monika Causholli
