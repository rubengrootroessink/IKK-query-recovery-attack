Monika:  can we make it Wednesday morning around 9:30 pm as I won't have another envelope going to the attorneys this afternoon, and I do not want to be responsible for passports overnight.

Hello Margaret,

Can I bring my passports to you this afternoon (including that of my husband's) for you to send to Washington DC so I can get my visa extended? My 1 year H1B visa expires on Sep27th, 2001.

thanks,
Monika Causholli
