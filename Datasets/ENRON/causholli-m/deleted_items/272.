I actually went home right away because I felt tired to stay here and do any work. But I came in early this morning to finish Bulls and Bears and work on the market wrap.
Thanks for asking. 
I sent that presentation to Dick.

Did you ever get home last night? I hope your meeting with Allen was useful. One thing you can be sure about: today will be a better day!

Dick Robinson asked if we could email him Allen's presentation. I suspect most other people would prefer a printout. Could you send it to Allen by email and have Nyree distribute the others by paper copy?
