David,

Would it be possible for Monika to share her presentation so that we can all get a feel for the flow and the information that is presented?

Thanks,
Peggy

Two things:

1) I think you are all aware that we need to develop a market overview presentation on each of your markets similar to what Monika is pulling together on pulp. Have you started outlining what would go in your presentation?

2) Please give me a short (2-3 bullet) summary of what you are doing on pricing and inventory forecasting. I want to develop a summary report for Bob Crane.

Thanks,

Dave
