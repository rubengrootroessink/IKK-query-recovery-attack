Actually me and my husband were going to go there until of course we learned how much the ticket was. We are going to Janet's concert here in town though.

Anytime.  I considered Mjs concert until I heard that tickets were going for $2500/head...the only problem is that my Swiss bank account, in  billions of US$ of course, has been frozen temporarily.  Apparently the bank cannot handle the excess amounts of  money that are dumped into my account bi-weekly by Enron's direct deposit transfers :).  Why must I suffer :)

Monika,
The edited the following tabs : market pulp, inventory by grade, shipment by grade and production by grade.  I hope this helps.
Thanks,

Danilo
