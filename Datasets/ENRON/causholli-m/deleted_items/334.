Just to clarify everyone,

I created a spreadsheet that has information on the cash production costs of Brazil, Indonesia, and Russia. This includes both FOB-Mill costs as well as delivered to different regions costs. The spreadsheet will be expanded to include cash costs by company in these countries. Please see attached. 
This can also be found in the O://Industrial Markets/Fundamentals/Paper/Pulp/CASH COSTS ANALYSIS.

thanks,
Monika
