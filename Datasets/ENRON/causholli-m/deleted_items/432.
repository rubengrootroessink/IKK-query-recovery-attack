BRUSSELS, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Frantschach Pulp and Paper has ordered an automatic chip storage and reclaiming system for its two pulp lines at the Steti plant in the Czech Republic. The revamp will be implemented in two stages to avoid a shutdown. The first phase of the upgrade will be completed in February 2002 and the final work will be wrapped up in July 2002. 
 A spokesman said the Steti mill produces 250,000 tonnes/yr of bleached and unbleached kraft pulp. The new system will enhance safety and product quality. 
Steti's paper mill produces 200,000 tonnes/yr of sack paper, machine-glazed (MG) wrapping paper and linerboard. A revamp of the plant's PM is also planned for next year. The unit's 12,000 tonnes/yr capacity of MG paper is set to gradually rise to 31,000 tonnes/yr following the upgrade.
