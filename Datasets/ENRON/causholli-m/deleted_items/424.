SINGAPORE, July 20, 2001 (paperloop.com) - ITC Bhadrachalam has unveiled plans to invest Rupee 2.5 billion ($53 million) in a new fiber line for its Serapaka mill, which is located in the southern India. 
The modern elemental chlorine free (ECF) pulp line will have a capacity of 300 tonnes/day of bleached kraft pulp. It will use a mix of wood and nonwood fibers, including eucalyptus, bamboo and subabul. Startup is scheduled for mid-2002.
Metso Paper will supply the fiber line including screening, brown stock washing, oxygen delignification and bleaching. The new line will replace two 20-year-old lines with a combined bleached kraft pulp capacity of 200 tonnes/day, but which cannot produce the high brightness pulp the company needs to manufacture high quality board. "To match international competition and meet the needs of customers in India and abroad, we have to use high brightness ECF pulp for the products being made on our machines," a spokesman for ITC Bhadrachalam said.
