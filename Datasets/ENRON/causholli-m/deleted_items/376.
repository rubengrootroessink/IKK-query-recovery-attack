SINGAPORE, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com ) - Market pulp trading is growing in China in line with the country's healthy economic growth, but it is slumping in Korea as a result of the country's weakening coated woodfree paper exports to China. Sources said that although buying activity is picking up, Chinese traders are keen to destock their full inventories, putting a stop to any upward moves for NBSK and radiata pine pulp prices. Spot prices for these two grades have stayed flat at $390-410/tonne and $370-390/tonne, respectively, since early July. 
Mill downtime and reduced woodchip supplies have impeded trading of Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood in Asia. But a flurry of Brazilian eucalyptus to the region has filled the gap. Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood prices have edged up at the lower end to $360-370/tonne, up from $340-370/tonne in mid-July. Brazilian eucalyptus prices also shifted up $10/tonne at the lower end of the range, taking prices to US$360-370/tonne. Sources reported that large volumes of pulp from Latin America were being shipped to China in July following orders placed earlier. These include Brazilian eucalyptus and radiata pine from Chile. Chinese buyers placed large orders for these grades when prices plunged in April.
