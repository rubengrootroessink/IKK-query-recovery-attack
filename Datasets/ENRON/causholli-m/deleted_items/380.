We can use the disclaimer for anything - the legal group did ask to see the=
 "first" one of anything that we decided to send out.  Do we want Laura to =
take a look at developing a standard "format" for the outside newsletter an=
d include some key pricing parameters?  I would also suggest that we review=
 the "first issue" and the proposed format with Jennifer Walker. =20

Here is the language for the disclaimer:

Enron Industrial Markets and its affiliates are engaged in the trading of s=
teel and related commodities, and swaps, options, forwards and other deriva=
tives on such commodities, for their own accounts and such trading could af=
fect the markets for or prices of such commodities or derivatives.  The mar=
kets for and prices of such commodities and derivatives could also be affec=
ted by a variety of other factors, including supply and distribution factor=
s, activities of other market participants and economic conditions generall=
y.  Enron Industrial Markets and its affiliates assume no liability or resp=
onsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information contained he=
rein or for ensuring that any such information is current or updated.  The =
views set forth herein are intended solely for the personal use of the reci=
pient, should not form the principal basis for any investment or trading de=
cision and are not intended as advice or as a recommendation or solicitatio=
n of any transaction.  The user is solely responsible for any investment or=
 trading decisions made on the basis of this information.  The information =
set forth herein is subject to change without notice at any time.

A tad bit wordy, but if it will keep us from having to review every issue w=
ith legal, it is a good thing.

Thanks very much! I'll check it out.

Monika, could you forward to me the file with your market pulp originator n=
ewsletter in it? Some of our originators would like to send it out of the c=
ompany to potential counterparties, and I would like to look at the wording=
 to make sure we can send it out: the wording for an internal document may =
be more frank and open than a document that's intended for external distrib=
ution.

Peggy, did I hear you say you got some legal language for a disclaimer for =
steel? I wonder if we can use that on the market pulp and other originator =
letters to make sure they can be used externally?
