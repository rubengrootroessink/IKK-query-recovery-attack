Stacy,

Do you remember when I asked you to find some info on Phoenix Pulp and Advance Agro Public Company. I told David Ho to look over the EIM website but he didn't find anything helpful there. Below is what David Ho needs exactly. Can you help me with this task? Also I realize that we do not have any ready available presentations so I am going to tell that to David.

thanks,
Monika

Hi Monika,

Great to hv you onboard. I have already seen all the postings on the Fundy website but nothing new. All I need is some other pulp presentations done for other companies. I just need to follow the format and use some of the slides to modify. 

I need some information on Phoenix Pulp regard their new increase in capacity. They are having some expansion plan in their mill. Their capacity will increase by another 220,000mt in the year 2003/4. Please help me check it out. Please find out what kind of pulp will they be producing in this new capacity.

Thanks
David

David,

I am replacing  Dimitri as the pulp analyst so in the future send the requests to me.

First, we do not have any readily available presentations on any of those two companies.
You can go to the EIM fundies website under companies and there is some info there about Advance Agro Public, I am not sure about Phoenix Pulp though. 

Also, if this info is not what you want can you be more specific as to exactly what you want reported on these two companies?

let me know if this helps,
thanks
Monika Causholli
