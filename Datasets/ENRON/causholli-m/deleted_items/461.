Hello Gwen,

I received the paycheck with the anniversary increase today and I was wondering if this paycheck includes the increase for the last 2 periods or just this last period?

thanks,
Monika

Ivonne Brown submitted your anniversary increases in time for you to be paid on your June 29 paychecks.  Unfortunately I was out of the office due to a death in my immediate family from 05/29-06/11 and have been trying to catch up every since.  Your anniversary increases will be on your July 13 payroll checks.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks in advance,
