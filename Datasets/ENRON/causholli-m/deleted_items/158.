As I suggested earlier, it appears that Abitibi has no response to Boise's move to reduce or eliminate its purchase of slush pulp from Abitibi's Fort Frances (ON) mill. Right now it appears Abitibi will allow the pulp line at FF to go down when Boise stops purchasing from the mill. 

This may create an opportunity for us to finance installation of a pulp dryer at FF in return for offtake,  although I suspect the competitive cost position of the FF pulp line probably would make it a better strategy for us to focus our efforts on St. Felicien. (Also I don't know that Abitibi would be interested in a pulp dryer at FF.)
