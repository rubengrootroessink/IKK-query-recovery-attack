WAAAAAZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!

Its Greek Festival time again. October 4 through the 7th (Thurs to Sun). We're gonna bust it out GREEK    STYLE. And I dont want any smart comments about the Greek Festival being in Montrose. I've heard them all. The festival is really easy to find. It is on Yoakum between West Alabama and Westheimer, near St Thomas University, near Sky Bar, near La Mora, near La Colombe D'or and near a few other things. Also, there is a Greek party at Mykonos Island Restaurant  in Shephard Plaza at 1030 pm Saturday night. Everyone is welcome to come. Let me know, because half of Houston and all of Montrose is going to be there and you cannot miss it.
