Karen,
 
When I asked MT about exp. smoothing she said that exp smoothing is used for smth else and not for correlations. She suggested though that I run the correlations between the changes in prices as that will remove the trends in data (if there is any trend) for a more accurate corr. coefficient. That is what I did in the spreadsheet. As a result correlation coefficients were much lower.
 
By the way, how is your son doing?
Monika

Monika,
 
Just curious, are these the correllations with or without exponential smoothing?  Thanks.

Jim, 

Attached is the file that contains the correlation analysis between the NBSK price and the price for paper grades. 


Let me know if you want to further discuss this. 

thanks,
