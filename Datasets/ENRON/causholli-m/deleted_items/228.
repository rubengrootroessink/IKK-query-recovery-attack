Monika,

You should have received this as it's information which Rob Saltiel would like to see in the company analyses.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

KC

Addendum to earlier e-mail - in the basic summaries, let's also include the financial statistics - market cap, P/E ratio, stock ticker, and stock performance.  I did not see this in the recent GP summary.

Thanks.
Rob

Rob,

Methodology

The methodology we have been using to gather information for the Forest Product End-User Report consists of the following:

Collecting the following information from the individual product specialists:
Industry characteristics
Trends of the market segments
Shipment Information
Ideas on target markets and customers in their product specialties
Issues in their market segments 	

Information from various published reports, including the North American Factbook,  Jacobs Sirrene, various industry publications, and news sources.

With this information, we are identifying the top 10 producers and consumers in each market segment.  Each company profile consists of the following information: company description, facilities, products, business strategies, shipments, production, and capacity numbers.  Attached is a matrix outlining the identified companies, progress of report preparation, and the analysts assigned to cover each of the companies.  Since these analysts are new to our group and require training, some of the initial reports are taking more time.  As indicated previously, we appreciate any direction from you and your staff on establishing priorities.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see a draft of the information that we have been gathering.

Thank you,

Stacey
