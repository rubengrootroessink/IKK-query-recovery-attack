Dave,

Just wanted to update you on the correlations. Luis did not have any high yield fibers prices that we talked about yesterday. The only thing available was the mixed paper prices which I tried to correlate to tissue but the correlation coefficient came at 15%.

Also, I spoke with Ryan Ogden at Bureau of Labor Stats and it didn't seem like they had the prices for those recycled products. In any case, I asked him to email me whatever they have in their website in terms of paper prices and I am expecting that email today. Hopefully smth good will come out of that.

MOnika
