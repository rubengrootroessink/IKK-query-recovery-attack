Hi Karen and Monika,

I am working with Christopher de los Santos and Fariha Haque in looking at some of the drivers for the pulp market to structure a Decster for pulp-- one thing that struck me at today's meeting was the looming threat of BEK.  I would like to get together with you to better understand the work you have done on the drivers as well as the view that we are developing for BEK.  Let me know if you have some time tomorrow, I am wide open, and I will schedule a room.  Thanks!
