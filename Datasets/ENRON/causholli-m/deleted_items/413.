Monika, 
As you may notice, I've changed from the FOEX office into my P?yry office. 

In addition to the material I already sent to you on PIX pulp indexes earlier today, please find attached an older presentation (from the time FOEX was still an Exchange and NBSKP was the only index-series launched) which may shed some more light into the issue. 

Best regards, 
Timo T.

I for got to include another request in my other email. I am also
looking for the historical FOEX prices for pulp. Can you please send
those to me too.

Thanks,
