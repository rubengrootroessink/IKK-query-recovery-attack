Dear Team,

In the next couple of weeks, I will be scheduling meetings with the individual pulp originators.  We are gathering information on the pulp business and the originators' individual strategies when prospecting and maintaining client relationships.  

To prepare for these meetings, I would like to develop an outline of questions that we would like to discuss with the originators.  I hope to get their views on the industry, problems, and success stories.

I will scheduling a meeting later this week to discuss the strategies for these meetings.  In the meantime, would you put down topics or questions that you would like to discuss?  If you have any questions, please let me know.


Thanks,

Stacey
