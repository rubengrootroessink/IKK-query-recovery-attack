Lots of data & useful information is virtually at our fingertips.  In order to capitalize on all what's available, the Research Group would like to host a Brown Bag on how to get information as quick and painless as possible.  The Brown Bag will be an hour long, and will cover the EIM Fundy Website, general search engines, financial, company & industry specific data sources.  The brown bags are offered to everyone, so please let us know if you're interested in cashing in on some of our secrets!
 
Dates:    Session 1 :  August 21 - 10 a.m.
                   Session 2 : August 21 -  2 p.m.
 
                   Session 3:  August 22 - 10 a.m.
                   Session 4:  August 22 -  2 p.m. 
 
 Please respond to:  Stacey or Doug by email and let us know which session you will be attending.
