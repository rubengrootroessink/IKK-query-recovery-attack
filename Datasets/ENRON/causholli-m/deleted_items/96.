It has been brought to our attention that someone has written an offensive and inappropriate comment on the wall in the men's restroom located at ECS04710.   Security has been notifed of the incident. 

At Enron, every employee is expected to adhere to the values that the Company has established.  These values govern the way we conduct ourselves with coworkers and customers.  Employees are expected to be respectful, courteous and professional in all working relationships.  Offensive and/or derogatory comments are unacceptable in the work place.

We want to be absolutely clear that this type of behavior will not be tolerated and is grounds for immediate termination.

Jeff and Ray
