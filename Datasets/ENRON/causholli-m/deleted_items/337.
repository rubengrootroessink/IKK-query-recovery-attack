  Attached is the correlations for NBSK vs. paper grades.  Based on MT's advice I also did the correlations between the changes in these variables.
 In addition, I ran some regressions and the results are also in this spreadsheet. We will discuss these findings sometimes tomorrow morning. I have a meeting at 9 so after that I w'll be free.
