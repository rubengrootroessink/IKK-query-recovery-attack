Karen,
 
I left a message with the person that does prices at paperloop and hopefully he will get back to me soon.

Monika,
 
It would appear that paperloop.com is now publishing spot pulp prices for NBSK and SBSK.  It wasn't clear from the description how they were compiling/obtaining the information to publish this pricing.  It'd be interesting to see how these prices compare with the prompt contract price for pulp on the Pulpex.  Any chance you could check this out for me tomorrow?  Thanks.
