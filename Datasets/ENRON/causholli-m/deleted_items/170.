TO ALL HOUSTON BASED EMPLOYEES MOVING TO ENRON CENTER SOUTH
 
 
Thanks to all of you for your patience and assistance during the move process.  Just a couple of things we want to remind you of/update you on.
 


Friday, October 12 is move day.  Please assure all boxes are packed by 5:00 p.m.  Movers will begin at 5:00 p.m.

Remember to get rid of as much as you can prior to moving - - space is limited.

There are boxes in the freight elevator lobby.  Feel free to take as many as you need.  There are also shred bins which are the large blue containers.  Please put only confidential papers in these bins as we will be paying for shredding by the pound.

Because movers will begin at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, the Graphics department will need to begin packing as early as possible.  No requests will be taken after 12:00 noon on Friday.

In an effort to help you with your packing on Friday and your unpacking on Monday, EIM Office of the Chairman will be supplying lunch for those wishing to stay in and pack/unpack during the lunch hour.

If you have any move related questions please contact Marsha at x-33356.


 
Thanks again to all of you for your cooperation and a special thanks to all the Points of Contact for a job well done on preparing churns and passing along information.
