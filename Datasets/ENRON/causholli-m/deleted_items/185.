Ladies,
 
The newsprint desk is sponsoring a trip to Canada (I'm not sure where) to attend paper school.  I believe the course is scheduled for November 1st - 2nd, but I'll need to confirm these datea.  As they are looking for possible participants, I wanted to know if any of you had interest.  If so, could you kindly let me know by this afternoon so I can try to grab the spot(s).  Thks.
KC
