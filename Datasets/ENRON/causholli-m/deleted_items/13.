Hi Monika

I'm back in Spore.. after almost 24 hrs on plane... terrible long flight
Such a pity that I spend so little time with u... hope to make up next time.. for a drink 

Stay in touch and who knows what will happen
Call me if u need to touch... Spore is about 13 hours ahead of Houston

You can reach me anytime by cellular...


Cheers
