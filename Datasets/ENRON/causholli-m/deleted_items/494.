ABOUT SPOT PRICES
---------------------------------------------------- 

One important note: The pricing in this newsletter
and paperloop.com's Spot Prices Center should 
not be confused with contract pricing reported in 
Pulp & Paper Week and PPI This Week. Spot prices can 
vary dramatically from what most buyers in the market 
are in fact paying. The movement of spot prices does, 
however, provide some information as to the future 
direction of contract prices. The prices reported here 
reflect the market conditions in the week prior to 
their publication.
