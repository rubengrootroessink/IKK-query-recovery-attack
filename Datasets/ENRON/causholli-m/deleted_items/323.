Elizabeth,

Most people like to do what you proposed. Can you tell me what time is the concert and what time is good for us to have the dinner?

Monika

I mentioned the following idea to Vikram.  The Gispy Kings are playing out at the Woodlands Pavilion on August 26 (it is a Sunday)  and I was thinking it might be nice if we got together beforehand and had the potluck and then we could all go to the show, assuming their music is within everyone's taste and liking.  (Given the heavy weighting of the Latin contingent, I suspect it may be.)  Anyway, lawn seats are only $17, so it is also pretty affordable.  Dave and I both live out there, and I would be happy to host the potluck before hand in the afternoon at my house, or if Dave is willing we could make it a pool party,and get him off to a good start with all of his new neighbors by being really loud in his back yard.  Any thoughts?

PS  I'm out of town this coming weekend.

Elizabeth

I volunteer to taste the desserts from every region to make sure they're acceptable...Again, for the greater good of the group, I am always willing to sacrifice.

I know both Peggy and Elizabeth are in!

Hello everyone,


As a follow-up to Vikram's note I was thinking of us getting together someplace and each bringing a potluck dish from our own respective countries or anything else that you want to cook, including desserts. 

What do you think? I am going to need some feedback on this in terms of when you want to do it, where, and what time? Then we can coordinate on who is bringing the main dish, salads, and desserts. 

I thought of this as a way of knowing each other better and sharing some cultural experince from everyones background.



let me know,
Monika
