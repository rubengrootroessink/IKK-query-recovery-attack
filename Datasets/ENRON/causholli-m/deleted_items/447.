ALPHARETTA, Ga., July 16, 2001 (press release) -- Schweitzer-Mauduit Intern=
ational, Inc. (NYSE: SWM - news) today announced a plan to restructure its =
Brazilian operations and exit the printing and writing uncoated papers busi=
ness in Brazil in response to current business conditions. A pre-tax charge=
 of approximately $4.5 to $5.0 million will be taken in the second quarter =
of 2001 to implement this restructuring. Excluding this unusual item, the C=
ompany anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 200=
1 to be in the range of $.52 to $.54 per share. Second quarter diluted earn=
ings per share in 2000 were $.41.=20
Brazilian Restructuring=20
Wayne H. Deitrich, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, comme=
nted that, ``Recent changes in Brazilian business conditions made it necess=
ary for Schweitzer-Mauduit to reassess its ability to continue to compete e=
ffectively in the printing and writing uncoated papers market. Sales volume=
s during the past six months have been unfavorably impacted by a slowdown i=
n the Brazilian printing and writing papers market as well as by a decision=
 by the Company to reduce its sales of certain grades of these papers that =
have been negatively impacted by ICMS, a form of value-added business tax. =
In addition, the recently enacted electricity rationing program in Brazil h=
as necessitated production curtailments in our Brazilian operations. The pr=
inting and writing uncoated papers business is our least profitable product=
 line in Brazil while being our largest electricity user.''=20
The decision to exit the printing and writing uncoated papers business in B=
razil will result in a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of 2001 of appr=
oximately $4.5 to $5.0 million, or $.20 to $.22 per share, for a non-cash w=
rite-off of assets. In addition, a further pre-tax charge of approximately =
$0.5 to $0.7 million, or $.02 to $.03 per share, will be taken in the third=
 quarter, primarily related to employee termination and severance costs. Sc=
hweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil's net sales of printing and writing uncoated pap=
ers totaled approximately $25 million in 2000. Because of cost reduction st=
eps to be implemented as part of the restructuring, exiting the printing an=
d writing uncoated papers business is not expected to have a material impac=
t on ongoing operating results after the restructuring is fully implemented=
, which should occur by year-end 2001.=20
Brazilian Energy Situation=20
In late May, the Brazilian government announced the details of its electric=
ity rationing program which has an overall objective of a 20 percent reduct=
ion in electricity consumption and mandates a 25 percent reduction in elect=
ricity consumption by the paper industry in the most populated and industri=
alized regions of Brazil. The reduction is calculated from prior-year avera=
ge electricity consumption. The reduction must be measured and achieved for=
 consecutive thirty-day periods commencing May 31, 2001. Failure to achieve=
 the mandated reductions would result in higher electricity rates and cuts =
in electrical power service. The duration of the government's energy reduct=
ion directive is uncertain although it is expected to last at least six mon=
ths, through the traditional ``dry period'' in Brazil. The government's for=
ced consumption reduction program is in response to unusually low water lev=
els in the lakes and reservoirs supplying Brazil's hydroelectric facilities=
 that provide 90 percent of that country's electricity.=20
In response to the Brazilian government's energy reduction directive, Schwe=
itzer-Mauduit do Brasil implemented a four-part electricity reduction progr=
am. All nonessential nonmanufacturing uses of electricity are being elimina=
ted including cuts in air conditioning, reduced lighting and changes in the=
 operation of the water and effluent treatment plants. Manufacturing proces=
s modifications are being implemented to achieve more energy-efficient usag=
e of equipment where product quality will not be compromised. A comprehensi=
ve energy conservation training program is being conducted for Brazilian em=
ployees and contracted service providers of the Company to increase awarene=
ss and solicit ideas for additional electricity reduction. To achieve the 2=
5 percent electrical consumption reduction target, it has also been necessa=
ry to implement production curtailments. Machine downtime has been taken to=
 reduce the production of the Company's least profitable products.=20
Mr. Deitrich added that, ``Schweitzer-Mauduit does not expect the governmen=
t's electricity reduction program to significantly affect the demand for or=
 its ability to produce tobacco-related papers. Likewise, the availability =
of the Company's major raw materials such as wood pulp, chemicals and chalk=
 and the ability to receive raw materials and ship finished product are not=
 expected to be materially impacted. Exiting the printing and writing uncoa=
ted papers business will permit Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil to better focu=
s on and service its other product lines.''=20
Anticipated Second Quarter Results=20
Excluding the unusual charge associated with restructuring the Brazilian op=
erations, the Company anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second=
 quarter of 2001 to be in the range of $.52 to $.54 per share. Operating pr=
ofit improvement is anticipated in both the French and U.S. business units =
compared with the prior-year quarter. Results for the quarter are expected =
to benefit from increased tobacco-related papers sales volumes, lower wood =
pulp costs and improvement in average selling prices. The average per ton l=
ist price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp in the United States was=
 $570 per metric ton in the second quarter of 2001 compared with $680 per m=
etric ton in the second quarter of 2000. These positive factors will be par=
tially offset by higher purchased energy costs and expenses related to the =
banded cigarette paper project and resultant higher cost of operations at t=
he Spotswood, New Jersey mill.=20
Schweitzer-Mauduit will issue its second quarter 2001 earnings press releas=
e on Thursday, July 26, 2001. The Company will hold a conference call to re=
view second quarter results with investors and analysts at 10:30 a.m. easte=
rn time on that day. The conference call will be simultaneously broadcast o=
ver the World Wide Web at http://www.schweitzer-mauduit.com . To listen to =

all to register and download and install any necessary audio software. For =
