Chris,

I don't think that there is any price reported for Indonesian tropical hardwood but I'll check and make sure.

Chris,

Can you provide a similar analysis for mixed tropical hardwoods versus NBSK?  Acacia versus NBSK?  We have an opportunity to pursue these commodities and provide structured solutions, etc.
