Thanks.  But actually, I am looking for the % of pulp these companies purchase as % of total market pulp purchased worldwide.

Jim,

Lecta group is a privately held company and I was unable to find sources of info that would report on their pulp consumption. If you know of any source let me know.

Below you will find the consumption rates for the rest of the companies
