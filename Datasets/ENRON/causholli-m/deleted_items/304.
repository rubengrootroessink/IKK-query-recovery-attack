Karen,
 
I was just thinking that maybe Wall Street Journal would be a good source of Brazilian ec. condition and sometimes they report on specific industries too.

Subject: Market Wrap - Brazil


Please find attached the first version of a Brazil Market Wrap which we envision issuing bi-weekly.  The intent is to provide you with a general overview of the currency's value and the prevailing economic environment in Brazil, as well as information relevant to the pulp market. 
 
As we're still in the process of refining our Brazil data, we hope to eventually start publishing some proprietary information on operating rates, FOB cash costs, and prices obtained by individual companies in various geographic regions.  Assuming, that is, our in-house resource is able to obtain this type of information.  
 
We hope that this newsletter will provide information for discussion purposes, and anyone requiring anything further can please feel free to contact those individuals from Fundamentals listed in the report.  If you don't wish to receive this, then please kindly advise me and I will remove you from our distribution list.  Thanks.
 
Karen
