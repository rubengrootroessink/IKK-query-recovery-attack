HEADLINE: 	Deferiet Paper mill in N.Y. to be reopened by new B.C. owner 	
ARTICLE: 	By James McLaren 

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 29, 2001 (Forestweb) -- Vancouver, B.C.-based Belkorp Industries Inc. has acquired the Deferiet Paper Co. mill in Upstate New York from bankruptcy court. A Belkorp official declined comment today until the transaction is completed. 

The new owner plans to reopen to idled mill to produce paper, either from existing wood pulp operations or recycled paper, according to local press reports. 

The deal comes four months after the mill closed down, and one month after an auction failed to produce any bids. 

The independent mill was formerly operated by Champion International. It has listed capacity of 225,000 tons annually of groundwood specialty paper. 

Belkorp plans to re-open the mill by next spring, and rehire between 100 and 200 workers, local press reports said. It previously employed more than 400. 

The news came after weeks of efforts to jointly market the Deferiet mill with other Upstate closed mills in Lyons Falls, N.Y., and Newton Falls, N.Y. 

Unemployment benefits were to run out soon for the former Deferiet Paper workers, who are members of the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union.
