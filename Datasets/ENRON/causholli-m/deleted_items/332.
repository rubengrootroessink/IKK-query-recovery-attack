Hello everyone,


As a follow-up to Vikram's note I was thinking of us getting together someplace and each bringing a potluck dish from our own respective countries or anything else that you want to cook, including desserts. 

What do you think? I am going to need some feedback on this in terms of when you want to do it, where, and what time? Then we can coordinate on who is bringing the main dish, salads, and desserts. 

I thought of this as a way of knowing each other better and sharing some cultural experince from everyones background.



let me know,
Monika
