Hello,

I am the pulp analyst in Houston and I have been putting out a newsletter every week (usually on Fridays) with major news and some market analysis. Attached you will find two of the most recent of these newsletters.

If anyone is requiring further information    please feel free to contact those individuals from fundamentals listed in the report. If you don't wish to receive this, then please advise me and I will remove you from our distribution list.  

Thanks,
Monika Causholli
