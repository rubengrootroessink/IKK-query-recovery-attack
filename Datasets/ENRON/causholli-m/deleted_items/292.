Pulp Update: Inventory Rise in July Well Below Average; Goldman Sachs High
Yield Research; 8/14/01

Norscan pulp inventories rose just 4,000 tonnes in July, which is well below
the typical seasonal increase of approximately 150,000 tonnes.  Amidst all
the bad news about the pulp environment, this is good news.  Producer
downtime is certainly helping.  However, pulp prices remain quite weak, and
inventories of 1.78 million tonnes are still too high to allow for any
tightening of supply and demand in the short term.

We will distribute details of the July pulp report once they are available.
