San Francisco, Oct. 18, 2001 (Forestweb) - Weyerhaeuser Co. will increase t=
he U.S. price of its northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) price by $20/t=
onne to $500/tonne effective Nov. 1, according to a buyer source. Another b=
uyer source said Weyerhaeuser has increased his price by $20/tonne on the s=
awdust pulp that he buys, "and I assume on the others." Weyerhaeuser offici=
als were not available for comment. Weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout =
at the U.S. price of $480/tonne for Oct. 1, when other North American produ=
cers went to $500/tonne. The competitors have complained that Weyerhaeuser'=
s price was a drag on their efforts. Producers and buyers alike have said t=
hat $500/tonne has been a hard sell in October, partly because of the marke=
t, but also because demand has been so slow. A number of sources say NBSK i=
s at $480/tonne for October, though a few are paying the $500/tonne price. =
"I don't think we will pay $500 (in November)," a buyer said today. "I thin=
k it will be $490." An agent today described the Weyerhaeuser news as "a pl=
us," but added, "Now all we need is for demand to pick up." Another agent a=
lso responded cautiously. "There is no indication anywhere in the world whe=
re demand has picked up, certainly not in the paper business. Without that,=
 (producers) can announce what they want to, but it is not a slam dunk," he=
 said. As for October transaction , aid that in most cases, they didn't mov=
e. "I know everyone needs (price increases) and I know the inventories have=
 gone down, but my feeling is they will go up again," he said, noting typic=
al late-fall patterns.  said that in contrast to the past, paper companies =
have not been able to make money off of low prices. "It's going to be a bat=
tle, for sure," he said. "There's a lot of fighting going on, a lot (of buy=
ers) are saying they're not going to pay it."
