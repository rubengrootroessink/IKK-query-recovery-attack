Dave,
 
I am fine. I thought Karen told you about me working from home today. I am reading the tissue book that I just received from Esko Uutella Consulting in Germany.
 
I am also working on Abitibi's mills and send it to you by email. I asked Greg Bruch about the mills but he did not know the information as much in detail as we had it.
 
Thanks,
Monika

I will be working from home for the rest of the day today. If you have any questions you can send them by email as I will be checking it from home.

Thank you,
