Jim,
 
I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to.
   1- Yale
   2- Boston College
   3- University of Massachusetts
   4- Bocconi University (Italy)
 
Thanks,
Monika

Hi -
 
I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows, they may have some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I would be happy to do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a specific recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So let me know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically, students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential letters.
 
Jim

Jim,
 
I did write to Eric Hughson about the PhD program and I am waiting for his response.
In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday.
Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU trying to see what they can help me with?
Thanks for all your help. I will keep you posted.
 
Monika

Hi Again Monika -
 
Here is what I heard from my former professor. If I were you, I would contact Eric Hughson about CU's PhD program in Finance. It is worth a try.
 
I will contact you if I hear about other opportunities either for graduate study or employment opportunities. Keep me posted.
 
Jim

Hi Jim,
It has been a long time between communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU <mailto:Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU>.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific recommendations.
Ron
PS--I also still like the teaching part of the academic life and probably won't be retiring for another few years.

Hi Ron - 

It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun.

The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.

Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 

Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the right person at CU?

If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?

Thanks for any help you can provide. 

Best regards, 

Jim
