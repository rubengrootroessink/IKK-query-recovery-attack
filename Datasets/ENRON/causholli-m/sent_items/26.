The good news in terms of pricing is that consumption rose this month by 16%, and higher consumption levels will deplete inventories and consumers will need to replace those inventories faster. Hopefully consumption will continue to grow over the next several months.

Monika, this is interesting. To summarize, are you saying that inventories are below a year ago (which is good for producers) but they rose when they normally fall (bad for producers)? What does this mean for pricing?
