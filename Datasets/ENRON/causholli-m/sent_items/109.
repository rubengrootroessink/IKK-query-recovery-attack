Hello Mr. Uutella,


I am an analyst working for Enron Industrial Markets in Houston, Texas and I am gathering some information on tissue. I spoke to Rod Young and David Pinault from RISI and they told me to contact you as you do some more extensive studies on tissue usage. 

What I am looking for are: tissue capacity worldwide and by region (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia)
and the biggest companies that produce tissue.

Can you also include how much this information would cost?

Thanks in advance,
Monika Causholli
