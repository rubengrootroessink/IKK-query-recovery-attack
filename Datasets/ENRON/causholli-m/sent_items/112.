Ami,

I will be here on Monday but I believe that most of my day is taken with meetings. Can we possibly meet on Tuesday? Just call me at my extension 5-1510.

Hey Monika,

I'm going to start working with Om Bhatia next Monday, and he thought it would be good if we met so I could talk to you about things I will be working on. Let me know when you have some free time!

Thanks,
