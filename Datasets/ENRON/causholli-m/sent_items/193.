Dearest Friends,

Please know that I have been afforded the opportunity to rotate into Enron's Principal Investments Group.  That being said, I wanted to thank all of you for the warmth and kindness you have extended to me over the past 6 months.  I sincerely hope that our paths in life will cross again very soon.

Best Wishes & Many Thanks,
Vikram Singh
