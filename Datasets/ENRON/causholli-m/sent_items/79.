Dear Ms. Causholli:

If your husband is not eligible to receive a Social Security number, he
needs to obtain a "letter of ineligibility" from the Social Security
Administration.  With this letter, the Department of Public Safety is able
to continue with the process of issuing him an original driver license.  He
will need to present proof of his identity in order to obtain an orginal
driver license and his foreign passport with a valid U.S. Visa included will
be sufficient.  Your husband will be required to take the written and
driving tests and pay the required fees.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me at this
e-mail address or by phone at (512) 424-5062.

Sincerely,

Rhonda Fleming, Major
Driver License Division
