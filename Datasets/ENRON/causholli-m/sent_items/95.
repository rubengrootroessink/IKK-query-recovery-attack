Hello Avril,

We have found some good info on tissue paper from an independent consulting company.I talked to Andrea so we are going to go and purchase the study. The consulting company is located in Germany and the name of the person and his contact are:

Please read below for the kind of information he can provide us with and the related costs. We decided to get the whole package.

Monika, if Bryja and Karen are OK with this, go ahead and purchase.  I think we probably need to go with the complete study.  Please coordinate with Avril.
Thanks, avr

This report sounds very worthwhile, and the cost is extremely reasonable. Does Jim Bryja know these guys?

Andrea,

I found a private consultant on tissue (as RISI does not do anything on the subject) and he is located in Germany. Below is the kind of information that he can make available to us as well as the costs. Can you please advice me on how much information we want to get from him based on what he wrote below?

Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study "Outlook for World Tissue 
Business" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
detailed Annexes).

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
could easier fulfil your data needs.


Best regards

Esko Uutela
