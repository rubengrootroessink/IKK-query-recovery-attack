Hello Jim,

It's been a long time since I last wrote you but here I am again. I am still working for Enron, but I moved away from Oregon. Now me and my husband are living in Houston, Texas. 
I worked in Portland until May of this year and then I though of moving away from Oregon just because opportunities are not as big there. In Portland I wroked as a power real time trader buying and selling power real time. I got tired of that job because of shift work. This summer I joined the forests products department and right now I do analysis for the traders. I ahve taken a couple of derivatives classes offered in the company and plan to take some more. My goal is to move to a trader's position, mostly financial trader to work with derivatives but we will see what happens. Right now I am learning about the market, and how it functions. 

I plan on taking some classes next term at Rice University in Houston. I need to have better mathematical skills and I will start taking math classes at night after work. We will see how this goes. i have to prepare myself well for the future. 

That's all on work side. 
Moving to Houston was quite a change. The  weather especially. Right now though the weather is great, it's sunny and in the mid-70s to 80s. I love it. Koli likes Portland better. Houston is a much bigger city and a little more dangerous. I like it though, what I miss is Corvallis and school. I miss business school at OSU and studying for finance classes. I want to go back to school eventually and get both MBA and PHD so I can teach. I would love to be a professor. 

So how are you? How is your wife? Your kids? Is anything new happening? What about your parents in NY? Are they OK from all that has happened?  
What about OSU? Anything new there? How is prof. Moulton? Say hi to him from me. What about the students? Are you still demanding of them? You know I remember that I put a lot of work in your classes.

We plan to go home this Christmas and meet our families. My parents ask me about you all the time. They had the greatest time when they visited me here. 

well that's all for now but I will keep in touch more often. Let me know how thigs are going with you,

say hi to your wife from me
best wishes,
Monika
