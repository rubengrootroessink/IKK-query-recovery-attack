Dave,

I am leaving for Dallas tonight because I arranged a meeting with an international advisor at University of Texas tomorrow. She will do an exception for me.
Anyways, I won't be coming to work tomorrow but I will keep in touch.

See you on Wednesday
Thanks for everything,
Monika

I didn't save the electronic version, so can you re-send it to me?

Dave,

Just got off the phone with the school. Apparently I don't have enough time to submit application but I practically begged for it so they are allowing me to submit a late application.

The only thing is that I won't have an answer until the beginning of January. Classes start in the middle of January. So, is it possible to change the date of departure until Jan 11 in the letter that you wrote for me. It would be great.

Thanks,
Monika
