Hi Monika,

Your husband needs to complete the Form SS-5, attached.  Take it to the SSA office, you can also do this on his behalf.  However, you need all the documentation listed and your passport or drivers license.  He (or you) need to specifically request, from the SSA office, a "denial letter".  The denial letter will be sent to your home.  Upon its receipt, he needs to take the denial letter in lieu of a social security card with his Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) and apply for one then.

Margaret just advised that your husband received a Texas Drivers License.  Please advise if the above instructions are different than the process you utilized.

Best Regards,
Bobbi

Subject:	Question on driver's licence for H4 visa holders

Hello Margaret,

I am trying to figure out how my husband can obtain a driver's licence in the state of Texas but the office of social security, IRS, and DPS all give me different answers and are not helpful at all. We are confused. My husband is on H4 visa and he does not have a social security but the state of Texas requires the social security to obtain a driver's licence. He has a tax-payer SSN but that did not work for the licence. 

Do you know what the law is in this case? Can we ask Enron lawyers about this problem? 
Common sense tells me that there can be a way for him to drive here but I don't know how.

Please help us,

Thanks a lot
Monika Cauhsolli
