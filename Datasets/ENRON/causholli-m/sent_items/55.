Hello Margaret,

Actually you forwarded this messagge to Rhonda Fleming and she did help me a lot. We were able to obtain a driver's licence for my husband.  

Thanks Margaret.
Monika

Subject:	Question on driver's licence for H4 visa holders

Hello Margaret,

I am trying to figure out how my husband can obtain a driver's licence in the state of Texas but the office of social security, IRS, and DPS all give me different answers and are not helpful at all. We are confused. My husband is on H4 visa and he does not have a social security but the state of Texas requires the social security to obtain a driver's licence. He has a tax-payer SSN but that did not work for the licence. 

Do you know what the law is in this case? Can we ask Enron lawyers about this problem? 
Common sense tells me that there can be a way for him to drive here but I don't know how.

Please help us,

Thanks a lot
Monika Cauhsolli
