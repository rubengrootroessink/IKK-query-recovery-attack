I did give the itinerary to you but if you still need it I can give it to you again. Also, Dave knows that my husband is coming with me but I don't know if Andrea knows. If there is a problem with this let me know.

Hello Monika, 

Hope your day is going great.  I am in the process of preparing your expense report.  Correct me if I am wrong, did you give me a copy of your flight itinerary for San Diego?  Also,  did Andrea know that you were traveling with your husband?  Please advise.

Thank you, 
Nyree
