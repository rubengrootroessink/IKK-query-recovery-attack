Hello Mr. Temple,

This is a follow-up email to what you talked with Dave Allan on the subject of Fiber morphology. Attached you will find the fiber characteristics spreadsheet - the most updated version. 

We also have an additional question which is - why each quality parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use (paper grade) application.

You can contact me for any further questions.


thanks,
