Hello Karen,

Please find attached Chile's capacity and its expansion projects.

Note that: 
1- Arauco's Constitucion mill might have another alternative capacity of 360,000 tons a year. I was confused because in their annual report the capacity is mentioned many times, each time different numbers. Can I get your input on this. We can discuss it when you have time.

2- There is one modernization project that will increase the capacity of Pacifico mill (CMPC) that will come online on Q1 2003. I did not apply any percentage rate for the project implementation. PLease advise me if I need to do that plus the rates I should use.

3- The projects in red are not impelemented yet and PPPC does not look very optimistic for those. 

4-Sheet 1 of the spread sheet contains the mills' capacities from Jacobs Sirrine which are not far off from the capacities I found in the annual reports.

Let me know if I need to work and improve this further.
 
Finally, I had a lot of fun working on this project  :)

Monika
