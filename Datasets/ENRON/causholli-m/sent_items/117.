Gwen,

There have been problems with my paycheck going to the wrong address. It is still going in Portland, Oregon. Can you please change my mail stop to 2906?

My current address is
2440 North Boulevard # 5205
Houston, TX 77098 

and I changed this in the ehronline website. Can you reconfirm this? 

Thanks,
Monika Causholli
