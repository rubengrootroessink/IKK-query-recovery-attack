Hello Mr. Hughson,

Ronald Melicher adviced me to contact you about the PhD program. 
I am interested in the field of finance and I wanted to learn about the PhD finance program at the University of Colorado. 
Can you summarize the main points of the program, its requirements,and the deadlines? 

I have finished a finance degree from Oregon State University and have two years of work experience.

Sincerely,
Monika Causholli
