You need the following ingredients:

Trout Fish (medium size)
About 4 big yellow onions- chopped into little pieces
About 4 pieces of garlic- also chopped in little pieces
Tomato Sauce
Red Pepper
Black Pepper
Bay Leaf
Lemon Juice
Salt
White wine
Vegetable Oil

The process:

1- Clean and wash the fish. Cut the head off you don't need that. Place the fish in a pan and pour lemon juice in it. Leave it in lemon juice while preparing the sauce.

2- In another pan put some vegetable oil and fry the chopped onions. After about 4 min add a little black pepper, red pepper, garlic, salt and bay leaf and stir. 
3- Continue stirring until the onions are a little brownish in color. Then add the tomato sauce and continue stirring. You will have a reddish sauce ready.
4- In a baking pan put the sauce that you prepared above and open a free space in the middle for the fish. Place the fish in the middle. Then pour lemon juice and white wine on the whole pan and put the pan in the oven.

Keep an eye on it as fish is cooked really fast. When you serve it ad lemon juice again. 


Another way of cooking the trout fish (much easier and I think tastier)

Get a small trout this time., 
After cleaning it place it in a baking pan. Then add olive oil into it (lots of it), lemon juice,  chopped tomatoes (about 2 tomatoes) , and olives. 
Just bake it and there you have it. Again when you serve it you need to add some more lemon juice.
 It's delicious!



Try any of these and let me know how they taste. Have fun
