I said at yesterday's meeting that I would get back to you concerning the 
speed issues of the V@R calculations - here's the response...

I spoke with Steve Stock, the Director of RAC systems.  He agreed that there 
are performance problems and this is being addressed in a technology review 
being conducted by my application architecture group.  There are plans to 
re-architect the application so it can handle real time calculations.  Once 
the results of the review are known - I will be more than happy to share them 
with you.  The V@R process currently takes 11 hours from start to finish.  We 
also find this unacceptable!

Also, the front end is very slow in accessing data.  There is a new front end 
in development that will address these problems.

I'll keep you posted as new developments occur.
