Mr. Lavorato,

Hello.  Below are estimates on the vacation we discussed last week.  I
know that Jamaica was not a set destination but I really feel something
like the FDR Resort might be a good options for a family vacation.  One
of the biggest pluses is the nanny you are assigned upon arrival I think
most people find it really makes the vacation stress fee.  I will be
honest with you there are other resorts in the Caribbean that are nicer
but they are not family resorts.  Programs and things are offered for
children usually starting at 4 years (sometimes 3) of age nanny services
are not really provide and just babysitting that must be prearranged.  If
features like the nanny service are not as important to you then I will
make other suggestions.   I am not including rates on the Boscobel Beach
Resort because they just closed to do renovation that will last until
December 2001.  If you have any questions, need additional information,
or would like to set up reservations please do not hesitate to call or
E-mail.


Regards,
Crystal Schwartz
