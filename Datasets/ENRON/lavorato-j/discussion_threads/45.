Jonathan,  in the email below are examples of the US Natural Gas Long 
Descriptions we have come up with for the Tokenised Periods "Day Ahead" and 
"Balance of Month".  The Short Description for these products will have the 
specific dates in it whilst the long description will not.

Thus we need toi have language that will adequately describe the tokenised 
period.

I am not familiar with the rules and specific calendar holidays that needs to 
be referenced in the relevant part of the long description.

Can you use the US ones we have done below as a start point come up with 
language to describe the:
Day Ahead
Balance of Month
periods for Canadian Gas that will cover the weekend and holiday periods.

Mark, are you the appropriate legal counsel to review the tokenised 
descriptions for Canadian Gas?


Thanks


Awais
