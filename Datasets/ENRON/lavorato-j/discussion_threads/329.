The following is what I have found at Pebble Beach for the month of March:

Only one weekend is available for both the hotel and golf.  Accommodations at 
Inn at Spanish Bay for 4 guests arriving Thursday, March 8, 2001 departing 
Sunday, March 11, 2001.  There is a minimum of a two night stay but you can 
use any combination within these dates.  Ocean View room rate is 
$525.00/person/night.

Golf Availability:
Links at Spanish Bay - Friday, March 9 at 7:20 a.m. - Golf Fee $185.00/pp 
includes 2 carts
Pebble Beach Golf Links - Saturday, March 10 at 12:00 p.m. - Golf Fee 
$300.00/pp includes 2 carts
Spyglass Hill Golf Course - Sunday, March 11 at 7:30 a.m. - Golf Fee 
$225.00/pp includes 2 carts
(Please note:  Only these courses and these tee times are available to play 
on these dates.)

If you are not planning to stay on property, tee times can only be reserved 
60 days out at The Links at Spanish Bay, 30 days out at Spyglass Hill and one 
day in advance at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

Average high temperature in the Monterey area during the month of March is 62 
degrees and the average low temperature is 45 degrees.

Attached is some information on the hotel and golf courses as well as driving 
times and directions from nearby airports.

The resort will only hold these dates until the end of the week so please let 
me know if you would be interested in confirming.  If you choose to look at 
alternate dates, I would be happy to check availability for you.
THANKS!!
