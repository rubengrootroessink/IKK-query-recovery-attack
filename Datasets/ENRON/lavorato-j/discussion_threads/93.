Jane,

Sorry for the delay.   Please be advised of the following:

De Geurin Realty, Inc
2650 Fountainview, Suite #300
Houston,  TX   77057

Contact:  Phyllis Peak (I believe Phyllis worked with David Oxley)
713-789-9999 - Office -
713-528-5801 - Home -

or

Greenwood-King Properties
3200 Kirby, Suite 200
Houston, TX   77098

Contact:  Jacque Morris
713-524-1228 - Office
713-851-2917 - Cell Phone

Both of the above can provide the services requested.  I am not sure of the 
costs, however, they are both very reasonable.

Thanks.

Lloyd:



Attached is his relo letter.  I have put a signed copy in interoffice mail to 
you today.


John has asked me about hiring someone who will handle all the little matters 
of getting electricity and phone hook-ups, mail forwarding, etc.  Is there a 
company that can do this?  What kind of fees are usual?  David Oxley 
mentioned that his real estate agent did all of this.....

Thanks,

Jane
