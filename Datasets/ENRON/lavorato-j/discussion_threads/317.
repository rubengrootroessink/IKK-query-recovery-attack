If you call changing the world not much to do, so be it.  I know Texas is a
big state, but is there enough room to accommodate your arrogance and
Waldren's?

By the way, I want to bring Dena (I think it's with an 'e') something for
putting up with Rich and James.  What kind of perfume does she like?  - Or,
what else might she appreciate?

Give me an idea of required clothing for the evenings.  I assume shorts for
golfing.

I'm sensing that you don't have much to do during the day.  I'm thinking
about inviting Mark Waldren down at the same time.  Please advise.
