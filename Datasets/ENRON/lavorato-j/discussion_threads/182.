John,

As of 6/15 the value in the ICAP curve was $79MM.
I have executed bilateral trades creating $3MM of New Deal value in my book.
There is now $65MM of value left in the curve.
$11MM has been spent in hedges.

FYI
From July 13 - 21 the PJM cash desk is open for you to trade.  Let me know 
when you want to come down for some training.

Dana
