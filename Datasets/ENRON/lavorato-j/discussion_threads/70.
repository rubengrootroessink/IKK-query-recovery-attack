The 2000 Federal Budget was recently announced.  Here are some of the 
highlights that you might find interesting:

Stock Options:

The amount of the stock option benefit reported as income is reduced from 3/4 
to 2/3 on options exercised after February 27, 2000.  In other words, 33% is 
not taxable (was 25%).

Tax Rates:

Basic personal exemption will increase to $7,231 (currently $7,131)
this change will be effective on the July 1-15 pay and will be doubled for 
the remainder of 2000

Spousal amount is increasing to $6,140 (currently $6,055)

The new tax rate structure for 2000:

17% of taxable income up to $30,004 (was $29,590)
25% of taxable income between $30,004 and $60,009 (was $29,590 to $59,180)
29% of taxable income in excess of $60,009 (was $59,180)

Limits to Foreign Content Increased:

Despite a "hot tip" that RRSP contribution limits would be raised in this 
year's budget, it did not happen.  However, the foreign content limit for 
RPPs and RRSPs is increased from 20% to 25% for 2000 and to 30% for 2001.
