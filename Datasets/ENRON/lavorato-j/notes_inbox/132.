No not a promise but it more or less went like this:  Kathy:  "Lavo, you have 
caused me a lot of grief by taking both Ryan and Chad, you wouldn't believe 
the overtime I had to work.  I should get some kind of hiring bonus or 
something".  John:  "Well if you go three for three you're on".

I have read that the average cost of hiring/training someone is approx 
$80,000.  I am willing to accept much less than this.  Actually I don't 
really expect anything I just thought I would give it a shot.

Kathy

In all seriousness, did I promise you a payment.
