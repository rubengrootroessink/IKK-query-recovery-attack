Seems Baxter and presumably Hannon are interested in him. Shall I call them?

Lavo tells me this guy needs to leave but apparently there is some debate 
about him staying?

Can you tell me:

Where he is  HE WORKS IN M&A.  CURRENTLY HE IS HELPING WITH THE SALE OF THE 
GAS BUS. UNIT.  CLOSELY WORKS  WITH BAXTER BUT ACTUALLY REPORTS TO KISHKILL.  
WE TOLD HIM BACK IN DECEMBER THAT HE NEEDED TO REPATRIATE AT THE END OF THE 
MONTH (JAN).  HE WENT ON VACATION AND NOW HE IS OUT SICK.  HE TOLD US THAT HE 
IS COMING BACK TO THE OFFICE NEXT WEEK.  I'LL BE TALKING TO HIM ON THE 
REPATRIATION AND JOE ON HIS PERFORMANCE (WE RATED HIM ISSUES BUT AT THE 
GLOBAL VP PRC IT WAS CHANGED TO NEEDS IMPROVEMENT).  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING 
THAT HE IS GETTING A JOB WORKING AT EBS.  THAT IS THE LAST COMMUNICATION WE 
HAVE (INITIALLY BAXTER WANTED HIM).   BASED ON THE INTEREST FROM BAXTER AND 
OTHERS WE PLACED HIM ON THE TRANSITION LIST BUT WE WANT HIM OUT AS OF THE END 
OF THE MONTH.  LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFO.  MP
Who he works for
What issue is
etc.,
