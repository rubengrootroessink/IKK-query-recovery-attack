John,

Happy New Year!!  I wish you and your family the best and as Dina puts
it...BUY LOW, SELL HIGH (lol).

I have a great deal of songs to send you.  Just look at the lists (you can
open it with Wordpad) and let me know wich ones you like or if you prefer I
will send them all to you.  Also, I wont be able to send them via e-mail
(too big in memory size).  Therefore, check to see if your IT group have an
IOmega Zip Drive (100 MB) so that I can mail the songs to you.

I have attached the copy of the mi2 theme song and a catalog of the
Corvette.
