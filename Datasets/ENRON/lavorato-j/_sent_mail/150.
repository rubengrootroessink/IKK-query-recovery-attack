John -

Again,  we are having "big time" systems issues.  While we are having the 
usual length of time issues (a few people were here past midnight last 
night), the issues that occured last night are much more serious than in the 
past.  The system brought through totally inaccurate information on a few 
books.  (Positions,  value,  etc.)  Luckily, these errors were all caught 
last night,  but if a less experienced person had been on those books,  it 
could have been a disaster.  (Traders getting incorrect positions and p&l and 
interest rate and credit getting incorrect numbers.)  I have contacted those 
in ERMS that need to be involved,  but I would appreciate it if you could 
provide additional support to this effort.

Thanks,

Jeff
