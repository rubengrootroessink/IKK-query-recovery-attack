John,

I am interested in a power options trading position at Enron.  I have a track
record of profitable options trading and market-making in illiquid markets,
and have also worked closely with Origination groups to design and evaluate
structured products for customers.  I attach my resume for your review and
would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and background
with you in person.  I can be reached at 214-812-8560 during the day and
214-891-1705 in the evening.

Regards,

Manu
