Subject: Approval for transfer to EBS

John:

My name is Husnain Mirza. I have been working for ENA as Senior Specialist.  
I work in Andrea Reed's group, and report to her through L'Sheryl Hudson.  On 
August 8th, on behalf of Andrea Reed, L'Sheryl Hudson told me that with the 
dissolution of CTG, Andrea's group would change significantly and that there 
would be  no growth opportunities for me in this group. I was told that I 
should look for opportunities and growth elsewhere. 

After talking to numerous people in Enron, I found someone who told me to go 
to EBS. In EBS I approached Paul Trieschman of HR and Larry Lawyer. Paul 
Trieschman said he would check in EBS and forward my resume to people who 
might be looking to fill in vacant positions. Larry sent me to Ravi 
Thuraisingham, who was looking for someone with telecom background. Ravi 
talked to Jim Fallon, who was also looking for someone with telecom 
background. 

My background in Williams Communications Group, Inc., and specifically 
working on Fibre build business plan and related subjects, like cost study of 
fibre capacity, provided a direct fit with the position that Ravi and Jim 
wanted to fill. Ravi, after asking what I had done at Williams 
Communications, went to discuss my background with Jim Fallon. In the 
afternoon he called and made me an offer to join EBS. I accepted the offer. 
He told me that the projects that I will be doing are about Fibre build.

Upon receiving the offer, I went to Andrea Reed and told her about the offer 
and the excellent fit that this position has with my telecom background.  I 
told her that this position gives me great opportunity to make contribution 
to Enron's broadband efforts. Andrea, knowing that there are no growth 
opportunities for me in her group,  said she fully supports my transfer to 
EBS. She has already called Paul Racicot and told him of her support for my 
transfer to EBS (Please see Andrea's email below).  

Jim Fallon and Paul Racicot, understandably, are very sensitive about my 
transfer to EBS. They want to finally check it with you and get your support 
for my transfer. Everything related to my transfer has been finalised, except 
that Jim and Paul want to hear directly from you and get your approval.  
Andrea Reed fully supports my transfer and has no concerns about it. I would 
appreciate if you could O'K my transfer to EBS. I do not want to miss this 
opportunity, and would like to start as soon as possible.

Regards,

Husnain Mirza

Husnain, I've already given him a call.  We will take care of it here at ENA 
so you can transfer to EBS.
