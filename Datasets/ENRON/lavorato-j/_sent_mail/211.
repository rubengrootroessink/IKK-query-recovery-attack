Can you make sure that the Toronto Office is not blowing their minds on 
costs.

I totally support having a separate marketing and trading team in Ontario to 
focus on the opening of that market.  However, with respect to creating a 
redundant physical system operation/real-time unit monitoring/dispatch 
function in Ontario, it simply does not make economic or logistical sense.  
With the integration of the  6 peaker plants into our operation and the 
associated IT support, control area operations, plant operations, hourly 
trading, and real-time monitoring system here in Houston, we could provide 
all the necessary tools and support personnel necessary to perform this 
function from Houston.   All the critical trading information would obviously 
be available to the Ontario office, yet they would not have to be burdened by 
the additional overhead to build a stand alone physical operation.

From my standpoint, it just doesn't make sense to re-create the physical 
capabilities the Houston office has developed over the past two years.  The 
Ontario guys are doing a great job and I like their aggressive attitude, 
however, rationale business decisions should still prevail.

Your thoughts?

Attached is the data you requested today.   The schematic detail requested 
can be found in the email attachment at the bottom of this email.  Please 
also contact Ed Baughman on the TIE proposal for dispatching, scheduling and 
trading services that was recently done to leverage of the existing Genco 
facilities and staff.

On the dedicated ring downs all work was co-ordinated by Darren Adamik 
(713-853-4764) if you require additional details.

Generally it will take 4 staff for a 24 hour operation plus one vacation/sick 
relief.  Depending on the complexity of the operation you will have to 
determine the level of industry expertise.  A good plan would be to hire a 
senior lead utility type and then bring on junior staff.  The quality and 
quantity of staff will likely be based on the value at risk and the 
complexity of dispatching these units. 

If you consider the operation critical a diesel and UPS will be required.

Plasma displays run $10,000 to $15,000 per display plus any switching/av 
equipment.

We have a PI consultant on contract that could be available for your PI 
project - typically $ 150.00 per hour plus travel and expenses.

The above assumes that no special hardware/software is required from The IMO 
to dispatch these units.

Art,

Please find attached my report on the PI installation at the ECP plants.  If 
all goes as expected, we should be wrapped up by September 1.  The total cost 
to date is approximately $75K with an additional $33K expected.  Please call 
if you have any questions.
