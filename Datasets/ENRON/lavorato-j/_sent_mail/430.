Subject: Friday Meeting on Dayrates

Just as a reminder to everyone, there is a meeting in John Lavorato's office 
this Friday June 2nd regarding Dayrates

John

Enclosed is the presentation that Keith MacIvor and I gave to Noble 
Drilling's CEO, Jim Day and Pride International's CEO, Paul Bragg, their CFO, 
Earl McNiel, and their COO, James Allen this morning 5/30.  Both sets of 
leaders were extremely interested in pursuing dayrate transactions with us.  
Both sets said that they believed this product would have a very positive 
impact of the drilling business.

Jim Day assigned us to his leading financial innovators, Mark May and Steve 
Manz.  Paul Bragg and Earl McNiel are wanting to sign an ISDA asap and begin 
discussions asap.

 I will be giving the same presentation to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, Jim 
Tisch this Thursday (in New York) and a "deal specific" presentation to the 
CFO of Chiles Offshore the same day.
