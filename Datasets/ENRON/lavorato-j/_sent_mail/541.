John, I thought I would send you a note to outline our conversation re. David 
Redmond.  Dave will return to the London office in late May.  In late 
February we will pinpoint the group/job that will best suit Dave and Enron.  
All  efforts will be made to get Dave an option trading related position.

Regards


John Lavorato
