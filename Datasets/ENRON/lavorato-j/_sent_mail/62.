Subject: Friday Trading Track interviews 37th floor 3 Allen Center

Please be advised that you will need to be at Three Allen Center, 37th Floor 
no later than 12:45 for the Trading Track interviews.  I have attached a 
preliminary schedule for your review.  We will be in the Dover Room at the 
Doubletee for the decision round.  The Dover Room is located on the first 
floor of the Doubletree and you need to be there no later than 5:15 pm.  I 
anticipate we should be finished with the reviews about 6:30 to 7:00 pm.  
Thanks again for all your help.  Ted
