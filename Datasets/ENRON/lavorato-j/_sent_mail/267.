The auction is now closed -- no more rounds will be run.  In round 70, there
were no new bids, no bid withdrawals, and no proactive waivers submitted.
In accordance with the auction rules, the Minister of Resource Development
will decide no later than Thursday, August 24 whether to accept all winning
bids or to reject all winning bids.  Names of standing high bidders will not
be revealed before the Minister's decision.
