I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list 
of agreed apon tasks.

1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we 
have huge business risk if it blows up. 

 -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to 
maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  
        (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds 
like it should be a high priority)

2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to 
long hours on the part of our back office staff.  

 -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to 
address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are 
expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add 
hardware and reduce the time problems.

3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately 
combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real 
time risk.
TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the 
traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by 
the               traders to meet their needs. 

 -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in 
consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to 
come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.

4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is 
leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made 
progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the 
next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.

5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin 
Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements 
deals and volume management deals in the east.

6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).

7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their 
books through an interface with Houston.  

 -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its 
worthwile to put servers in Portland.    

 -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering 
all his needs.
