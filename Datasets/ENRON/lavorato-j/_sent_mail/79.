The model looks great except when I changed an input and hit go it blew up.  
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  One thing that I would like changed is that 
I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last 
day.  So the role should happen on the second last day not the last day.  
Please change that if you can.
