As part of the info you should put together I thought it would be good to 
have the historic head count (for 1-2 years) by month and by level to try to 
get a sense of how many people we hire.  Might even need the number of hires 
and fires/resignations.  My thought is to try to figure out how difficult it 
would be to have a few committees to interview candidates before offers would 
be made.
