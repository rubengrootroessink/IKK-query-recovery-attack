Subject: Mark H. Slaughter information

John,
  In an attempt to keep you informed, Gary Hickerson is bringing in a 
gentleman by the name of Mark Slaughter to work on his desk in an 
Agribusiness Consultant role.  Mark will be on contract for a 6 month period 
and may be brought on full time pending his success.  His rate of pay is 
equivalent to $80k annually.  If  Enron breaks the contract within three 
months Mark will be paid a breakage fee of 20k.  If contract is broken after 
three months Mark will be paid the amount remaining under his agreement.   If 
Mark is hired full time during this contract there will be no associated fee 
involved. 
Feel free to contact me if there are any questions
