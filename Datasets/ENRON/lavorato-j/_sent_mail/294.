Veronica,

In the future, please send this information to me so that I can print it off

Subject: Authorized Trader Memo

I am resending the Authorized Trader memo to reflect that Sherriff is also 
responsible for Debt Trading.

 Please review the attachment and let me know if you have any changes or 
suggestions, sign and fax to Veronica Valdez at (713) 646-2194.  

Thanks,

Veronica for Ted Murphy
