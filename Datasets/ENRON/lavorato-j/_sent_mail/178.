Subject: Credit Issue

We have finalized our P&L for Q3.  On the last day of the quarter we had 
about a half dozen deals that were closed that credit still had not given us 
a number for.  We were hit with credit reserves for three deals on the last 
day of the quarter.  These deals were done more than a month ago and credit 
materially changed some of the reserve numbers at the last minute.  We still 
have not received credit numbers from three deals that were done in Q3.  What 
level of service should I expect from credit?

The P&L is not yet done for yesterday.  Our risk group was here until 
midnight.  Our systems were not working right.
