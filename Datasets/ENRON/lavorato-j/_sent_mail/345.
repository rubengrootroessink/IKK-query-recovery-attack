Please order John an ISDN line with the understanding that he would still 
like to receive DSL.

Subject: DSL Orders

DSL in your areas is exhausted which means SWB is not even taking any orders 
for that service at this time.  We can try ordering ISDN to see if we can 
arrange that service for you.  Please let us know either way if you would 
like ISDN or not.  Please reply to circuit.provisioning.

Thank you,

Garhett
