Please excuse Kim Hillis and Kay Chapman from SAP timekeeping class and 
provide them with the necessary tools to learn this at their desks.  I 
understand that with this dismissal that they will be required to learn it on 
their own. 

Kim Hillis is currently registered for the class on Thursday, June 29 and Kay 
Chapman had Beverly Stephens attend on her behalf.

Please provide them with a contact name in the event that they have any 
questions.
