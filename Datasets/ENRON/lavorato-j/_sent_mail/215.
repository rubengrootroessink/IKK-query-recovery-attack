I'm expecting more details from Bill re. Perry Gas but I'm quite pissed about 
this.  I will deal with my traders when I have the details.  On the Retail 
side, I think this is the problem in trying to set up a separate Wholesale 
trading group in retail which is clearly happening.  This wouldn't of 
happened it they were trading through us.

John,

As discussed today, I have attached a summary of ENA's credit exposure to 
Perry Gas Companies, Inc (approximately $1,800,000).  They have filed for 
bankruptcy on August 28, 2000.  It should also be noted that our July 
settlement was not offset by our purchases due to an apparent oversight by 
the Settlements group, resulting in an additional $678,000 of credit 
exposure.  EES's credit exposure is still being researched but is estimated 
to be over $5,900,000 of additional exposure.  We are working with EES to 
resolve these issues as well.

As I mentioned today, Perry Gas Companies, Inc. was not approved for credit 
on any of these transactions and was on our Credit Watch List.  This company 
was not an approved counterparty and was granted a zero credit line.  

We are still trying to get the list of trades and traders for the July 
transactions.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Bill
