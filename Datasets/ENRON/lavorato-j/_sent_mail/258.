John:

In the past couple weeks, Janelle Scheuer has been contacted about a couple 
job opportunities. Initially by someone on the crude desk offering her a job 
to head
their marketing group. Jeff Shankman followed up to encourage her to become a 
candidate for the job. Separately, Fred LaGrasta approached Janelle to ask if
she would be interested in coming back to work for him in Breslau's 
Industrial Group. 

My concern is  that none of these individuals provided me the courtesy to 
check if it would be appropriate to discuss job opportunities with Janelle. 
Given that she has been in power for only  5 months and is performing a 
critical role in our effort to increase deal flow, I will be in a bind if I 
loose her. Janelle did the right thing by divulging this information. I 
wanted you to be aware of this.

Thanks,   Ed
