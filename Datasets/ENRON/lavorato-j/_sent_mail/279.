Hi John:

I received your faxed guarantee offer.  We need the original copies of the 
guarantee offer sent to us by courier before takeover.  Also please make sure 
to have you signatures on the original copies witnessed.

I have spoken to Wayne Coultry and takeover date has tentatively been set for 
Wednesday August 23/00.

I have spoken to Angela, Len Wong's assistant and she is going to contact the 
contractor - Brad Askin to begin repairs on the property immediately.

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,  Jessica
