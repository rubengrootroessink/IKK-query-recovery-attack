I contacted him and he was interested.  We talked to Dave Ryan about him since they used to work together.  Dave didn't think he would be a very good fit here because Mr. Abrams is basically a radio guy.  Also, his current contract and non-compete restraints may be troublesome.  However, he does have extensive experience and is distinguished in his field.  We were going to keep him in mind but not actively persue him at this time.
