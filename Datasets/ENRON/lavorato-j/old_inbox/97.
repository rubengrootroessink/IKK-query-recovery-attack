I called again today and spoke with Valerie.  She stated that they are currently not expediting passports however she would send in a note requesting that it be sent to you ASAP.  She said that it is currently 20 business days to complete and send.  I did explain that this is urgent for your green card application (remember I also sent a letter with your application).  She said that she could not help.  I asked to speak with a Manager and that is when she sent a message expressing the urgency.

She did confirm that they have your passport information in their office.  I also sent to the necessary materials for them to overnight it back to you.

Sorry John.  If you would like to call them yourself, the number is 819-334-9500.
