Bob and his wife are flying in next Thursday.  Will you look at what you offered him the first time and let me know what you are willing to do for him to move to Houston.  Please reserve a time on Thursday or Friday to meet with him.  We will also need an HR rep for UBS to discuss benefits, etc.

Thanks,
Mike
