John,

I wanted to make sure that you saw the following.  I inquired about the visa issue and this is the response.

Karen:

Regarding Mr. Lavorato's I-94, it should remain in his old passport and he
should travel with both passports, until we can file for the change of
status and he obtains a new I-94.  I will be out tomorrow (Wednesday).  If
there are further questions, we can discuss on Thursday.
KInd regards,
Lynn
