Hello everyone.
 
My grandmother passed away and I will be going to Toronto to attend the funderal.  I will be back Wednesday night.  
 
Greg - can you take care of Ellen and Pushkar.  I gave them offers on Wednesday.  They were 50/50/50.  They didn't get an original bonus.  
 
Hunter - Sorry no weather interviews for me until Thursday.
 
All - I think we should send daily e-mails to all 600+ people with updates (ie when are we closing/trading etc).
