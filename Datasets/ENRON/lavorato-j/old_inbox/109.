John,
Are you in charge of sign ups? I know you are for commercial types, and I'm trying to figure out who decides how much I get paid in UBS world.  I have meeting with UBS this afternoon to discuss.  If possible, can you intercede for me and help me get more money (signing bonus and bump in salary, maybe even year contract?)..  Flat bid to current salary is very humbling, especially given market opportunities for my skill set.  

I appreciate everything you've done for this organization and if you are unable to intercede, I'll understand.

Thanks,
Frank
