John,

I am a Kellogg graduate, class of 97.  You spoke with me briefly one day at the MET when I was wearing a Kellogg shirt.  Be careful about that sort of thing in the future.  That is all it took to get me nominated to the speaker planning position.

Anyway, I have agreed to help organize the spring speakers for the Houston chapter of the Kellogg Alums and I am writing to ask if you would be available to make a presentation.  This would likely be a joint session with graduates of some of the other top b-schools. 

We recognize that you would not be able to speak about Enron, but wanted to try and get your views on the markets in general.

Please let me know if you think that this is something you would like to do.  

Thank you,
Michael
