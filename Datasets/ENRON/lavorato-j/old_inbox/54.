John/Louise

In checking some of the support areas after you left I discovered that letters for :

- Vuittonet Laura
- Hogan Irena
- Young Rebecca
- Moore Kevin
- Rangel Ina

had been put into the bundle for Wes and Perre ( not sure of spelling ) and they had pulled them as not being part of their group ( they show under the tab - Admins for Houston Commercial )

Collette was concerned that if we send them this will put us over headcount ?

I'll come by first thing tommorrow to follow up.
