John, I apologize for all the emails back and forth.  We had to make a 
revision on the last retroactive calculation (we called in the "big gun" - 
Laura Scott) and are confident that this is the definitive payment.  I've 
also attached a summary that Janice prepared outlining all payments received 
to date - hopefully, it will clear everything up.  Call if it requires 
further explanation.  (x6724)....

100,000.00 (Original Payment)  149,780.00
