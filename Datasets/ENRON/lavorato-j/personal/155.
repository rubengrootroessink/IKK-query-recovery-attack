John, apologies for taking so long in  congratulating both of you and little Michael on the arrival of the newest  member of the family. Hope every one, in particular the mom, they always have  the most work with new babies, is well.
As a secondary thought dceg continues to do well on  a profit basis. You'd never know it bu the share price. Ultimately the numbers  will do the talking and they are looking good again for the nfourth  quarter.
Hope all is well at Enron. Should I ask if you were  able to at least cash out on any of your options? Amazing how a company's  fortunes can quickly change.
Your Uncle Frank
