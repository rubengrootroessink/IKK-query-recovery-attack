Dear John:

I have discussed the attached letter with Phillip and wanted to forward this on to your attention.  I would like to get together to discuss this issue when you have a chance.  Phillip and I have had several discussions regarding my current interests over the last few weeks.  

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby
