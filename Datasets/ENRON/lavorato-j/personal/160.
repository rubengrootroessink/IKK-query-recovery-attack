Hey John,

I can't believe it - again, I just finished watching
lefty lose a major. Oh well, someday he'll win I
guess.  There was some good golf though, especially on
Saturday.

So, if you haven't figured it out yet, it's me, the
lefty from Canada.  How are things?

Sorry to bother you at work. I don't have your home
email or new phone number in Houston.

Anyhow, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions
about life in the US.  Yes, I finally accepted a job,
in Fairfax, Virginia, a suburb community about 15
miles west of Washington.  It is a multi-disciplinary
design firm, and I am going to be starting in the
first week of October. And the area seems to be really
nice, great golf, not much winter, great pro sports,
and hopefully lovely 'Americanan gals'!!!

I think I have almost everything under control thus
far, except I have a couple of questions that I
wouldn't mind your opinion on.

First, I want to select a bank just for simple
personal banking, cheques, withdrawls , etc.  In
Fairfax, the predominant one seems to be Bank of
America.  They also have SunTrust and United.  The
other ones (like Fleet, First Union etc.) don't seem
to be really located there much.
I guess I'm looking for a major bank to start off with
like the CIBC or Royal in Canada. Is Bank of America
OK. What do you think?

Secondly, (due to my Italian 'cheap' save money
attitude), I am looking for a VISA that collects air
miles. (In Canada here, I had CIBC Aerogold which was
excellent for Air Canada reward travels). I guess I am
looking for a gold/platinum card that is best for
flight miles.  I flew United when I went to the
interview to Washington, and I understand that United
has a Mileage Plus First Gold VISA.  Also, I have
found other cards including Delta Skymiles AMEX, US
Air Dividend Miles Platinum, Continental Platinum and
TWA Aviators Gold.  I guess ideally am I looking for
the best card that will allow me to accumulate points
to fly from Washington to Toronto (since that's where
most people I know live now).  I am also not to sure
which airlines are reputable that would fly into
Toronto.  Maybe you could tell me what card you guys
have, or which ones might be worth looking into.

Anyhow, I would really appreciate when you have a
chance sometime to drop me a line or give me a ring
(905)709-7970 with some of this info.

As for now, have a great rest of day at work.  Say
'hi' to Dina and Little 'Tiger'.  Hope all is well
with you guys.  Maybe I will get to see you more now
that it is not so far and so expensive to fly down
there.

Take care for now, JR.

P.S.  Yes there is another stadium in the world to see
a ball game other than Wrigley.  I saw Boston at
Cambden Yards last weekend and it was awesome.  What a
classic modern baseball stadium design. And the Ripken
mania stuff is nuts.  The Ribs in Baltimore are
amazing, just like wings in Buffalo. See you later.
