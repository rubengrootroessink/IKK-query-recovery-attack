Subject: Another 4Q Update
Hi all!! or Y'all (which ever you  prefer)
=20
Great summer, 3 weeks in Italy (tuscany) with my  wife and kids.  I love Tu=
scany.  Cannot wait to see the rest of  Italy and start getting into more o=
f Europe...next year.  Other than that  I went to my kid sisters baby's chr=
istening.  So weird to see my sister  that way, those of you with younger s=
ibs know what I mean.
=20
It seems, like so many others, the  entreprenuerial song is calling me...ag=
ain.  I had a lot of fun in  dot.com land, but I am certain that one has pl=
ayed itself out for  now.  Also, in all honesty, I think I will leave this =
technology stuff to  the rest of you.  I get it, but man...there are too ma=
ny ideas in each  sector for little ol' me to keep up with.
=20
So, I find it is a good time to get back to my  roots and what I was doing =
around the 5-yr reunion; LBOs.  This time I am  focusing on my true love, t=
urnarounds; the messier the better.  I have  set up a partnership.  Initial=
ly, my partners and I seek mfgs  ($5MM to $50MM) of products with ticket pr=
ices under $100 per unit sold, with  losses or breakeven performance.  They=
 need to be in the Midwest, and in  Greater Chicago if they are less than $=
10MM in rev.
=20
Example: this summer we bid on a $30MM mfg of  brass ingots (cost $25 bucks=
 an ingot altough sales where in the $100K plus  per order), with losses ro=
ughly of $3MM per year.  It had lots of  financiable assets and a core busi=
ness that was viable.  Management had  stopped paying attention to cash flo=
w and thereby ran the ship  aground.
=20
It does not have to be that mundane, but you get  the picture.
=20
So that sort of stuff should keep me real busy  for a while.  If you come a=
cross small/middle market companies with these  kinds of issues, drop me a =
line.  Especially, those of you in really big  companies with lots  of no-o=
ne-can-remember-why-we-bought-this-company-in-the-first-place  little divis=
ions.
=20
If you are in Chicago, drop me a line.  If  you are flying in or out of Chi=
cago, wave just before you land, you are just  over my house.
=20
Until next time...
