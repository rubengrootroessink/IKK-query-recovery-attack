Hey,

New Hockey season starts this Sunday.  We may need some more players on our
team.  Games start between 7:30pm and 9:30 pm every Sunday for about 10
weeks or so.  Cost is 250.00.  Let me know if you are interested.  If you
want to play less you may be able to split games with someone.

Love,

Scott
