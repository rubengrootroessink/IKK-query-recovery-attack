Hi, Tony Borelli the recruiting writer here. (the guy you just talked to)

Below I've pasted the text of your brief interview/profile blurb for the
Enron recruiting web site. It consists of a main section and a short
"callout quote" to be set apart from it, maybe in a different typeface.

Please review it ASAP, and reply to this email, either approving it as is
(which I would love) or listing any changes that I need to make. NOTE:
Please list any changes separately, rather than editing the text directly.

I ask that you focus on looking for any errors of fact, revelations of
proprietary information, statements that will genuinely make someone look
bad, or other such serious problems.

The informal style and tone, the general content, and the length have all
been predetermined, and they need to match all the other blurbs we're doing
for the site. So I'd ask that you not focus on those issues or change those
parameters, and that you avoid doing any wholesale rewriting unless you
think it's absolutely unavoidable.

Please be brave! Keep in mind that whole platoons of Enron communications
and legal specialists will review and edit everything carefully before the
public ever sees it. And of course, since this will appear only in web
format, even after it "goes live" it will never really be permanent.

Thanks for all your help!
--Tony

John Lavorato
Managing Director (trading and risk management)
Enron North America

I started in Calgary in 1995, building our Canadian natural gas and
electrical power trading operation from scratch, and I left as president. It
was absolutely awesome. I had the time of my life. I hired the people I
wanted, with very little supervision, back when gas and power trading was in
its infancy, and today we're the biggest market maker and risk manager
there. These days, as many people know, we're using that same expertise to
create liquid markets in many other products, from broadband capacity to
paper pulp. So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in
Canada-to help build revolutionary new businesses.

But what some people might not realize is that even in our established gas
and power trading operations-where we're by far the dominant player-it's
hugely interesting and complicated, with a million variables to figure out,
from the weather to the available storage capacity in Montana. You can't
ship natural gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like
other commodities. And it's not like trading bonds, where you sit around
waiting for the Fed. If you like solving incredibly complex problems, and
you're very good at it ... get down here! We need you!


<JOHN'S CALLOUT QUOTE>
Enron's not a place where you can hide-or where you'll be hidden. If you
can't get it done, you won't fit in. But if you can, and you work hard,
you'll get noticed, you'll excel, you'll get paid, and we're going to love
you.
