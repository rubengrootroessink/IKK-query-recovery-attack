This message is to all employees who are currently in the process for permanent residency (green card) through Enron.  Effective today, your primary contact for directing documents will be Margaret Daffin.  Margaret is located at 3AC2026A and her phone number is 713/345-5083.  I will continue conducting and managing the permanent residency sponsorship process, but will do so on a consulting basis.
