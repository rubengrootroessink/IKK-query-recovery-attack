Good Morning Mr. Lavorato,

I am e-mailing you to give you an update on the appraisal process.
Both appraisers went in to see the property on Friday June 16, 2000.  We are 
expecting one written report today and the other one tomorrow.  We should be 
in a position to give you your guarantee price by the middle of next week.

I was advise by Cendant Mobility that your spouse's first name is Dina.  
Please advise me if this is not the correct spelling of her name.  I will 
correct it in our system.   You can contact me by return e-mail at 
Pfournie@Royallepage2.com or by phone at 416-386-6028 or 1-800-410-2983 ext. 
6028
Since I'm not totally sure at this point if your family has already vacated 
the property in Calgary so I don't want to send any documents there.   I am 
attaching three documents to this e-mail so that you have them with you .

The first document is the offer information form and disclosure statement.  
Since this document forms part of the guaranteed offer,  and would ask you to 
please complete this document and return it to me by fax by Monday June 
26th.  My fax# is 416-448-6358.

The second document is a blank guarantee offer.   This document will be used 
in the event that you are able to negotiate a verbal agreement with a buyer 
prior to a guarantee price being established.
If this situation occurs, please insert the agreed upon price and sign the 
RLRS Offer,.  Return it by fax , along with the Power of Attorney which forms 
part of this package.
Once these documents are received by RLRS, we are in a legal position to sign 
an offer on your home showing RLRS as the vendor.

The last document is the amended sale program  procedures . This is the 
relocation program that has been approved by your company for your 
relocation. It outlines in detail the procedures to be followed under that 
program.
It is a program that has been designed by the I.R.S. and the U.S. relocation 
council to deal with the issues of relocation and taxable benefits.
One thing that I want to you to remember is that if you have an offer on your 
property,  you must negotiate it verbally and please do not signed nor 
initial anything on the offer.  Once you have come to a verbal agreement  
with a purchaser, Royal Lepage will sign that offer on your behalf.

You can contact me at the office between 8:00 to 4:00 or leave a voice mail 
message anytime.

I will be on vacation next week June 26th to June 30th. If you need 
assistance during that week please contact Jessica Desouza at 416-510-5764 or 
you can use the 800# and ask for ext. 5764.  Jessica will contact you next 
week with your guarantee price.

Could you also please e-mail me your mailing address where to courier your 
guaranteed offer.

Do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions

Thank you,

Patricia Fournier
Relocation Consultant
