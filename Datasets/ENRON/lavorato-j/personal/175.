Here is the project a little more refined. This was prepared by
Jeff Beale my partner in the project.

<font size=3D3 color=3D"#0000FF">Dear Greg, Eric, Addison:<br>
<br>
</font><font color=3D"#0000FF">Per my discussion with Bill Perkins
and Eric
last week, as a starting point to understand the Hermosa LNG
Project,
attached are some documents that we have prepared over the past few
months along with a paper from a recent LNG conference on "Offshore
LNG Unloading."=A0 I would hope this would begin to give you a
sense of the scope of the project.=A0 There are, of course, many
issues that need to be addressed.=A0 There has been substantial
front-end work performed on the relative feasibility of using
existing
offshore pipeline infrastructure in support of importing LNG into
California.=A0 <br>
<br>
Key aspects of the Hermosa project are:<br>
<br>
</font><font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>There is an
existing
(unused) gas pipeline extending from the Hermosa petroleum
platform that
can be tied into Sempra=92s onshore existing intrastate gas pipeline
infrastructure that can carry 400 mmscfd.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>There is currently
adequate
and idle equipment that could be relocated to provide LNG import
rates of
400 mmscfd.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>A single ship
unloading pump
can readily and continuously supply LNG at a rate equivalent to 400
mmscfd.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>California is the
prime
target for increased natural gas supply.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>Once importation is
initiated through Hermosa, the precedent has been set to construct
a
permanent, larger floating LNG import terminal<br>
<br>
Some of the major areas of concern that are covered with this set
of
attachments include:<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">
<dl>
<dd>=A8 </font>Ability to offload from LNG ship to an existing oil
platform.<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">
<dd>=A8 </font>=93Quick Start=94 capability, i.e., timetable when
compared to
=93traditional=94 LNG terminal, assuming such a terminal could be
permitted.<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">
<dd>=A8 </font>Costs to initiate LNG
importation<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">
<dd>=A8 </font>Time-table to initiate LNG
importation<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">
<dd>=A8 </font>Long term plans, i.e., how can =93quick start=94 be
transitioned
into less operator-intensive operation.<br>
<br>

</dl>Please contact me with any questions you may have about the
attached
as it no doubt will not address all questions that might have.=A0
