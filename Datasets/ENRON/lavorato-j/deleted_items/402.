Janie Tholt called Dynegy because of the .12 cent spread between SJ EOL and SJ ICE.  The Trader at Dynegy said that they were busy training two schedulers to trade cash, and that arbing the market was not the message they wanted to send to them.  They would like to focus on the "Big Picture" instead.
