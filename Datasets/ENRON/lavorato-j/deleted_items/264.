 Congrats. on the young Michael!  That must be fantastic...my fiance is from Houston and we go up to Spring periodically to visit her folks and I would love to hook up with you and the family if possible on one of those trips...yes, it is a common problem for traders - my dad eventually demoted himself back to the action - I think he said something about executive management draining the life blood from his veins?
I am spending a lot of time in Detroit on our latest acquisition...it is looking like another home run...I will attach the press release..
Congrats on all the successes!  I am glad things are so well for you... 
Best regards, 
Ross

   John baby, 
   What are you up to?  Are you in Houston?  If so, we should touch base 
@ 
   some point.  Still with Enron?  Do you run the company yet?  Are you 
   responsible for my pricing at the pump?  I have been back in Dallas 
   since '95 and am working with The Carlyle Group...getting married in 
   August...you? 
   Hope all is well. 
   Best regards,
