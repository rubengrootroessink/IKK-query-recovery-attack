  Set for June Completion<br>
  Bush's National Energy Policy Promotes Use of Biodiesel</b></font></p>
<p>ONTARIO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 19, 2001--Southern States Power Company,
  Inc. (OTCBB:<a href="http://www.stock-quotes.com/clienttools/quotes.asp?ticker=SSPC&exchange=OBB&link=CB0529&textcolortop=FFFFFF&tblbgcolor=FFFFFF&width=450&colorall=FOFOFO&chartbgcolor=FFFFFF&color=CB0529&bgcolor=WHITE&fontsizetop=4&chart=YES&showquote=YES&background=none">SSPC</a>
  - news) announced Saturday that the company's Coachella Valley Biodiesel Production
  Facility is near completion and scheduled to begin producing fuel on June 11,
  2001. The final stages of construction are ongoing, and photographs of the facility
  have been posted on the company's website, <a href="http://www.sspowerco.com">www.sspowerco.com</a>.
  The addition of biodiesel from the Coachella facility will allow the company
  to fulfill the growing number of orders it is receiving for its OXyG Biodiesel
  Fuel, including the most recent to supply backup power to the University of
  California, Riverside. Southern States Power Company is receiving increased
  national exposure in the wake of the newly released National Energy Policy which
  emphasizes the further development of alternative fuels. </p>
<p>The Coachella Valley Biodiesel Production Facility is designed to initially
  produce 10 million gallons of fuel annually, with plans to expand capacity in
  the future. Southern States Power Company is currently providing biodiesel fuel
  to a growing number of clients, including Deer Valley Unified School District,
  the largest school district in Arizona and Rockland Materials, a cement company
  with a fleet of over 100 trucks. The contract to supply biodiesel to the University
  of California, Riverside marks Southern States Power Company's entry into stationary
  power generation, a market that is rapidly expanding in California and other
  areas of the United States. As Southern States Power Company signs more biodiesel
  contracts, the company anticipates building production plants across the country
  to meet an increasing demand. </p>
<p>In the new National Energy Policy unveiled by President George W. Bush last
  week, the emphasis placed on more widespread use of alternative fuels, such
  as biodiesel, has created even greater interest in Southern States Power Company's
  OXyG Biodiesel Blend. The Report of the National Energy Policy Development Group
  includes several recommendations regarding cleaner, renewable fuels which will
  tap the vast potential for biodiesel in the generation of electricity and to
  power a wide variety of motor vehicles. </p>
<p>Lawrence W. Taggart, President and CEO of Southern States Power Company commented,
  ``The Coachella Valley Production Facility represents a significant step forward
  in the growth of the company. This is just the first of a number of facilities
  that Southern States Power Company plans to build. It is heartening to see the
  federal government recognizing the importance that alternative fuel, particularly
  biodiesel, will play in the energy future of the United States.'' </p>
<p><b>The Company </b></p>
<p>The primary focus of Southern States Power Company, Inc. is to develop, produce
  and distribute alternative fuels, particularly biofuel, for use by consumers
  and commercial businesses. While the demand for alternative fuels is great,
  there are few producers ready to meet the growing need. </p>
<p>There are nearly 27 billion gallons of diesel consumed annually in the United
  States alone, and an additional volume is consumed internationally. It is the
  goal of the United States Department of Energy that 30% of petroleum based motor
  fuel be replaced by alternative fuels by the year 2010. Federal and state fleets
  are mandated to use up to 75% domestically produced alternative fuels. </p>
<p>Southern States Power is poised to capture a significant portion of the rapidly
  expanding biodiesel market through an aggressive marketing plan as well as contacts
  in government, business and industry. Tightening clean air standards and growing
  fossil fuel costs are forcing private commercial fleets to look toward alternative
  fuel products. Major biodiesel initiatives have been passed in Arizona, Ohio,
  New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware and Iowa. More information can be found at the
  company's website: <a href="http://www.sspowerco.com">www.sspowerco.com</a>.
