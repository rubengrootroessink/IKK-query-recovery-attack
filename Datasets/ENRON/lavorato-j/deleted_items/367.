On Thursday, May 17th, senior executives with Woodside Petroleum Australian=
 headquarters will be in Enron's offices to discuss their company and explo=
re possible opportunities with Enron.  Woodside is the largest E&P company =
in Australia.   Enron was approached a couple of weeks ago by Woodside's Ho=
uston representatives regarding acquisition of oil and gas assets currently=
 managed by ECR.  They also requested a meeting at a senior level to discus=
s other opportunities as well since their Australian execs were visiting Ho=
uston this week.  The agenda below was developed with input from Woodside's=
 Houston representatives.  Woodside is interested in spending $1B on domest=
ic US acquisitions.  They are also a large player in the LNG and natural ga=
s markets in Australia. It appears that there are several areas where Enron=
 and Woodside could interact.  Enron has attempted to do some LNG business =
with Woodside recently.  They do not seem to be fully aware of Enron's dome=
stic or its global presence.  A goal of this meeting is to address this unf=
amiliarity.  I have attached briefing materials on Woodside for your review=
.  Hard copies of these materials are available upon request.  Special than=
ks to David Mims for his input.  If there are any other Enron personnel tha=
t should meet with Woodside on Thursday, please let me know.  Also please c=
irculate this email to anyone that should be advised of this meeting or cou=
ld benefit from the materials.
