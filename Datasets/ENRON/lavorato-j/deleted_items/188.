John,

I work with Wade Stubblefield on Project Phoenix (contract analysis project). Wade suggested I set you up in our contract analysis database. Attached is an e-mail with a link to the database and instructions on how to log on. You have been set up in the system as a user. Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,
Misty

Subject:	Contract Analysis Database Instructions

As you may recall, a database has been developed for the contract analysis team. This database will allow the team to house the results of their analysis and  provide status reports. You will receive an e-mail next Tuesday with a link and instructions to the database. 

A 15-30 minute database demo will be given next Wednesday morning, 5/30/01, at 10:00am in 3125b. 

Please forward this to anyone I inadvertently left off.

Thanks,
Misty
