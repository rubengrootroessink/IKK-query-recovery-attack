Sumas has been priced flat or weaker to AECO, so there  has been less gas going North from Stanfield and less gas hitting Sumas because of the outage. There was also
a restriction for IT shippers: they were forced to take the IT gas out (about 800 mmcf) by today, so more gas may go in in the next few days, although there is not much pace left. We will get back with a more elaborate answer later this morning.

If the gas isn't going into Jackson, where is it going.
