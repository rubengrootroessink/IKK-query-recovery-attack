John,
I haven't spoken to you in a while and trust that your off to another strong year and that your family is well settled in Houston.  As you may have heard, I have spent the last year in Japan with Global Mkts trying to help kickstart an fx and interest rate trading operation that would tie this region into our global operation. 

Something has arisen personally and wanted to ask you in confidence of any potential opportunities that you may be aware of in Canada for a trading and/or origination role, perhaps in the next 2-5 months time.  My wife is keen to relocate near her family in Montreal, and so ideally I am wondering if you are aware of any needs that Rob Milnthorp, David Delainey, or yourself may have in that area, be it in metals, power, gas etc. I am aware of a satellite metals office in Montreal under a Director named Jean Michaud, as well as the recent Quebec City paper mill acquisition but am not aware of any other activities which we are involved with in that region. 

Thanks for your time, John

Sincerely,
Darren
