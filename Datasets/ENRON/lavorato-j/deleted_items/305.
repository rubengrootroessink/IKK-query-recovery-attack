Dan,  Attached is the electronic version of the contract I gave you a copy =
of earlier.  Note that all EES CA residential customers should be under thi=
s contract.  However, the residential customers acquired through the PG&E E=
nergy Services deal will be under a different contract form.  Legal should =
have copies of the PG&E ES contracts, and Deborah Culver or Jim Keller woul=
d probably be the best contacts.

Vicki,  I know Jim has pulled copy of the contract, but I don't believe I w=

Thanks,

See below.  Do you already have this info pulled together and if so,  can y=

Several questions I would like more information on so that we can figure ou=
t how to return our residential customers to utility service:

1)  Vicki - can someone on your staff pull a copy of what we have sent cust=
omers describing our commitment to them?  Or what did they sign and send ba=
ck to us? =20
I am interested in the pricing and the terms of the deal. =20

2)  Evan - is it possible to get a copy of a bill that we send to a residen=
tial customer just to see what one looks like.
Evan - can you also tell me if there is anything difficult for the resident=
ial customers in being switched back?  What should they expect to see?  Wil=
l their bill be messed up for a while?  Are there procedural things that ne=
ed to change?  How long does it take?  What might the new bill look like? =
=20

3)  Lamar - could you have someone validate the position we have in the boo=
k (PV volume and dollar exposure - pre and post rate increase)

4)  Peggy / Beth - can we meet and brainstorm how to communicate our "good =
bye" to these customers.  One idea:  perhaps we could ask Devon to help us =
send residential customers a letter showing them 100 ways to reduce their e=
nergy bill by changing their behavior or spending less than $100 at Home De=
pot on energy conservation enablers.  Then, as part of our good by, we coul=
d send them a $100 gift certificate to Home Depot.  This, along with a clea=
r communication on what to expect in their billing cycle and what they migh=
t expect from the utility.  - our message might be?: " we have always been =
able to price differently than the utility, but due to market conditions we=
 really aren't going to be able to maintain that "pricing advantage" that y=
ou have enjoyed for the last several years.  Since our company is based on =
helping our customers create extra value, and since we can't find any extra=
 value, we will be moving you back to utility service.  As we go, don't let=
 it be said that we aren't always thinking about creating extra value, so h=
ere are 100 ideas and a $100 dollar certificate to home depot.  Just implem=
enenting 10 of these ideas could reduce your energy bill by 25%.  In the en=
d, lower the overall cost of energy is what it is all about.  As we get new=
 ideas, we'll be in touch....."
Just an example...but something like that....

5)  Carol:  could you schedule a meeting for us to review this stuff say Tu=
esday? =20

Please email ideas or comments prior to the meeting.  Vicki, if we have the=
 info from #1, I am not sure you or an associate need to attend.  I think E=
van, someone from project Golden Bear, Peggy and/or Beth, and Evan. =20

Thanks all.
