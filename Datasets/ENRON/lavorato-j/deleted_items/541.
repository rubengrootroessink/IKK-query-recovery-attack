John-
Probably don't have time to respond to the message, but hope you are
weathering this storm ok.  Call me if you have some time or need to blow off
some steam.

-Bill

PS-If you are going to be back east in the spring, let me know so we can tee
it up at Somerset Hills, something tells me you may need a break.
