Dave,

FYI -- I have been working with Scott Mills from Sally Beck's group developing a recommendation to improve the EES/EWS information gap that exist around billing and flash-to-actuals.  Scott and I are meeting with Sally on Monday to walk through our suggestions.

The attached chart outlines a 1st cut at functional roles and responsibilities -- Scott and I will continue to evolve that document as we dig deeper.

 

Also, our team within the Services Group has developed an initiative to anticipate the needs of EWS to get a head-start on getting EWS the information it needs.  The e-mail below outlines that agenda.  We'll change/amend that effort once EWS gives us direction on frequency/format of the information.

After we meet with Sally on Monday -- I'll give you a follow-up briefing.  If you have any question -- please give me a call.

Thanks,

Evan

Here's my plan to get Risk the "actuals".  
We will manhandle this thing into reality.
