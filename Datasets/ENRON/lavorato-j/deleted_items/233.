John, we have factored the additional $6M in costs into the Q2 budget to  ensure complete coverage of the EES risk group costs.   As per our earlier discussion, I would like to schedule the risk group into the EES PRC. It might be helpful to have you participate to get a better handle on some of the people and iniatives going on in EES.  I am also working the risk group bonus costs into the EES plan.  We are planning on killing the sales incentive plan next week.  Is there a better name for your group than the EES risk group? Spoke to Haedicke about his concerns asked him to give me proposal that advances the business independent of people and ENA/EES regular politics. He said he would have that together Friday.  Lets discuss.

Working on the note for review and comment .....  

Regards
Delainey
