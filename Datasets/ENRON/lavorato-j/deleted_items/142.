Guys, we are bringing through a VP candidate for your review.

Her name is Faye Worthy.  She has a great sales history in the energy industry and I think can really help us in the franchise market (ie) McDonalds, Safeway, Starbucks, Motel 6, etc.

I would really appreciate you spending a little time with her.   I will forward her resume.

Thanks
Dave
