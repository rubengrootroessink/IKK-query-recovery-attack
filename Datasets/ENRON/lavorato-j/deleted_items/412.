John,
You agreed to the original request below, I received a request from Jill Zively today for 4 more desks for the mid-market group below.  This will completely consume the 36 desks Don was allocated.  

Please advise.  They want to move on Nov. 30.

Thanks,
Tammy

Tammy, we need to be sure that the 4 sales folks sitting at the EES Gas Desk are also moved along with the rest of the desk to the new building. These guys are responsible for rollover deals/retail "mid-market"-type transactions, etc. and need to be sitting with our gas desk. If there is any issue with this, call me.

Thanks.
