One of the proposals under review with the Apag?o team is to allow the B and A costumers to access the Mae and transact their "contracted energy" after their respective 20-25% reduction targets.  The MAE and the distributors do not have the systems in place to deal  with over 1,800,000 customers in the entire system. Elektro alone has close to 150000 customers in this class.    This can be a tremendous oportunity for Enron on Line to take off.  Remi could you review and prepare an action plan urgently.  These measures are targeted to be released next week.
