John and Louise,

After Saturday's meeting, Tim and I felt we should more concisely describe our thoughts on Bonus Plan and Key Employee Retention.  There is a lot of angry noise in Portland, but we believe that a plan similar to the attachment would work here.  We have not discussed this with the other Saturday participants.  We are prepared to discuss at your convenience.

Regards,

Chris
