John,

The rooms will be available in the morning.  One room has 2 PC's set up, a printer and a fax and a lucent phone.  The other room has 2 pc's, a polycom and a lucent phone and marker board.  The copiers on the floor are functioning.  The trading desks we discussed have live lucent phones on them and the numbers will be on the phones so they can be given out if necessary.  If we need to have pc's installed at those desks, we can do that later. 

I will walk over first thing and make sure everything is functioning and gather the phone numbers.  

Tammy
