Watch me carefully Joseph, as I snatch that bird from your hand, fry it up, devour it along
with some beer, and proceed to fall asleep with bird bones on my chest.  In other words, NO
DEAL!!!  Dem rubles are mine, sir!!

I logged on to our pool today for the very first time, and low and =

derriere, only a few points back. What makes this race to the finish =
particularly exciting is the fact that the only differentiation left =
between Chris and I is that I have Jason Arnott and Rob Blake. Also, =
Chris has Brodeur and I have Roy.=20

In other words, I've got Don Hedley shitting himself! I know he's =
already blown the money we entrusted him with but that money's mine!! =
But, I tell you what Chris. If you respond to me within ONE HOUR of this =
e-mail, I will agree to split the winnings (not including the $20 =
side-bet McConvey will owe me) 50-50 with you, but only if you agree to =
concede right now!!!!

Remember, a bird in the hand............
