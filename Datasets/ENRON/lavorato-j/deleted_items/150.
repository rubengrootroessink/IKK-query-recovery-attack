The network security group on EB34 just completed re-building
your Nortel router.  There were some filters that look like they
were causing the intermittant connectivity issues to non-Intranet
sites like www.enrononline.com <http://www.enrononline.com>
 
Part of it may have been the previous efforts to allow access for
you to the <http://ersys.corp.enron.com> website
 
In any case, you now have NetScape on both home machines,
and the next time you can bring the Compaq Armada laptop in
to the office -- Randy and I will make one more change that
will allow NetScape Communicator to "behave" at all sites.
 
There is not enough time to finish that here today, and there is
a 'profile' issue for your login ID that will not allow NetScape to
run at all until Information Risk Management and App-Integration
can see what is happening when it loads.
 
Have a good trip!
