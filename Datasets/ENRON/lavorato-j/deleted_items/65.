John,

From all the information I am gathering, the Canadian gas curves should be out by 4:00 Houston time.  Kathy (Reeves) said the power curves should follow 30 minutes after the gas curves.  After talking with Phillip Love who is the Central Risk lead, it seems the traders are always away from their desks when it's time to load curves.  The usual response from the risk people is "we can't find the trader" when we are inquiring about the curve load.  

Any help you could give us would be GREATLY appreciated!

Thanks.

K.
