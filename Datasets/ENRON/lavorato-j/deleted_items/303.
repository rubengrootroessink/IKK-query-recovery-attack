Subject:	Meeting



Please plan on attending a meeting at 10am Thursday morning June 7 to follow-up on our previous discussions regarding the EES contract reviews.  The goal will be to discuss everyone's progress to date and exchange feedback on the Contract Database, along with discussing the broader goals and process of completing review of the entire contract list.  

As you may have seen from the latest Project Status Report the contracts have been proiritized in an attempt to focus our efforts on the higher impact relationships.  We should begin to establish timelines for these agreements and discuss expectations for the deliverable product.

I will follow-up with the location of the meeting but wanted to go ahead and reserve the time with everyone.
