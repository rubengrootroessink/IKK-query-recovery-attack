John,

I know you have heard this from Tim, and I know you did not ask me, but...morale is pretty low because of the stock price, EES, EBS, litigation, etc. I think it makes sense to pay more $ to keep the rest of Tim's uncontracted team.  

On my side, most of my key people are under contract already - originators dont negotiate as well as traders.  

Regards,

Chris
