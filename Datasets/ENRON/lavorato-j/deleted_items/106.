John

fyi - I'll call him this afternoon/evening and get his feedback and work with Kim on getting him in to close this down - Whalley has asked to meet him when he comes in.

Do you want to see him again ?

	I had a great visit with Eddie Rietze last night.  We spent about 3 hours together.  I think we should definately pursue him.
He is interested talking further.  We will probably need to meet with him during the evening.  Please let me know if I need to do 
anything to proceed.  I indicated to Eddie that you would be contacting him to set an interview schedule.

thanks,

Scott
