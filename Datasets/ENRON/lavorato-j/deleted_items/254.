Yes  Chris...we did administer a frequent flyer, V.I.P. program for them, but they  cancelled the contract with us when a "rouge" hued young man scrapped his pink,  sun burnt nose on the seat in front of him whilst flying through some  turbulence.  The giant scab resulted in several plastic surgeries and never  really healed.  Their insurance premiums went through the roof and as a  result, they cancelled our program.
 
I am  now working on a program for Canada 3000 - 1 free chiropractic adjustment  for every 15 minutes of flying time - hoping to close this one  soon!
 
Just  an FYI...
