John,

The timeline is as follows :

1.  Spoke with Nowlan this past Friday, he agreed to pay us this week.  As such, I had Carol Carter contact Scott Earnest, his book person, to receive monies.
2.  Carol called me yesterday and informed me that Scott would not be sending the money and that Nowlan would be calling me.
3.  I left a message with Nowlan yesterday asking him to contact me.
4.  We had our conversation regarding the P&L resulting from the Formosa deal.

I have cc'd all relevant parties.

Regards, Mrha
