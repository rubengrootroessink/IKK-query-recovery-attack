Hi,

The ICE wishes to remind all our oil customers of the changes to the WTI
swap contracts.  Below are the two previous emails delivered on that topic.

First email from Tuesday;

As discussed with the users, we have decided to replace our current WTI swap
contracts by the WTI bullet swap contracts for the first four months
forward. To avoid any confusion between the two markets, we are going to
remove the current contracts (for the first four months forward) and add the
new ones on Thursday evening. We will remove the first three monthly time
spread contracts as well. The quarterly and yearly WTI swaps contracts will
remain the same.
We will keep the WTI/Brent, the Heating oil 1st line crack, the USGC heating
oil crack, the fuel 1% NY Harbour crack, the USGC Conventional Unleaded 87
crack and the Unleaded 1st line crack markets as they are now, but we will
not have the legging functionality for the first four nearby months'
contracts.

We plan to add:
- the first four months forward contracts
- the first three time spread contracts
- the Dec Red Dec contract
These contracts will be available for trading on Friday, May 18th.

If you want to add these contracts to your portfolio:
- go to Admin / Manage Portfolios,
- select the portfolio you want to add these contracts to,
- select Oil for "Market", Crude for "Products" (or Crude Spread for the
time spread contracts) and WTI Bullet swap for "Hub".

The contract will be settled on the penultimate scheduled trading day of the
WTI light Crude futures contract as published by the NYMEX for the delivery
month.

Second email from Wednesday;

	Following the e-mail you received Tuesday concerning the new WTI
bullet swap contracts, we would like to summarize what we have done on the
ICE system Tuesday evening:

		-Deleted WTI monthly time spreads
		-Deleted WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with
legging)
		-Deleted 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with
legging)

		-Added WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with NO
legging)
		-Added 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with NO
legging)

	Unfortunately the WTI/Brent and the 1% NYH Fuel Oil Crack contracts
(with the legging functionality) have been removed from your portfolios. You
will need to add 	the first four nearby months' contracts to your
portfolios by going to Admin / Manage Portfolios / Edit your portfolio....

We would like to thank you for your support and your help.
