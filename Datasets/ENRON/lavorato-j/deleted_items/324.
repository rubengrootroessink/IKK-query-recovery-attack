John, I had lunch with Kevin and I'm 100% on board with the concept and the=
 chance for an expanded scope for Special Assets under an Enron Corp. umbre=
lla.  I think I will work well with Kevin.  I am sorry to leave ENA though.=
  I am sincere in complimenting you and Louise on the progress you are maki=
ng in a short time period.

As I mentioned this morning I had scheduled a Wednesday meeting to brief yo=
u on a new business idea for Special Assets...Enron Executive Services.  Gi=
ven this change and the demands upon your schedule you may prefer not to pr=
oceed with this session--although I will send you the presentation in any e=
vent.  There is one issue, however,  that I need some guidance and perhaps =
your help.  Next week we will be in Spain meeting with governmental and pro=
vincial development agencies exploring the feasbility of providing services=
 (on a fee basis) for evaluating and preparing projects for presentation to=
 developers and capital providers.  Stature and titles tend to be important=
 in these international relationship introductions.  In other companies bef=
ore coming to Enron what I've done in these cases is set up a shell company=
 and assign senior officer titles to the members of that project.  We sugge=
sted this to legal, i.e. a shell company with no assets, who have indicated=
 someone would need to approve using a non-standard officer slate.  Is this=
 something you can approve?  Thanks.  Dick.
