John,
	Now that I've healed from the 175 mile biking experience, I wanted to thank you for your generous donation put towards the sponsorship of my MS-150 Houston-Austin bicycle ride.  It was much appreciated, and the money all goes to a good and worthy cause.  (Contrary to my initial gut impulse, the money did not go to the "Scott Tholan New Bike Fund").  
	Seriously though, thanks for your support.  Next year you ride too.  
	

--Scott 

PS  I recently sent in your check, and it should be deposited by the MS organization in the next several days.
