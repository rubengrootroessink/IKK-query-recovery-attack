I would welcome your participation.  Brad Snyder who is working in Jeff Ade=
r's group will also be attending.  Jim Wood originally agreed to go and I a=
m trying to confirm his attendance as well.  A few others in sales have als=
o expressed an interest and so we still need to assemble the team.  The ite=
ms you listed can all be covered.  The purpose of the meeting was to see if=
 we could put together a deal that would allow AEP to provide us with whole=
sale power as an interim solution to our inability to do physical deals.  A=
lternatively, if we can work with AEP to figure out a way to do our own del=
ivery, so much the better.  I view this as a stop gap measure to get us ent=
ry into the market while working on the RTO for a permanent solution.  Afte=
r we see how things go with AEP, the thought was for me to contact Cinergy =
to arrange for similar discussions.  As you know, Cinergy also has decent s=
hopping credits (although not quite as good as AEP) that are available cont=
ingent on physical delivery. =20

I am attaching for your review the summary I prepared for AEP on the scope =
of our meeting.  I am planning the meeting for 2:00pm.  Logistical details =
to follow.

I would like to go to AEP on the 7th.  Their egos may not allow them to neg=
otiate as fairly with me at the table (due to wholesale side) but I really =
need to get in front of these utilities in person to understand what obstac=
les we will face in the physical delivery world.  =20

I am still a novice on these issues but I would like to achieve the folloow=
ing on the physical side, some of which may already exist.  Your comments w=
ould be helpful.

Ability to aggregate customers into pool so that we can serve hourly load m=
ore effectively
Would like for AEP to review our aggregated customer list and provide us wi=
th day ahead and hourly load forecasts so that we know how many Mw to deliv=
er each hour
Pre-determined energy imbalance service=20
Pre-determined ancillary fees
Pricing Incentives for us to serve more load
Basic walk-through of standard protocol necessary to serve load physically

These are my quick thoughts.  Kevin, do you have any further thoughts.

Thanks,
Rogers

AEP has agreed to meet with us to discuss providing us with wholesale gener=
ation.  The meeting is tentatively set for June 7th.  They would like an it=
emized list or agenda of what we want to discuss so that they can have the =
right people present.  Andy Patterson, who handles AEP's retail market acti=
vity transferred the matter to George Rooney in Marketing and Origination.
