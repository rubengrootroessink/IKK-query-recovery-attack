I'm not sure that we have enough candidates to bother.

John,

To ensure a consistent approach with the previous trading track interviews, we will shcedule a dinner the night before the interviews (Tuesday, 29th May).      Your entire Interview/Management Team will be invited (24 people).

I trust that you are available/happy for us to proceed on this.

Karen.
