FYI.  John, you said to smother you with e-mails so you could understand what was going on so just let me know if I am overdoing it.

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?
