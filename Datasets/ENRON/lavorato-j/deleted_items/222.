Another (small) deal closed.  Congrats to Marcelo.  We'll book the position once the contract is signed.

Subject:	PCH deal verbally closed

After one month of negotiations, we received today a verbal closing from PCH Salto Lobo, under the following conditions:

plant location	: Brotas (SP) - CPFL territory
power amount	: up to 1.5 MW (interruptible)
pricing and term: 
Jan 02 - Dec 03	: R$90/MWh
Jan 04 - Dec 06	: R$67/MWh
delivery point	: SE center of gravity (Salto Lobo pays for T&D and we take the T losses)

Karla, since this deal will fall under the non-firm, non-MAE member type of structure, I'll take the initiative to fill the draft contract and send you for legal approval.

I would like to stress the key role that Elio Kumoto played on this deal. The deal originally came to Enron through him and Elio actively participated on the negotiation and technical assessment of the plant.

Rds,

Marcelo
