Dear Mr. Lavorato,

I received your contact details from Dave Delainey and he suggested that we
speak regarding this initiative. I am compiling a report entitled The Impact
of Competition with PricewaterhouseCoopers Energy Practice that examines
business solutions within the utilities sector. Essentially, the report is
designed to inform senior executives with energy management responsibility
throughout the private sector on how to enhance their effectiveness. The
project is in its second phase and you can see round one on the associated
web-site, www.utilitiesproject.com.

I would like to schedule a call with you, so we can speak about this
initiative and your potential involvement. Thank you for your time and I
look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,


Martin Grealis
