Michael -

Are these changes in the forward volumes (unrealized losses).  Can you explain the reason for these adjustments?  How much more exists that we need to address?

Thanks,
Rogers

We have re-priced Suiza, Packaged Ice, and Arch of Chicago with updated volume information from our billing system.  The impact is as follows:

Thank you.

Best regards,
