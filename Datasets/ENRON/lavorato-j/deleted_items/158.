> John,
>
> Jeff Feig showed me the Enron online site and recommended I contact you
> with specific questions.
> Basically I was hoping to speak with one of your technical people about
> the tools or architecture
> you used in implementing the site.
>
> Some aspects of the site that I would like to know about are:
>
> What you used for the personalization features? Was it BEA, Apache's
> Jetspeed/Turbine, or something "home-grown"
> What tools you used for the Flash components?
> Why you decided on Flash over Java applets?
> How stable and straight forward has the flash client implementation been?
>
> I understand if you deem the answers as trade secrets, but any insight
> into your experiences would be appreciated.
> Thanks for any help you can provide. You can contact me at 212-723-1366.

> Regards,
