Are you referring to the EOP origination?  IT was working on the issue last night and I'll follow up this morning to see what the resolution was.  That information did not roll into the DPR.

Jeff -

I think that new deal info may have even rolled into the DPR.  can you check and could you get us a revised new deal report with accurate p&l.
