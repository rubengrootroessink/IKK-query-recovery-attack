John,

I surveyed the group.  In general, people are fine but we should ask for a bit more.  This should apply to US only as Milnthorp has already cut a separate deal with Janet.

EES Proposed that they own all SIC Codes EXCEPT the following:

Mining
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper Manufacturing
Chemical Manufacturing
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
Fertilizer Industry
Rail Transportation

In our discussion with Dave, we suggested and he agreed that Primary Metals should be added

In discussions with the different regions:

ENA should add: 
Refining 
Grain Processing - Baughman and Luce
Meat Processing - Luce
Cement Manufacturing - Luce 
Auto Manufacturing - Luce, Baughman
Aerospace Manufacturing - Tycholiz, Baughman
Heavy Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (caterpillar, john deere) - Baughman
Paper Manufacturing should include - pulp, board, lumber, etc.
Glass Manufacturing - Luce ( I suspect Dave will resist this because of their Owens Corning deals)


Let me know if there is anything else I should do.

Chris
