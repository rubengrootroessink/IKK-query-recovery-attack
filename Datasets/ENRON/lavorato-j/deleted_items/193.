John,
Since we have been interfacing primarily with Greg on Mariner, I wanted to make sure that you were in the loop.  Greg and Bowen met with Bob Henderson on Tuesday to discuss changing the management of the asset by Enron.  The meeting apparently went well.  Greg, Jesus, Thompson, and I are meeting with Henderson tomorrow at 11:00 pm at our offices to formally introduce Thompson and me to Henderson and to discuss the process going forward.  We are moving with changing the board.  Bowen, Donahou, Detmering, and Sherrick are resigning from the board and being replaced with Greg, Thompson, Keel, and me through a process of unanimous written consent.  The board restructure will hopefully be accomplished tomorrow or Friday.    

I will keep you posted.
Scott
