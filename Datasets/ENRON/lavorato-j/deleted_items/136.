Attached are the positions for the East and Central broken out by Region, Hub, State, Utility, & PRC Region for 5/23/01.  These positions EXCLUDE the options that currently reside in RPS (Real options, not Reg Opts).  Currently this is a manual report!  If the excel file is agreeable, until the canned reports are available from RPS, we can start delivering this report daily beginning next week.  If you have any questions or need any explanations about the report, please feel free to contact me.  Let me know!
