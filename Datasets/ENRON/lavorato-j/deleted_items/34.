John,
I'm hearing we are thinking about going to 24 hour trading. You are aware that the "machine" in crude is not profitable.  It is my understanding that crude has lost approx.$20MM on this algorithm year-to-date.   (FYI, at 11:00am it was down 132K for today's action)

For whatever it is worth, I'm a seller of this idea.  (Unless of course, someone tells me that something has changed. And if it is fixable, why haven't the crude boys fixed it?)

Frank
