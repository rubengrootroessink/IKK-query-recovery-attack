During the month of June, RAC will begin the rollout of our new website and linked portfolio tracking system called PortRAC.  The website will provide the user with instantly available transaction policies, procedures, DASH's and other valuable reports and links.  The PortRAC system is an extensive database of merchant and strategic investment information combined with a powerful search engine and report writer.  PortRAC will enable the analysis of our investment portfolio in any fashion that the user specifies such as the calculation of returns for a particular industry or region.

I believe that the new RAC website and PortRAC system will be valuable tools to help manage our business and I would like to provide you a personal "demo" before we introduce these applications to a broader population.

In the next two weeks, Rick Carson will be contacting you to arrange a convenient time for the demo, which should take about 30 minutes.  I hope that you will be able to make time in your schedule.

Please call me with any questions.

Rick Buy
