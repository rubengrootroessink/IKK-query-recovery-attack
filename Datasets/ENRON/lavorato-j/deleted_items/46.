Word for Word [IMAGE] "I don't know. Part of me thinks the kid's right. He asks what he's done to deserve this. He wants to stay here, fine. Let's leave him and go home. But then another part of me thinks, what if by some miracle we stay, then actually make it out of here. Someday we might look back on this and decide that saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole God-awful mess. Like you said, Captain, maybe we do that, we all earn the right to go home." 
--Sergeant Michael Horvath (Tom Sizemore) to Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), in the Oscar
-winning World War II drama  Saving Private Ryan

Now Playing: Pearl Harbor
This Summer's Most Anticipated Film [IMAGE] On a sleepy Sunday morning in December, as children played and families prayed, squadrons of Japanese warplanes screamed across the skies of a Hawaiian paradise and launched a surprise attack on the U.S. armed forces at Pearl Harbor. The infamous day that jolted America from peaceful isolationism to total war and altered the course of world history is relived in Pearl Harbor , an epic tale of patriotism, passion, and romance. Director Michael Bay's ambitious take on the life-changing events surrounding December 7, 1941, focuses on the war's devastating impact on two daring young pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a beautiful, dedicated nurse (Kate Beckinsale). It's this summer's biggest movie event. Now playing.
