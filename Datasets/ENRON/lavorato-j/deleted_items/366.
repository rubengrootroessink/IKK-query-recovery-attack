seems like a pretty good deal...

- $1000 transfer fee (payable by Enron)
- $331 per month dues
- free golfing for members including all family (at 3 courses...all but TPC, where there's a minimal charge)  guest charge is about $60 per round
- golf cart rental fee is $14 per person (don't need if you have your own)
- tennis is free...$10/hr for indoor
- pool access
- pay for food at restraunts.

How does it work, do you still have to pay to play?

David, do you know anyone who might want a membership to the Woodlands?  The memberships are transferable and might be a good deal for someone (better than having to pay the initiation fee of something like $10 grand or so...
