John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris
