John, Peter Krenkle (NGX) called me yesterday and advised me that our technical guys are telling him that we can be ready for July 1. We had agreed to give the industry 30 days notice prior to implementation which means we would need to send out a notice today or tomorrow.  I want to make sure that we are extremely confidant that we can get this done in 30 days. Given our last discussion and talking to Zipper re the real-time issue, I'm confused on why our position has changed from being a huge issue to a "7-day fix". 

Please advise asap.
