John,

Just so you know, I was able to speak with Thompson about the E&P assets and that we would need $135MM.  He response was that the price was too high!  He wants to get together today with Jesus and me and discuss our valuation. 

I bet he calls you and I wanted  you to know that we are talking.

Don
