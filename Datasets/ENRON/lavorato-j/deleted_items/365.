It would be great if you could give me a call some time.  The obvious disdain that Milnthorp has for my presence and the lack of contact with you has left me wondering why you still have me sitting here.  Some direction as to the future or lack there of with Enron would be good.

I find it incredibly hard to sit here every day and watch the West markets collapse and yet we see no benefit.  Despite what many may think, a lot of work went into establishing our bearish view of Sumas.  Watching C$30 to C$50 million of value not come back into the book because of a long SOCAL position has been very painful.
