Rogers

We have given the figures to Scott yeaterday to incorporate into todays DPR.

We are working on is to put some quantities on the unbooked deals and which of the missing deals are being covered by Phoenix. Hope to finalise this by end of business today.

Thanks

Sunil

All:
Yes, I've made John, Kevin and Tim aware of where we are with the missing positions.  However, on the daily report, I would like it documented-- the number of batches which are still outside of the report, by counterparty.  That way, we have a status of how much information is still missing.  I've committed by 9 November we can resolve these difficulties with the current position reporting.

Thanks,
Dale

Scott

Please see the link to the latest P&L report.

I spoke with Dale. He has made senior management aware of the issue of missing positions from the report and hence he suggests that we can go ahead and include the URM figures in the DPR.

We have shown the summary position by East and West region, which I believe is the level of detail to be included in the DPR. The underlying details by NERC region and utility are for Rogers and Dales use. (We will probably reformat the detail reports).

I would like to bring your attention to the timing of the reports in terms of URM and commodity curve dates.

Please let me know if this suits your requirements.


Thanks
