John,

I feel that the people needed to manage the portfolio under a services
agreement are Jesus Melendrez, Craig Fox (engineering), Arvel Martin
(operations), and Joe Joyce (land).  Greg Smith (Geophysics) may also be
needed for a period of time to manage through Bonne Terre and Cypress.  Some
analytical support may also be required (John House and/or Brian Otis) -
Jesus would need to make that call.

Scott
