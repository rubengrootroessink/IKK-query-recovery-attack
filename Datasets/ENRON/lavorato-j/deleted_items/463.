Last week, I spoke with Sally and asked her to kick off curve validations respective to all desks.  I emphasized that curve accuracy is particularly important.  Although probabilities exist that Dynegy will mark book down, I think it would be wise that this process not be a deal buster.  Do you want me to communicate this to desk heads?
