John,

As we have discussed before, it appears that combining Texas gas and power origination activities is not going to work.  The final nail in the coffin is the fact that in the new building we continue to be on two different floors.  As a result, I would like your thoughts about how to manage the origination activities in Texas.  In my mind there are several possible solutions: 
	1.  Have Barry Tycholiz manage both the West and Texas origination
	2.  Combine EES Texas retail with wholesale under Mark Courtney (EES has been chasing wholesale gas business in Texas)
	3.  Have Brian Redmond manage Texas origination (Delainey suggested it; I don't know what you have planned for him but he has contacts with the TRC and 	     customers)

Also, I am continuing to interview for one trader and for one middle marketer with the assistance of Todd Piekert in HR.  He has been identifying third rotation associates for me.  One of the candidates that I have been talking to is Charles Weldon who was approved into the trading track program yesterday.  I am going to talk to him again soon, I would like to be able to have him assigned to my desk either as a trader or originator depending where his skills best fit.  The other candidate is Justin Corrnett.  I have not talked to him yet but I want to know what you thoughts are on all of the above before I go too much farther.

I will get on your calender soon.

Tom
