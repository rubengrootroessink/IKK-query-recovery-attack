Jean/ John -

It looks like they have fixed their "problems"  and we should be getting our money through accounting tonight.

Can you make sure that Carol is talking to Greg Whiting in Gas Accounting?

Thanks

There are no accounting issues.  I am assuming that Nowlan is retrading the deal.  I will set up a meeting with Wes.

Global Markets is maintaining that there are "accounting issues"  with the $1.25 million.  Should we get Faith Killen or Wes to get this wrapped up?
