We do not have to pay the ISO the $86 million.  They will estimate what we should owe them and bill us for that amount.  They also want to make sure that we have remedied the problem.  Murray O'Neil will be the point person with the ISO.  Who will be the lead within the EES Settlements organization to ensure that we adequately remedy this problem?  That person should work with Murray to craft a response to the CAISO.  

Regard,
Tim

Tim,

GOOD NEWS!

This is the response from the ISO.  We are being requested to provide them with detail explanations behind the generation of bad meter data.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks - MO

Good news.  See e-mail below.  Epstein is our Controller.  Spence is our
Director of Settlements.  Bill Regan is our Chief Financial Officer.
On another note, it has been requested that a detailed explanation be given
and what will be done to prevent this in the future.  I hope you can
understand the reasoning for this request.
