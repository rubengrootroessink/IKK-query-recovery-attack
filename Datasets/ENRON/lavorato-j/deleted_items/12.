Not exactly.

I told Carol to go ahead and book the $1.25mm based on John's approval.  I also stated that it would be until June for us to sort out the inter business unit origination through the Risk and Accounting books.  I told her that Jean and John need to discuss how exactly this deal will be accounted for after August, assuming not all goes according to plan. 

Carol needs to book the $1.25mm and have Jeff Gossett get in contact with me to figure out the details.

Scott

John,

The timeline is as follows :

1.  Spoke with Nowlan this past Friday, he agreed to pay us this week.  As such, I had Carol Carter contact Scott Earnest, his book person, to receive monies.
2.  Carol called me yesterday and informed me that Scott would not be sending the money and that Nowlan would be calling me.
3.  I left a message with Nowlan yesterday asking him to contact me.
4.  We had our conversation regarding the P&L resulting from the Formosa deal.

I have cc'd all relevant parties.

Regards, Mrha
