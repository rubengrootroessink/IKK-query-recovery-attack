All,

Don confirmed this morning that we do in fact want to move all members of the contract review team working on this full time to a new cost center.  I would like to effect that July 1, 2001, so we should finally identify that team by the end of next week.

Berney, since Don is out the first part of next week, can you copy the group back on the last round of identified people that you and Misty put together and highlight the full time people that should be in this cost center.  This will be an Enron Americas cost center , rolling up in the risk management group of cost centers under Don and Rogers direction.

Thanks

Wade
