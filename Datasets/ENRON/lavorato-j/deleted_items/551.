will do.
 
The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.  
 
Are the FedEx's getting to everybody Monday or are you sending them Monday?
