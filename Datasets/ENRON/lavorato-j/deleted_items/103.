Houstons - 11103 Westheimer ( at Willcrest ) - just outside beltway 8.

Some of you have asked questions about his background here's what I have :

- approached by us
- has met John Lavorato who liked him a lot
- met Scott Neal for drinks last week - Scott liked him
- top gas trader at Duke
- was offerred a position with Enron about 4 years ago but declined 

Sell Enron and determine his suitablility
