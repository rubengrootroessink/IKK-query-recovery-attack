Please be advised that, through the distribution of this email, Global Finance is adding the following language to the Roseville FASH dated May 9, 2001:

Add at the end of item 2: Investment terms and pricing;  Financing terms and pricing:

As indicated in the DASH, the $44.6MM represents the total amount requested for expenditures on project soft costs, as defined by accounting.  None of these dollars may be expended for hard costs, as defined by accounting, thereby preserving the ability to finance the power plant off balance sheet.  Any additional project expenditures (including commitments) which may be requested through another DASH (for turbine payments as mentioned in this DASH or any new amounts) must be incurred by a financing vehicle/structure which will allow this power project to be financed off Enron's balance sheet.
