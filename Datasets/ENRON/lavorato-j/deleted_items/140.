Yes,   we have 5 externals coming in next  Wednesday.
 
        From the 32 resumes shortlisted by you

14 of which were interviewed by your direct reports (remainder were not interested in Houston/job)
8 of which were recommeded by your traders
6 of which accepted an 2nd round interview (five of which are confirmed for next Wednesday, 1 could not make that date)

We therefore have a confirmd number of 15 to interview next Wednesday, however I was given additional internal names last night to follow up on this am.   I will confirm exact number of interviews later this morning but could be anywhere in the region from 15-20.
 
I have asked the current group in the Trading Track to faciliate an office tour of the trading floors/gas control room.   Following which there will be an informal lunch for all of the candidates in one of the conference rooms to include the current Trading Track folks.   Interviews will follow at 2.00 pm at the Allen Center.  Schedules are being formalised today and will be forwarded to you.
 
Thanks,
 
karen.

John 

Following the interviews next week, suggest your management team get together to review the rotations for the Trading Track, to see if they continue to meet business/Employe needs to ensure we have accurate data from a tracking perspective.

<<trading track rotations.xls>> 

Attached is the current list of rotations for the Trading Track participants and future assigned rotations (as decided at the time of hiring).    Can you please re-confirm you have these people in your group currently, as I appear to have conflicting information.  I will re-send, if any changes occur.

If there is any movement of these people between groups can you plese keep me in the loop. 

Kind regards, 

Karen.
