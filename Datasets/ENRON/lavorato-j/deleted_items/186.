John, we are confirmed with both the Premier's office and Lay for the 19th of June. I assume that you will be attending also. What are your thoughts on who should attend the Harris meeting and what other meetings should we set up to maximize the use of yours/Lay's time.

Brian Purchase is a key decision maker in Wilson's office. My thought was that you could meet with Wilson and Purchase. Aleck believes that it would be beneficial for Lay to meet with them also.

Rob, we have Lay from about 1 pm to 6 pm.  The question is how to make the best use of his time.   After the Premier, I think  meeting Wilson and Purchase is  the best use of his time.  It is really Purchase I want Lay to meet, and it would be hard for Lay to meet Purchase without including Wilson (assuming of course he is available).  They will be among the key decision makers going forward.   If you have any other suggestions about how to make the best use of Lay's time here, please let me know.

Aleck, I wouldn't have Lay meet with Wilson and/or Purchase but definitely Lavo could meet with them.

Regards, Rob

Lay is confirmed for the 19th.  We have him from one  to about  six.   Once I have the Premier's meeting tied down re time, I am going to try to arrange a meeting for Lay and Lavo with  Wilson and Purchase.  I think that is the best use of his time.  Let me know if you have any other or different ideas.
