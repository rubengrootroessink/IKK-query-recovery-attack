where do we stand now?  last i heard was an e-mail from oxley (which is on lotus notes and not accessible anymore) which said that we don't think that we are going to get there, but hold on for a few more days while we finalize our decision and craft a really nice decline speech.  it's been a few weeks now, and i am checking status.  do you still want to offer him the initial contract?  i doubt he'd take it but i need to know.  what would you change with his proposal that would be acceptable?  i think that mike has taken this negotiation seriously and deserves a timely resolution.
