John:

We executed the transmission connection contract with Light (local distribution company) yesterday for the project.  Based on completing this agreement and our conversation, we are moving forward with the shipment of the turbines.  Initial loading of loose items will start this afternoon and turbines tomorrow with a planned departure of the ship on Sunday.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments?

Thanks,
Brett
