I realize you are busy with merger but I would like to get this resolved.

Let me know,

John,

Given the fact that the market rules have now changed to allow us to hedge transmission in ERCOT, I would like to release the schedule C associated with the LCRA transaction. The enclosed spreadsheet outlines the details.

Please let me know if there are any questions,

Thanks,

Doug Gilbert-Smith
