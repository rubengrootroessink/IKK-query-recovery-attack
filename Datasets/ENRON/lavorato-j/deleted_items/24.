Diane and I are thrilled to announce that we will  be travelling to Russia for the 2nd and final time (for a few years anyway) to  pick up our son, Yanic! We will be leaving on Friday June 15th, with our court  appearance on June 19 and our flight home to Toronto on June  22!
 
Thanks to all for your kind words and sentiments  over the last few months.
 
REGARDS,
