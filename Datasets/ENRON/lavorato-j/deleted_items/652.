John,

How's it going?  Is there any good news out there?  I think that I need a hug or belly rub.

Gents,

I thought that I would let you know that Rob Hemstock informed me last night that Murray Smith (Minister of Energy) got the PPA Division Regulation through Cabinet yesterday.  This essentially allows us to split the PPA with the remaining steps being a formality.  The Sundance B PPA will become the Sundance B3 and Sundance B4 PPAs within the next week.
