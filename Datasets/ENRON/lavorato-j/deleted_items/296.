So, like we were saying earlier, there is less gas flowing North around the horn at Stanfield. The outage schedule is as follow: Pine River is back on June 12, and Fort Nelson starts on June 14 until June 27 (280mmcf), then 290 mmcf off on June 29 at McMahon. If prices are not motivated to move to Malin, it will back off in Alberta, either through Gordondale, or displacing gas at Kingsgate. 

The story for the other small storage facilities on Northwest Pipeline is:
	We were told that Mist is approximately 25% full, but it has a capacity of only 9 bcf   
	Plymouth has approximately has a capacity of less than 3 bcf.

Clay is taking its gas from the Rockies. We think there is enough supply to offset any additional capacity from Sumas, so Canadian gas should not be used for injection in Clay. Clay is already about 3 bcf over last year (23.7 bcf vs 20.9 bcf, on a capacity of 54.5 bcf. Last year they were only 83% full).


I hope this helps. If you have any other question, don't hesitate to give me a call at 6721.

If the gas isn't going into Jackson, where is it going.
