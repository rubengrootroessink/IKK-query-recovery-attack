  [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]      Dear john lavorato :  As a valued customer o=
f chapters.ca, we feel it's important to let you know about a significant c=
hange we will be implementing next week. As we prepare to merge Indigo and =
Chapters, we are combining the operations of both sites into chapters.indig=
o.ca. This new site will blend the best of chapters.ca and indigo.ca to cre=
ate the most efficient, engaging and entertaining online retail site for bo=
oks, music, movies, gifts, garden products and more.  To get to the site yo=
u need do nothing different - you can simply enter www.chapters.ca  as you =
have previously done, and you'll arrive there.  Specific to your Chapter 1?=
 Club membership, you will continue to benefit from the same savings and re=
ward structure that is currently in place. Your account information will re=
main active on chapters.indigo.ca. We are also hard at work on a program th=
at will see that all of our customers share in the rewards of both loyalty =
programs. Of course, we will happily announce these improvements as soon as=
 they are finalized.  Come along as we turn the page on a new chapter of on=
line retailing. We want to make this transition as safe and seamless as pos=
sible for our customers. To that end, we want to assure you of the followin=
g:  Orders already placed at chapters.ca will be filled and shipped by Chap=
ters.   For your convenience, your credit card information, shipping and bi=
lling addresses and Chapter 1? Club number will remain active on chapters.i=
ndigo.ca -- there will be no need to re-submit this information.   This is =
an exciting time! The future is bright and we thank you for your continued =
support.  Stay tuned for a follow-up email in the next week that will forma=
lly announce the launch. Please feel free to contact us if you have any con=
cerns.    Sincerely,  Peter Cooper PeterCooper@Chapters.ca    *************=
