We are discussing industrial coverage with EES.  EES has proposed the following industry classifications as wholesale, ENA customer groups.  All other industrial/commercial customers would be covered by EES.  This is very similar to the approach taken several years ago.  John Lavorato wants to know if this list is too narrowly defined or if there should be exceptions.

Mining
Oil and Gas extraction
Paper Manufacturing
Chemical Manufacturing
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
Primary Metals
Fertilizer
Rail Transportation
