John,
The third tab in this file contains the information that you requested on Argentina leasehold improvements.  It appears that the majority of the $3Million in cost actually relates to the purchase of the floor rather than improvements to it.  It seems that in order to apply for a power marketing certificate we needed to hold assets in Argentina.  I understand that they are now looking into selling our floor and leasing back only the space that we need.

3rd Tab is Argentina.

By the way, Brazil's leasehold is being amortized over 5 years.
