John,
Sorry for the late response.

Regarding #1 and #3, I enjoy golf and spa combos - Scotsdale, Broadmoor (Colorado),  Barton Creek (Austin), or Horseshoe Bay (outside of Austin).  My preference is probably Barton Creek for ease of access and cost.  Austin nightlife is good also.
Regarding #2, I enjoyed hearing what other business groups are doing and the issues that they are encountering.  I am not interested in climbing a mountain.
Regarding, #4, a quality guest speaker is usually worthwhile and enjoyable.
If I come up with anything else I will let you know.
Scott

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John
