to hear your thoughts on overall strategy, direction, short & long term vie=
w re markets & opportunities.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility=
.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in la=
te June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's ti=
me to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.=20

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. cl=
imb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.=20

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.=
  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to yo=
ur schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland=
, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   =20

Regards

John
