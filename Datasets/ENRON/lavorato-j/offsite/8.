John, lets take over the Rimrock Hotel. lot's to do, golf, river raft, hot springs, spa, hiking trails, horseback, fish.( you can fly fish at ghost lake) ... there is meeting space if required and, it is closer to Calgary then it is to San Fransisco from here so the connections are easy.  Stay at the Rimrock... get the penthouse suite and host the coolest party in town. COST !!!  If you would like more info, let me know.
