John,  Very good idea to improve our integration as an organization.  If po=
ssible the best  timing is the last weekend in June.=20
 With all the changes we have made I suggest an update of the major issues/=
 opportunities in each one of our businesses.  Also an overall sense of bus=
iness strategy and focus would be helpfull.  From an HR standpoint I am not=
 sure all understand the PRC  as a development tool, as well as an evaluati=
on mechanism.   We need to find ways to incentivate new and creative busine=
ss development that may not result in short term results.  A discussion of =
the HR development is key.
From a location standpoint there is a very nice  guest ranch with great con=
ference facilities that Enron has used in the past located in Jackson, WY. =
They can accomodate all our team and also have plenty of outside activities=
 that include horseback riding in the mountains which is much less stressfu=
ll than climbing but you get the same views.=20

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility=
.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in la=
te June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's ti=
me to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.=20

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. cl=
imb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.=20

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.=
  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to yo=
ur schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland=
, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   =20

Regards

John
