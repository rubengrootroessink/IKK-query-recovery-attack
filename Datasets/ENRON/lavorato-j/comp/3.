John, as requested, please see the attached. It's password protected, so you will need to call me. 

On a related note, I wanted your guidance on how you have in the past had input into non-commercial bonus numbers. Did you call guys like Shapiro, Colwell, Beck, Haedicke, etc. to agree to numbers or will they check with me before approving any numbers?
