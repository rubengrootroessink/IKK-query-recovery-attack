Attached is some very preliminary correlation work that Joe Hrgovcic did on 
understanding the dependence of PJM consumption/demand on a basket of 
temperatures.  As you will see from the spread sheet Joe was able to get a 
correlation of 97.7%.

Should you have any questions on the analytical work Joe's phone number is 
33914 and mine is 37480.  Both Joe and I have spoken with Vince about this 
idea. We on the weather desk are interested pushing this idea forward with 
your support.
