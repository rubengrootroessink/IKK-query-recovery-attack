John,

The news story relates to this report that DWR released today.  They held a press release.  They said that the state would honor all of the executed agreements, but any non-binding "agreements in principle" would be subject to renegotiation.  In general, they say they have executed about 6,000MW of long term agreements and about 5,000MW under "agreements in principle".  

DWR signed our Master Agreement.  We are holding off signing it because of litigation risk, per Tim and Legal.  

Chris
