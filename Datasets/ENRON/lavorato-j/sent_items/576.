John,

I've booked flights if the invitation is still there.  

Who should I coordinate with on meeting in San Fran and the associated logistics.?

John,

Clare is out of town that weekend (yee haw)

Flights are avaiable to San Fran (cheap, cheap)

All systems are go....but.....looking at significant Alberta transaction closing on March 12,13, or 14.  

I'll have more info on timing and probability early next week.
