John baby, 
What are you up to?  Are you in Houston?  If so, we should touch base @ some point.  Still with Enron?  Do you run the company yet?  Are you responsible for my pricing at the pump?  I have been back in Dallas since '95 and am working with The Carlyle Group...getting married in August...you?
Hope all is well. 
Best regards,
