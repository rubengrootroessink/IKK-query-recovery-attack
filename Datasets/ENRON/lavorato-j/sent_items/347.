John, not going to be able to make the Barton creek trip; however, the Vegas trip would be fun ... I will check into planes.  What did you have in mind as far as specific times and dates?

Regards
Dave

Recession, What Recession.

Barton Creek was full the weekend of the 20th and 21st.  Dorie managed to get me a room.  However, the Golf times were non existant so I figured I would play it by ear and try to book later.  If you and Donna want to join us feel free.  

The next weekend the 27th and 28th is the weekend that I may go to Vegas.  I may also stay and play lots of Golf here.  Let me know your thoughts.

Lavo
