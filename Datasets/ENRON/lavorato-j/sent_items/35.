We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.
