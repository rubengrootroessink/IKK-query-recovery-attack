it wasn't outrageous.  Call me if he is interested and we will talk about dollars.  Because he will be a VP candidate he will have to interview in Houston.

John, had lunch with Greg today... seems interested  - will let me know Monday if he would like to move forward. Do you recall what kind of $$$ you talked to him about previously? I understand that you were close on meeting expectations.
