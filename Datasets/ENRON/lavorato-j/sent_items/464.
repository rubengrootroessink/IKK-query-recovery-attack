Well - there you go!  I did think you meant p&l  - not to worry it was obviously a long day yesterday.

Have a good day.

100 what?  i mentioned a $100 price move in the fronts.  did you understand a $100 of p&l?  i thought that you sounded a bit happy about the price move.  the p&l was what i expected.
