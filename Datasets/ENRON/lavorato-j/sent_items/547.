Count me in with Russian rubles to counter the free market forces. I don't

know about Americans as Imperialists though, Chris. Theories of mercantilism

resulted in Colonial Wars and The American Revolution. America doesn't try

to influence other countries, they simply take what they need, with or

without asking. Just ask Lav's Enron Corp.

$40 is a bit high for a Collective farmer, but I'll forego some panza's

(deep fried, not baked ) to make it happen.

Joe.
