You should meet with Louise.  She is focused on the Power Business.  I will sit in if I'm available.

John:

I will be in Houston next Monday and Tuesday.  I would like to spend a half hour or so with you, if you had time, to brief you on what's going in the Middle Market Group in Portland, reviewing year to date earnings and a market share analysis we recently completed.  You may be getting some info. from Tim and/or internal reports, but I figured, since I was going to be in Houston, it would be a good chance to fill in some details.  Let me know if you would like to meet and what time works for you on Monday or Tuesday.

Thanks!

Chris
