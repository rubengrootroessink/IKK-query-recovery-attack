We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

This is to inform that we have closed 2.200 MWh for May to AES Sul at 25% discount rate against spot price at southeast sub-market to be paid on Jun 25th.
