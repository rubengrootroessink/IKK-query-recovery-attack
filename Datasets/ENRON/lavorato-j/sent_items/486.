No one needed for the PRC.  Jaime Williams and Steve Irwin are co leads.

John, I have the Mexico group. I am following up on this email to assess your interest in getting contracts in front of these indviduals.  Can you tell me if you will be following through on this or should I be directing this question to Louise?  Also, do you and Louise have a successor for Max in mind?  We will need to discuss PRC representation as well. My understanding is that Louise is planning to attend. Do we need anyone else to represent Mexico in the July 9th meeting?  Please advise or I will be happy to get on your calendar to discuss.

Seems to me a sensible move quickly on Steve Irvine and Jaime Williams to get contracts in place following Yzaguirre's departure. I believe Jaime's contract has just expired and Irvine we drafted back in April as part of the blitz approach but never got past the "do Yzaguirre first" obstacle.

What do you think? You want to talk with them or should we go direct to them?
