On April 4, 2001, Peoples Energy will hold their Board of Directors meeting in Houston.  I have been engaged with their executive team in their planning process and the schedule is as follows:

8:00 AM to 10:00 AM	Board of Directors Meeting - Peoples Energy Production Office, Houston 

10:30 AM to 11:30 AM	Enron - Tour of Trading Floor, Enron Bio, etc.

12:00 PM to 5:00 PM	Various Activities (Golf, Art Museum, etc)

6:30 PM -Evening	Enron Field, Astros vs. Milwaukee,  Enron Suite - Enron Hosting

I am requesting introductions (if available) and attendance on the Trading Floor from each of you, Dave, and Jeff Skilling.    Dave and Jeff were requested by Peoples due to their prior involvement with this account.   As we transition your involvement, I would like to use this event as an opportunity to ease the departure of Dave and provide an informal format to engage our new team.  

Those in attendance will include: 

CEO, Peoples Energy - Dick Terry
President and COO, Peoples Energy - Tom Patrick
Executive Vice President, Peoples Energy - Bill Morrow (signatory and key relationship for Enron current transactions)
CEO & Chairman of the Board, Chicago Board Options Exchange - Bill Brodsky

Non-executive Chairman, Alleghany Asset Management - Richard Toft
Various other PEC executives


Please let me know if your schedules accommodate this request.  If you have questions, please contact me at 312/541-1225.
