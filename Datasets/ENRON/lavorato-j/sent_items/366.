Kim,

Salomon Smith Barney will bring 6 Italian institutional investors to visit Enron on May 21st @ 11:30 a.m.  They are very interested in our wholesale business and  Paula Rieker would like to have John Lavorato, if he is available, meet with them.  We will be arranging a lunch in 50M03.  

Please let me know if John Lavorato would be available for this meeting.  

Thanks, 

Laura
