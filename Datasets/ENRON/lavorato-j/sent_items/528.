Our thought was that it would be useful for Ken Lay and John Lavorato to met with a group of very senior people in the investment community to outline our case for market opening.   A proposed initial list is attached.  It should be expanded to include Ron Munkley  from CIBC World Markets and Bill Homer of Scotia Capital.  The thinking behind this is that these guys are all senior advisors to the Gov't, OPG or Hydro One on decontrol and related issues and several, such as Long, Lindsay and Hudson, are among the Premier's closest advisors.  Let me know what you think so, if we decide to go ahead with this, we can do so soon.   << File: April4Invitees.xls >>
