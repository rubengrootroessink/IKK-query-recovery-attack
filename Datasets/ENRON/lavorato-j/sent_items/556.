I keep hearing that we will resolve the tape issue soon.  Can we go over to the broker's office and listen to the tapes.

Not yet.  Geralsul wants to listen to the tapes first, but refuses to sign a letter that protects the broker against any lawsuit (even though customary, conversation recording without express awareness of the counterparty is "illegal").  We hope to resolve the tapes issue by Friday.

Unfortunately we seem to have lost the deal with CSN today.  This caught us by surprise: they claim that they were offended by the changes in the contract that we submitted this morning as well as by the call that was made to S? Paulo de Oliveira (to try to get CSN guarantee).

Next step: I don't think that there is much of a chance of getting the deal with any type of intervention, although opinions differ on the matter.  We need to talk about it tomorrow.
