 D ear John,

 

I am first  year MBA student at Richard Ivey School of Business, University of Western  Ontario. 

 

I  have a bachelors degree in electrical engineering and prior to returning to the  business school Iworked in oil &  gas and telecom industries. I was interested in finding out  oppertunities for summer internships at Enron that will eventually lead towards Enron's  Associate program for full time employment.

 

I  understand that you must have a very busy schedule due to your position. I would  appreciate any kind of advice and  guidanceand will look forward to  hearing from you.

 

Regards

 

Irfan  Ali
