I wonder with Joe Sutton gone if they can cancel the worldwide Analyst and =
Associate PRC.  It take a lot of time away from our people and we are ranki=
ng them ourselves anyway.

Subject:=09Final Associate/Analyst 2000 PRC - Jacoby

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below ar=
e the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts=
) and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is =
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduc=
t a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The pre-ra=
tings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and avail=
able for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a secondar=
y supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts feedba=
ck.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or Associates/An=
alysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  The Associa=
te and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the completed =
feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system is closed=
.  The more information that you can secure regarding your Associates/Analy=
sts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated correctly at the final=
 PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are unsure of the process, p=
lease contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or Shelly Butler at x3-4584=
 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the Associates/Anal=
ysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate this feedback in=
cluding your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at your business =
unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not conducting a pre-rat=
ing meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the rating you provide =
is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  Please contact the P=
EP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at x3-5230 if you are unab=
le to load this data yourself.  You should wait to provide feedback to your=
 Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have been made to avoid any =
confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final cross-calibration and =
may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are responsible for contacting th=
e PRC Representative listed above whom will be representing your Associates=
/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind that the more information y=
ou can provide, either verbal or written, will ensure that the final PRC is=
 a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received=
 your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received th=
is, please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the sys=
tem and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how=
 many people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving you=
r reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of revi=
ewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will also=
 be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the opportunit=
y to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you have added =
value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may hear from yo=
ur PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do not, we s=
uggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing. =20

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 20=
00 at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and Anal=
ysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be communicate=
d to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be communicated to th=
e Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the Associates/Analysts have not rece=
ived feedback by the deadline, they should contact their Career Development=
 Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for=
 your cooperation and we look forward to a successful final PRC
