It's more related to the size of this transaction and the fact that the transport model apparently doesn't calc var.  I have no fundamental concerns but this one hit me from left field.  On our other issue, I working on getting something in front of you this week.

I understand that there was a new EPNG transport booked yesterday but that you did not want any option value booked.  Could you let me know your thoughts on this?  Is this a revenue management issue or do you still have fundamental concerns with the option value concept?
