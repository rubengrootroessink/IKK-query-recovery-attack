Dear Mr. Metts: 
  I am contacting you on behalf of the First American Management Enterprises and the Fort Berthold Development Corp. 
  We have the opportunity to aquire a contract to supply to the US Government, a large quantity of Natural Gas, Electricity, Propane,  Lubes and Fuels.  We feel that because of the size of this contract, it would require our company to obtain the assistance of a large company, such as Enron for this supply.  It will be nationwide and could reach a dollar amount of 2 billion per year and extend to possibly 10 years or longer.  We are now in the process of applications and acquiring more information.

  If this is something you feel Enron can help us with please contact us.  Thank you. 
  The contacts are as follows:  Bob Dennis- (701)575-8470 
                                                       E-Mail:bdlazer@hotmail.com <<mailto:E-Mail:bdlazer@hotmail.com>> 

                Rick Woodward-(701)391-6833, Bismarck, ND 
Sincerely, 
Bob Dennis
