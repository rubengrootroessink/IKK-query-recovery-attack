Unfortunately we seem to have lost the deal with CSN today.  This caught us by surprise: they claim that they were offended by the changes in the contract that we submitted this morning as well as by the call that was made to S? Paulo de Oliveira (to try to get CSN guarantee).

Next step: I don't think that there is much of a chance of getting the deal with any type of intervention, although opinions differ on the matter.  We need to talk about it tomorrow.
