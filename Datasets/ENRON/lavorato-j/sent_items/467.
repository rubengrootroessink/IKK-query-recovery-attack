Thought that you would like to see this message from your boy Eddie Rietze.  
 
I will make sure that the interviews are called off.  Let me know if you are interested in calling him at home.
 
Have a great week.

I apologize for not responding to your resume request sooner, but after

careful consideration of my future career, I am hesitant to make a career

change at this current time.  I appreciate the fact that Enron North America

gave me the opportunity to discuss the potential for employment with an

executive of the organization.  Unfortunately with the birth of my son, I am

hesitant to make any career change right now.  Based on the aforementioned

and in consideration of the valuable time of the Enron management team, I

would request that we cancel the meeting that has been scheduled for this

Wednesday.

Sincerely,

Edward Reitze
