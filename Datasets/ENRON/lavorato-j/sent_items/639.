Hello Dorie,

I know this is not the most opportune time, but we have a final decision on
the suite pricing.  This special rate was more than 50% off of the original
pricing for just one bedroom.  It was something negotiated between
ourselves and we can't justify a lower rate on a sold out night for Mr.
Lavorato when he continued to stay in the suite.  This might be different
had he moved to a regular room and we could have upsold someone else to the
suite.   However, we had to walk away from that revenue.    I hope Mr.
Lavorato understands our business position.  Please contact me if you have
any questions.
