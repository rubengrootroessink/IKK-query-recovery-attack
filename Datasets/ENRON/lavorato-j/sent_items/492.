Hi John. It was really good to hear from you. As  well I think you have a good idea of what I think of your corporate success. Not  to take away, in any way, what I think of you and the family on a personal  basis. give them all my love.
 
John, I did send you the article on David Cassie's  compensation at CIBC World Markets.
 
Could you e-mail me your new title [to update my files] and  business address.
 
Thanks
 
Uncle Frank.
