Wednesday, April 25 at 10 a.m. Houston time, join Sherri Sera, executive assistant to Jeff Skilling, on eSpeak.  Sherri will answer questions about how her job has changed since Jeff became CEO.  

If you can't make the live event, post your questions on eSpeak <<http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp>> now.  Sherri will answer them during her eSpeak, and you can find the answers in the transcript later.


Have you been wondering what happened to the information about Enron's severance pay policy?   Would you like to see an innovation suggestion for the Saturn's ring that will connect the two Enron buildings?
