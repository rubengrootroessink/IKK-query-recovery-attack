I would be interested in looking at the analysts/associates; however, interns are too short time for risk.  The training does outweigh the benefits.

Thanks,

Hi

We are getting in several anylysts and associates  (new hires) in the next few months.  We also have interns coming for summer only.  Do you need any.

Can you use interns or does the training out weigh the benefits.

John
