Yes he is.  In addition, Kathy Kelly and Dayem Khandker, who are on the Wellhead Desk, should be empowered to transact on Enron Online.  Please contact John Grass if you have any further questions.

John, 
Is John Grass an authorized trader?  It appears that he has been granted authority to trade on EOL and I don't recognize him as having such authority. 

Let me know.

Frank
