David,
Per my voicemail, the Associate and Analyst Program is currently looking for additional Director level Analyst PRC Representatives.  The breakdown that is needed is as follows:

1 - Enron Americas
1 - EIM
2 - EGM

Your previous nominations made at the end of the year will be used which will helps to reduce the number of Analysts for each Representative to ten.  However, we need more Representatives.  Again, we are looking for the Directors that are considered to be the up and comers in these business units.  The Analysts that will depend on them need to know that they are people who are willing to take on this responsibility and represent them fairly.  

We would like to have your new nominations by March 1st so we may begin communicating to the new Analyst PRC Representative Board.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks so much.
