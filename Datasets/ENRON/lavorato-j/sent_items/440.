This is bizzare.  Global Markets promised Jean this money and won't seem to write her a check.  It was also a low number relative to what was created for GM.

Global Markets is maintaining that there are "accounting issues"  with the $1.25 million.  Should we get Faith Killen or Wes to get this wrapped up?
