My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.  I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on International business.
