I'm fine, just wondering about what "data from transactions in the relevant contracts listed on EOL EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time" means from a practical standpoint and if we are going to have to build something to accomodate this....

As part of the settlement of Enron Canada's lawsuit against NGX, they (NGX) are required to issue a press release.  The draft of the release is attached.  It is expected to be released at the end of the day on Monday, April 30 or Tuesday, May 1.

Please send any comments to me at your earliest convenience.  If you have any questions, call me at ext. 3-9053.  Thanks.

Eric
