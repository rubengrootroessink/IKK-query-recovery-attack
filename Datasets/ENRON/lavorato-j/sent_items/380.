Boy does this sound like something that would get fucked up.  Start with Paul Devries in Toronto and let me know what happens.  I didn't even know it was closing.

John,

We will have a substantial multi-year C$ short when our mill closes.  We're looking at about C$100mm in 01 and $300/yr thereafter.  I understand ENA may have an opposite position.  Could we discuss this? or would you refer me to one of your myriad of underlings?  I would like to keep EGM out of our pockets if possible.  

Later,

bobc
