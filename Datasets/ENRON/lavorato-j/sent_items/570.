John- this is not the finished copy... will get Julie to forward...

On the 4-6, I would just want you to meet the key funds... Tudor, Catequil, Harvard, SAC Capital (and maybe Paloma) here in NY- I'd condense the meetings into a few hours around lunch/dinner to maximise your time..

It would be great if you could make it.... let me know.. I'll be in Houston next week.. will say hello..

Attached is the revised overview you requested; specifically, slide 15 was altered where the cash prices were moved to the appropriate production line area.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Attached is the revised Natural Gas Overview presentation you requested.  Please note on slide 15, whenever the rig and production count is altered, the Henry Hub Cash Prices do not fall within the line chart.  Please advise whether you would prefer the HHCP to adjust with the line, and if so, indicate placement since most of the dollar values are below the line.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Thank you.
