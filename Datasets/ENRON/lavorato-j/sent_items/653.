Hi John,
Attached is the marks we are using to mark our books as of Nov 15th.  Please
have your guys drop in your marks for the same day and send back to us.  This
should clear up 90% of our differences.
In addition, your help on some 3rd party book outs would help us reduce our
overall position size. We were working on one with Williams, when Kevin Presto
objected unless he was able to earn the bid/offer.  We would like to do the
following:

MS sells to Enron
Enron sells to Williams
Williams sells to MS

----100 mw of "Into SOCO" all at the current markt price.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
                Joe Delaney
