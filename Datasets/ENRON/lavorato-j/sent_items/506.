We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have elected to leave Enron.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial Officer of Enron Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of Enron South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of Enron Broadband Services for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented teams at Enron.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new endeavors.
