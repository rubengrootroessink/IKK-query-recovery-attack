John,

Did you put Frank Hayden up to this?  If this decision is up to me I would consider authorizing Mike G., Frank E., Keith H. and myself to trade west power.  What do you think?

Phillip

I've been asked to provide an updated list on who is authorized to cross trade what commodities/products.  As soon as possible, please reply to this email with the names of only the authorized "cross commodity" traders and their respective commodities. (natural gas, crude, heat, gasoline, weather, precip, coal, power, forex (list currency), etc..)

Thanks,

Frank


PS. Traders limited to one commodity do not need to be included on this list.
