They are working quite a complex tax structure in Canada.  I'm not sure wha=
t role I should play.  Should I just assume that they know what they are do=
ing and let them do whatever they want sort of like the finance guys do wit=
h our balance sheet or should I get involved.  My first take was that this =
was way too good to be true.

Just to follow up from our meeting yesterday morning, the total present val=
ue benefit from Project Slapshot is approximately $100 million (we do not a=
t this point know the exact benefit because it is dependent on the yet unde=
termined interest rate to be charged in connection with the EIM financing).=
  The benefit will be realized by EIM Canada and Enron Canada Corp. through=
 a reduction in the amount of taxes paid by each company.  The risk related=
 to the transaction is that the interest deductions from the transaction ar=
e denied in part and, as to the part denied, EIM Canada and Enron Canada Co=
rp. are required to pay interest to Revenue Canada on the amount of income =
offset by such denied interest deduction.  I will forward to you a calculat=
ion of the potential interest charge to Enron Canada Corp. in this circumst=
ance as soon as I confirm with our Canadian counsel the method by which suc=
h interest charge is calculated, and the likely rate at which it would be i=
mposed.  A more remote risk (due to actions we are taking in the financing =
documents) stemming from the transaction is that Revenue Canada could asser=
t a withholding tax on interest payments made by EIM Canada to the lender i=
n the transaction.  This risk would fall on EIM Canada.  I believe that it =
is highly unlikely that either risk will ever be realized and have obtained=
 the highest level of comfort on this point possible from our Canadian coun=
sel absent their telling us that there is no risk (specifically, Blake, Cas=
sels believes that there is a 70 to 80 percent likelihood that our position=
 will be sustained if challenged).  I am attending the Enron Tax Conference=
 on Thursday and Friday of this week but can be reached at 713.817.5052 sho=
uld you have questions regarding this transaction.  Best regards.  SHD.
