Subject:	Avoidable Overtime Hours

We have had 100 percent turnover in our risk group in the last 9 months, including two people leaving in the last week.  One of the main frustrations comes from many overtime hours spent working through technology issues.  

Last Friday is a typical example.  The three members of our risk group were here until about 10 PM Friday night working through a problem caused by Technology.  For some reason, our Futures position was dropping out of our positions.  They noticed this and stayed until it was fixed.  It turns out that a DBA somewhere made a change that caused the mapping of our Futures positions to change.  Had this person communicated to people what he/she was doing, it is my understanding that the problem could have been avoided.  Stated another way, lack of communication by someone in technology caused our risk group to work an extra 15 hours on Friday night.  I should add that one or more people in technology had to work extra on Friday as well.

It is so frustrating to see this sort of thing happen over and over.  The list of little things that cause lots of extra work is so long that it is not funny.  It kills morale and burns out smart, hard working people.  What do you think we can do to change this situation?
