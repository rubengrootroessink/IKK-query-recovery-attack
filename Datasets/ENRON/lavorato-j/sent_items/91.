We actually forced Craig Breslau and Fred Lagrasta to unwind an unapproved one year trade with their subsidiary Savannah Foods in April 2000.  In hindsight, it appears to be quite a good call.

FYI, Imperial Holly Corporation filed for Chapter 11 protection yesterday.  Counterparties affected would be:

		Imperial Holly Corporation
		Holly Sugar Corporation


At the present, we have no trades with either of these counterparties.
