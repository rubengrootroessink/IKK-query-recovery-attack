Subject:	Interviewers needed for Analyst Interviews on Monday


The A&A program are running a "magnificent Monday" April 30th to intervier 26 Analysts (summer start dates).    Therefore a number of interviewers have been requested.

Monday am:				20 Interviewers
Monday pm:				8 Interviewers

Can you advise if you or a manager/director in your group can faciliate.     No doubt, those that take the time to interview will have first "dips" on the analysts who get offered.

Thanks,

Karen.
