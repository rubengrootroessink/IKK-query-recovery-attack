We need to hedge funds.

Most of the macro hedge funds want to trade global crude products and gas options immediately.  However,  I am having a big problem getting Tudor and like funds up and running on EOL-

Problems:
#1: Credit- major back-log on new names - we don't have enough resources to deal with these names (the structures of the funds can be complex- not like dealing with industrials).  
#2: With those that we have docs, credit has said we can not trade on-line. (???)

The only differences I see with funds trading online is that their trades need to go to credit's (Bill Bradford's group) to be included in daily MTM and 5 day VAR reports.  We calculate variation margin off these reports so its essential credit gets the trades...

AND

In the case of Tudor, they allocate trades between funds- the EOL trades would need to go to me or the backoffice, so we could allocate them.

I think the EOL reporting issues can easily be resolved- the credit back log is the real killer at the moment.

Rgds,
Caroline

Now that gas options have been launched how are they being received ? Have you been able to convince any funds to trade. I've heard that Tudor is a huge player. where do they stand ?
