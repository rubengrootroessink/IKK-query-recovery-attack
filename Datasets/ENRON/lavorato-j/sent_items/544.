That sounds reasonable, however, I am looking at taking a different tract (ie.  going without orders and being a merchant company rather than an engineering company).  This has several issues especially capital but we are evaluating it over the next 2 weeks.  I will keep you posted.

PS  That's the longest email I've ever written.

John, I am a bid for a significant number of units that could take your costs and capabilites to scale quickly; however, I will not employ AMPS versus other suppliers unless EES is able to participate in the equity upside that our capital will create.  Please consider because it makes more sense than me going external.
