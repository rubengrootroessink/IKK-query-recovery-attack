Is there any stopping you! (But I'm guessing your not getting out running much any more.)  I really appreciated it when you called me at home on my recent promotion, but thought you might just get pissed of if I phoned you at home (maybe not).  Anyway, I won't bug you at home tonight, and I will congratulate you here.  Very impressive, well deserved.  The realignment involving both you and Delainey should be great for the company.  Push the stock.  Peter.
