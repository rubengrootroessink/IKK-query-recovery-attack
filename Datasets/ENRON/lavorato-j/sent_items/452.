John,

Willian Stuart has spent 3 months preparing the FX products you requested for distribution to our customers in Canada ( the noon day settlement products). As you can see, RAC has rejected approving these products.  We're ready to go.  I'll meet with them this week but will probably need your support.

Thanks,

Gary

As I mentioned, RAC is the final check point, and they are denying making markets externally. Let's discuss.

I was informed not to approve the product after I had erroneously done so. Please reject and resubmit the product.
