Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the year=
s, it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then custome=
rs. The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is questi=
onable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with=
 my partners.

Regards
Delainey
