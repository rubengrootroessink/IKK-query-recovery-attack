First, congrats on buying a great house for free.  Need to put up a fence in the back because Bob is a pain and somehow convinced me to take done the fence.  We never did figure out the combo for the back door.

John, we are in the middle of moving into our new home.  I think we will be very very happy there and would like to thank you for introducing us to the house last year.

One quick question.  Do you happen to remember the combination for the back door?

Regards,

Mungo
