Chris,

We will not be able to publish a preliminary DPR or position report for 10/31.  Port Calc has suffered a serious code crash, and the numbers generated are erroneous.  Our IT support will be working through the night to repair the code (Zhiyong's group), and hopefully by tomorrow morning we will be able to rerun an official book.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to call.

Thanks,
Monica Lande
