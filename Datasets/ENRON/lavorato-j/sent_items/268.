John,

Here are the simulations for:

Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
Roll to fill price gap

I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.


Normal Roll	No Roll		Fill Gap

   



Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.
