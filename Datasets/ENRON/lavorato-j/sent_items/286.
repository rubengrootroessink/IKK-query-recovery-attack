I think we are going to go back to the original Pebble Plan.  The 8th to the 11th.  Tych and Calger are O.K. with this.  There is a small chance that I will have to cancel or come back Saturday night but what the hell.
 
Let me know if you can do this and we will all attempt to arrange transportation.
 
John
 
P.S.  Sorry for the confusion.
