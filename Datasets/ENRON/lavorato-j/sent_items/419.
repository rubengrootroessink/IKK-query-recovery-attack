Mr. Lavorato:
 
I was given your name by Brian Edgeworth as a  possible contact for employment opportunities with Enron.  I was part of  Goldman Sachs C$ fixed income effort for four (4) years.  Goldman recently  decided to exit this business entirely.  I was involved in a  trading/capital markets role in both C$ corporate bonds and securitized  products.  I am interested in Enron because I believe it to be one of the  "smarter"  organizations out there.  I am flexible in terms of  location.  I have attached a copy of my resume for your  perusal.
 
I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.   I can be reached either via the phone number below or by replying to this  email.  I will attempt to contact you in the next couple  of days to confirm your receipt of this email.
 
Regards,
 
Robert Downer
