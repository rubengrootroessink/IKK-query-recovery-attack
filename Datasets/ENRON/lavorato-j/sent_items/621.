Joe

I once again asked about the committee.  I think Skilling, Delainey and Kean set up the committee and I'm told that there are going to be no changes.

You and I will need to go over your Vice Presidents prior to the meeting.

John,

Any word on whether I will get to participate in the Enron wide VP PRC?  As you know I served on the committee in past years and would like to continue to do so.  When you and Jeff Skilling were here in March, Miguel Padron and I raised this issue and Jeff acknowledged a need to consider my request.  You mentioned that you did not really have input into the list's composition and needed to figure it all out as well.

The kick off of the mid year PRC triggered my memory of this issue.

Thanks,

Kish
