John--
Assuming you get the o.k. on the work arrangement we discussed yesterday........

As a follow up to our discussions, particularly concerning working the second half of the day once each week, here is what I would propose:  Instead of working 4 half days in the morning and one half day in the afternoon/evening, I would work 3 half days in the morning (8-1) and one full day.  This way I would be available to meet with Geoff in the afternoon once each week.

Please let me know if this works and if the arrangement in general is acceptable to HR, Louise, etc.  Thanks.
