Dear John,
 
You do not know me, but I got your contact details  from Bruce Angus who I know from Kellogg as we both graduated in  1994.
 
The reason for this email is that I am very  interested in working in a management or business development position at Enron  Broadband Services in London. At the moment a headhunter is supposedly setting  up an appointment with Enron for me, but I believe it would be extremely useful  to approach you as well to speed up the process. Therefore I would really appreciate it if you could forward my details to  one of your colleagues in the US or the UK.
 
For your information please note that if you have a  look at my CV, you will see that my last two jobs were quite short. When I  joined eos internet ventures I knew I was taking a substantial risk, but  believed there was an opportunity due to the strong management, but  unfortunately we were not able to raise 2nd round funding. United Internet AG is  a German publicly traded company with 3000 employees and revenues of Euro 200  million. The Board decided to change the international strategy during my first  month of employment and offered me the temporary job (but minimum of 9 months)  of Head of Investor Relations for United Internet AG in Germany. I declined as I  was hired as MD in the UK and not Head of IR in Germany. In addition, I am  (still) happily married so I didn't want to travel between the 2 countries  for such a long time.
 
Anyway, it would be fantastic if you could help me  in any way and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me or  let me know if and when I can contact you.
 
Best wishes,
 
Eylard Wurpel
