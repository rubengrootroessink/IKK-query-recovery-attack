Michael -

Are these changes in the forward volumes (unrealized losses).  Can you explain the reason for these adjustments?  How much more exists that we need to address?

Thanks,
Rogers

20 Million !!!!!!  Is this back money or forward money.  Why did the volumes change so much.

We have re-priced Suiza, Packaged Ice, and Arch of Chicago with updated volume information from our billing system.  The impact is as follows:

 

The impact will be recognized on the DPR and G/L, pending Accounting Department's "green light."

Thank you.

Best regards,
