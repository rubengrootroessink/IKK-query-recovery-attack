Hi John,
I just got your e-mail address, thought I'd try it  out! I hope all is well, I hear you are doing great (reports from my father and  from Nana)!! Please say hi to Dina and Michael for us. We are doing well, just  had baby #2 and life is like a circus around here, two is a lot more challenging  than I ever imagined! Take care,
love
Christina
