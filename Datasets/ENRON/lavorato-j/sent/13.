John,

Sorry to bother you with this but, we are working with these cities to assess 
the extension of their gas supply contracts with Engage.

The price under the Engage contracts is effective July 1st - June 30th of 
each year and is based upon indices in the US Southwest and Alberta for the 
previous 12 months.  Thus, we can project the price for the contract and 
compare it to our forward curve (at AECO) to determine the best course of 
action:  extend or terminate.

The following summarizes the comparative pricing I need.  If the analysis 
indicates that these contracts should be terminated, Enron would be in a 
position to supply gas to these entities at AECO.

Quantity:    8,000 MMBtu/d baseload
Term:     July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2001
Delivery Point:   NIT (AECO)
Pricing:    Fixed in $US/MMBtu

Thanks for your help,

Laird
