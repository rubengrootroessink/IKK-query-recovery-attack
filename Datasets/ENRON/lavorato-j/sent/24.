Subject: Recent Senior ENA Personnel Changes

Please be aware of the following senior personnel departures from ENA which 
have occurred in the last two weeks:

Craig Childers - Effective February 1, 2000, Craig has joined Enron Energy 
Services.


Kevin McConville - has left the Company effective immediately. Please direct 
all business related questions to Greg Whalley.   If you need to contact 
Kevin, please call me first.   Although news of his departure is not 
sensitive, as with all employee departures, please refrain from any 
additional commentary and make every effort to discourage any of your direct 
reports from open discussion of the subject.


Mike McCall - has left the Company effective immediately.   The company 
policy generally is not to provide any type of reference for former 
employees.  Mike has requested that we respond to such requests as he seeks 
other employment.  Consequently, in the event that any external party should 
inquire as to Mike's position at Enron, please refer them to me, and on no 
account should you make any commentary about his departure from the company.

Your cooperation is appreciated.


David
