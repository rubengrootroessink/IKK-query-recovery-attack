John, I need your help again.  Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting 
to move to level 14.  There are several problems with this move.


1.  This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to 
support them.
 a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).
 b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more 
cabling for the turrets.
  There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling
 c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer 
manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.
  The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in 
late December.
  Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.

2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.
 a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.

3.  The Response Time would be affected.
 a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA 
trading floors.
  A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, 
Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.
  Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs 
for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.
 b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on 
Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.
  The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.

4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be 
susceptible to power outages.


I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to 
move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been 
completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is 
also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with 
Trading Desk furniture as well.

My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; 
this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to 
convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

Thanks,
