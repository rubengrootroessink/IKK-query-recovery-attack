John,

Just to keep you in the loop.  I've been asked to assist with this effort.  I 
am more than happy to do so.  I'm going to use consultants and charge it 
directly to Enron Canada.

Beth

Mark and Beth;

Further to our discussions, I have followed up with Beth to talk about 
resources to build the Enron Canada retail business.  She has suggested the 
we use Cap Gemini to help convert Daniel's systems for the Canadian 
business.  I have also given Beth a name of a systems guy that came 
recommended that would be an employee here to help translate the differences 
in the markets and would ultimately be the Dan Maitland of Canada to look 
after the product as we build the business.

I think that it would be very helpful to have Daniel involved in the scoping 
due to his familiarity with the systems and the settlement requirements with 
the wires and pipes companies.  If Daniel could direct the development out of 
London, that would be great as well.  I heard that he did a great job on the 
Spanish effort.

Dave Delainey and John Lavorato are supportive of building this business here 
and the Canadian president(Rob Milnthorp) is also keen to grow this 
business.  I think that we can be much more effective using the UK systems 
than trying to build our own from scratch.  I would rather build this without 
looking to the EES IT resources out of Houston, as I believe that we will be 
more successful importing the latest ED systems and modifying them for this 
market in time for market opening--just 2 months away.

I really appreciate your help on this, and hope that we can work together to 
deliver another success to Enron as a whole.  I'm sure glad that I know you 
guys as I know that I will end up with a product that works for us.  Don't 
worry, I will not try any coding myself.

Best regards to you both, and I hope you are staying DRY in wet old London 
Mark.

Cheers,

Dave
