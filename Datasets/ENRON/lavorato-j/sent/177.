John,
I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator for the Associate and Analyst Program.  
Attached is a list of incoming Analyst that will begin next Monday and are 
scheduled to go into the Trading organization per a resume review you had 
done .  We are trying to identify exactly who these people will need to 
report too in order to communicate to the Analyst and to also update our 
database with correct rotation information.  We would like to tell the 
Analyst exactly where they would go by Monday 17th.  Can you please advise me 
on who I need to contact in the Trading orgainzation in order to get these 
final placements made?  

Thank you,
Jana
