Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto  (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan 
under the following  conditions.

1 -  Volumes will not fall.  In fact they will increase.

2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then 
East Power will have no Emmisions Positions,

3 -  Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.

4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer 
pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not 
keeping.

Give me a call if there are any issues.
