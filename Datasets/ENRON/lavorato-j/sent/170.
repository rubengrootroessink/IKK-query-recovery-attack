I would like to request a temporary increase of the Natural Gas var limit for 
the next 10 business days.  I suggest Natural Gas Trading's limit increase to 
45 Million limit from the current 40 Million limit.  The floor is very 
bullish and we don't want to take off our West Basis positions which are 
eating up a lot of var.

Please advise.
