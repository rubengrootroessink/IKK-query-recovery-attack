We will wear the ICAP position with the following marks that represent the 
true mid.

 2001 2.00 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2002 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2003 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)

These new marks result in $9 million of incremental value that will hit 
Dana's P&L tonight.   Based on our discussion earlier, East Power (Dana 
specifically) is now fully wearing this position and fully assumes all 
downside and upside associated with the position.
