David

I'm going to extend and offer to someone who currently works at Koch.  I will 
extend the offer at the Director level but this person could easily pass as a 
Vice President.  I think I need to add some stock or options to the offer.  
Can you please advise me on how I can accomplish this.

Thanks

John Lavorato
