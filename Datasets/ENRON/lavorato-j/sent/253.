In the fundamentals group under Hunter, there is also research going on 
regarding LNG, and distillates, (and gas, weather, etc).  Vikas' background 
is in crude and products, and worked at Aquiva with two of Lagrasta's 
marketers.  I agreed to take him (6 months ago) and was planning for him to 
research crude/products.  Celeste Roberts knows the conversations we had with 
Vikas in particular becuase he wanted to start meeting people in my group and 
originally did not come through the associate program, where we finally put 
him, and she was involved from the beginning.  Li Sun is a Wharton MBA that 
Lavo did not originally pick when he went through the list with you, and was 
slated to go elsewhere.    I picked her up, after that, and she too is 
someone about whom Celeste and I had many conversations. I had met her last 
summer, and at Wharton recruiting events.  Prior to John's coming down 
Celeste and I had agreed she could come into my organization (gas) to do 
research, or to work with Vince--she is an unbelievable modeler.  I have no 
idea who the other two are or where they are going, and have not met either 
of them.  

I suspect now that we have delineated recruiting and staffing, which occurred 
recently, we won't have this confusion among the associate program 
administrators again.  

Not trying to kill you,

Jeff

Jeff, you are killing me - we targeted that group specifically to build the 
risk business in gas and east power in the short run.  This was well planned 
effort.

Dave and John, I spoke to Jeff Shenkman and he has indicated that the 
following new associates are to support him in his role in Global Markets:

Dustin Collins
Vikas Dwivedi
Li Sun

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are 
identified in our system.

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact 
with Jeff regarding these associates supporting him.

Dave, can we discuss this matter?  I can be reached at 713/853-7351.  My 
pager # is 1-800-980-1665.  Thanks.
