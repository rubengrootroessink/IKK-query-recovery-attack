John,

Hunter Shively needs Doyle Baughman to monitor the construction of a pipeline 
in the U.S.  Doyle has done this for us in the past.

The terms of the agreement are as follows:

1st month $10,000 + expenses
2nd+ months $  9,000 + expenses

Hunter anticipates that we will use Doyle for several months.  We can 
terminate our agreement at anytime.

Regards,
Brad
