Subject: The Enron Corporate Policy Committee Retreat

Ken and Jeff have decided that the Enron Executive Committee Retreat will 
include only the Corporate Policy Committee this year.  (See list of members 
below.)  You may be holding the timeframe of January 16-18, 2001 on your 
calendar, which you can now free up if you are not on the committee.

The location of the retreat is under consideration.  When a decision is made, 
we will get the information to the members of the Corporate Policy 
Committee.  Departure for the retreat will be early afternoon on Tuesday, 
January 16 with return to Houston late afternoon on Thursday, January 18.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions at 713-853-6088.
