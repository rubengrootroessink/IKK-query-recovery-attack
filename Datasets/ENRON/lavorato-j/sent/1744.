Mr. Lavorato,

As a member of the VP  PRC Committee you have been selected to attend ESA BU 
PRC meeting on December 1, 2000 in Sao Paulo.   You'll be responsible for 
attending and participating in the VP pre-ranking  portion of this meeting.  
The PRC team or the appropriate HR rep will contact you with additional 
details the exact time of that part of the meeting.

We realize you may have some scheduling difficulties, kindly review your 
calendar and let us know whether you may be able to attend the scheduled 
meeting.  In the event that you cannot, we will try to adjust the schedule or 
assignments.

The Calendar of meetings is attached for your information.

The VP MD PRC Committee will likely be reconvened shortly so that we can 
review  the roles and responsibilities of the Committee members.  We will 
keep you apprised of this meeting as details develop.

Lastly, as you know, the final VP PRC meetings will be held on January 5 and 
8 at the St. Regis Hotel in Houston.  Additional details on these meetings 
will also be forthcoming.

Should you have any questions or concerns; please do not hesitate to contact 
me or David Oxley directly.

Many thanks,

Gina Corteselli,
 Enron  Global Performance Management
