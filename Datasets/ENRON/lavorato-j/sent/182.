Why don't you take a stab at the disaster plan.

I agree with Jeff - we need to have a more concrete plan and capability. Let 
me know what you want me to do.

I think it's time to review our disaster plan with respect to trading as we 
enter hurrincane season.  As I understand, there is no real cohesive plan, or 
course of action.  We could think about the Chicago office as an evacuation 
site for redundant trading, etc. This issue affects all businesses, and Sally 
and I have been talking about this problem.  John, should I get in touch with 
Phillippe or do anything else? 

Jeff
