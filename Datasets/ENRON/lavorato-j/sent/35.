Can you type up thank you letters for me.


Dear xxxx

I would like to thank you for your generous donation to The Order of Good 
Cheer fundraising effort.  Our organization raised over $200,000 for the 
Enviros Program.  The money was much needed and will allow this wonderful 
program to continue to improve the lives of young Calgarians who have 
experienced hardship.

Yours Truly





John Lavorato.
