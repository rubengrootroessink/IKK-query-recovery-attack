Hi Kim!  Why don't you just give it to Jennifer.  I have several others to 
pick up on that floor and I can just stop by her desk.  Thanks a bunch for 
handling this for me.  (Just as a FYI - I am now in EB4939)

Susan,

I have $50 for you from John.  Would you like for me to have it delivered to 
you or would you like to come by and pick it up?

If you would like it delivered, please let me know what your new EB location 
is.

Thanks

Thank you very much for your support of me and Enron in the annual Summer 
Stroll for Epilepsy.   The event took place this past Saturday and was a lot 
of fun.  Your generous donation of $50 enabled me to pass my personal goal of 
$3,000 by $65. Thank you!!

We have been asked to collect the money by Friday, May 19, so if you will 
call me once your check is ready, I will be glad to pick it up.  Please make 
your check payable to the Epilepsy Foundation.  Thank you again for your 
donation and support!
