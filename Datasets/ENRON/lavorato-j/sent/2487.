All;

As requested yesterday in the VP PRC Committee meeting, the following 
comprises a list of your Business Unit VP's who have  either not accessed 
HRGIS or not fully completed the required information. The following 
information is considered critical for PRC profiles:-

- Current Responsibilities (VP to input info)
- Date of Promotion to VP (VP to audit info for accuracy)
- Date of Hire (VP to audit info for accuracy)
- Photo


Access information:

To access HRGIS, via the HRWeb intranet site, the employee will need to use 
their SSN (no dashes) as the Logon ID, and their password is their data of 
birth YYYY/MM/DD. 

Please contact me if you have any questions or need further information. 
Thanks in advance, 

Gina Corteselli
