I wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week.  
Although I am definately not getting brave, I would like to request an extra 
15 Million for gas for the next week.  The price levels are making it hard to 
eliminate risk.  I can give you my assurance that any increase in VAR day to 
day will come from price movement, not increase in position.  

Let me know 

John
