If you bring Dina some cheesey (spelling) 80's movie on DVD like "16 Candles" 
she would be in heaven.  We got a crazy cold spell last week but it should be 
gone when you come.  In case you guys want to go to a nice place to eat you 
might want to bring some casual pants but for the most part jeans should be 
fine.
