My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well 
with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are 
very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should 
slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.  
I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on 
International business.

John
