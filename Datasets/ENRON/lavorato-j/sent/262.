We can make this even simpler.  All broker trades are confirmed the next 
day.  We would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which 
is rare and all marketer deals.  If we do this we might consider keeping the 
tapes for a longer period because only the confirming part would be on tape.  

Please advise.
