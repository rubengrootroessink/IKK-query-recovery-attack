Barry,

FYI the California QF's are negotiating a settlement deal with Edison and the 
state of California which would fix energy payments over five years.  
Currently the energy payments are indexed to Socal Border because a majority 
of the Edison QF's buy spot gas.  If this settlement happens, the QF's will 
likely want to buy financial swaps.  The Edison gas-fired QF's represent 
about 500MMCF/Day of gas.

Chris
