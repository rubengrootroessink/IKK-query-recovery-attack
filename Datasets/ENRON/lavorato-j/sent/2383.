Same a mid year

I'm smarter than everyone else.

Just in Case

*  Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits 
taken) - probably not due to me.
*  Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there.
*  Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to 
turn it back.
*  Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying.
* Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in 
the future and every company is copying.
*  Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in 
Houston.
*  Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought 
traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has 
bought into.  The future success is unclear but the exercise was very 
worthwhile.
*  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and 
reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and 
the risk group.
*  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the 
continuation of the increase in Gas.
*  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank 
that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.
*  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours 
devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this 
implemented in 2001.
*  Experimented with the "Pay PRC"  which I think was very successful.  I 
think this will start our organization to think a little differently and 
hopefully in a way that will benefit us.
*  Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".

I'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in 
months I realized that I was smiling while I was writing.

Regards

John
