	[IMAGE]		  [IMAGE] With the warm weather and longer days, you don't want to spend all your time in the kitchen or the store.   So why not take advantage of summer fruits and vegetables and make some delicious salads the whole family can enjoy.  Consider adding sweet corn (sliced off the cob), mushrooms, olives, nuts or raisins to your favorite salad for a little bit of a change.  Canned tuna or grilled salmon also taste great on top of a salad!
