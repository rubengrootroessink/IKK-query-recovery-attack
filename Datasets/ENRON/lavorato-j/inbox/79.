John,
Attached for your review is the process that I am pursuing at Mariner.  I
would like to discuss it with you tomorrow if you are available in person or
by phone.

Also, it appears that Mariner has another discovery in its Swordfish
prospect.  The results from the 1st well are positive and we are preparing
to drill the 2nd well in the next few days.  Second well will be down around
Christmas.  A definitive economic impact is impossible to provide at this
point but could be in the $15-$25 million range +.

Scott
