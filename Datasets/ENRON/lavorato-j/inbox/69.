John-

Late October, Enron announced a change in the administrator for the Enron Savings Plan (our 401(k)s) and locked us out from making any changes in our asset allocations or contribution rules until November 20. This has generated an awful lot of resentment and deep conspiracy theories. Can you ask the Board to offer a remedy to those affected by this?
