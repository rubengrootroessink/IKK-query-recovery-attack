Hi John,

We have now a total of 29 people interviewing for the trading track with potentially another 5( first round screens taking place today).   I have 29 interviewers from you... assuming they don't cancel, I am still short on interviewers.  Please advise on additional names you would like to particpate.

Thanks,

Karen B.
