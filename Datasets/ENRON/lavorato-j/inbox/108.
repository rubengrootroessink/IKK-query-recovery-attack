The settlement with TBG has been completed.  We will be making a payment to TBG of $1.8 million on December 7.

New Agreement

Same term - Sept 30, 2004
Terminate oud documents and replace with Master EnFolio
Sell 12,500 MMbtu per day baseload - No swing quantites, and purchase is no longer tied to power production at TBG plant.
Enron has multiple delivery points and price protection for specific delivery location
$1.8 million payment is less then possible amount due to TBG at end of year under current contract terms under "true up" provision.
