yes, i went over it with Errol.  The positive value I gave you was change in existing deals versus liquidations.  The only value you should have received was curveshift.

I arrived early today hoping to catch you.  I don't know if you've looked at your packet to see the $5 million correction I made to your Canadian Gas Daily, I wanted to fess up to this mistake in person.  There is a note on your packet, if you need to talk to me about it, please call me.
