EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Senator Keeley Spearheads a New "Plan B"
State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E Bankruptcy

Keeley's Collective "Plan B"
Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed=
 out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan "as =
soon as possible"; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is n=
ot this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republi=
cans were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so th=
ey developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).  H=
owever, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough Repub=
lican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much tough=
er fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will be =
able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people w=
ho would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.=
  Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez "Plan B's," Keeley's=
 new plan is said to:
Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their unde=
rcollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to "high-end cust=
omers."  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who would =
not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate compon=
ent is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to 12 y=
ears.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate component f=
or SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B that =
will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional ded=
icated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough to co=
ver the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forward pu=
rchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation sho=
uld be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key question=
 becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of power is h=
igh, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to continue oper=
ating.
The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission asset=
s) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan would=
 be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return on th=
e transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an inc=
entive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it wou=
ld not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, the v=
alue would be credited toward the loan.
In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the fil=
ed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native power =
generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would have t=
o pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for direc=
t access to power.
If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the=
 constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go fo=
rward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that=
 the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollec=
t.  Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transm=
ission assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets =
would become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constit=
utional.

Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of Bankruptcy
Today, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding "Plan B" and t=
he legislature.   Currently, the legislature is NOT considering offering Ke=
eley's "Plan B" solution to PG&E.  If the Plan B mentioned above passes the=
 Senate, it is more likely that the state will purchase PG&E out of bankrup=
tcy.  Both the Assembly and the Senate leadership are talking seriously abo=
ut purchasing PG&E out of bankruptcy, though the Republicans remain strongl=
y opposed.  The state then, would likely sell off pieces of PG&E (except fo=
r the transmission assets, which it would retain).
