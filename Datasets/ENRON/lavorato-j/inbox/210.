Guys, I think Don has a good idea here - but it needs to be managed prudently.

a) Mark who do we talk with in Dynegy to inform them that we are selling or otherwise disposing of material contracts or assets of EES?
b) Jeremy, it is important to have a view on the viability of getting these customers to agree to an assignment and releasing us on confidentiality issues so that we can approach dealers/producers/utilities with a tight book?
c) Vicki, clearly legal issues on the contract (ie) confidentiality, assignability, DASRing or assignment in a post non-deregulated California, etc.

These issues need to be vetted before we approach any producers.

The idea is to raise significant cash quickly

Please respond ASAP.

Regards
Delainey

Over $50mm listed below.

I think Sempra or one of the producers would have interest in buying these contracts (obviously with a haircut)

I will wait to hear from you how to move forward. Thanks
