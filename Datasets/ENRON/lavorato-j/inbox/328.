Dear John,

Dina's returns are leaving our offices today by courier so you should have
them tomorrow.  The only year for which there is an amount owing is 1998 -
including interest and penalties, the total is $34 US.

Please contact Laurie Pare (403) 509-7569 or myself if you have any
questions or concerns.

Best regards,

Judy Perdomo
