John,
 
The attached is the interview schedule.    We have 33 people confirmed for interview (with 1 still awaiting confirmation).    Hopefully you can make the de-brief, scheduled fro 5.15 pm at the Double Tree, Dover Room (as before).     If you can't, sending your guys a note in advance might be helpful to keep them on track.
 
Attached is the schedule (still missing one interviewer which we will finalise tomorrow).
 
Thanks,
 
Karen
