Dear Morningstar.com Premium Member:

With the market gyrating more than usual, monitoring your investments
in a timely fashion has never been more critical.

We can't do anything about the market (though we wish we could).
However, you've made it easy for you to monitor the stocks and funds
in your portfolio--and those you've earmarked as prospective
opportunities. Just go to:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/Sub_center.html?memail=alert112701p

Then tell us what you want to receive. Here's a quick rundown:

NEW PORTFOLIO ALERTS
Exclusively for Premium Members, these Alerts report on the
performance of your portfolio in five areas: Asset Allocation,
Investment Style Box, Mutual Fund Expense Ratio, Stock Overlap, and
Stock Sector. You decide the lower and upper limits in each of these
areas and we notify you when they hit your low and high targets.
Where to find them:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/xrayalerts.html?memail=alert112701p


NEW INTRADAY PRICE QUOTE ALERT
Alerts you to changes during the day, while the market is open. You
set an upper and lower limit for stocks, ETFs, and closed-end funds.
We e-mail you when a price goes above or below your limits. (You can
use this alert for open-end funds, too. Since these are priced once a
day, at the end, you'll receive an alert at the close of the day.)
Ideal for keeping an eye on investments and prospects in today more
volatile market. Where to find it:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/intraday.html?memail=alert112701p


STOCK AND FUND ALERTS
Alerts you to changes in any of the 35 different criteria you set.
You can ask for alerts on stocks and funds in your portfolio. You can
also ask for alerts on stocks and funds you just want to keep an eye
on. It's a convenient way to watch over your holdings--and to be in a
position to take action on potential investments of interest to you.
Where to find them:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/sfalerts.html?memail=alert112701p


PORTFOLIO UPDATE
Updates the value of each of your portfolio holdings every evening
after the markets close. Also provides you with links to news stories
about your holdings. It's another quick, simple way to keep up with
your investments--even if you don't have time to be online during the
day. Where to find it:

Our completely revamped and improved alerts are among the most
sophisticated on the Web. So, give them a try now at:
