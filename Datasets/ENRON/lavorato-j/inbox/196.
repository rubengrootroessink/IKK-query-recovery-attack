Plan is to pull Accounting, RAC, IT, Back Office, HR, Research, EES, EEL, EBS, etc., names today. I was assuming you could just give me EA names minus ENW, Colwell, HR, and accounting, which I would get from functional leads.  I've told most people this may be roughly 10% but in some case it should be 0% others maybe deeper (maybe up to 20%).

We can go over list this evening and make changes.

Remember logic is:

People we need to help us through bankruptcy
People who are critical to core business which would otherwise hamper our ability to sell/operate
People who could easily get other jobs
People who are critical to keeping lights on
People with critical knowledge on deals/transaction we need to manage or unwind in next 2/3 months.

Top analysts and associates - we have started ranking and will be finished today.

What is Beck's list and does it include IT or is it the list we did?

Power Scheduling too.

...some bonuses this week (with some reclaw plus penalty), putting aside yourselves, the guys we already took care of, Colwell, Headicke, Beck and my people, is there anyone else in EA you would like to make a case to pay?

Plan today is to get these names and proposed numbers pulled together for Greg this evening. Plan was to ask Colwell, Headicke etc., separately, if you want to review their names I can let you see them later tonight.

I plan to sit over in old building (16.71) and do this this afternoon noon till 5pm. You can either call me on my cell or have Jeanie walk list across.
