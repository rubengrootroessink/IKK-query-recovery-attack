Interesting idea.  Here are some of the issues we would need to think about.
California - since Direct Access is suspended, we would need to evaluate that the  assignment would void our   contract ( at least one commissioner at the PUC is still trying to further  limit DA ).  would need to check with our DASR team to see what restrictions exist on DASRing
Assignment - the contracts generally would require consent to assignment by the customer
confidentiality - may need consent of the customer to show the contract to the seller
DYNEGY - would need Dynegy consent to the sale
Other - issues may exist after we read the contracts.  At least one of the customers on this list is bankrupt (Paradise Textille).

I'll wait for some business direction before we start anything. 

Thanks. Vicki

Guys, I think Don has a good idea here - but it needs to be managed prudently.

a) Mark who do we talk with in Dynegy to inform them that we are selling or otherwise disposing of material contracts or assets of EES?
b) Jeremy, it is important to have a view on the viability of getting these customers to agree to an assignment and releasing us on confidentiality issues so that we can approach dealers/producers/utilities with a tight book?
c) Vicki, clearly legal issues on the contract (ie) confidentiality, assignability, DASRing or assignment in a post non-deregulated California, etc.

These issues need to be vetted before we approach any producers.

The idea is to raise significant cash quickly

Please respond ASAP.

Regards
Delainey

Over $50mm listed below.

I think Sempra or one of the producers would have interest in buying these contracts (obviously with a haircut)

I will wait to hear from you how to move forward. Thanks
