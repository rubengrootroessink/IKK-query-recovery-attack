A MESSAGE FROM DOUG SPEERS, MBA 1970, CEO OF EMCO LIMITED AND
CHAIR OF THE IVEY ALUMNI ASSOCIATION BOARD

Dear John,

I am writing today to introduce an exciting new initiative from the Advancement Department at the Ivey Business School in conjunction with the Ivey Alumni Association Board that will benefit all members of the Ivey community. It's our new on line service called eZone!!

Collaboration is the hallmark of an Ivey Business School education. eZone offers us the ability to collaborate with members of one of the premier associations of business leaders in the world - the Ivey Alumni Network. A little further below, you will see the address for the website and the username and password that you need to log in.

CONNECT WITH CLASSMATES
My Communities is where we'll be able to have online discussions, share ideas and build relationships with classmates and other members of the Ivey Community. Send a request for a new community to Ivey Advancement today!

BUILD YOUR NETWORK
Turn to My Directory to locate a classmate or other member of the Ivey Alumni Network, or to find out how to contact a member of Ivey Faculty or Staff - for the first time, eZone brings together all members of the Ivey Community: Alumni, Students, Faculty and Staff.

MANAGE YOUR CAREER
Click on My Career to post a resume, to view online job postings targeted to Ivey Alumni, and to link to Global Workplace, a unique service open only to alumni from many of the world's premier business schools. Global Workplace gives you access to a worldwide database of senior executive appointments and automatic notification of relevant opportunities.

READ THE NEWS FROM AN IVEY PERSPECTIVE
On the eZone homepage, take note of Ivey in the News. There you will find links to articles about Ivey Alumni and the School that have appeared in the media, and see which of your classmates has been appointed to a new position.

UPDATE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION
Community is not something we can take for granted. With the job market facing such uncertainty, it is very important for Ivey Alumni to be able to contact and network with one another. Take a minute today to update your particulars by clicking on My Information in the upper right hand portion of the screen - and don't forget to check the box beside Publish.

Of course YOU CONTROL what information other members of the Ivey network can view about you, but we'll all benefit from a robust Alumni Directory.

Take a few moments and look at eZone today!!

Navigate to http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/ezone and use your username and password to start to benefit from this excellent site
