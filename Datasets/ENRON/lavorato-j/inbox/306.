John,
 
He travels periodically to
Houston. I may inquire about his next trip.
 
If you want to speak to him urgently, I can arrange 
a phone interview or invite him to Houston. 
 
Vince

I would love to talk to him.  Does he live in France.  Is it easier for him to work in London. If not I would be happy to do a phone interview.
 
Please advise

John, 

I am not sure if I have already sent you this resume. 
Please, take a  look at it. I met Claude a few years ago 
and was greatly impressed by him. He may be a good candidate to 
work with Andy Zipper.
