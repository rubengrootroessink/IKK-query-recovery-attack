Does not do much for balance sheet or to improve liquidity.  Only mitigates credit risks.

If Petrocanada posts with us.  Does that do any thing for our balance sheet or our ability to post more l/c's.

This is top exposure by Counterparty and an Enron entity level.  This does not take into account OTM positions with affiliates.  Be aware the data is a direct download from the risk systems and has not been checked for accuracy.

We are still scrubbing the data for assignment opportunities to reduce margin positions.  We will brief you sometime tomorrow.
