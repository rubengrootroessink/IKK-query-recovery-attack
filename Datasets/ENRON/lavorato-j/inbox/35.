Per your request, I eliminated Gas Desk employees from the spreadsheet.

David -

Can you ask Tom to delete gas desk employees and their supply deals that had no origination?  We only want a list of EES originators.

Attached is a query from the Retail Gas System which includes all retail Gas deals done in 2001 by originator name.  Also attached is a copy of the Sutter Health deal ticket done on 5/30/2001.
