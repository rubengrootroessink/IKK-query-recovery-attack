Ken would like to continue the meeting tomorrow with all the people that were in the meeting today.  I am adding Jim Derrick to the list as he wasn't able to attend today.  If I have forgotten anyone, please let me know.

The only available time Ken has is 10:30 a.m. tomorrow morning and the meeting will be in EB50M03. 

If Rick wants to call in, the number is 713-853-4539.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Rosie
