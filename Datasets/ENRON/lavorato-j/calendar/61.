Kim,

Here is our revised budget file.  Let me know if John needs anything else ahead of the Wednesday call.

Thanks,

Kish

 

Per Orlando Gonzalez request, please find attached a draft of the ESA presentation to be delivered to Jeff Skilling in his upcoming trip to Brazil.  Please note that some of the slides are still being updated.  Orlando will be calling you to follow up with any potential comments you may have.
Thank you very much.
Erwin
