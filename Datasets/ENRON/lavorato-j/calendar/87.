Kim, Sheila would like to meet with John Lavorato for about 30 minutes
on Monday, if possible.  The topic is VP salaries.  Would you please
let me know when he is free?  She has available the following times:

	11:00 (this would work best, if he is free then, since she is already on your floor for a 10:00 meeting in 3321)
	1:00
	1:30
	3:00
	3:30
	4:00

Thanks so much, Kim!
