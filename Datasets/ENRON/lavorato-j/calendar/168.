Gentlemen,

On Thursday, June 21st, Steve Lowden, Sr. VP Bus Dev with Marathon Oil, will be in our offices to discuss opportunities between Enron and Marathon (MRO).  He and I have discussed three main areas of intial focus (i) joint venture of MRO's production with Enron's trading/risk management capabilities, (ii) LNG, and (iii) power generation opportunities around their refineries.  He will also have two other people with him whose names have not yet been provided.  The agenda is outlined below.  I have coordinated with your assistants and these appointments should be on your calendar.

	11:00	Greg Whalley - Macro Discussion
	11:30	John Lavorato - Marketing/Trading Discussion
	12:00	Tim Detmering - Business Development, Asset Divestitures
	1:00	Les Webber - LNG Discussion
	1:30	Trading Floor Tour
	2:00	Dave Duran - Power Generation Discussion

With the exception of the meetings with Greg and John, the meetings will be held in EB 3335.  Briefing materials on MRO are being prepared and should be delivered to each of you no later than Tuesday morning. I will be happy to meet with you to discuss the materials or pursue any questions that may arise.  I have heard MRO's President, Clarence Cazelot, publicly describe Enron as a company to emulate. MRO is in transition as it is moving out from under the US Steel (USX) umbrella.  Cazelot and Lowden have been  interested in meeting with Enron.  Maybe there is an opportunity to do something with them.  

Thanks,
