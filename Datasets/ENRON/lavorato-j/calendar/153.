The front end of the simulated trading in EOL is set up now. In order to get all the bridging done into the downstream systems (TAGG), it looks like Monday, July 30th is the latest that the deals will be able to bridge directly into the system (hopefully sooner). There are a few more details I need from you guys.
1. It appears that the desk heads are also going to have a simulated book. Will these books be used to trade other commodities, and do they need to be calced by other commodity groups risk groups?
2. Is there anyone besides the desk heads and trading track people that we will need to set up books for beyond the ones that we have already talked about? 
Thanks
