Kalen/Kim;

This is to confirm that Mr. Belden, Mr. Lavorato and Mr. Cox will be attending the EES PRC on 12 July as PRC Committee observers.  Their primary responsibility is to observe the VP portion of your meeting in preparation for the VP PRC on 23 July.

To this end, may I ask you to contact their assistants (CC'd above) to advise of the location of the meeting and the approximate time the VP's will be discussed?  
Many thanks in advance, 

Gina

Kimberly;

This is to confirm Mr. Lavorato's  attendance as a VP PRC Committee observer to the following meeting:

?	EES VP PRC on 12 July  beginning at 8:00 am (location TBD)

EES HR will provide you with additional details on the location of this  meeting.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  

Regards,

Gina
