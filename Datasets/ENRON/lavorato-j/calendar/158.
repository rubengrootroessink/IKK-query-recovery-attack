Edineth,

John asked if we could move this meeting to tomorrow.  I know that Joe would like to have it today, however, with the current PRC meetings, John is extremely booked today.

Could Joe do it tomorrow at the same time, 9:00 am?

Please advise, and sorry for the inconvience.

John is only available at 9:00 am.  Please let Joe know that I did try and contact him back on Tuesday and appologize for missing him.

Confirm for me the 9:00 am and have Joe call John.  I will put it on John's calendar.

Thanks
