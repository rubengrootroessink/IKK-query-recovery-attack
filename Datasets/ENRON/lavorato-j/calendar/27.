Attached are 3 org charts.  The first is our current structure, page 2 is what I would recommend to you and page 3 is the other practical alternative.

Please call me at 011-528-152-2401 if you have any questions.

There's no new info on my front, but I'll let you know as soon as I hear something either way.

Best regards - Max
