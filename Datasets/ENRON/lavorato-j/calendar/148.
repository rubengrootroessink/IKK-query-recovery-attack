Everyone -

I understand we are in front of a customer, ANC-Rexam, discussing potential contract renegotiation structures and language.  I would like to temporarily stop dicussions until we can review what our legal position is regarding our current contract with ANC-Rexam and the associated strategy we are following in our current contract renegotiation discussions.  EWS Risk should have the current positions and values ready on Monday afternoon so I suggest we meet then.  

I will have Kim Hillis coordinate a time and location for Monday.

Thanks,
