Per our discussion, the following meeting has been scheduled.  Michael Miller will be calling into the meeting.  When I contacted Hope Vargas' office, her assistant said she had a conflict at 4:00.  I left Ms. Vargas a voice mail stating that this meeting needed to occur today and asked that she rearrange her schedule so she could attend the meeting.  I'm waiting to hear back from her.

Place:		EB3308 (Mr. Lavorato's office)
