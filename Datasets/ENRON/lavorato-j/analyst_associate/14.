John,
I could use one or two interns / associates for the Summer.  It will be a great way for them to see how the trading side of our business relates to the physical delivery on the grid.  I have discussed this with Lloyd Will and it fill a need I face in light of the new "Services" group.  I will probably lose two of my regular schedulers to that group, and another (Maria Valdes) to help trade various Cinergy positions as per Fletch.  

Thanks,

Corry Bentley
