John

I have 3 new associates coming into the group between now and July (includi=
ng one person from the Trading Track program), for a total of six assigned =
to me. I'll have 2 to 3 spots available in Sept./Oct. and then another 2 to=
 3 next Jan./Feb.. Five or Six associates at a time seem to be the most eff=
ective number for our group.

I've turned down a large number of good candidates lately due to availabili=
ty. Let me know if you're expecting our group to accommodate more or if you=
 need spaces reserved for Trading Track participants.

Thx

Berney
