Based on current deal flow, I need 2 analysts and 2 associates on my team.


I currently have 2 associates - 1 to be promoted to Manager at mid-year and the other to possibly rotate at end of Q3. I would like to replace both spots as they become available
.
I currently have 1 analyst who will be with me through the end of the year and am in the process of interviewing 2 others for the remaining spot.
