John,
ECR currently has 2 analysts and 0 associates.  Our 2 analysts are rotating this summer.  We are actively pursuing 2-3 analysts and 2 associates.  We have met with Billy Lemmons and are currently working within the existing A/A pool as well as checking leads on outside prospects.  We would like to review the resumes of the new A/A's to see if there is a fit in ECR.  We are less interested in a summer hire but would take someone if you need a place to put them.
Let me know if you need anything else,
Scott

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,


John
