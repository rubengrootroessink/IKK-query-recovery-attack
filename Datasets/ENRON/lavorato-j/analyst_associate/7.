hen you can.
Regards,
Ed    =20

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associate=
s and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will =
then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the =
ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portla=
nd have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me kno=
w if this is incorrect). =20

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you d=
on't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with =
your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,


John
