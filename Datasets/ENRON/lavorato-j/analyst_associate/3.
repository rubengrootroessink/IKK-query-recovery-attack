John,

I have no need to increase the size of the group (in fact, with the departure of Robert Greer and Anna Briggs, we've actually downsized a bit).

I have one Associate rotating out in the summer but have already identified his replacement.  In terms of Analysts, we have two rotating out in the summer, but we really prefer analysts with a year of experience and will take our chances identifying and hiring them.

No need for summer A/A's.  Not likely to be a really busy time for us this year.

Regards,

MLM

I asked everyone for their A/A needs and received very little feedback.  Please respond promptly.


Thanks
