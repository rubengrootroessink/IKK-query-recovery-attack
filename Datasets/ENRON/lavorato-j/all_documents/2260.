John,

I have attached some updated appendices from last May's Ontario Electricity 
Supply & Demand report created by Eric LeDain.  Unfortunately, the IMO has 
not updated the Monthly Generation by Type, Monthly Imports & Exports by 
Intertie and the Nuclear Performance Reports.

In early November, we had requested all IMO Transition Information be 
updated.  To date, the IMO has only updated hourly demand information.  As we 
continue to pressure the IMO, more information will be available.

Updates were made on the following appendices:

1. Ontario Net Exports/Imports - January 1997 through August of 2000

2. Scatter Diagram of Load and Cooling Degree Days

3. Ontario Average Peak Demand at each Temperature 1998, 1999, and 2000 
(through the month of October)

4. Peak Supply and Demand 2001,2002, & 2003



I would like to submit a complete report when the IMO Transition Information 
is updated.

Toronto is great.  We have a quality team here. I'm am anxious for the market 
to open.
