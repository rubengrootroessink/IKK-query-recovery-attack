Subject: Possibility of Delay in Alberta Restructuring

Rob, I spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD on Friday and specifically asked if 
the Government was considering a delay of its restructuring timetable to: 1) 
address concerns of consumers that it is impossible for them to make a choice 
of supplier prior to November 1, 2000, and/or 2) to give time to develop a 
workable Plan B.  Larry was adamant that there will be no delay in Alberta 
and said there is no point in any stakeholder even proposing a delay because 
it such a proposal was a "non-starter" and won't happen.  He told me during 
the discussion that investors will not invest in a jurisdiction where the 
government does not follow through with what it says it will do and he 
referred to the Jan 1, 2001 date as a firm commitment of the government 
entrenched in the legislation.  I agreed with him that this was absolutely 
the right approach and told him that the Government had Enron's full support 
on this issue.
