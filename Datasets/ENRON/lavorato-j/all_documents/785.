John,

I wouldn't ordinarily send these past you but are you OK with below for

He is a technical Senior Director (promoted from Director year-end, ranked 
Superior) working in the San Francisco office - his main responsibility is a 
power plant developer.

Let me know if you need more information!

Thanks and have a great day.

David -

Chris would like to offer Sam Wehn an employment agreement.  

Can you please review the attached and let me know if you approve?  Also, 
does Lavo approve employment agreements for Chris or does Delainey?

Thanks!
Amy
