Dear Amazon Customer,   

 Recently you  received a mailer from us with a special offer at our DVD  and 
Music  stores for $10 off your next DVD or CD purchase. If you've already 
taken  advantage of these savings, we're glad your player won't be going 
hungry any  longer.

If you haven't,  you'd better hurry--the offer ends January 31. You'll find 
just about all  the DVDs  and CDs  you could ever want, and we even have an 
option that lets you pre-order  titles before they're released.

So stop by today. Then feast away, and save $10 on  your next DVD or CD 
purchase before January 31.
