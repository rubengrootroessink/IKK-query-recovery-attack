Hi everybody,

Bill Ketcheson has asked me to let everyone know that if you are interested, 
you can by up to 15 tickets for the Order of Good Cheer. I realize that some 
of you will not be making the dinner tonight so we can make other 
arrangements to get you your tickets. For those of you who are coming, I have 
included Bill's price table should you be interested in more than ten tickets.

Just as a reminder, tonight's dinner is bein held in Rancher's Hall at 
Heritage Park. Drinks will start at 7:00 and a buffet dinner will begin at 
8:00. Be prepared for another one of Maggie's tough quizes for after dinner 
and we'll see you tonight. If you have any questions, my work number is 
262-5971.

Libby
