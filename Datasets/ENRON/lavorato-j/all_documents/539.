John, I've been meaning to drop you a note to say thanks for the golf
weekend, but things have been a little crazy since I've been back.
Shannon's mom passed away last Wednesday, so I was on a plane to Thunder Bay
within a couple of hours and up there until Sunday night.

It was great seeing you, Dina, Michael and Rich.  He's a great kid (Michael,
not Rich).  Please give my thanks to DIna again.  By the way, are you
missing a car key?  I just unpacked my golf bag and there was a key chain in
the golf travel bag with a BMW key on it.  My intuitive mind tells me that
the key is probably yours.  Give me your mailing address and I'll send it
down to you.

Mark
