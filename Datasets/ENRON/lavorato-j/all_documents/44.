Sign-ups are still going well.  The following is the status as of Friday, 
Feb.4

MEU's signed up to firm contracts: 34
# of customers: 730,000
Load: 2700 MW
Gross Revenue: CAD$2.8 MM/yr = CAD$8.5 MM over 3 years.  Revenues begin as of 
market opening.

Also, 970 MW of load has nominated for our Power Pool concept.  This 
represents CAD$1.7 MM/year = CAD$5.1 MM over 3 years in Power Pool 
administration fees.  Any term power sales to this pool is incremental - we 
do not have an exclusive supply basis to this pool.  This is not absolutely 
firm at this point as we need to develop how the Power Pool will work prior 
to committing from our end.  As well, this is subject to the MEU's choosing 
to carry out their SSS obligations through a third party. (ENERconnect's 
lawyers view this nomination as allready firm - I would rather wait until we 
have spent some time with the MEU's who have signed up for this to ensure 
they know what they have done....)

MEUs with string interest and paper in (either not signed right or with 
conditions, etc.): 23
# of customers: 245,000
Load: 600
Gross Revenue: CAD$1.5 MM/year = CAD$4.5 MM over 3 years. 

Cheers, Paul D
