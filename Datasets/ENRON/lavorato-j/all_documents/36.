Good morning,

I hope everyone has recovered from the party last Friday.  I think we 
definitely have maintained our 'best party of the year' status.  It was a 
great night!

To wrap everything up, we want to get the names of our donors to the Calgary 
Herald as soon as possible.  We are hoping to have the Herald run the full 
page ad showing our sponsors next SATURDAY.  That means that I need you to 
make any final phone calls to donors by the end of this week, Monday at the 
VERY LATEST.

Please send the names, money, etc. to Kelly.  If you have someone who is 
confirmed but will not donate until later, we will put them in the ad.

Kelly, Lauch, Sheila, Shannon/Micheline, Jim, Mike, Bill and Chris can 
confirm this, but I think we had about $225,000.00 in the bank the night of 
the party, we made about $5,000.00 on the balloons, $8,000.00 on the silent 
auction, $18,000.00 on the ticket sales and Sheila just received a large 
donation $10,000.00 (?) from CanOxy (I think).  So, it looks like we're at 
over $260,000.00 now.  Great job everyone.  It was really wonderful to be a 
part of such a successful night!

Thanks again for all your hard work, and get those names in to Kelly,

 Elizabeth Stock
