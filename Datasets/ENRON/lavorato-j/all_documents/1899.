David -

Jeannette is out this week.  I confirmed with Corp. Compensation the 
following:

July grants were priced on July 5 - grant price of $66.4375

Belden and Swerzbin are each receiving 20,000 options ($400,000 value @ $20 
Black-Scholes for 5-year options).

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Sheila

Jeannette,

about July 5 strike price
2 - Belden and Swerzbin had 5 year options what were their scholes and 
exactly how many were they granted?

Thanks

Subject: July 5 Grant Awards

To All:

Per Corporate Compensation, all miscellaneous stock awards (June submission 
-July Grant Awards) have been approved with a grant date of July 5.  These 
awards were approved at the closing price on July 5 - $66.4375, and at a 
Black - Scholes value of $25 for a 7 -  year term and $28 for a 10 - year 
term. 


The ratio for a 7-year option remains at  .365.  This ratio  will be reviewed 
and updated as needed and is subject to change. Please encourage the focus on 
the dollar value the equity grant is intened to deliver vs. how many options 
will be awarded.  With the volatility of Enron stock, the BSV can change from 
time to time, which could effect the number of options awarded.


Regards,
Jeanette
