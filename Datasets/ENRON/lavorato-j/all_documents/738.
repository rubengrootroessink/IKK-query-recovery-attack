John -- Sorry we did not catch up when I was in Houston in December.? At the 
time, I was in the process of leaving the company I helped to start? and have 
joined a sports marketing agency to build their international business.

At some point, I would be interested in speaking with you about some projects 
(domestic and international) that we're working on.? One of our business 
groups specialize in the stadium/properties naming rights field and there are 
some great opportunities including the new Pittsburgh Steelers stadium.? I 
thought one of your companies or possibly New Power might have an interest in 
taking a look at it.? Let me know when you have a free moment.

Cheers, BA
