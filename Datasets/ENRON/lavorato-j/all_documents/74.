Attached is an e-mail Aleck got from Seabron Adamson who is an 
economist/consultant with Frontier Economics that Aleck has recently used in 
Ontario.  Seabron use to work at London Economics and was the author the of 
January 1998 London Economics Report that was commissioned by the Government 
of Alberta to assess market power in Alberta and develop alternatives options 
for the mitigation of market power in the Alberta Power Pool.  The idea of 
the PPA Model was first introduced/described in Seabron's Report and his 
ideas formed the basis of what has ultimately been developed into the PPA 
Model we have today.  

It looks like Seabron is available to help you out if you need him.  Aleck 
has his phone number, etc.

FYI - He is EXTREMELY bright.  If it ever came down to getting modelling 
advice re the auction etc.  I think Seab would be first rate.  As you know he 
is the architect of the PPAs.   Aleck

Dear Aleck and Paul:

Any news from the OEB?

Do you guys have any interest in the Alberta PPA auction process? We saw
that Enron was listed on the website. As you know Kevin and I played a role
in designing the thing and have also done some modeling work on looking at
the contract packages.
