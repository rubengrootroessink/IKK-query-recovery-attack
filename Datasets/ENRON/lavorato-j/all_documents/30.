John, attached is a brief memo for you to pass on to J. Sutton.  It address 
both Ontario and Alberta.  My understanding is that the two people that Mr. 
Sutton is meeting next Wednesday at the Canadian Embassy  are Jim Wilson 
(Ontario Minister of Energy) and Tony Clement (Ontario Minister of the 
Environment , also Minister of Municipal Affairs).  Accordingly, I suspect 
that the  part on Ontario will be most relevant for Mr. Sutton's purposes.  
It occurs to me that Mr. Sutton might want: a) a brief profile of each of 
Wilson and Clement  (i.e there is some personal data that he may find of 
interest for conversation purposes - i.e. Wilson is very proud of the fact 
that his great- uncle, Father Jim Wilson, founded Little League baseball in 
Houston); and b) a memo setting out some key messages which Mr. Sutton might 
deliver regarding the Ontario market.  Let me know and I can get that stuff 
to you on Monday to forward on.
