Just in case my recent lack of emails has left you thinking that you can wait 
until the New Year to get working on your Order of Good Cheer 
fundraising...think again!!

Its now time to take 15 minutes out of your day today to send those letters 
off.  You will be so glad when you come back from ripping up the town/ski 
hill/beach, etc. on New Year's Eve to know that you just have to call up your 
prospective donors and close the deal.  Too easy!!    If you arn't already, 
get motivated -- there are a whole bunch of kids showering in freezing cold 
facilities up at the wilderness school, and studying in cramped quarters who 
will appreciate our help.

I have heard from about half of you and I know that lots of you are ahead of 
the game -- your letters have been sent out and you are working hard on this 
-- keep it up and let me or Brian B. know if you need more brochures, etc.

Have a great holiday and I look forward to hearing about the BIG BUCKS you 
are raising!

Liz
