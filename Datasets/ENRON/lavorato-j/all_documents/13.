John Lavorato has been involved in fund raising for this Project, and I 
understand that Blakes made a financial contribution.

John has some tickets which he has set aside for Blakes to attend the 
Fundraiser Ballat the Palliser on Friday Jan. 28, 00.  It is supposed to be 
an excellent event, with tremendous corporate sponsorship, and a lot of fun.

If you would like to attend, please let Nella know.

Regards, Peter.
