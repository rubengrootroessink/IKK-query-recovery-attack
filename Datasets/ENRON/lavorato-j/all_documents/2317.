John, as requested, please see the attached. It's password protected, so you 
will need to call me. 

On a related note, I wanted your guidance on how you have in the past had 
input into non-commercial bonus numbers. Did you call guys like Shapiro, 
Colwell, Beck, Haedicke, etc. to agree to numbers or will they check with me 
before approving any numbers?
