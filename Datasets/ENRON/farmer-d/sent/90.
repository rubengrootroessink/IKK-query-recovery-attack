Another national crown ... It must be nice.  We have to keep referring back 
to our one and only in 1935.  But, we will never forget it!  I am looking 
forward to the 28th.  Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game.  We'll 
see how that goes.  Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that 
weekend.  That should be a good battle.  OU also has a week off to get ready 
for you.  (I think they should be rated #2).

Things are going ok here.  I can't remember if we've talked about the sale of 
HPL.  That is getting closer to happening.  I am hoping it does.  I'm ready 
to go on to something else, and that would make it much easier.  Ami Chokshi 
decided that she would leave the co. this week.  She is heading of to San 
Fran.  No job or any specific plans yet, but it's always something whe has 
wanted to do.  It would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like 
that.

How's everything else going for you and the family.  We are all doing pretty 
good.  I actually took last week off.  The only plans I had were to spend 
time with the family.  It was great!  It really drove the point home that I 
need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities.

Anyway, would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday?  I'm sure it's 
been a while since you've had your Treebeard's.  Let me know.  Sorry I 
haven't talked to you much.  I'm going to end up losing all my friends if I 
don't change my ways.
