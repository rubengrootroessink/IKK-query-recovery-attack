I think I hate football too.  4th and goal on the 3 yard line, to win the 
game, and RC decides to change his lifelong coaching strategy from run, run, 
run, to pass the ball.  Why not Ja'mar??  The guy who carried 3 defenders 
into the end zone earlier.  Anyway, we beat the spread and I got $20 from 
your friend Mary.  So things are not all bad.

How did the Corn boys lose?  If I would have known about it on Saturday, I 
would have called to console you and the family.  Maybe it's time to just 
turn our attention to the NBA and leave this heartache behind.
