Megan, 

I changed the demand fee for Jan.  It looks like Trisha has changed the 
Transport ticket for the $.11.  I agree with the header charges.

TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and 
$0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please 
change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.

Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They 
have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El 
Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has 
the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called 
"Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is 
$0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

Thanks,
Megan

I have made the changes mentioned below.  I've also adjusted the spreadsheet 
based on our conversation yesterday.  Take a look at it when you get a chance.

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 
2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting 
spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353  Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258  Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11



I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser 
ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we 
do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that 
only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just 
going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so 
you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan
