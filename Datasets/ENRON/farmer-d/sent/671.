Darren:
I think Marta is referring to the supply deal 391119 on 9/6 for 10,545.  We 
do not have a price of GD + $0.04.  We have IF + $0.04.  Please check this 
price.  Also, they seem to be missing the overdelivery calculation in their 
spreadsheet.  Attached is the September 2000 spreadsheet.

Megan, 

Please see the message below.  The pricing on deal 391125 was incorrect;  
should be HSC GD-.04.  I corrected the deal ticket.
