Subject: TXU at Lonestar Katy

Hey, I spoke with Ronnie Skerrik and Charlie Stone this morning and they 
agreed that 
if Lonestar does not bring the gas back to HPL as nomed that the gas will 
continue to be 
sold to TXU.   This should elevate any higher vol re-deliveries/Make up to 
HPL.

Please call me with any questions,
Janet
