Subject: New Contact for Devon

Please note that I will be leaving Enron as of March 23,2001.  Please send 
future e-mails regarding 
Devon changes to Kathy Kelly and Clarissa Garcia, as well as the schedulers 
that you are already sending
changes too.  They will coordinate all future Devon inquiries and changes.

If there are questions before then, please call me at 713-853-6357

Thanks,
Beverly Beaty
