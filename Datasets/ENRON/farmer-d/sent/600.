The deals you listed are transpurt usage tickets that we use to estimate the 
cost of transport and the fuel used in the transport.  This is just an 
estimate of what we think Lone Star will bill us under the Tenaska transport 
contracts (We will pay Lone Star and Tenaska will reimburse us.)

The email below is from James Armstrong regarding two transport deals for CPR 
Fuels.  The deal numbers are 557869 and 514056.  Can you tell me about 
these?  James thinks these are 3rd party sales that he needs to be paid for.
