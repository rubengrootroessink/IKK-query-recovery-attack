   Good Morning!  

   I was wondering if you all would be interested in going in together to buy 
a 
   gift for Bob Hall.   I have picked out a little something that I thought 
he would 
   like for home or office.  Take a look and tell me what you think, asap.  

   This is completely optional, I thought it might help some of you (like me) 
who 
   have no idea what to get him.  If we all went in on it, it would cost us 
$17.00 each.


   

Description below for the  Audiovox Slimline CD Player & Radio

This complete audio system can sit on a swivel base or be mounted on the wall 
as a convenient space saver. The ultra slim design features CD and cassette 
players 
as well as an AM/FM radio and remote control. 16?"L x 12 7/8"H x 6?"D.
