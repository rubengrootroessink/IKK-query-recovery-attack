I have created deal tickets 241558 and 241560 for July 99 - March 00 based on 
the info below.  Due to time constraints, I have not researched pricing and 
volumes, I trust that the info supplied to me agrees with the contract.

Robert - We need to get together tomorrow afternoon to set up April.

Robert:  Who requested Valero to be split out?

Thanks!

Are you still available to assist Robert with entering the new deal tickets 
for Equistar?  After talking with Bryan Hull and Anita Luong, Kyle and I 
decided we only need 1 additional sale ticket and 1 additional buyback ticket 
set up.

You'll may want to run this idea by Daren Farmer.  I don't normally add 
tickets into Sitara.

Kyle and I met with Bryan Hull this morning and we decided that we only need 
1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up.  The time period for both 
tickets should be July 1999 - Forward.

The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara #156337 
below:



The pricing for the new buyback ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara 
#156342 below:


If you have any questions, please let me know.
