Should the entire volume be moved over to ICC now?  Currently on deal 131478 
(ICC), 10,000 is being sold at 2.84.  The sale on the TXU ticket has been 
zeroed out on the deal line, but needs to be reallocated in Vol Mgmt.  If I 
need to move the additional 25,000 to ICC, I will.  But, I want to make sure 
that is what we need to do.

Could you please setup a spot deal for October under ICC Energy Corp.  I 
would just copy the TXU deal below.  I believe the pricing is the same.

Was the gas allocated wrong?

Could you set up the deal for ICC Energy Corp for 10/99 production?  The gas 
was originally billed to TXU Fuel Company.  If you have any questions, please 
let me know.

Thank You,
Tina Valadez

Howard,

Please forward to the appropriate v.m. person in your group.  Thanks.

10,000 mmbtu scheduled on October 14th should be moved from Sitara deal 
#120941 (TXU Fuel Company) to Sitara deal #131478 (ICC Energy Corporation) on 
OPLC Meter 1527.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help.
