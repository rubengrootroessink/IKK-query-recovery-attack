Subject: Tenaska 11/00 and 12/00

We have the actuals for December 2000.  We need three demand fees.  Let me 
know if you have any questions. 
 Deal 529856 - $878,330.63 to offset price difference on Tenaska IV sale
 Deal 384258 - $459,483.51 to bill Tenaska IV for payable reimbursement
 Deal 514353 - change demand volume from 45,000 to 45,333 to update agency fee

Also, I need one more adjustment to Nov 2000 and then we will be done.  

 Deal 529856, day 11/01 - change demand fee from $409,145.72 to $407,547.02

Thanks,
Megan
