Mary we need the pooling points set up for the following regions:

Thompsonville  -  Zones 1,14,18,22
Agua Dulce        -  Zones 3,5
King Ranch         -  Zones 2,21,19
Corpus                 -  Zone 11
Katy                       -  Zones 13,15,16
HSC                      -  Zones 10,17,23
Texoma               -  Zones 8,20
Tx City Loop       -  Zone 6
Freeport               -  Zone 9
Valley                 -  Zone 12

For regions with multiple zones, I have highlighted the zone where I believe 
the points should be set up.  (When I mentioned that there would be seven 
regions the other day, I did not realize that Tx City, Freeport, and Valley 
zones were broken out.)  Let me know if you have any questions.
