Sandi, 

Do you have a complete contract for the Apache purchase under the Tenaska IV 
deal?  Apache is billing us a rate that is $.11 below the commodity rate 
stated on page 22 in the original contract.  In the documents I have, I can't 
find a reason for the adjustment.  I may be missing an amendment or 
something.  I thought that you may have a complete set of documents and could 
help me out.

Daren
