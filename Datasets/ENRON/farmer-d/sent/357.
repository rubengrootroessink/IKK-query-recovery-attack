For volumes in excess of the 60,000 on our term agreement which were 
redelivered to HPL at Mobil Beaumont, we agree to pay Inside Ferc HSC-.045 
for the month of March.  The price at which HPL delivered the gas at Eastrans 
remains at Inside Ferc HSC-.04.

Our nomination into Eastrans is 75,000 MMBtu for 3/7/2000.

Redeliveries

7,000 MMBtu from FCV
50,000 into PG & E
3,000 at Carthage
15,000 at Mobil Beaumont

Per Brian Riley, the price for the incremental 15,000
above  60,000 will be per our Transaction Agreement,
(i.e., PanEnergy purchases 15,000 MMBtu at 1st of Month
HSC - $.04 and sells to HPL 15,000 at Monthly HSC - $.0375.

Please confirm the incremental 15,000 transaction.

Thanks.
