Subject: to better serve you

I need some further information on the folks below.  Please respond to this 
request by letting me know the following:

 1) In what area is this person working?

 2) Who is their manager?

 2) What type of Pipeline Operations access does this person need (read, 
update, none at all)?

 3) In the future, please include the above info on the request in the 
comments section.  To include a statement like "please give Delma Salazar 
the   same access as Bob Smith" would help greatly.

Here are the people that I need more info on:

  Tom Hook
  Demmy Adeshola
  Rebecca Griffin
  Jason Vogler
  Paul Couvillon
  Bob Fischer
  Delma Salazar

My goal is to get your folks access to the Pipeline Operations module as soon 
as I can.  With your help, I will be able to achieve this in the quickest 
time possible.

Thanks,  MVE
