Who does Lone Star show as the transporter on their side, if anyone?  Do we 
have an OBA at this point?

Daren,

There are two purchases at the above referenced meter for the 28th of Oct., 
1999.   Gas flowed without a purchase from the29th through the 31st.  Please 
let me know if we should be paying the swing parties(deal tickets117738 and 
120359) , or how I should allocate the volume.  

Thank you for your time and patience!!
