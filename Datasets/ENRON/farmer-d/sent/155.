Marlene, 

After discussions with the desk, we have decided to keep the Oasis contracts 
under ENA.  So, we don't need to sign the contracts you sent earlier.  Let me 
know if you have any questions.

I need to know the status of these contracts I forwarded to you on August 23, 
2000 and August 25, 2000.
