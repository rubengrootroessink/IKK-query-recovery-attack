The deal at mtr 8663 in April was not a spot deal.  This was a Gas Daily Firm 
agreement under the term contract with Southern Union, deal 72349.

Darren,

I understand that you can tell me the deal number for a spot deal you set up 
for meter 988663 for 4/4-4/9 for Janet Wallis.  

Let me know if you need any additional information from me.

Thanks!

Karen
