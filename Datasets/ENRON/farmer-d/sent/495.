See notes in red below.  In each case where the contract has been terminated, 
Tom and/or Carlos will need to get with Producer Services to determine what 
we need to do (set up a GTC, renegotiate the term deal, etc).

Subject: 12/99 K's Needed and 1/2000 K's Needed

Daren, can you help me with placing K's @ the below listed meters?  I don't 
know if these deals should be rolled or if new ones were set up.

I'll need a K @ each specified meter for the month following the noted month 
that had a K @ it.

Thanks in advance for your help.
