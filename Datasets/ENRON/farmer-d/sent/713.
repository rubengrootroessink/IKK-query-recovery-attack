I moved the Cannon sale volumes from #170335 to #529753 effective 12/14/00.  
You will need to re-nom #529753 for all prior days at zero and then allocate 
volumes at each meter from the old deal to the new deal.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

Daren,

Should I change the counterparty on this sale, or is that handled by 
marketing?  Also, we may need to look at changing the Storage Agmt.   Please 
advise.

Mary

Has the volumes for the deal below been nomd' yet under the new deal.  Credit 
is having a cow because they are showing exposure still under Cannon.  Is 
there a way that we can get this done tomorrow?

Julie,

Cannon is not a wellhead producer.  The meters below are assigned to the 
following individuals:

Meter #  Scheduler

68  Mary Poorman
4132  Jackie Young
1040  Aimee Lannou
1606  Mary Poorman

These schedulers should be advised of the changes.

Bob

Robert, please do your magic.

The trades below were originally executed between HPL and Cannon Interests 
Houston per terms of a specific Master Physical Agreement.  After recieving 
back executed documentation, we are ready to have the trades offically moved 
within the various Enron capuring systems from Cannon to Kinder Morgan Texas 
Pipeline, Inc. per the terms and conditions of the recently executed Master 
Physical Agreement between HPL and Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, Inc.

First, here are the TAG Nos. of the trades we wish to have assigned.

NU2813
NA0376

Second, several trades are listed within a ERMS book called:  P A M
These trades show a 12-31-00 expiry and their Nos. are:

522284
830689
892696
904035
904276

I am not sure what these numbers are.  But, could you move them as well.

Thanks for your help.
