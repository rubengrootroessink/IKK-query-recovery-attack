Imelda, 

Look on the Texas tab.  I've made some comments beside the names.  These 
adjustments are for HPLC and Texas.  We no longer handel EFSC.

Daren, I'm in the process of updating the Sitara Security Administrator 
database and I need to confirm that the necessary users have access to EFSC, 
HPLC and Texas along with the correct roles.  I have attached a file that 
lists the users that are currently in the database.  Please verify that these 
users currently have access to the proper desk and have the correct role 
given their function.  If there are some users that I have not listed, please 
update that information in your reply.  If you have any questions or think 
that I need to contact someone else for this request, please call me at 
x35423.  Thanks for your help.

Imelda
