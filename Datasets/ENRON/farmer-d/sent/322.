We are trying for a conference call on Friday, April 21 at 10:30 CENTRAL time.
We are going to be discussing the HPL buy/sell agreement.  We are very close 
to
agreeing on procedures except for one issue:  the allocation of volumes at the
Fuels Cotton Valley delivery point and the Valero delivery point.  If you can
not make it please let me know ASAP.  If anyone has any questions please feel
free to call me at 303.605.1804.  Otherwise I will talk to all of you on 
Friday
at 10:30 CENTRAL.

Robert
