Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized 
through legal.  However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make 
some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers. 

Buy from Tenaska IV

Sell to Tenaska Marketing

 Aug 399797

Sell to ANP

The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".

Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany 
mail.  (I received both invoices this week)

 I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks.
