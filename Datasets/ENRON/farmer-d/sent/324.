Charlotte, 

I need you to find out what's going on with this point and the transport on 
Channel.  Apparantly, we are moving some gas on Channel from HPL #3455 to HPL 
#6490. (Deals 83084 and 83088).  Why has this occurred each month?

No deal for March or April 2000................  but I have flow..... in 
March a total of   3804 flowed (delivery) and for April it's averaging about 
100/day as a delivery.   in February this was on the  213 contract, deal 
#83088 as a receipt at this delivery meter.  Do we have a deal at this city 
gate to sell Palacios this gas?


THANKS!!!

Charlotte
