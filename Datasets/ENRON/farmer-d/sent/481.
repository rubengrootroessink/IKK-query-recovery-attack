Stacey Neuweiler is my primary back-up (not really a lead since my group is 
so small).  She should be contacted if I'm not available.

Subject: Leads

Please send me a list of those individuals in your departments who are 
official or unofficial leads.  We would like to provide Commercial with a 
tool to contact these individuals should the situation ever arise.   Please 
provide their names and what area they are the lead for.

Thank you!
