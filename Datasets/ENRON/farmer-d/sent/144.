Daren 

The number of interested people turned out to be larger than the room can 
handle.  Can you just send 3 or 4 for this meeting and I will set up a 
secondary date for the others.

Thanks

I will be giving a training session on Wed   9/13/00  in 21C2 from 3:00-4:30 
pm.
I would like for you to send to the class any new logistics personnel that 
you might think could use a Sitara overview.
If someone cannot make it at this time, let me know their names and I will 
try to schedule something for them at a later time.

If possible, please send me a note on who might be attending, so I can get an 
approximate head count.

Call me or e-mail me if you have any questions
