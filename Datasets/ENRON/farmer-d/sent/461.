Hey, Mom.  I got your message.  Just send the curtains whenever you get the 
chance.  Jo went to the doctor yesterday and everything is looking good.  She 
is going to start going to the doctor weekly.  Carrying the baby pretty low, 
so he's getting ready.  Jo thinks he'll be coming around the first part of 
March, the doctor didn't say that, though.  Anyway, tell Lacy "Good Luck".  I 
love ya'll.
