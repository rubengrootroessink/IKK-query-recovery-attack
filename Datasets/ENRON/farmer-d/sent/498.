Subject: Entex Estimates for 12/99

Attached are two spreadsheets showing Entex data for Dec. 99.

Jan00_factor shows the difference between the estimates that should have fed 
over to POPs and the actual for all meters in the meter set {2001-2500, 2540, 
3509, 3519, 3530, 3533, 6822, 9544}.  I do not have the actual for Vidor CG 
yet.  I have estimated the volume to be 190.00.

Actuals were 6105.26 Mmcf using the Vidor CG estimate
Estimates were 4870.37 Mmcf. 
Difference of 1237.89 Mmcf.  (About 1,250,000 Mmbtu)



Jan00_scada shows that if we had correct information from the Hempstead CG 
RTU the difference would have been 819.186 Mmcf.



If you have any questions please call.
