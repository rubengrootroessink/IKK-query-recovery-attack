Charlene, 

Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may 
need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.

I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.

Charlene,

This gas purchase is not a part of the wellhead portfolio but is being traded 
on the Texas desk.  I would suggest you get with Darren Farmer or someone on 
the desk.

Sorry I could not be of more assistance!

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to 
come to our office to have a meeting about clearing this up.  It will be nice 
if we don't have to meet with them.

Production dates are             Volume                     price they are 
looking for
