You can copy the old tickets or create new ones.  What ever you need.

Subject: Midcon Transport Usage Tickets --Mar01

Daren---

I noticed that the Midcon transport usage tickets at Oakville & Moore are not 
in for March.  The previous deal tickets are 598934 & 598958 for that 
transport.  Should they?  Let me know if you want me to set up new tickets if 
need be...or let me know if you create them, so I can update MOPS & POPS.  

Thanks,
Mark
