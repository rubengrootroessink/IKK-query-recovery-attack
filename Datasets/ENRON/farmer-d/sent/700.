This volume should be allocated to deal 138642 for Jan.  The meter has always 
been on the ticket, but with zero volume.

Daren:

During the period of 1/1/2000 to 1/4/2000, the above meter has recorded flow 
on the following days with no deals attached:

 Days     Mmbtus

 1/1/00          3,737
 1/2/00          3,713
 1/3/00          3,730
 1/4/00             800
      
        11,980

Deal #120891 was at that meter during 12/99 production month, but it expired 
on 12/31/99.  Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL 
Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics needs either (1)  have Deal #120891 
extended, (2) new deal, or (3) approval to writeoff these volumes to 
Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to Clem 
Cernosek).
