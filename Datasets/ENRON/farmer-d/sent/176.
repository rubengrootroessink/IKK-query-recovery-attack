This transport ticket should have been entered under ENA, instead of HPL.  
However, the pathing in Unify is correct.  HPL sold 30,000 on th 15th to ENA, 
who then transported it to mtr 628 on Oasis for .015.

Mark has informed me that one of you would handle anything prior to 5/00 on 
Oasis.  Please see below.  Let me know if I need to provide further 
information.

Thanks!

Hi Mark!

Another interconnect issue - 7/99:

Can you please take a look at deal 109660?  It is set up with a transport 
usage ticket, however is a brokered deal.  I am not sure if it is pathed 
incorrectly or if possibly the deal is set up incorrectly.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Karen
