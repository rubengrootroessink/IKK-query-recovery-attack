Hey Ken,

Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you, but...We've had an 
interesting couple of weeks here.  Craig Faulbaum has taken personal some 
time off (I think that this is the 4th week).  So, we have picked up his 
trades.  Tom restructured the EOL trading.  Carey has gone to Gas Daily and I 
have taken over the Waha trading for an interim period.  (I'm still 
responsible for our overall position, but Ami is watching it during 
trading.)  In other words, everyone on my desk is doing double duty.  And, of 
course, Tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps (not cracks, anymore).  
He has two opening on the trading side that we (Stacey and I) are filling.  I 
don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet.  I am getting very 
frustrated with the whole business.  It doesn't see that he even appreciates 
the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack.  
Wheww...That feels a little better... getting some of that off my chest. 

Anyway, Tonya is very uncomfortable.  I think that baby is going to come 
along any day now (due date is still 3/18).  We are both definitely ready.  
The desk is really going to be in a fix when I'm out with that.  That's just 
too bad.  (I half expect Tom to ask me to come in some.  I've got a real 
quick answer to that.)

How are things at home?  Linda doesn't have you working too much does she?  I 
just bought the materials to put a sprinkler system in our front yard.  If 
things get weak on your stock trading, I've got some trenches you can dig for 
extra cash!  It shouldn't be too bad, I bought a brand new sharp-shooter.  
(Of course with a new shovel, I'd have to knock some off of your hourly pay.)

The grant price on the employee options is $55.50.

I hope everything is going good for you.  I would like to have lunch with you 
sometime.  I will let you know when things work out here, so that we can do 
that.  Or...I can give you a call when I'm out for paternity leave and we can 
go one day then.  Talk to you later.
