Bob, 

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated 
during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it 
is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for 
this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

Daren,

Please read this memo and the one dated 2/21/01 from Vance.  He told me all 
new production should be entered at IFHSC.  The deal in question is 634075.  
Do you want it changed to Gas Daily?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob

Tom/Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period  Global No.
HESCO Gathering Co., LLC 9876   85mmbtu/d  100% GD less $0.17  3/13 - 3/31 
96057368

FYI, Susan will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of April.  Additionally, 
this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,
