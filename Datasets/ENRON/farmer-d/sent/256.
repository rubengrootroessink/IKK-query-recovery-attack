Bob,

The EOG contract stipulates that a Gas daily price should be paid only for 
the initial delivery of gas at the execution of gas purchase contract; any 
deliveries subsequent to the initial turn-on should be priced at first of 
month index.

Thanks,

Production from the SG Marshall leases has increased due to workovers of
some of the wells.  Effective June 14, 2000, please increase the June 1
estimate from 2,300 mmbtu/d to 8,000 mmbtu/d @ HPL Meter 68-6296 delivery
to HPL Thompsonville (PG7E Meter 834134).

Production from the M. Martinez leases has increased due to a new well
behind meter 98-6067.  The estimates from this meter has increased from
4,600 mmbtu/d to 8,200 mmbtu/d.

Please call me at (713) 651-6858 with any questions.   Thanks!!!
