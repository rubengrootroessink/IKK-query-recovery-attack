After comparing HPL's numbers with PG&E's numbers I have found a few 
discrepancies with the Tufco volumes.  
 
   HPL   PG&E

5/8   137.500   139.583

5/11   103.750   100.833

5/19   108.333   8.333

Days 8 and 11 have small discrepancies.  I got with Carlos on the 5/19 
discrepancy.  He checked the numbers sent to him by Tufco.  He verified that 
it should be 8.333.  I also checked with Steve in Gas Control regarding what 
flowed for Tufco.  Steve told me 8.300.  I have gone back into MOPS and 
corrected these volumes.   This should impact the UA4 number.  Also, this 
decreases the MidTexas cumulative imbalance.  As of 5/23 PG&E owes HPL 
4.649.  If you have any questions, please let me know.
