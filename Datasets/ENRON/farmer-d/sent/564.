Each month, prior to bidweek, I pull up a monthly range in Path Manager to=
=20
get a feel of how many of our swing customers operated in a prior month (or=
 a=20
month in a prior year).  I have never had problem with this before, and I=
=20
have done this task every month since Unify was put into production.  When=
=20
the problem occurred this month, I was attempting to view Apr 1-30, 2000 on=
=20
Houston Pipe Line, with HPL as the shipper.  This information is very=20
important for my bidweek preparation.  So, I need to continue perfomorming=
=20
this operation each month.  If needed, I can wait until 5 pm top view the=
=20
range.

Darren,
Do you know if you were running pulling up the Path Manager for a date rang=
e=20
around 10:51?=01; How do you normally pull up the Path Manager?=01; Please =
let me=20
know as we're attempting to find out what caused this problem and if we=20
should restrict access on the date range functionality.=01; If you were onl=
y=20
pulling it for a day, that would be okay.

Thanks
