I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal numbers 
you listed are WRONG.  

Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.  It has a zero nom.  You can send that to 
POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on.
I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2).
Deal 529738 is valid for mtr 1598.  It has a zero nom, also.

Daren I have three meters that have flow in Feb but no deal.

1.  Meter 0416  flowed the whole month  1-28.  This our ols friends at Pawnee 
gas plant fuel.  Last deal used was 289396 could you extend it.
2. meter 1601 had flow on the 15 &18.  This is Southern union Lockhart.  Last 
deal used with them was 285350 Hpl or 259208 ENA. 
3. Meter 1598 had flow the whole month 1-28.  This is MT Enterprise C/G- 
Panther.  The last deal used  is 284 620

I'll get Accounting Arrangements for these when you let me know the deal 
status and get them cleared up. Thanks.
