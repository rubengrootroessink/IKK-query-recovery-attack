Hey Ken.

How are things going for you?  Is the market loving you?

We have been really busy.  We sold our house after 2 weeks on the market.  I 
don't think I had it underpriced.  I looked at the average $/sq ft for sales 
in our neighborhood for the last 6 months and I was pretty high above the 
average.  Anyway, we got what we wanted and made a little money, so we were 
happy.  Two days after we sold our house, Tonya found the one she wanted in 
Oaks of Devonshire.  It's over at Louetta and I-45, just before The Thicket.  
It's a little bigger than we were looking for (3100 sq ft), but it's got a 
great game room/sunroom for the kids.  It was built in 86, so it needs a 
little work.  But that's ok with me.  Anyway, we are closing on both houses 
on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday.  We will have you and Linda over 
for lunch or dinner one of these days.  We also had tubes put into Jake's 
ears this month.  We hated having to do that, but it has really made a 
difference.  He had a constant ear infection since October.  Now you can tell 
that he feels so much better.  He's learning more and more each day.  We have 
nothing that is "Jake proof".  Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets 
don't hold him.  He knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over 
that it will eventually slip or break and then your in.  I'm going to install 
pad locks on the cabinets at the new house.  We'll see if that stops him.  
Anyway, everybody's doing well.  I will be alot better after we finish this 
house business.  I don't feel so good when I'm writing all those checks.  
Talk to you later.
