Mike, 

Based on the screen today and current spreads, we may be able to market the 
excess volumes (in the Waha region) at the following levels for 2001:

Jan 4.65
Feb 4.47
Mar 4.26
Apr 4.04
May 3.97
Jun 3.96
Jul 3.96
Aug 3.95
Sep 3.84
Oct 3.96
Nov 4.06
Dec 4.17


Of course, these are only forecasts and are very volatile.  If you need 
anything else, or have any questions, let me know.

Daren,

I'm trying to put together the 2001 Operating Budget for the plant.  I need a 
conservative forecast, per month, of the price that could be obtained by 
selling our excess volumes. 

Thanks.
