Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related 
to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going 
a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the 
majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading 
arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda 
rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the 
week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay 
balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split 
into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, 
with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  
It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things 
to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The 
kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to 
turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was 
too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides 
down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow 
bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off 
or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the 
way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets 
right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe 
you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next 
couple of days.

Did you survive bid week?
?
I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for 
you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff 
left?
?
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)
?
Gotta run. Almost have my *&%$#!!@# taxes done. If people  had to write a ?personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some  big ?changes. It sucks.???Later,?Ken??????
