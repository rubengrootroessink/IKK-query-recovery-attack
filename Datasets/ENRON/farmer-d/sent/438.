I would like to talk about what we can do to make sure that effective 
training occurs in the future for new hires/transfers.  For example, we are 
giving an HPL training session today.  We should not have to give another 
full blown session in the future.  The group should be able to take this 
knowledge, add to it, and pass it on to others entering the group.  With the 
rate of turnover we have experienced in the past, it seems like some 
knowledge has been lost.
