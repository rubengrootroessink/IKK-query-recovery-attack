Kris, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person.

We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) 
Pipeline.  This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.  Duke 
(Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 
5 months.  The deal in Sitara is #145125.  Please look into this and let me 
know where we stand.

Thanks.

D
