AC, 

You may need to fax a copy of the invitation for the July trip to Tim.  When 
I talked to him today, he hadn't seen anything.  (My fault, I turned the 
names in late.)  The real invitaion should be delivered to him soon.

Subject: Customer Meeting Invitation


   Good Afternoon All!!  

   I have attached the invitation to our 8th Annual Enron Customer Meeting to 
be held at The Don Ce Sar in St. Pete's Beach, FL.  

   Please feel free to fax or email to your customers as you see necessary, 
but please use the RSVP forms for the trip they will be 
   attending (July or August).   The 'invitation' attachement is generic and 
should be used for both RSVP forms.  

   The original invitation will be going out in the mail this evening.  with 
a requested return date of June 8, 2000.  

    


     If you have any questions or need an assistance, please call me at 
x33278.  

     Thank you, 

     Heather Choate
