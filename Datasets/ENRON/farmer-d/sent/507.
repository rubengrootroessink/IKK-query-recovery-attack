Sherlyn, 

The base purchase should be brokered with the base sale.  Deal 135563 does 
not replace the basse purchase ticket, it is in addition to that one.  On the 
days where deal 135563 is applicable, the purchases and sale should balance 
out;  no flow.

Daren,

Is this a buy/sell?   If not what transport contract do I use?  I also see a 
deal 135563 purchasing from Phillips.  This new deal is not to replace that 
one is it?   I just  noticed it was for 6000/day.

Thanks.

At Sweeney (Mtr 1517), for December, 6,000/day was confirmed to the Phillips 
sale.  Acutally, we should have nominated a purchase of 4,000 and a sale of 
10,000.  The original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date.  
So, I have created deal 148851.  Please reallocate mtr 1517 with these 
changes; sale of 10,000 on deal 93804, purchase of 4,000 on 148851.  If you 
have any questions, let me know.

D
