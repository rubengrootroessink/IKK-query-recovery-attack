Tim, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person.

Bill Bailey with Southwest Garment & Laundry in Irving Texas is looking for 
an offer for gas supplied to their business under an 18-36 month term.  The 
last year of volume flow is:

Dec'00 1023
Jan'01 972
Mar 951
Apr 936
May 821
Jun 831
Jul 743
Aug 577
Sep 540
Oct 581
Nov 727
Dec 797
Jan 1098

Bill is needing a price as quickly as possible.  He is apparantly getting 
pressure from accountants to quickly tie up this supply.  His phone number is 
972-438-2730.

Thanks.

Daren
