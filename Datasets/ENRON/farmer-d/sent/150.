Marlene, 

Stacey put the contracts in intercompany mail before I got this notice.  
Sorry.  Send them to us again and we will get them signed and returned 
quickly.

Just a note, that the assignment and assumption agreement does not need to be 
executed, but the amendments still need to be executed and returned to me.

Daren,

This is true.  I did not learn of this until Friday September 1, 2000.  
However, I still need to have the Oasis Contracts returned to me.


Please return them in interoffice mail.


Thanks so much.

Marlene, 

After discussions with the desk, we have decided to keep the Oasis contracts 
under ENA.  So, we don't need to sign the contracts you sent earlier.  Let me 
know if you have any questions.

I need to know the status of these contracts I forwarded to you on August 23, 
2000 and August 25, 2000.
