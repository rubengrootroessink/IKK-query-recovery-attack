BH,

I plan to be on vacation July 5-6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the 
7th.  While I am out, Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during 
trading.  Stacey will be in charge of everything else.  I am comfortable that 
everything will be covered.  

I will be back in town Thursday night.  The primary flight for the customer 
trip leaves around 11:30.  Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).   The latest 
idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will 
take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the 
office for half the day.  I can also come in for the half day on the 7th if 
we decide that is needed.

D
