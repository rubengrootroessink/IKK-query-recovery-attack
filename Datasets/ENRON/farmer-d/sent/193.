B, 

I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently:

1)  After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to 
Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to 
interview her.  Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times, 
even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.  Pat Clynes 
fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately 
called Toni to get it straightened out.  Toni called me at home, which is 
good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to 
discuss information with me.

2)  At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.  This has 
improved over the last week.  She has called me a couple of times awaiting my 
decision on salary concerns.  So, I think that she is trying to stay on top 
of this now.

Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting.
