Steve, 

How are things going with this request?

FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only 
sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.

Thanks.

Please forward this to whoever in the Pipeline group does transport, 
especially Oasis, and I disagree that it should be HPL cause most of the 
things off Oasis are ENA and will continue to be.

Dan, 

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to 
HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process 
used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.

Thanks.
