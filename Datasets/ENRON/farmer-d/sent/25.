MP, 

Apply that volume to the Cannon Storage deal.  The meter is already on the 
ticket for that time period.

Daren,

A small volume (352 Dth) flowed on the 10th at Flagstaff meter, I think it 
may have been a test volume.  Do you want to put in a deal or hit strangers 
for now?

Please advise.

Mary
