If you currently have any Kerr McGee production on your pipe, please plan to 
attend the meeting today in room 30C1 at 1:30.    
This should be a very quick meeting.  We will be discussing everyone's roles 
and responsibilities in maintaining the Kerr McGee tickets in Sitara.

I realize we are dealing with numerous cuts and renoms during the day, but if 
at all possible, please try to attend.  We need to clarify some issue 
immediately to avoid confusion in the future.

Thanks
Tricia
