I changed the price to 2.85.  With the changes in personnel on the desk, we 
don't have a lot of info to dispute their price.  It's not cost beneficial to 
do so anyway.

Charlene, 

We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.  No price was 
negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last 
price on the deal to cover those days.  What price is Hesco showing?

Daren would you look at the price for 29 and 30th of March 2000 .  There are 
no prices for these days but volume was scheduled for these days.
Thanks
Charlene

Charlene, 

Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may 
need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.

I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.

Charlene,

This gas purchase is not a part of the wellhead portfolio but is being traded 
on the Texas desk.  I would suggest you get with Darren Farmer or someone on 
the desk.

Sorry I could not be of more assistance!

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to 
come to our office to have a meeting about clearing this up.  It will be nice 
if we don't have to meet with them.

Production dates are             Volume                     price they are
