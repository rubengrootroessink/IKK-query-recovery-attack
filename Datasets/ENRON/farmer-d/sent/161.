Subject: Lone Star Points

Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created 
and the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below.

Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system 
(which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would 
create).

Standard Pooling Stations and West Texas (Line X) Pooling Stations had no 
meters, so they are not set up.  I will try to find the meter numbers for 
these locations.  I don't think we will be using them much.  So, it may be a 
few days before I get the info together.

The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-8477-01) was previously created as (178477), I 
need to know if the (01) needs to be added.  Please add the 01.

We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).  Is 
this the same point???  This is the same point.

Please let Donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red.


Thanks,
Faye
