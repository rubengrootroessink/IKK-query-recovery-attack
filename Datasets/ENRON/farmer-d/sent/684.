I don't know anything about the transport either.  But, I would assume the 
rate remains the same.

I'm assuming yes, but I don't really have anything to do with this one.  Any 
insight Gary or Daren?

The Dow K# 012-24525-202 was terminated 12/31/00, therefore, a new K# was 
setup (96054723).  My question is, does the rate of .025 remain the same for 
Oasis Katy to Dow Stratton?  Let me know.  Thanks, Mary
