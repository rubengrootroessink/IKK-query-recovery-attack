I don't think that we should have any volume on this deal.  It seems like Jan 
2000 was added after the fact to assist with allocations.  But it was later 
determined that we didn't purchase anything from Copano.

Daren,

I'm looking into this deal.   There is no volume on this deal for January 
00.     Should this deal have had some volume on it.
It was never scheduled with volume  however, in January it received flow of 
3461 due to ranking in POPS.  It was taken to zero once the actuals came in.

Please let me know if you intended to have volume on this deal for Jan 00  


THANKS
