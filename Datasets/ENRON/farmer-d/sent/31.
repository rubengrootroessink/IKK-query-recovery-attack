For October, Tenaska IV should be paying us.  We bought gas from Apache and 
Williams on Lone Star Pipeline.  We sold that gas to Tenaska IV when the 
Cleburne plant was operating.  On days the plant was not operating, we sold 
that gas to other counterparties (the sales on Lone Star you see for ENA).  
For September, we may need to pay them an amount, but I need to check into 
that.  With the way this deal has been in the structuring process over a 
couple of months, there are some questions on how to handle Sep.  I'll let 
you know what I determine about Sep.

Daren:
Can you shed a little light on this Tenaska IV deal?  James Armstrong is 
telling me that we should have a purchase deal in the system to pay Tenaska 
IV for the 9/00 and 10/00 gas that we are marketing for them.  I do not see a 
deal in Path Manager for either month.  I also need some detail on who we are 
buying and selling this gas from and to.  There are a number of 
counterparties at Lonestar for ENA and I'm not sure which ones go with this 
deal.  Is there a schedule you can email to me?  James is looking for an 
answer today on the Tenaska IV payment, so whatever you can tell me will be 
appreciated.

Thanks,
Megan
