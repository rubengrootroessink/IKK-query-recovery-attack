Mark, 

It looks like we will probably take over the Cornhusker deal in October.  So, 
I need you to get the following information for Lone Star, Williams, and 
Apache:

Contact Name
Phone #
Fax #
Mailing address


We will be sending notices to these parties indicating our agency agreement 
with the plant (Tenaska IV Texas Partners Ltd.)

Additionally, we will need this information from the plant manager.

Please gather this information as soon as you can from Nancy Stivers.

Thanks.

D
