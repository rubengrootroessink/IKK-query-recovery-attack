I don't know what PC 12667 is.  But, in the attached spreadsheet, my cost 
center is grouped with Risk Management.  I now report to Bob Hall, so CC 
105633 should be reported with the other Logistics groups.

Hi Daren,

I'm afraid I don't understand what you are asking me to do.  Do you mean that 
you want CC 105633 moved to Logistics PC 12667.  If so, there is a 
complicated process in order to do so.  Has someone else made this request or 
is this your own?  Please explain.

Thank you,

Holly

Subject: Revised Allocation %'s - October

Attached is a revised allocation file for October.  Please note that the 
format of this file has been changed to reflect the new team reporting list.  
Also, "Global Markets" and "Industrial Markets" have been broken out for 
billing purposes.  If you have cost centers that are allocating to either of 
these teams, please provide a breakdown of those percentages by Monday, 
November 6th.

All other allocations are due by end of day today.

I have also included the team reporting list that is currently in use until 
the end of 2001. 

Thank you for your help.  Please call if you have any additional questions.
