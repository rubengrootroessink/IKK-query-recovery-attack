Subject: Deal Extended

Deal #276494 ended June 15, but there is additional flow on meter #9602 from 
the 16th thru the 30th.  Could you extend this deal thru the 30th so that I 
can have Vol. Management create an accounting arrangement for it.  If you are 
not the person that I need to contact, could you let me know who I need to 
talk to.
