Ken, 
Thanks for your input.  I will definitely take this into consideration.

Also, I want you to know that I really do appreciate all that you've done for 
me.  I have greatly benefited from your knowledge of the market and industry; 
and also from your experience of just dealing with people and issues.  It has 
been very nice having someone to discuss ideas with and to learn from (and 
argue with!).  Thanks, also, for your honesty and openness.  I really 
appreciate you telling me when you disagree, it helps me see things from a 
different view.  (I just want to do the best thing for our business, and you 
help me to do that.)  You don't try to slip anything by, and you take 
responsibility for your work/actions.  That's hard to find these days.  I 
just wanted to let you know that.  Thanks.

But, I will still continue to think of you as in that Dilbert cartoon:  
"Whenever we disagree, I always end up yelling.  That's an indication that 
you have poor interpersonal skills."
