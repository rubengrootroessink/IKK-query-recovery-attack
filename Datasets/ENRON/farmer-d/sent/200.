We didn't buy anything from Pan Energy at Centana Mobil until April the 3rd.  
So, we shouldn't pay for this gas.

PanEnergy purchase: Deal #231758.
 
Gas in the amount of 271 mmbtus for April 1st was purchased from PanEnergy on 
deal # 231758 . 
However, scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day 
one and as a result, it is not pathed in the system.
 
Could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn't be a sale 
so that Scheduling can either path April 1st or I can dispute the volume 
being billed to us by Pan Energy. 


This is part of Pan Energy's exchange deal.

 As I  told Thu before (see below), I did not see any volumes for that deal 
in 4/00. I think this volume is some residue that flow from the last day in 
March and probably should be allocated to that month. I dont show a deal to 
purchase or sell that gas in April. If you have any more questions please let 
me know, thanks.

Carlos

Deal #231758 
This brokered gas in the amount of 271 mmbtus for April 1st was purchased 
from PanEnergy on deal # 231758 
Could you please review this item and see if it should be pathed, so that I 
may pay Pan Energy for the gas in question?

Katherine,

 This is a brokered deal (Buy Deal 231758 and Sell Deal 93472).  This first 
day was not pathed, that's why you are missing volume of 271.  Per Carlos 
(see below) the deal was not for day one.

Carlos,

 I don't think I can allocate April's volume to March production.  Could you 
please extend the deal to April 1 so that I can allocate it.  Thanks

Thu
