Thanks for the info! 

As Greg mentioned in the staff meeting today, the intent is that this 
restructured deal is papered effective 4/1/00.  The impact is potentially 
that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate 
transport/gathering agreements, etc.  If any rates are changing, then those 
need to be changed in our systems also.  There may be other areas of changes 
also - I'm not attempting to list them all.  Rather I just want to make 
people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations.

Thanks for the information.

Pat/Daren:  Can you get with Mike and/or Brian to determine the potential 
impact, if any?  Thanks.

Brenda,

Per your request, attached are the Draft documents which will be used to 
finalize the new  Gathering Arrangment between HPL and Coastal, the revenue 
sharing arrangement between Exxon and HPL (Transaction Agreement) and the 
Residue Gas Purchase Agreement between Coastal, as Seller and HPL as Buyer 
(Amendment to Wellhead purchase agreeement).  

I do not have a copy of the Processing Agreement between Exxon and Coastal, 
as such agreement does not involve us (and I believe it is far from 
finalized. The only other document that I plan to prepare is a termination 
agreement relative to the current Liquifiables Purchase Agreement between 
Exxon as purchaser and HPL as seller--this termination will be affective as 
of 4/1/2000.

If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.


Steve
