Steve, 

I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 
2000.  Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.  But since 
our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where 
HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.  ENA then transports the 
gas to a delivery point.  If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an 
additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery 
point.  This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and 
completing the scheduling in reasonable time.  Plus, it just doesn't make 
sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as 
HPLC.  Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.

Thanks for your help.

Steve, 

How are things going with this request?

FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only 
sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.

Thanks.

Please forward this to whoever in the Pipeline group does transport, 
especially Oasis, and I disagree that it should be HPL cause most of the 
things off Oasis are ENA and will continue to be.

Dan, 

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to 
HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process 
used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.

Thanks.
