BH, 

Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.  I left the office sooner than 
planned.  This list is pretty slim.  I spent much time trying to learn to 
trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing 
reults for you.  With me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to 
hire an additional person, this will change.  Let me know if you have any 
questions on my list of accomplishments.

D
