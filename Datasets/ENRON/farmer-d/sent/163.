I show that we adjusted pricing for excess volumes for the following dates:


Mar 11-31    15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .045


April 5-19 15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .055.  An 
outage occurred on the 5th, so the deliveries to Mobil didn't acutally start 
until the   12th.

If you need anything else, let me know.

I thought it might be easier to reply by email of the
period, volume, and price for periods when the
price for gas redelivered by Duke at Mobil Beaumont was not
HSC Monthly Index - $.0375.
