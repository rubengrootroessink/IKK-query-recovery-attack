mark, 

Can you look into this?  You may need to check with Mary or Trisha on 
transport capacity tickets for Dec forward.

Have you been able to work out these transport pricing differences for Oct. 
2000?  We have only been able to pay $4,000.00 of the $28,000.00 invoice.  
The pricing for Nov. 2000 (deal 452491) has problems too.  We have $0.01 for 
11/3 at meter 20014804 and TXU is billing us $0.10 at meter 25000200 and 
$0.02 at meter 20014903 for the entire month.

I have also noticed that we are not accruing any transport for Dec 2000 
forward.  We have received the Dec. 2000 invoice from TXU, but we do not have 
a deal to pay them.  We should be getting Jan. 2001 next week.  Is there a 
deal for these months?

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,
Megan
