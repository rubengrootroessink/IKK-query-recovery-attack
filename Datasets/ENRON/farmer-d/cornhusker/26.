Mark,

I understand that you need a note for your files regarding the Tenaska plant.

On Saturday, October 14, 2000 at 5:14 am, the plant had a catastrophic 
failure of the gas turbine. The entire plant is essentially shutdown until 
these repairs can be made. This outage will last a minimum of 10 days. Ken 
Riesz will keep you informed of our progress.

I hope this is what you need. Let me know.

Michael Mazowita
