Please take note of Dave's very important  message regarding Sitara 
positions. We absolutely cannot afford to go through this again and need to 
do everything  possible to help limit the exposure. With prices where they 
are and winter weather upon us we will most likely have a very challenging 
bid week. 

That being said I want each of you to make sure we adhere to the "daily 
clean" process. You should pull all the necessary reports each day and keep 
after the schedulers to make sure they are up to date. If you wish, Donna and 
Richard can make these available each day and distribute to the group. We 
don't have much time so this needs to happen immediately.

Donna, please provide me with a daily summary of all the desks for the 
remainder of the month. 


Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, thanks - Bob

Subject: Sitara positions, end of month feedback from Unify

Bob, et al,

As I am sure you recall, we had a problem with Sitara positions earlier in 
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to CPR for positions.  
Although I have not gotten very far in my transition off of Unify and onto 
Sitara and TDS, we do see some potential for this happening again towards the 
end of this month and the beginning of next month.

The problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts, 
along with updates to those deals.  A large portion of these updates come to 
Sitara via the Unify Bridge Back process.  It would be ideal if we could 
continue to have the Unify data "cleaned/scrubbed" week to week and try to 
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated/bridged in the final 
week/days of the month.  I know this is the goal of Logistics, but I just 
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on 
the Gas Trading systems.  Perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the Pipeline 
Exception Summary and the Bridge Back Pipeline Summary in Unify this month 
would help.

Another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to 
have 2 months "active" at a time.  In other words, when November is over and 
we are in the first week or two of December, Sitara continues to maintain 
positions for November.  This November data degrades the ability to update 
December positions in a timely manner.  We may find ourselves having to 
remove the November deals from the Sitara positions sooner than we have in 
the past.

I will be trying to work with the Sitara team in the coming days/weeks to 
implement some combination of quick fixes, as well as look into the long term 
changes necessary to support our increased trading business.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area.

Thanks, d.n.
