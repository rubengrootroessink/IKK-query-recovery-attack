During mid-july, SITARA will change the logic on Desk to Desk deals to post 
the volume associated with the Sales (Seller) side to the SITARA deal.  
Currently, the volume on the Receipt (Buyer) side is being posted.  This 
change will be implemented in order to coincide with the logic currently 
being used in SAP.  This change should help to avoid Intercompany imbalances.

Please be aware that this change will effect Desk to Desk deals only.  The 
logic on Transport Usage deals will remain as it is currently - Delivery 
Point (To) - posts to the SITARA deal.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at X39222.

Chao!
