Subject: Unify performance problem on Wednesday

As you are aware, the Unify system experienced significant performance 
problems Wednesday from approx 9:30 am - 11:20 am.  The duration of the 
problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before.  
The problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking 
that a fresh login might work better.  Additional logins never improve 
performance and generally degrade it, but that is another story.  (There was 
actually a single user with 21 sessions!)  We had to "bounce" the server 
twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance.

The good news is that we found out what caused the problem.  It was not a 
particular user or a particular report or process.  It was actually an 
intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in 
the past, but this particular change had drastic side effects.  We have 
contacted Sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the 
behavior is a "feature" or a bug.  In the meanwhile, we will do these types 
of changes at night during scheduled outages.

I apologize for the frustration, anxiety, and extra work brought on by this 
problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again.  
If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to give me a 
call.

Dave N.
