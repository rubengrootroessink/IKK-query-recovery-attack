Because of a timing issue with Client Services, I have fixed deal 157288, 
separating the Carthage meter to a new ticket.  That ticket is 229758.  The 
price for the Carthage is suppose to be IF HSC - .06.

Stacy:  I will need Feb pathed ASAP so Volume Mgmt can get the volumes 
moved.  Client Services needs to get this invoice out today.

This problem, among others with this exchange deal, is currently we have a 
massive A/R issue and we're trying to get this cleanup before end of month.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.
