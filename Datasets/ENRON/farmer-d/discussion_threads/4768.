Eric, 

I recieved a call from a guy with Pacific Interlink (?).  He is looking to 
market LNG in Europe.  Since I have very little knowledge in this area, I 
didn't get much specific information.  But, I told him I would find someone 
for him to talk with.  His name is Sam Kovacevich.  Phone:  847-971-3369.  I 
would appreciate it if you would give Sam a call.  If you aren't the person 
he needs to talk to, please let me know.  Thanks.
