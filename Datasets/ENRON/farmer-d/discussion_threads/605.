Daren,

On January 15 and 16, HPL bought some gas from Western Gas Resources at the 
Aquila Header (10.000 and 5.000 MMBTU's respectively).  This was a late 
Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in POPS, the gas was scheduled 
on the stranger's gas contract.  However, deal ticket #143709 was never 
updated to reflect those late changes.  Please let me know if you want me to 
update the deal ticket.  Thanks, Susan.
