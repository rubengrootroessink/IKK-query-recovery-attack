 I want to let you know that we have had a change on our coaching
staff and that Dwight Dawson will continue the coaching work with Daren
Farmer.  Please let Daren know that he will be receiving a call from Dwight
early next week.

 If you have any questions at all, please contact me at:

 Take Care

 Jill
