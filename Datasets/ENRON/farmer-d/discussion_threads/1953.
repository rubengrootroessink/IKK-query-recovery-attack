 Conoco has nominated 5.0/d at this meter.  Conoco transport can be allocated 
the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow
 exceed 5.0mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter.
 
 HPL may also be able to extract a sell for this overage which is why  I 
wanted you to be aware of the daily activity thus far.

 Should I roll this deal to cover August 2000 activity ?
 
 Volumes todate are as follows:     82mm  8/16
       85mm  8/17
                      65mm  8/18
       57mm  8/19
       60mm  8/20

 Sitara ticket #: 363514

 These small meter flows are causing allocation exceptions for August.

Please set up a ticket priced at Gas Daily Houston Ship Channel midpoint 
minus $0.03

Also, can you let me know the exact volumes in question on July 1 and July 
31?  Dorcheus wants to know.  Me too.

Thanks

Lee

 Just a reminder that "allocation close"  is Monday, August 14th.
 
 A  Sitara ticket is needed to set up an Acctg. Arrangement which will 
eliminate  the allocation exception for meter # 981266
 {Victoria Station # 2/ Brandywine}.

 I spoke with Bob Dorcheus, Brandywine about this issue and he suggest you 
and he get together and agree on a 
  price because the gas flowed into the plant.

 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Thanks
