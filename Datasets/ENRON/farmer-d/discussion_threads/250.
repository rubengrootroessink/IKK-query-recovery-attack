To help avoid Unify problems during bid-week we must be keeping up with the 
business on the non-EDI pipes throughout the month rather than wait until the 
end of the month to clean-up and bridge back. The IT staff has identified 
this as one of the things Logistics could do to help them maintain reasonable 
performance. 

Please make sure you know the status of each of your pipes and speak to the 
schedulers if you see they aren't keeping their data clean and bridged. I 
expect you to keep on top of this throughout each month.

We are asking everyone else to work around our schedule so lets make sure we 
do our part.

Thanks - Bob
