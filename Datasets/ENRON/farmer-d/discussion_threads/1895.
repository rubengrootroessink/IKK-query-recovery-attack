Please set up a ticket priced at Gas Daily Houston Ship Channel midpoint 
minus $0.03

Also, can you let me know the exact volumes in question on July 1 and July 
31?  Dorcheus wants to know.  Me too.

Thanks

Lee

 Just a reminder that "allocation close"  is Monday, August 14th.
 
 A  Sitara ticket is needed to set up an Acctg. Arrangement which will 
eliminate  the allocation exception for meter # 981266
 {Victoria Station # 2/ Brandywine}.

 I spoke with Bob Dorcheus, Brandywine about this issue and he suggest you 
and he get together and agree on a 
  price because the gas flowed into the plant.

 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Thanks

 Please verify the volume on Meter #: 1266 for July 1st & 31st  are valid gas

 Brandywine did not nominate any activity  at this meter for July 2000.
