  Daren, 

  Below, I have attached the information that I initially sent out to the 
managers.  
  If you would please forward me your customer and employee trip designation 
as well as 
  their addresses as soon as possible I would really appreciate it.  

  Again, I am sorry for the mistake in not including you in this email.  I 
assure you it will not
  happen again.  And please let me know if there is anything I can do to help 
you. 

   - Heather

Subject: Deadlines - 2000 Customer Meeting


  The planning has begun for our 2000 Customer Appreciation Meeting.  This 
year's trip
  has been scheduled at The DonCeSar in St. Pete's Beach, FL 
(www.DonCeSar.com)
  on July 7-9 and August 4-6.  We will be having fun in the sun with a Luau 
theme this
  year.  

  Our activities will include Golf, Fishing, Parasailing, Waverunners and 
Spa.  We are 
  also looking into a few others (I will notify you all of any updates). 
  
  NOTE:This year our customer's will be responsible for their own airfare and 
their
  transportation to/from the airport. 

   Our deadlines are as follows: 

   May 8, 2000   Guest List Due!
    (This process should include a phone call before hand to
    determine the customers interest, so we can expedite the
    invitation process.)

  May 15, 2000  Generic Invitation Mail-out (July and August Customer trip)

  June 1, 2000  Employee list by trip Due! 

  June 16, 2000  Customer/Employee RSVP's and Activity selections due!

  
Attached below is also a spreadsheet I will be using to consolidate all of 
our information, if you would like to use it as well.

 Please let me know if you have any questions or ideas that arise, we welcome 
any feedback! 

 Thank you,
