Steps 2 - 4 have been done.

Mary, since Jackie is out tomorrow, you will need to verify the following 
information has flowed across to POPS tomorrow morning (check meter catalog).

Meter           Facility                         DRN

986892        515136                       60217
980439        501026                       286715

If there is a problem, then you will need to get with Romeo.

If everything is okay, you will need to let Sherlyn know so she can set up 
accounting arrangements on meter 439 and you will need to enter them into 
POPS.

Step # 1 has been completed.
Sherlyn, verify step # 2 tomorrow and call me when completed.

Jackie, verify the nom on Oct 4 & 5.  It appears there is still a volume for 
meter 6892 until Oct 6.

If there are any questions or issues, contact me at 37649.  I am the contact 
person while Clem is out (through Friday).

Clem,

I have completed setting the confirm = 0 for 986892 and reallocated
all the days. They are all zero now, however 10/4/2000 and 10/5/2000
still have a non-zero BAV, these should get set to 0 by 10/6. Since
allocation will not allocate these days till 10/6 gas date.

r.d

Gary:

This could create some problems for Gas Control, because all confirmed 
volumes will be zeroed including October, 2000 activities at meter 986892  
today (10/4/00).   This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at 
meter #980439.

Daren:

This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should 
clear within 24 to 48 hours.

Victor:

This is just for your information, since this should not create and changes 
for you.



IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME AT X-3665O.

THANKS, CLEM
