Steve,

Two questions:

1).  Does the answer below suffice for our needs?

and 

2).  If yes, and with Pat's answer in mind, would this be a cost that would 
go to your group first, then to Ed as O&M, or would it go directly to Ed?  


I am not sure who has the ability to control these cost more directly, you or 
Ed?


Thanks,

Troy

Becky,

In reviewing the spread the minimal volumes being reported are associated 
with the gas that supplies instrumentation on the pipeline, i.e. pressure and 
flow controllers, actuators, valve positioners, gas quality sampling and 
monitoring equipment, etc.

Pat, Attached is a file for unmetered gas loss for February 2000.  You have 
already answered my questions regarding meters 0980805, 0980877 and 0980803.  
After meeting with Steve Schneider it was decided to take a closer look at 
gas loss.  Steve would like explanations for all gas loss in Feb. 2000.  The 
attached file should help you.  All volumes in blue need an explanation.  Let 
me know if there is anything you need from me or if there is anything I can 
do.  Thank you.  Becky
