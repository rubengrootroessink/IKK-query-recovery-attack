Daren:

On 9/15/99, the above meter recorded flow of 2,476 Mmbtus.  There was Deal 
#113050 at the meter for 9/14/99 , but it expired on 9/14/99.  Logistics 
needs either (1) Deal #113050 extended to cover 9/15/99;  (2) a new deal to 
record these volumes; or (3) Logistics needs approval to writeoff these 
volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to 
Clem Cernosek).
