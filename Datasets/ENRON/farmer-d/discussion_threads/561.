FYI,  I was watching the position manager for ENA and noticed some business 
transactions on this pipeline.  This pipeline was bought by Duke Energy Field 
Services effective 8/1/99.  All HPLC transactions were moved to that pipe at 
that time.  The CES transactions that are current on this pipe should be 
moved to Duke Energy Field Services.  I believe the pipe was renamed when 
they bought it back in June or July.

If you have any questions, or want to verify this information, I would check 
with the Global contracts dept.
