Per the Management Offsite Meeting, please provide me with your monthly 
calendars showing your vital business days, close, bid-week, etc.  If 
necessary to capture all those days please provide me with the months of 
January and February.

Please work with your assistants to get this accomplished before next Monday.

For those of you without, please give me a call and we can set a time to sit 
down and I will handle your calendars.

Thank You!
Yvette
