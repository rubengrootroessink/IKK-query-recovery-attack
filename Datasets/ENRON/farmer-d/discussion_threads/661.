Aimee,

There is a feedback error on swing meter 981595, deal number 151203 for 
January 2000.  POPS and MOPS systems match, however in checking in Sitara, 
the deal number attached expired 12/31/99.  

I am not sure you are the correct person to address this with, if not, please 
let me know.  If you can fix this problem, please do so and let me know.

Thanks and let me know if you need any addtional data as well.
