Daran,  We have a few volume changes for the 1st of March,  first EOG has 
changed there volume for the gas at meter 6296 from 11,036 to 7100.  I  ran 
into Laurie Allen in the hall and she said we were heavy there and  that she 
would visit with you abut it.   The second one is Cokinos, they  will not 
confirm the volume at meter 9656.  We have 922 and they want that they want 
950.  I looked up there nom and that is what they asked for.  Not much of a 
change.  Last is the one that you faxed down to me this mornings.  Basin 
Exploration wants to drop there nom due to well problems from 896 to 1.  for 
the whole month.  Let me know what you think and I'LL get after it.  Tom Cat 
!!!
