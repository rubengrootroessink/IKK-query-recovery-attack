Ed graciously volunteered you to go with me to this meeting.  We'll be 
talking about position screens necessary to track the EOL transport activity 
on a real time basis.  I don't know if they're serving lunch or not.

Please mark your calendars for a transport meeting Monday, October 2, 2000 at 
11:15 am in 32c2.  This is a brainstorming session to talk about all 
infrastructure needs for intra-month transportation.  We will have a separate 
meeting on forward/long term transport position reporting.  The Sitara team, 
transport traders, risk and I will be there.  .
