Thanks Daren, I just found the answer this afternoon.  We paid Seagull.  
Ocean Energy bought Seagull, and Pam Boxx included this deal with her net to 
Seagull.  We just need to move the suspense amount.   Thanks.

I have no idea why payment would be suspended.  I don't remember having any 
problems with Ocean Energy.  Sorry.

Daren, There are five HPLC purchase deals for 09/99 from Ocean Energy Inc.  
They were Craig Falbaum's deals.  A person who is no longer in my group 
suspended payment for these deals.  Gary suggested that I contact you and see 
if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended, or 
know anything that might help.  Thanks.
