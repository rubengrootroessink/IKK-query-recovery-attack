This deal is to book the Teco PVR revenue.  It is my understanding that Teco 
just sends us a check, I haven't received an answer as to whether there is a 
predermined price associated with this deal or if Teco just lets us know what 
we are giving.  I can continue to chase this deal down if you need.
