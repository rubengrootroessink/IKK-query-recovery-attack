I may need more assistance on this issue.  I tried to extend the deal and it 
blocked me saying...

Teco Gas Processing Company is suspended.
Deal with inactive or suspended counterparty may not be extended.

 Any suggestions?

You can extend them, but make sure that the volume is zero.

Volume management was wondering if deals 137870 and 235670 needed to be 
extended into 2001.  These are deals with Teco.  Let me know if you need me 
to extend them.
