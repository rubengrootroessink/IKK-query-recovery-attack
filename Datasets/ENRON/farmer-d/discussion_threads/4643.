Linda-

I did not know that this was part of a Natural Gas / Crude Oil exchange deal 
and billed Texas General Land Office for the gas sale  in Jan. 01

Do you have a Crude Oil payable to offset this sales invoice?
If so, will this A/R balance of $ 974,144.00 be netted against the Crude Oil 
Payable in SAP?

Please let me know, I would like to take care of the net in SAP ASAP.

Thanks- Katherine

Deal # 547201

Texas General Land office has called and is disputing that this sale is a 
part of the month exchange deal for transport.  
Do we have the name of the trader at Texas General Land Office that did this 
deal with us ?

The sale was for 01/01-01/31 for 99,200 mmbtus at $9.82.

Thanks - Katherine
