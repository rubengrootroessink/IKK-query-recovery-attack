2. Tom gave that info to Ed, and he asked for further data:

a. About Cinco ranch, Greatwood, and Spring interconnects

I coordinated with Brad Blevins and applied it to the fact that origination=

Documented why Entex Transport volumes decreased by 6000, and used info=20
towards the audit

c. Check weather forecast for Nov
