YOUR FARETRACKER LOW FARES
*************************************************
We've designed Fare Tracker to help you find great fares by listing
the lowest fares found by your fellow travelers on the routes you
selected.

You can change your Fare Tracker subscription at:

We have made it easier to find the lowest fares that we
send to you in the Faretracker mail by sending you the lowest
fares found by other Expedia customers.  Unfortunately,
we are unable to track fares for all possible airport pairs
in the world.  All three airport pairs that you have in your
Faretracker subscription are no longer supported.  Please click
here to log into Expedia and choose from the hundreds of
airport pairs we do currently track fares for:
