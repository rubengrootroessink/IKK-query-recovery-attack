Donald,

Back in October we had the gas received by HPL at the above meter moved to=
=20
Strangers Gas pending a call from Coastal to renegotiate a contract for Sep=
t=20
2000 gas.  Since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger=01,s gas it=
 has=20
been placed on an MJG deal which was the only valid deal available for Sept=
=20
2000.
I assume Coastal has not contacted Brian as of yet.  Is it possible to have=
 a=20
deal created for Coastal with a price of zero?  I know that we definitely d=
o=20
not want to pay MJG for this gas, but as long as the volume is sitting on=
=20
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the=
=20
payment out.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Nick

Having discussed the matter with Brian Riley, HPL has no intention of=20
contacting Coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received=
=20
in September at at Meter 4179.  It was Brian's opinion that the gas should =
be=20
considered Strangers gas since HPL has no contract or price.   It is=20
suggested that Nick Moshou contact his counterpart at Coastal, relaying thi=
s=20
information and suggesting Coastal's trader contract Brian Riley.

Nick,

I understand that they terminated their agreement.  However, I don't feel=
=20
that we can confiscate their production.  We need to either pay them for th=
e=20
gas, or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter. =20
Given the decrease in prices from September to current and prompt month, I=
=20
would guess that they want to be paid.  We won't know that until we call=20
them.  I don't know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to=20
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was=20
shut-in. =20

Please let me know if I can do anything further to assist.

Mary
