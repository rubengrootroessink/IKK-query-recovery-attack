I think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up 
for Williams and Apache.  On Williams deal 384237, the demand charge needs to 
be removed from Sept. 2000.  The demand charge should not have started until 
October 2000.   Because we did not know at the time what was happening with 
this deal, the demand fee was inadvertently paid to Williams for Sept. and we 
need to recoup our money.  On Apache deal 384247, James thinks we need to 
remove the demand charge completely.  He says it is not a part of the deal 
and Apache is not billing us for it.  We also need to talk about the pricing 
on both of these deals.  Williams and Apache are billing us less than what we 
have in Sitara.  To be able to keep this desk at zero, Jim Pond does not want 
me to use pay the lesser of  for the purchases, so we need to address the 
price differences.   You said you had some contract briefs that supported our 
prices.  Please fax a copy to me at 713-646-8420 and I will compare them to 
what James has.

Just a heads up...We are beginning to work on November 2000, so we will need 
a demand fee entered (hopefully next week).  I will email you the spreadsheet 
after we have received all of the cash and are ready to pay Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan
