I am confused. What file do you want me to update;   Julie Meyers file or Ken 
Seaman file ?
  Both files  provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support 
groups.
  To  prepare both files I feel is a duplicate of my efforts .  Please let 
know if you want both files updated
   and the approximate time table for completion.

Robert, 

Ken developed an industrial report before he left.  It can be found at 
o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly/...  There is one file for each 
month of 2000.  I need you to update this for March.  This will need to be 
distributed to Gas Control, Logistics, and myself.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.

D
