Its a monthly nom for 413447

you're right - the swing deal 413462 needs to be extended to match the term 
of 413447, as does the buyback 413472

Lee, 

On deal 413447 (Chevron @ Olefins), we have a flex nom of 6,000 to 
12,000/day.  Is this a monthly nom or daily nom?  Will we have a swing deal 
with them for the winter?  The current swing deal is for Oct only.  For Oct, 
they have pulled an average of 16,000/day.
