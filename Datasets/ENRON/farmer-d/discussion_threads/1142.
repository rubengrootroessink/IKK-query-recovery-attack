Hi Daren,
I received an email from Kenny Soignet to make sure everything was in the 
system for me to pay Cannon on Friday, 5/19/00.
The deal # is 257141.  I see that the volume has not been scheduled, so 
therefore it is not pulling into unify for me to pay.  
Are you the person that will be able to schedule the volume in order for me 
to pull up this deal?
( I see that in sitara that the deal is set for 5/00 production, does that 
matter? )

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
