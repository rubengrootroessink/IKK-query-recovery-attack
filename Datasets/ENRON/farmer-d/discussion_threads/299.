Just following up to my week ago note.

Rest assured I know how hectic things have been around here and how many 
irons you have in your fire. Time for my issues are, I'm sure, a lower 
priority.

Let me offer a thought or two.

I don't have enough challenges at the moment to hold my interest. 

 I had asked for next Wed and Thurs. off. Let's toss in Fri also. My 
expectation is you would have a plan by the time I would come back, Monday 
the 7th. I hate to be a pest but you need to get a better value for the 
paltry salary $'s you are paying me. Maybe a Tues-Thurs. week would work 
better for each of us. Or if things are going the way they seem to be;  you 
don't need me at all.

If  you could possibly let me know before the 7th what the plan is I sure 
would appreciate it. 



Thanks,

Ken

P.S. Just in case the plug is pulled on this --- please-- no formal goodbys. 
I will pay my respects to those I want too. I would very much like to just 
fadeout -- ok?
