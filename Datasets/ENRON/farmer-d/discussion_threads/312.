Sitara 147092 is tiered pricing. If you want, you can nom whatever volume is 
on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly. It will keep 
things in balance a bit better, but you can go either way. For Feb there is a 
base deal for 5000/day and a term deal for 20,000/day. Only 15,000 of the 
20000 is pathed.
