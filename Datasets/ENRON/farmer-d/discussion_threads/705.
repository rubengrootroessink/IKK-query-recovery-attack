come up on March 26 and we will treat it as force majeure at this time.

  Effective March 11th  Valero has not pulled any gas on a 35.0/day 
nomination.
 
  Do you want to arrange a buyback for this activity. There is a buyback 
ticket { # 148381} available
  to handle any underage.
 
  I am being told this interconnect will be down 2-weeks; effective March 
11th.
