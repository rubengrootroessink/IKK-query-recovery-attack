Daren-
Deal # 421859 Sales
Deal # 421847 Purchase

Settlements is showing both a sales and purchase for Texas General Land 
Office and they are stating that they should not be billed or paid for 
anything. 
Are these deals suppose to be a washout and netted together? 

 If so, the volumes are not matching: the sales on HPL are 7,440 mmbtus on 
deal #421859 and the purchase on MidTX is 6,629 mmbtus. 
Let me know what type of deal this was intended to be. 

FYI
I was told that Tom Acton was handling this deal, but I believe he will be 
out until after Thanksgiving.
