country??? With less than 6 weeks until the entry deadline of April 25th,the 
Hoop-It-Up staff is gearing up and coming to town! 

You should have received your entry form if you have played in the Houston 
event in the past but if not, please contact our local hotline at 
713-521-4535 and our representative will take care of you right away.? You 
can also visit any Houston-area Foot Locker or Army Recruiting station to 
pick up an entry form right there on the spot.? If you'd like to enter even 
faster, register online at www.hoopitup.com and waste no time at all getting 
in on the action.?
