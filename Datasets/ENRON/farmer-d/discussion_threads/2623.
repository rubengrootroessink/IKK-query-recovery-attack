Here are some ideas for discussion this  week.??
?
Next week we won't be meeting, and after that we  will have only two meeting 
times left before Christmas.? Be thinking about  what you'll want to do as a 
group?for the last meeting, since it'll be here  real soon.? Some groups have 
a party, with a Chinese gift exchange (why is  it called Chinese?), or some 
go to eat somewhere and then go as a group in a van  or suburban to look at 
Christmas lights, etc.? If your group doesn't have  some tradition or 
enjoyable end to the semester, be imaginative and see if you  can't come up 
with something fun to do.? Of course if you need help let me  know!
