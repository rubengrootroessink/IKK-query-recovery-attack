Subject: Evergreen deals

Julie, 

I need to know if the following deals have evergreen provisions to roll into 
Jan 2000.

Cokinos / 9676  95912 - No this is a GTC Firm contract, deal expires with 
contract
Cokinos / 6373  128952 - This is a GTC Spot
Coral / 4120  93883 - This is on a Single Transaction contract, we would need 
to check with the trader
Encina / 6392  93487 - Yes, this is a committed reserve.  I marked the 
evergreen flag.
Midcoast / 5097  92956 - No, GTC 1st Purchaser, deal expires with contract.
United O&M / 5053 93728 - No, this deal was moved to the Wellhead portfolio 
for January, but the deal was terminated per legal.
Vintage / 2540  93750 - Not the right deal number.

Thanks.

D
