Paul, please pass this on to anyone who would need to know.  Beginning 
September 00 and continuing for one year, ENA is buying production tied 
directly
into Entex's pipeline system.  The Company we are purchasing from is Osborne 
Oil and we are selling directly to Entex under the big contract at IF plus 
+.769.

This meter will be allocated by a third party and the meter statement will be 
sent to us and Entex.  We will bill & pay off of the meter statement (if this 
is not possible or reasonable, let me know).   See attached pricing for 
Osborne. 



I would like the person whom is paying osbourne to contact me.


Thanks,
J
