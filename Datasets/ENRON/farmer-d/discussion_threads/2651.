Ladies and Gents:

On Sat Oct 21, HPL meter # 1428 had a malfunction, and started flowing at a 
very high rate, way over the nominated rate of 18,000/d  (Gas Control will 
confirm this).

Since Sat-Sun-Mon are all one gas day from a Gas Daily perspective, I told 
Gas Control to try to balance on Sun after the meter was fixed, by cutting 
back to a lower flow rate.

So we will need to do a special allocation for the three days October 21 - 
23, Saturday through Monday.  The three day total for the meter is 59,067 
MMBtu.  Beaumont Methanol nominated 54,000 MMBtu (i.e. 18,000/d for 3 
days).   We should allocate a total of 54,000 MMBtu to Beaumont Methanol for 
the three days, and the 5,067 MMBtu excess will be purchased by Brandywine - 
under Sitara # 484934 priced at Gas Daily HSC midpoint.

Please call with questions.

Thanks

Lee
