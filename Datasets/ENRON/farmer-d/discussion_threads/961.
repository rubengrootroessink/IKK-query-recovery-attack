Who is considered to be on Greg Sharp's orig team?  If they have deals in the 
Wellhead Portfolio, do we need to move them out?  Just double checking.

Great.  Keep in mind - some people continue to confuse "Wellhead Portfolio" 
with "deals done by Producer Services."  All that should be in the wellhead 
portfolio is truly wellhead deals - not deals done by Greg Sharp's 
origination teams at competitive points.  Does that make sense?

I worked with Tom Acton last night to get the Wellhead Portfolio cleaned up.  
Tom had a sheet from Vance that we used to determine what deals should be in 
the portfolio.  I believe the portfolio is now correct.  The Sitara team will 
move the deals we identified today.
