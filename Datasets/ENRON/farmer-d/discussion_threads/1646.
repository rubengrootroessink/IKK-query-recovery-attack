Lee informed me today {7/12th}  that Global Octane has experience 
"operational" problems beginning last night and will be down until further 
notice.
 
  Note:  This outage is considered "Force Majeure"  thus, whatever flows 
during this time period should be allocated to the "term" deal.
 
 Lee was very specific toward this issue not being a buyback. 
 
 
Howard, Please forward this information to whomever need it in 
Settlement....thanks.
