The Operational Pricing Model Team (formerly known as the Transaction Cost 
Model) has simplified the # of activities being performed within Energy 
Operations and used for our model.  We would like to review our results with 
you and determine which activities your team is performing, as well as talk 
about the drivers for your activities.  If you have any questions, please 
contact Jennifer Reside at 3-5971.
