Deal #135714 was at this meter, but the contract tied to this deal expired at 
the end of August 2000.   Currently, these volumes are being booked to the 
HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics need either (1) Purchase Contract 
#96008903 tied to Deal #135714 extended, (2) new deal & contract, or (3) 
approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).
