Hello again.  Thanks to those of you that have RSVP'd for our event.  If you
haven't and you would like to attend, please let us know.  We would love to
have you join us!

After what had already been a difficult year for you as an investor, the
tragic September 11 events only added to our concern for financial recovery.
While we certainly can't control events around us and the impact they have
on our investments, it is still important to remember that we must look past
short-term effects on the markets and think of our long-term goals.

We would like to invite you to join us for an evening out to talk candidly
about how we all must feel right now, the current market conditions, and
steps that we need to take to help us reach our financial goals.

We will address The Three E's - Emotions, Expectations and Economics:

? How to cope with investment emotions
? Education on asset allocation
? Education on long-term investing

Please join us for our Market Outlook Seminar, to be held on Tuesday October
30th from 6:30 to 7:45 at Romano's Macaroni Grill at 1155 Lake Woodlands
Drive in The Woodlands.  We encourage you to bring a guest - in fact, we
will have drawings for some free giveaways for clients that bring guests!

You will have the opportunity to hear Allen Kuhn, Regional Vice President of
Franklin Templeton Investments, discuss the current market and what you need
to be aware of for the future.  Also, we have a new assistant for you to
meet, Karen.  Karen came to work with us last October.  Some of you may have
already had an opportunity to talk with her.

Call Kathy at 281.367.8658 ext. 2234 soon to make your reservations, since
seats are limited. I look forward to seeing you soon.
