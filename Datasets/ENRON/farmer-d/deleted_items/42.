How to Patch Chipped and Pitted Concrete[IMAGE] Every spring, the effects of the past winter's freeze show up in the form of new cracks and chips in your concrete driveways and walkways. If you have an older property, the damage can get pretty ugly, but you don't always need to call in a professional to deal with it. As hard a material as concrete is, with the right tools and a little bit of know-how, it isn't that difficult to work with and repair. Check out this thorough  guide  from American Handyman magazine for the lowdown on how to shape up your concrete without breaking the bank.

Do-It-Yourself Tip 
[IMAGE]A new patch in an old concrete driveway or sidewalk can really stick out like a sore thumb. Getting a good finish match just takes a little patience and a soft-bristled push broom. After you've poured the concrete in the patch hole and worked the surface smooth with a wood float, wait around as it dries (this is the part that requires patience). When the new patch has hardened enough so that it's tough to put a dent in the surface with your finger, spray a fine mist of water over the top and gently scrub away the surface cream with your soft broom until the aggregate appears. If the old concrete shows larger aggregate, you'll have to scrub harder to match it. To take the fresh white color out of your patch, trying washing the surface with a little cola after it has hardened for a day. Odd as it sounds, the acidic nature of the soft drink often does the trick.
