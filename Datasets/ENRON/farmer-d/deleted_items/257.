at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove," Head Coach Mike Holmgren tol=
d the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantas=
y starter right now, espec! ia! lly against the Dolphins' defense in Week S=
even.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Dilfer suffered =
a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected =
to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-=
Intelligencer. "There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll jus=
t leave it at that," Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. "He's i=
njured, and he won't practice this week." Dilfer is probably the better Fan=
tasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team f=
or the next two weeks.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Sack Attack Updated 10/16=
/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson=

 unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, accord=
ing to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulde=
r revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeri=
es. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's gam=
e, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Rob Johnson , QB=
 BUF - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable=
 for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been =
a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe t=
hat will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair t=
he torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on i=
njured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season.   Marshall =

 of! Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. =
"He really could possibly play this week," coach Mike Martz said. "We're no=
t going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out." If Faulk is=
 unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the gam=
e. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start =
Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throughout the week.   Justin =
McCareins , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 McCareins will be sideline=
d six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. H=

nt Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dea=
ler that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Rav=
ens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup=

tack Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game again=
st the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Marco Battagl=

Swamis Stallions Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Sta=
ley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. =

 will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - F=
ree Agent Updated 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's=
 game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so =

y Galloway , WR DAL - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/16/01 Galloway suffered a =
sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowb=
oys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover fro=

 Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre=
-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, =

10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washingt=

s his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six=

 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday.=
 Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against P=

p in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - =
Free Agent Updated 10/16/01! Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's =
loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He i=
s expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas=

- Pongo Pack Updated 10/16/01 Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, =
which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green=
 Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, =
it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  =
 Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to=
 get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett=
's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper lea=
gues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Pack=
ers' defense.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/16/01 Acco=
rding to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss =
this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on =
