Hi,
 
Lunch ------- I'm free any of those days.  Whichever is easiest for you. I just need a few hours notice.
 
I'm glad you enjoyed your vacation.  Soccer coach huh. I'd be looking to get even on that one.
 
I, of course, have a few zillion  questions re Enron --- we can save those for lunch.
 
Now I know you have gone home by the time  I write this on Friday before the BIG game between the BCS #1 and the soon to be  named #1 CORNHUSKERS. I did need to state the outcome before the game. (Of  course I have eaten much crow in past years).
 
Later,
Ken
