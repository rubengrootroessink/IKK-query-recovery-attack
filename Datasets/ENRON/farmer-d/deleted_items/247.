Ok guys!  I am going to help you out this Holiday Season with an idea your Woman won't forget!!!
 For those of you who don't know, I am an Independent Mary Kay Beauty Consultant!  

This Christmas I am selling what I call the 12 Days of Christmas!
What I do is stack up 12 Hat boxes from Small on top to the biggest on bottom and tie big ribbons around it!  You will give this to her on Dec 13th!
On Dec 13th she opens the small box and then on Dec 24th she opens the big box!  And, in each box there will be a special note!!!  Wow, how clever you will be and win lots of points on such a romantic idea!!!

The packages range from $150 to $350  Just tell me how much you want to spend and I will customize the boxes for you!
She'll love it!  I will include the #1 Brand of Cosmetics in America, plus candles, frames, etc!!!  (also, if you have a special item you would like to include in the Last Box, I will add that to it,,,such as jewelry, etc!)

Please let me know if you are interested!  This little Elf must get busy now shopping and wrapping for you!!!  I will deliver to your office or home Early in December.  You may want to hide it until Dec 13th or just put it by the tree and keep the suspense!

And, I will also be selling Gift Baskets ready for you to give!!!  (Mom, Sis, Aunt, Wife, Girlfriend, Etc.)  Let me make this Holiday season easy on you!!!  Please call me or e-mail me and we can get your shopping done early this year!!!


Thanks!
