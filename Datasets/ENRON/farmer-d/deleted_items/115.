If anyone gives platelets, it would be appreciated.  He has had one
transplant and is on the list for another.  I have worked with him at
Halliburton...  Prayers are definitely needed too.

	I just found out that that you need to make an appointment to give
platelets.  Call the Blood Donor Center at 713/441-3415 to make an
appointment.


	Dave is continuing to fight his battle with the liver transplant.
Unfortunately, Dave is not doing very well right now.  He is currently in
ICU and is bleeding internally.  Additionally, the disease is attacking his
bone marrow.

	Dave is in need of Blood Platelets.  If anyone wishes to donate,
please call:

	Methodist Hospital
	Dunn Tower
	One behalf of Charles David Conklin
	713-790-3311
	6565 Fannin, Houston, Texas

	Please keep Dave in your thoughts and prayers.

	Steve
