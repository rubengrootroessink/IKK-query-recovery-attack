Hi All, 

Per the discussion at today's staff meeting, I would like you all to review the attached presentation and put in general information for your particular desk/cost center in the respective slides.   I have one slide for each desk/cost center called " Desk/Cost Center X Information" and another called "Asset Management Deals" if this is applicable to you.    

Please return the attached presentation with your additions and/or changes to me by Friday, October 12th.    Please call me if you have any questions or concerns. 

Also, please feel free to utilize me as a resource for any PowerPoint presentations, data gathering that you may need done. 

Thanks, 
Elizabeth
