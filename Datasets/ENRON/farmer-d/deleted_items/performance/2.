Daren,

I have no problem sticking around with the group, it is a compliment and I am glad that you all appreciate what I have been able to contribute to the group.  I just want your opinion on something.

One of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a  senior analyst or third year analyst.  It is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase.  In no way do I want to imply greed, or that I will only stay for money, but if in your opinion I may be deserving of this, then maybe we could run it by Bob or the program, or whoever is in control of that.  

Just a thought, let me know what you think.

Mike
