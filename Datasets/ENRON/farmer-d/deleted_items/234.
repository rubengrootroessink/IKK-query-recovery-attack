  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=
 start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill  Schroeder, Chris Carter, T=
erry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce=
 Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? Answer =
- GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agains=
t a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and=
 three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously n=
ot an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to =
go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so go=
ing with your most established player in this case is the best move. To ans=
wer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolin=
a defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but B=
arlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at b=
est, so our hands are tied.  =09


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=
is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=
e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=
ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =
facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=
 like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=
ig game.  =09


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=
non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=
ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=
ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=
n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=
rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=
ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =
current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =
good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=
 will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=
other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=
ntasy player.  =09


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =
giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=
n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=
fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=
 will continue to be a productive player all season.  =09
