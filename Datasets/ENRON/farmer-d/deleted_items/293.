low his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,  Shaun Alexander =
, RB SEA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Alexander had another great game,=
 rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denver. Alexander =
has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he has ignited t=
he Seattle offense. If he continues to play a! t ! his current level, he mi=

nd a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off twice. He's st=
ill not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a reserve at =
this point.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Smith h=
ad a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and a touch=
down against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but he's still=
 good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective.   Laveranues Co=
les  , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/14/01 Coles was very prodcutive for =
the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards and two touchdow=
ns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week just yet, but Col=
es is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.   Vinny Testaverde =
, QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Testaverde had a good outing agains=
t Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth st=
arting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the match=
up is right.   Glyn Milburn , RB CHI - Fr! ee! Agent Updated 10/14/01 Milbu=
rn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will be re=
-evaluated on Monday.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14=
/01 Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against De=
troit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider droppin=
g Bennett altogether.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Swamis Stallions Updated=
 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine pass=
es for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every=
 week at this point, but he'! s ! easily worth a roster spot if available. =
  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Batch had a huge gam=
e against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. He's still no=
t worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but he might no=
w warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free A=
gent Updated 10/14/01 Franks caught only two passes for four yards against =
the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as=
 a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.  David=
 Patten  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Patten had a good game again=
st San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely be pushed ou=
t of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't be surrpise=
d to see his numbers decrease somewhat.   Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Fightin=
 Farmers Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD a=
gainst Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clea=
r signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet=
 start prior to this week.  Travis Taylor ,! W! R BAL - The Dyno-mite Updat=
ed 10/14/01 Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. =
The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltim=
ore passing game.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Gle=
nn had a huge game in his return from suspension, catching seven passes for=
 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly basis, =
but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your receiver=
s.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Brookins rushed =
for 33 yards and a TD against Green Bay. The y! ou! ng, strong back might c=
ontinue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears on.  Troy Brow=
n , WR NE - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Brown had a great outing against S=
an Diego, posting 11 catches for 117 yards against San Diego. With Terry Gl=
enn returning, Brown could become a pretty relaible Fantasy player facing N=
o. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis.   Darnay Scott , WR CIN - WidowMakers U=
pdated 10/14/01 Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Brown=
s, but he scored on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in t=
he passing game, even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.=
  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14/01 Conway had a solid ga=
me, posting four catches for 117 yards against New England. He is slowly be=
coming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is becoming a much more reliable =
Fantasy player than in years past.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - The Dyno-mite=
 Updated 10/14/01 Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San D=
iego, but he did score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy playe=
r, however, and is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is r=
ight.   Kevin Johnson , WR CL! E ! - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Johnson c=
aught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It appears t=
he Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy player. =
 Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Brady had his first impres=
sive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and two touchdowns in the Pat=
riots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite the great performace, Bra=
dy is still not worth anything more than a reserve spot Fantasy-wise.   Jam=
es Jackson , RB CLE - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/14/01 Jackson played agains=
t Cincinnati, but was l! im! ited to only 22 rushing yards on 14 carries. T=
he rookie running back, who played despite some rib problems, has been inco=
nsistent and unreliable so far.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Okie Pride =
Updated 10/14/01 Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his =
standards, but he did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of th=
e top tailbacks in the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. =
  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Okie Pride Updated 10/14/01 Flutie had a solid game=
 on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a touchdown against New England. =
He's still not worth starting every week, but is better of used when the ma=
tchup is right.   Justin McCareins  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 =
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against T=
ampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still warra=
nts very little Fantasy consideration.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/14/01 Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints=
. If opponents continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes mi=
ght continue to post some respectable numbers.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Wid=
owMakers Updated 10/14/01 George had his best Fantasy game of the season, p=
osting 132 yards of total offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The perfor=
mance brings a sigh of relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had l=
ost a step after offseason toe surgery.   More Updates  View Transactions  =
