 NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM   Redskins , DT WAS - Okie =
Pride Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday=
 due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (=
leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carol=
ina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , =
WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probabl=
e for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at pract=
ice, however, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffer=
s , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work=
 in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orlean=
s. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muh=
sin Muhammad , WR CAR - Terminators Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are st=
ill sore after taking a few ! sh! ots during Sunday's game against New Orle=
ans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limit=
ed. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may w=
ant to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB C=
AR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to=
 a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quar=
terback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback th=
is week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   Ter=
ance Mathis , WR ATL - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) retu=
rned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against Ne=
w Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy pe=
rspective. !   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Sack Attack Updated 10/17/01 Jeff=
erson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the =
starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to u=
se Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf wo=
rked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was fillin=
g in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen righ=
t knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he=
 has no real Fantasy value at this time.    Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick =
is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of bril=
liance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this=
 point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is=
 listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankl=
e injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice servin=
g as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR M! IN! - Pon=
go Pack Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game a=
gainst Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to s=
tart him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unles=
s it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He return=
s to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  =
Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Mud Dogz Updated 10/17/01 According to published r=
eports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at ! Sa! n Diego. H=
e has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wa=
nts him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week=
, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any =
Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Terminators Updated 10/17/01=
 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too pr=
oductive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.=
   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Mud Dogz Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggle=
d in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in =
the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lo=
t of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins=
 will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple =
of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC=
 - WidowMakers Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by head=
aches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 2=
00 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01=
 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is=
 listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does ! pl! ay. Brady =
only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Sack Attack Upd=
ated 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to c=
atch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , =
WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the s=
eason after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. =
"We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head C=
oach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI s=
howed a significant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fanta=
sy team. Larry F! os! ter assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyron=
e Wheatley , RB OAK - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/17/01 According to publis=
hed reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprai=
n. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before =
he was hurt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Pongo Pack Updated 10/17/01 The Con=
tra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley=
 as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was=
 reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry  , =
RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans t=
o have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis i=
n both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.  Jay Ri=
emersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bi=
lls want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that tackles Jon=
as Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to b=
lock more often early in the year, but he will now become more involved in =
the passing game.  Jerom! e ! Pathon , WR IND - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/1=
7/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week agains=
t the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne w=
ould start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Herald says Ward had his foor plac=
ed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins =
do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Mud Dogz Updated =
10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Star, Smith could end up splitting=
 more carrie! s ! with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave C=
ampo believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the m=
ove will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day.   Stephen Alex=
ander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Alexander underwent an MRI on =
his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high sprain. He is expecte=
d to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injury, so be sure to res=
erve him if he is still on your roster.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Free A=
gent Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's lo=
ss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this week=
end's game against Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play.=
   Greg Clark, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Clark went through his m=
ost extensive workout since undergoing surgery on his right hamstring three=
 weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark told the Contra Costa Times. "I ran=
 (a half mile). I never could do any of that before the last surgery (which=
 removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I could do was jog two minute=
s. It's an amazing difference in comparison." Head Coach Steve Mariucci doe=
sn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make his season debut, howev=
er, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago.    Mo=
re Updates  Player News&n! bs! p;Teams    Fightin Farmers Player News - Pro=
vided by Commissioner.COM  Joey Galloway , Active WR Updated 10/17/01 Gallo=
way (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to res=
t his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status=
 for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined.   Rob Johnson , R=
eserve QB Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday=
's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fa=
ntasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will chan=
ge this week. Don't use Johnson.  Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 10/16=
/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be ava=
ilable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision =
on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him t=
o go.   Derrick Alexander , Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01 Alexander overcame =
back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held to just one catch =
for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements have rendered Alex=
ander a disappointment so far this season.  Antonio Freeman , Reserve WR Up=
dated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Balt=
imore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal th=
at Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prio=
r to this week.  James Allen , Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 Allen had a soli=
d game on Sunday, rushing for 75 yards and a touchdown. However, the perfor=
mance is a bit tainted Fantasy-wise since it was against a weak Arizona def=
ensive front. Don't expect thos type of numbers from the Bears' tailback on=
 a weekly basis.   Ahman Green , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Green has been =
one of the best backs in the league thus far, but he could struggle against=
 Baltimore's vaulted defense. If you have a deep group of running backs, yo=
u may want to consider reserving the Packers' tailback.   Byron Chamberlain=
 , Reserve TE Updated 10/12/01 Chamberlain has quickly become one of the ke=
y weapons in the Vikings' passing game, and he is a reliable weekly Fantasy=
 starter. Expect another good outing this weekend against Detroit.   Trent =
Green , Active QB Updated 10/12/01 Green might have another bad week. Pitts=
burgh's defense will pressure him often, and the Chiefs will be less effect=
ive in the air without the injured Derrick Alexander.  Oronde Gadsden , Act=
ive WR Updated 10/12/01 Gadsden should find himself in position to catch a =
TD pass against the Jets. Miami will score often against the New York defen=
se.  Mike Anderson , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Expect excellent numbers fr=
om Anderson this week. He always plays well against Seattle, and the Seahaw=
ks still lack the talent to stop him from gaining big chunks of yardage as =
the game wears on.  Jerome Bettis , Active RB Updated 10/11/01 Bettis sat o=
ut Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal. He is expecte=
d to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable.   Fred Taylor , Reser=
ve RB Updated 10/11/01 The Jaguars have ruled Taylor out for their next gam=
e against Buffalo on October 18. Taylor is still recovering from the groin =
injury he suffered in Week Two.   Broncos , Active DT Updated 08/23/01 Defe=
nsive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a slight ligament tear in his=
 knee during Monday's preseason game, is expected to be ready for the start=
 of the regular season. Denver's defense has the talent to be a solid unit =
from a Fantasy perspective, and will be one of the top ten defenses taken o=
n Draft Day.   Wade Richey , Active K Updated 04/20/01 The Chargers signed =
ex-49er placekicker Wade Richey on Wednesday, when the kicker's former team=
 did not match the offer sheet San Diego tendered last week. With the 24-ye=
ar-old Richey in, incumbent kicker John Carney will most likely leave the t=
eam.   Joe Nedney , Reserve K Updated 03/07/01 The Tennessee Titans on Tues=
day reached a contract agreement with Nedney, an unrestricted free agent wh=
o played most of the 2000 season with the Carolina Panthers. The five-year =
veteran will replace longtime Titans kicker Al Del Greco, who was cut last =
week after a poor postseason performance and for salary cap reasons. Nedney=
 converted 26 of 28 field-goals attempts and all 20 of his extra-point trie=
s for 98 points last season.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc=
