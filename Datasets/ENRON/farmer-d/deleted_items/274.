Two quick questions...

Volume Management seems to think that we had business on Blue Dolphin Pipeline for August 2001.  I told them that we had none, and that whatever they have is AEP business.  They insisted that it was ours and sent down Allocation Statements from Blue Dolphin.  WE have nothing in the system, so I have no idea what to say to them beyond what I think is the case, that AEP has this business now.

As for the Industrial research, I got your message and I assume I should focus on the ones on the map.  The map has 17 plants listed with pipeline connects.  I will call them for capacities and flexibility.

All errors were taken care of by Jay and I with little trouble.

Thanks.

Mike
