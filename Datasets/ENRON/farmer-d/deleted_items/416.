Sheresa Barron is back in the hospital for the rest of  her pregnancy. 
 
She had an ultrasound yesterday. One of the little  girls fluid levels looked low. They thought they might have to deliver the  babies today. But, being in the hospital overnight and getting IV fluids has  perked up the little girl. She looks better today. 
 
So, Sheresa will remain in the hospital until the  babies are born. 
 
She may be moved to a room today or tomorrow.  
 
Keep her in your prayers.
 
Calls and visits welcome. 
 
Texas Womens Hospital in the Med. Center.
