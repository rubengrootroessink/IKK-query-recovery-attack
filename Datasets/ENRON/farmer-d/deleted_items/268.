ffered a hip pointed during the second quarter of Sunday's game. It was his=

these days.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updat! ed! 10/15/01 The B=
ears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the Chicago =
Sun-Times. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't worth adding to =
your Fantasy roster.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/15/0=
1 Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when Se=
attle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami on=
 Oct. 28. "The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy," Ho=
lmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so far, =
but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played mista=
ke-free football.  ! Ma! rk Brunell , QB JAC - WidowMakers Updated 10/15/01=
 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play i=
n Week Six.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/15/01 Smith sp=
rained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is not consid=
ered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.  Brian Griese , =
QB DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/15/01 Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injur=
y on Sunday at Seattle. The Denver Post says Griese's shoulder will be re-e=
xamined on Monday or Tuesday. "I was able to come back and ! pl! ay this we=
ek, and I'm hoping to do the same next week," Griese said.  Chad Johnson , =
WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Johnson is expected to miss six weeks =
with a fractured collarbone. He injured the shoulder in the third quarter o=
f Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might now become Cincinanti's third receiver.   =
Terry Jackson , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Jackson suffered a calf=
 injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next week's game at Chicago.  =
 Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Fightin Farm! er! s Updated 10/15/01 The Buffalo Ne=
ws says Johnson (neck)  looked good in practice on Sunday. He is expected t=
o play in Week Six. ""He threw the ball extremely well, especially in the w=
ind today," said coach Gregg Williams. "He had a fresh arm. It seems like t=
here is no residual effect from it right now."   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR -=
 Terminators Updated 10/15/01 A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishin=
g Sunday's game. He is expected to play in next week's game against the Red=
skins.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/15/01 Mathis=
 shook off a hip injury and played i! n ! Sunday's game. However, a spraine=
d hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury isn't cons=
idered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.   Bob=
 Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Christian suffered bruise=
d ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Shaw=
n Jefferson , WR ATL - Sack Attack Updated 10/15/01 Jefferson missed a lot =
of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left big toe. He will be evalu=
ated on a day-to-day basis.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Okie Pride Updated =
10/15/01 The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. Th=
e Rams originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collatera=
l ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage.   R=
ams coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three w=
eeks.   "They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to=
 four weeks," Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes=
 it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New Orl=
eans Saints on October 28.   "We'll see," Faulk said. "It's kind of early t=
o say, but you never know."     Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated =
10/15/01 Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exch=
ange on Carolina's second posse! ss! ion, losing another fumble when his ar=
m was hit as he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All th=
ree turnovers led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished=
 21-of-39 for 196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserv=
e for now.    Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Dilfer le=
ft Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was replaced=
 by Matt Hasselbeck.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/14/0=
1 Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect=
 Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid outi=
ng. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,  =
Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Alexander had ano=
ther great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against De=
nver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and =
he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current =
level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters ret=
urns.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Fiedler threw for=
 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off tw=
ice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a=
 reserve at this point.   Lamar Smith ,! R! B MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 1=
0/14/01 Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offe=
nse and a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game,=
 but he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. =
  Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/14/01 Coles was very p=
rodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards an=
d two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week jus=
t yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.   Vin=
ny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/14/01  Testaverde had a goo=
d outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's sti=
ll not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise=
 when the matchup is right.   Glyn Milburn , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10=
/14/01 Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. H=
e will be re-evaluated on Monday.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack U=
pdated 10/14/01 Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushin=
g against Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to cons=
ider droppin! g ! Bennett altogether.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Swamis S=
tallions Updated 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, ca=
tching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent eno=
ugh to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if=
 available.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Batch ha=
d a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. H=
e's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but=
 he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues.   Bubba Franks , TE=
 GB - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Franks caught only two passes for four ya=
rds against the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearl=
y emerged as a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive u=
nits.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Patten had a good=
 game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely b=
e pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't =
be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat.   Antonio Freeman , WR G=
B - Fighti! n ! Farmers Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138=
 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top def=
ense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, de=
spite his quiet start prior to this week.  Travis Taylor , WR BAL - The Dyn=
o-mite Updated 10/14/01 Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at=
 Green Bay. The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche i=
