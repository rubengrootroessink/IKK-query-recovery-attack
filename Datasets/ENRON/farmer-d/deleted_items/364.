Just to let everyone know...Sheresa got to
come home today on medication and home care
and will hopefully get to finish out her pregnancy
there in bed of course.  Caella Chappell has the
food list for dinners for them if anyone wants to
help them out.  They live in Candlelight Hills.
Keep them in your prayers.

Jill
