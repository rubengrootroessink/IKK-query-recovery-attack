 Dear Daren:  From out of something as horrific as the events of September 11th has come something truly amazing - a growing sense of patriotism in America not felt for decades.   We've felt it here at iWon - in fact, we've had numerous iWon members write to us and ask if iWon sold American Flags. They've been hard to come by recently, but now, through the cooperation of The National Flag & Display Company, we're proud to offer American Flag Kits to our members.  Each kit includes one (1) 3' x 5' polyester flag, 3-piece 6' pole, styrene eagle and mounting bracket.    Click here to order your American Flag Kit  - and show your pride in our nation!    Thank you, The iWon Team 	[IMAGE]
