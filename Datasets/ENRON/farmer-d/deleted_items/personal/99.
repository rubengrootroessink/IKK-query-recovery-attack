Hey fellas!

Just for my records, each of you guys have paid the $20 dues for the
league...here's just a little last bit of info for you.

This is the last week of the regular season...after that comes the
divisional playoffs, followed by the Superbowl.

The same week as the Superbowl, another exciting game will be played for the
first time ever, pitting our 2 worst teams in the league against each other,
hacking it out for bragging rights...THE TOILET BOWL!

Rewards break down:

Superbowl winner:	$125
Runner-up:		$50
Toilet Bowl champ:	$25

Thanks fellas, and get back with me if you are interested in doing a $5
College Bowl sheet against each other...(you know, where you pick the
winners from each bowl game)...we already have a few who are in for this!
