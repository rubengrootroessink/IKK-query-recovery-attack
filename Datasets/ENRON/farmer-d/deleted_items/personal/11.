Please respond to Hi, Just wanted to let you know that Lacy's sugar levels =
are staying up pretty well.  She was down to 51 this morning, but she took =
a shot last night & I guess she didn't eat enough ice cream.  She was mad a=
t me cause I didn't give her more than I did.  But it's so hard to know exa=
ctly how to handle it 'cause she's been going to bed a little high & gettin=
g up a little high.  But anyway, she's doing better & I guess she'll always=
 be mad & think I'm mistreating her.  I stay stressed out every day not kno=
wing if she got low after I left & passed out & no one would know it.  I'm =
going to try to get a cell phone & have her call me when she gets there--I =
think--I don't know--she'll be mad about that too.  But the other night, sh=
e didn't eat right after she took her shot, then didn't eat anything fast a=
cting & got in the truck to go over to Phillip's to get research info from =
his computer, got low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs.  So that's what =
scares me.  She knew to eat righ!
t after she took that shot & didn't. But she was high before she took it & =
I guess she didn't think about it getting low. I don't know what will happe=
n to her when she leaves home.

But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we're going to Dallas to look for=
 the prom dress & shoes, don't know if we will stay all night or not. I hav=
en't talked to Shane & Shelley.  I wanted to stay & go to Saturn Rd. to chu=
rch & go to the singles class.  But I don't know what Shane & Shelley have =
planned.  So we'll be back either Sat. night or Sun. Lacy has to be back to=
 work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once.  So, wish u=
s luck.  Any donations will be appreciated!  I hear they're more than I was=
 expecting. But anyway, I don't intend to go overboard.  Maybe there will b=
e some sales.
Hope my grandsons are doing ok.  I bet they were glad that their Daddy got =
back home Sunday. Hug them for me & tell Cole that Mimi can't wait to see h=
is bunkbeds. Love ya'll
