Good God ---- where do you find time for all of that. You  should write a book when the kids go off to college. By then you should have  many many stories.
 
By the way what is your new address? I may want to come by  some evening with a lawn chair and a 6 pack. Watching you work sounds better  than anything on TV.
 
You will make a good trader. Good relationships and flexible  pricing are all you need. Oh, and a few zillion other intangibles you will  run into. It beats the hell out of most other things though.
 
I'll let you be for now, but do keep those stories coming ----  we love them.
