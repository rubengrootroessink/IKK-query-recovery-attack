WELCOME TO DELTA'S WEEKLY WEB FARES

Hello Mr Farmer!

Delta Web Fares offer weekend getaways to your favorite domestic and
international destinations. Keep in mind that these are round-trip
fares.

Delta Fan Fares offer another great opportunity to check out your
favorite sporting or cultural events in a city you might not otherwise
visit. Because of a technical problem, many of our Fan Fares subscribers
did not receive their e-mails this week. If you were one, take a look at
this week's cities by selecting the link below:

Domestic Web Fares require a Saturday departure and return travel on
either Monday or Tuesday. Visiting an exciting domestic destination this
weekend is as easy as reviewing the cities featured below and heading to
