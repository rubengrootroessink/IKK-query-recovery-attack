Daren---Just so you know...

Mike will be taking Cornshucker today from me, (I no longer have access to the deal tickets concerning this), he is doing both the hub business and oasis also, which should keep him pretty busy.   It looks like he has pretty much got it, but we will help him if he needs something.
