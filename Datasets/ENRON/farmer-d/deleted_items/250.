 Top Ten List:
 How you can tell you grew up in the Church of Christ.....

 10.  You know the 1st, 2nd, and 4th verses to nearly every song in the
 book.

 9.  You think it might be unscriptural to drain the baptistry.

 8.  You were 18 years old before you knew that guideguardanddirectus was
not
one word.

 7.  You used to think the offering was part of the Lord's Supper.

 6.  You've wondered who Ebon Pinon was.

 5.  You've never seen an original showing of "The Ed Sullivan Show" or any
other program aired on early Wednesday or Sunday nights.

 4.  You were the only kid in 6th grade who knew what "acappella" meant.

 3.  You were the only kid who had actually sung alto or tenor before
 taking junior high chorus.

 2.  During a service you have: laughed, cried, spanked a child, dropped a
book, walked to the bathroom, passed a note, emptied your purse on the pew,
eaten a cookie, chewed gum, taken medicine, whispered to someone sitting
beside you, winked at a friend, coughed, sneezed, burped, or said "amen,"
but
you have NEVER, EVER clapped.

 And the #1 way to tell that you grew up in the church of Christ:

 1.  You have stood for 13 verses of "Just As I Am" with the last stanza
 sung softly.

 Phil. 1:3  "I thank my GOD every time I remember YOU!"
