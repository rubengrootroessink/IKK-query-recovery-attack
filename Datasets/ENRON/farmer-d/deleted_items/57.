Dear J Farmer,
Now you can enjoy a special low promotional rate when you transfer 
other credit card balances to your Citi

Consolidating credit helps you reduce finance charges and interest to

balances you transfer, the more you can save. 
Be sure to respond by 6/18/01 to take advantage of our special 
lower rates.
