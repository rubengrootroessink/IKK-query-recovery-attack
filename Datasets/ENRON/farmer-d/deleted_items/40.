1. Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on  the 
same night. 
2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason  why the human race has not 
achieved, and never will achieve, its full  potential, that word would be 
"meetings." 
3. There is a very fine  line between "hobby" and "mental illness." 
4. People who want to share  their religious views with you almost never want 
you to share yours with  them. 
5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its  glories, 
decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His  messenger, 
a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle. 
6. You should  not confuse your career with your life. 
7. No matter what happens,  somebody will find a way to take it too seriously. 
8. When trouble  arises and things look bad, there is always one individual 
who perceives a  solution and is willing to take command.  Very often, that 
individual  is crazy. 
9. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and  dance. 
10. Never lick a steak knife. 
11. Take out the fortune  before you eat the cookie. 
12. The most powerful force in the universe  is gossip. 
13. You will never find anybody giving a clear and compelling  reason why we 
observe daylight savings time. 
14. You should never  say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that 
you think she's  pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her 
at that moment.  
15. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to  make a 
big deal about your birthday.  That time is age eleven.  
16. "The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age,  gender, 
religion, economic status, or ethnic background, is that, deep down  inside, 
we ALL believe that we are above average drivers. 
7. The  main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy 
people who  are not in them. 
18. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the  waiter, is not a nice person. 
19. Your friends love you anyway.  
Thought for the day: Never be afraid to try something new.   Remember, 
Amateurs built the Ark... Professionals built the Titanic.
