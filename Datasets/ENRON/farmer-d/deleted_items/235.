 NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM  Trent Green , QB KC - Figh=
tin Farmers Updated 10/18/01 Green should move the ball with ease against t=
he Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numb=
ers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilg=
er is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't ex=
pect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  M=
arcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as=
 Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor i=
n the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND =
- The Dyno-mite Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in=
 his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers o=
n James' home turf this week!   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated =
10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon f=
or the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put h=
im in your Fantasy lineup.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Swamis Stallions Upd=
ated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and ha=
s burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers=
 against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/=
18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He =
was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better agai=
nst them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/18=
/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right an=
kle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Gree=
n Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether=
 he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fightin Farmers Updated=
 10/18/01  Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is =
receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before=
 deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - The Dyno-mit=
e Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapol=
is' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an =
early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Th=
e Dyno-mite Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the firs=
t time he faced the Colts this year. Expect h! im! to get in the end zone a=
t least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chr=
ebet , WR NYJ - Mud Dogz Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very =
disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the Jets engage in a sho=
otout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will cente=
r its gameplan around Curtis Martin.  Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Sack Atta=
ck Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but=
 might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be abl=
e to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin  , RB NYJ - Sack Attack Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this we=
ek. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.  =
 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his fir=
st decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a ver=
y risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolin=
a is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants=
 consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks w=
as very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes=
 for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even wort=
h a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - W=
idowMakers Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this seas=
on, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some succe=
ss against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in =
deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/18/01 =
Testaverde might not be a g! oo! d start this week. The St. Louis defense c=
an be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first i=
nterception of the year.   Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18=
/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen Al=
exander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this =
point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could h=
ave a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's=
 worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.  =
 Torry Holt , WR STL - Terminators Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential =
to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a b=
ig time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly b=
asis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Mud Dogz Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been =
very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benchi=
ng. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets s=
econdary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell ha=
s become a decent tight end from a Fantasy ! pe! rspective this season. He'=
s worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight e=
nd on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 =
Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back thi=
s weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offen=
se and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kur=
t Warner , QB STL - Sack Attack Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbe=
rs he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. H=
e'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure =
to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Okie Pride Updated =
10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he g=
ets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach A=
ndy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likel=
y be the more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Mud =
Dogz Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the leagu=
e, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for t=
wo scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into =
your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pinksto=
n is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. =
He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at=
 this point.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/18/01=
 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial colla=
teral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will m=
iss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28=
, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Widow=
Makers Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid=
 Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league'=
s top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.  =
