Hi,
 
I know the stock sucks and things look  black, but I hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving and a good trip.
 
At this 10 seconds there is 2 min. left  in the 1st quarter of the Neb./Colo. game and I have struck my colors.  Discretion being the better part of valor. My Aggie neighbor saw me taking them  down and just laughed ......... can you imagine?
 
We sure had the polls fooled for awhile  ............. and some of us more ignorant fans.
