Hi,
Hope you are doing something productive  these days. Are you guys ready for Santa yet? I'm sure the boys  are.
 
Looks like the "Cornboys" had a good  weekend what with the Heisman and a trip to the Rose Bowl. We Huskers are  becoming so spoiled. Another chance at a National Championship -------------  God, I love it.
 
Did I here the Aggies were to play in the  Mattress Bowl. That's really an odd name for a bowl game. 
 
Let me know what's happening when you get  a minute. You know how I love gossip. By the way, how is Nick in all of this? I  sure hope the HPL people got rid of their Enron stock when they  moved.
 
Must get back to my package wrapping  duties. Got to get this stuff shipped off to Omaha and Colorado. I really should  by UPS stock.
 
Ken
