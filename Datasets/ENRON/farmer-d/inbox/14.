       ONE MINUTE PRAYER  TIME
      In WWII, there was an advisor to  Churchill who organized
  a group of
    people
    who dropped what they were doing every day at a  prescribed
  hour for one
    minute to collectively  pray for the safety of England,
  it's people and
    peace.
    There is now a group of people organizing the same  thing
  here in
  America.
    
      If you would like to participate, every  evening at 9:00
  pm Eastern
  Time
    stop  whatever you are doing and spend one minute praying
  for the  safety
  of
    the United States, its citizens, and  for peace in the
  world.
    
      If you know anyone else who would like to  participate,
  please pass
  this
    along.  Together, we "CAN" make a  difference!! Thank You,
  and God  Bless
    America.
