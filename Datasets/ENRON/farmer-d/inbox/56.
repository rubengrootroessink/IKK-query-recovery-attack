Darren,

The deals were actualized to zero  because the TXU pipeline statement shows no activity at the point the deals are scheduled.  Mike and I have spoken about the discrepancies.  From my understanding, Mike is in contact with TXU about these deals and others in question.  Currently, I am in a holding status awaiting the outcome. If you would like a copy of the statement I would be glad to bring it to you. 

Let me know if I can do anything more to alleviate the issues at hand.

Sherry/Chris - can one of you get back with Daren on this?  

Daren - FYI my group doesn't actualize volumes.  That is done in Rita Wynne/Mark McClure's Volume Management group.  Let me know if you need anything else from me.  Thanks.

Bryce, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person in your group.

I need someone to look into deal Sitara #833675, referenced below.  Why were these deals actualized to zero?

To recap what we talked about this morning.  The following deals were done for June.  ENA is not showing these deals in you system so therefore they won't pay.  

6/7	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.71	between Roger & Daren
6/12	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.78	between Roger & Daren
6/14	sold 5000 to ENA @ 4.16	between Roger & Daren
6/20	sold 10000 to EOL @ 3.95	between Roger & EOL
6/23-25	sold 10000/d to EOL @ 3.57	between Roger & EOL

Thank you, in advance, for your help with this.
