Everyone's remote access has been changed due to security reasons.    Brandee is in the process of initiating a E-Request for each of you.  Once you get approved you should get the following email.  

In addition, each of you who uses a laptop will need to connect the laptop to the network here at the office and log on as yourself.  This will syncrize your profile on that laptop.

Please pass the information onto your staff.

Thanks,

Tammy
