Can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated?  I am getting mixed information.  I know that we use the higher of the two volumes (receipts vs. deliveries).  The question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume.  Last month (March), we left the volume at the nom of 45,000/day.  In the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume.  For April, the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47,089/day.  James Armstrong is using the actual volume.  The deal for the fee is 514353.

My other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes, receipts, deliveries and transport.  Should the transport volume be in the calculation?  Also, Mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume.   Do I include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom?  If you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee, I would like to have a copy.  You can fax it to 713-571-3141.  If none of this makes sense, give me a call and I can try and explain further.
 


Thanks,
Megan
