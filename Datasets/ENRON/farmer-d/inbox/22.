Darren Farmer has the remainding transportation agreements in use.  He can't get new agreements until Monday at the earliest, so he requested that they stay active.  He will have to beg the pipes to set up new agreements retro to 6/1.

Please look at the last page, last hunk of contracts to find the transport deals in question.  They are on the latest "contracts staying with ENA" list.

Bob Walker - I neglected to activate the "active/inactive" filter in the document I sent Sandi earlier today, so you were seeing contracts that no longer have active HPL deals.  I have revised the document to show only those ENA - IM Texas contracts that have active deals after June 1.  Sorry for the confusion.

On the CES- matter, I left Bob Hall a message relating to who recognizes the benefit of the CES- "contracts" during June - Enron or AEP,  I suspect his answer will be AEP, and if so, you'll need to put the appropriate back-to-back paper in place.  I asked him to call either you, Sandi or me.

Bob,

The attachment segregates the ENA - IM Texas contracts that are to be assigned to either HPL or Lodisco ("go") from the ENA - IM Texas contracts that will be staying with ENA ("stay").

Sandi - Bob will be sending a comprehensive memo to all.

The EEX contract listed (96054930) is not going - it's the back-to-back deal.  The ENA-FT Texas contract listed (96001400) is the back-to-back hedge for the Tuffco contract.
