Susan:  As we discussed, this change was missed but was discussed with you
last week.  I apologize for the omission.  I am checking with my field
personnel and anticipate a further reduction (due to well production
decreases) effective 12/15 which I will send under a separate email for an
"intra-day" change Wednesday.

  Here's REVISED December 1999 (effective 12/9/99 ) setup for
Josey: (using 1.081 Btu/Mcf)
* Gas deliveries into HPL
    12,300 MMBtu/d for KRI            (net reduction of
1,000 MMBtu/d)
      12,300 MMBtu/d into HPL
