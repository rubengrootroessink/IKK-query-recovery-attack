Tom,

Please see the attached file estimating wellhead production for the month of 
June.  Please be advised that this is a preliminary estimate as I have yet to 
meet with the gas buyers (the meeting is Monday at 2pm) and to this date we 
have not received any noms for June.  I will update you with any revisions as 
they occur.

Thanks,

vlt
