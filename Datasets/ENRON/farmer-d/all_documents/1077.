Kellie,

PG&E will probably try to bill us for parking a volume of 10,263 for August 8 
and 9 at $.03/Mmbtu each day.  Please do not pay this charge when we receive 
this invoice.  PG&E was unable to make deliveries into El Paso because of 
high sulfur content in their gas and is trying to charge us with a parking 
charge for gas that they could not deliver.  Please let me know if you need 
any additional information.  Thanks.
