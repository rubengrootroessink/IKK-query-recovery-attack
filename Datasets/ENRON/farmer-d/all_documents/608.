I rolled this deal for day one in October only.  

Bob - Please check with Vance on this deal.  Has it terminated or should it 
roll for October.  I don't think that Vance nom'd anything.

Daren - Meter 9707 has flow for Oct. 1 (1.459mmbtu).  Deal # 125786 was used 
for Sept. 2000.  Could you please extend the deal or have a new one 
created?    Thanks.
