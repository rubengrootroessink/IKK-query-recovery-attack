Bob,

The following production is now on-line and sitara ticket no. ????? should be 
modified in sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period  Global No.
Cody Energy LLC  9864   20,000mmbtu/d  Less 2 % as fuel                 100% 
GD less $0.21  2/12 - 2/28 96052809

FYI, a firm ticket has already been created and submitted for the remaining 
term of the deal beginning with the month of March.  Additionally, this is a 
Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... 
attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,
