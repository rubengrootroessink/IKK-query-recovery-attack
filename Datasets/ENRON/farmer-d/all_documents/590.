It has come to my attention that there is some confusion over the proper 
conventions for signature blocks for Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. and that 
various permutations have been used, to the result that there may be some 
confusion among third parties.

There follows the proper signature block for the partnership.  Please see 
that this is distributed to anyone who will be preparing documents for the 
partnership, including under our Corporate Services agreement with the owner 
of the Managing Partner of the partnership.
