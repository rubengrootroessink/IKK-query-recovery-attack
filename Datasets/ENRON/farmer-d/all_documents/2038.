Recap of PG&E Texas meeting 4/12/00.

Volume Issues:
? Sherlyn Schumack will provide Stacey Neuweiler with volume variances by d=
ay=20
and contract as soon as possible (preferably the same day allocation is=20
received).
? Stacey will notify Sherlyn of correct volume or status if further researc=
h=20
is necessary as soon as possible.
? Sherlyn will notify logistics, Stacey, and Lorraine of PG&E Texas of=20
interconnect variances by day.
? Each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through th=
e=20
system, eliminating manual line items on invoice.
? Charlotte Hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding=20
interconnect issue for 2/00, and Daren or Charlotte will make the necessary=
=20
correction. =20

Rate Issues:
? Heidi Withers will pull daily rates from PG&E Texas bulletin board.
? Greg Steagall will provide Heidi with service verification(s) and the dai=
ly=20
allocation summary received from PG&E Texas during close, which shows rates=
=20
from PG&E Texas.
? No action will be taken on rate variances where PG&E was paid per their=
=20
invoice.  Heidi has talked with Brenda Herod, and Brenda is okay with this=
=20
course of action.=20
? There are four invoices from 1999 production where PG&E was underpaid, so=
=20
Heidi and Greg will work to correct those months to pay PG&E correctly. =20
There are no open invoices in Settlements.
? It was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay PG&E per=20
their invoice in the future.  We expect to correct issues in the system pri=
or=20
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between=
=20
ENA and PG&E.  If ENA has a valid disagreement, we will pay per ENA=01,s=20
verification.

Daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ENA transport contract=
s=20
to HPL.   This would eliminate Stacey having to schedule the transport on E=
NA=20
as well as the desk to desk deal.  It would also prevent Sherlyn from havin=
g=20
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk=20
deal. =20
He has not had a response from legal yet.
