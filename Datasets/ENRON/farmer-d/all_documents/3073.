Kim/Anita-

A volume of 7247mm shows to have been allocated to the Reliant 201 contract 
for November.  There was no nomination for Reliant at this point in November 
and, therefore, there should be no volume allocated to their contract.  
Please make sure these volumes are moved off the Reliant contract prior to 
November close.

Thanks.
