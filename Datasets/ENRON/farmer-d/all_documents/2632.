Tom,

The Doehrman #1 well came on line for first delivery on Monday, 2/7/00 at 
11:45am.  The contract calls for intra-month pricing for deliveries that 
commence after the first day of the month.  Please create a one month 
baseload firm deal ticket for the remaining days of the month based on the 
following information:



Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price

Union Gas Operating Company  9825   500mmbtu/d   100% Gas Daily less $0.10


Susan will create a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of 
the deal once our geologists have gathered enough data to forecast the 
reserves of this well; at such time, we will request that this ticket be 
zeroed out.

If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call.

Thanks,

vlt
