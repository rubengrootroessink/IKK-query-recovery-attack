Daren, I am trying to process two invoices from Samson Resources Co. (Samson 
Lone Star Limited) for September 2000 and October 2000.  The volume is at 
Carthage Hub.  I have not been able to find this volume in Unify for either 
month.  Samson has faxed me their confirmation and your name is listed as the 
contact.  Do you know the Sitara number for these deals?  Thanks.

Laurie Ellis
