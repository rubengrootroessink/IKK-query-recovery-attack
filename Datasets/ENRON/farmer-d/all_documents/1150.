Pat, could you shed a little light on how we get the CPR Fuels number?

What is the source of the numbers for the fuel and what pipes are included?

Brenda wants to know why we flashed 24,302 MMbtu's with a value of $83,827 
and actuals came in at 12,511 MMbtu's with a value of $37,662.  Logistics is 
booking our fuel on 3rd party pipes.  Is there something Logistics needs to 
do to better estimate this expense?

Then the question would be:  where did we miss our projection?  Once again, I 
think we should include Rita in the reconciliation effort.

We flash fuel on 3rd party pipelines.
