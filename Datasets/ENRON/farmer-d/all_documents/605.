I left Vance a voice mail message yesterday but he was out sick.  He called 
me back and said there shouldn't be any flow at meter 9707 and there wasn't a 
deal in place with United Oil & Minerals.

Did you find out anything about the purchase from United Oil & Minerals at

I rolled this deal for day one in October only.  

Bob - Please check with Vance on this deal.  Has it terminated or should it 
roll for October.  I don't think that Vance nom'd anything.

Daren - Meter 9707 has flow for Oct. 1 (1.459mmbtu).  Deal # 125786 was used 
for Sept. 2000.  Could you please extend the deal or have a new one 
created?    Thanks.
