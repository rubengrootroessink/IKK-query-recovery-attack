Danny--

It looks like deal 133196 (purchase from Duke) at meter 5892 South Katy Gas 
Unit#2 needs to be renegotiated.  The deal expired 8/31/00, and they are 
allocating the gas to us for September.  Let me know as soon as you can so we 
can make sure the gas is allocated correctly for September, and so it can set 
it up for October if need be.

Thanks,
Mark

I spoke with Daren Farmer re: deal 133196 that expired 8/31/00 at meter 
985892, and he said the deal needs to be renegotiated in order for us to 
agree to buy that gas that is being allocated to us (volume of 4,098 MMBtu 
for Sept on gathering contract).  Unfortunately, Danny Conner handles this 
deal and he is out this week.  Daren said to wait until he gets back next 
week before we do anything with it.  

Thanks,
Mark
