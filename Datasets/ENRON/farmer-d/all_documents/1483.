Per Mary, Sitara can not handle it either.  It can calculate and withhold 
volume from the deal as a % for fuel, but not as part of the price.  Steve 
says this is a nightmare for the Denver office.  Can you take the "To Do" to 
follow-up on this throughout the systems, and get back with Ed to further 
discuss?  I'd really appreciate it.

We need to discuss further.  My concern would be that how do we know what % 
HPL should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our 
fuel cost ?  Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance?  I think 
that Pipeline Operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel 
retainage.  But, if we retain fuel on ENA transports, then we need to come up 
with a plan to nominate this in Marketing Operations to Houston Pipeline.  
Currently, this process is not in place.

What is the answer?  Can the systems and processes handle this?  Please let 
me know ASAP.  Thanks.

Brenda,

As you know fuel is a big risk.  One of the things we are trying to do is get 
the shipper to pay fuel.  This would mean we would purchase, transport and 
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price.  Can the 
downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?
