Vance,

What is the price and volume that should be entered for October?  Apparently, 
Engage changed their name to Coastal was the reason the deal ticket was 
created that way.

Bob,

You are correct, I did request a ticket at meter 5848 as a spot purchase.  
However, I'm not sure why the ticket was created in the name of Coastal; it 
should have been in the name Engage Energy US, LP.  As for October, HPLC is 
buying this package of gas on a "spot" basis and a ticket should be created 
and entered in to sitara.

Thanks,

Vance,

On August 28, you sent a request to enter a spot ticket for September 
production on Engage Energy, meter # 5848, 240 mmbtu/d.  The ticket was 
entered as a purchase from Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.  A volume of 304 
mmbtu flowed on meter # 5848 on 10/1/00.  Should there be a spot purchase at 
meter # 5848 in October?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob

Bob - there is flow at meter 5848 for 10/1.  In Sept. it was on a Gathering 
contract on deal # 382621 for Coastal Merchant Energy.  Could you please 
check to see if there should be a deal for October?

Thanks.

Aimee
