This could create some problems for Gas Control, because all confirmed 
volumes will be zeroed including October, 2000 activities at meter 986892  
today (10/4/00).   This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at 
meter #980439.

This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should 
clear within 24 to 48 hours.

This is just for your information, since this should not create and changes 
for you.
