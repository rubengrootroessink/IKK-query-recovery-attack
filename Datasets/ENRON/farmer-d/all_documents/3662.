Hey guys and girls, there are three things you need  to announce tomorrow 
night at NEON.
?
??? 1)??? Get a count  of the kids in your group who need to go to the 
retreat late.? There is a  van leaving later Friday night, due to a several 
kids who are participating in a  Northland basketball game.? There is only 
one van, and priority will be for  the kids playing and girls cheering.? Get 
a count of those who need to go  late (it might even be good to get their 
names).? You can email this  information to beckyp@bammel.org
??? 2)???? The  toilet bowl will be at the NCS field at 2:00, unless the 
field is wet, and then  it will be moved to the Strack Middle school field.
??? 3)??? There will  be a superbowl party at Scott Simpson's home starting 
at 5:30.? Girls bring  sweets, guys bring chips and dips.
?
It looks like a busy weekend for the kids!?  Have a great NEON.
?
Bobby
