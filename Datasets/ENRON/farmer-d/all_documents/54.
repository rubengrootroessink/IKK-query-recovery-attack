Daren,

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

Thanks.

Mike
