 The ticket is in and the deal number is 237756. It doesn't seem to want to 
flow over to mops at the moment though.

Tom,

The following production commenced to flow on last week and a ticket should 
be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price   Period

Texas Nom, LP(dba
        Garrison, Ltd.)  9656   500mmbtu/d  100% GD less $0.10 3/27 - 3/31


Susan will create a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of 
the deal once our geologists have gathered enough data to forecast the 
reserves of this well; at such time, this ticket should be zeroed out.


Thanks,

vlt
