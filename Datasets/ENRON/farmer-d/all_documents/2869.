For days 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 28,  we are short at the aggregate 
meter.   Should the Reliant transport and Sales or do we charge Reliant a 
penalty?

Also, I notice that at meter 1554 we have 3rd party transport this month.  
This look strange because I've not seen them here before.

Please advice.

Thanks
