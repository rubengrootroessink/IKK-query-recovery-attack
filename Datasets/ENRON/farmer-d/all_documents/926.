All except for last one rollled due to evergreen.  When you convert to ENA - 
IM Texas - don't forget to remove the evergreen flag on the old ECT - IM Waha 
deals.

These deals should be converted to ENA-IM Texas.  Is there a way that you can 
change all of these deals systematically?

Should these not be converted to ENA - IM Texas ???  Some time ago - we were 
told this desk was dead and the existing deals would end.  This desk is not 
included in any Texas desk portfolios.

The ECT desks are supposed to be inactive - however - these deals keep 
rolling - and 
someone created some new ones?   If the desk is active - should we change it 
to ENA - IM Waha - 
as ECT is no more ???
