Attached per your request is the Big Cowboy production for October 2000.  I 
also have the Gas Volume Statements from Coral Energy that shows the actual 
daily volumes for all of the meters, receipt and delivery, if you need that 
level of detail.



If there is anything else let me know either today or tomorrow because I will 
be on vacation next week.

Fred

Fred,

Please look at the attached file below.  Can you give me the October volumes 
for these meters?
