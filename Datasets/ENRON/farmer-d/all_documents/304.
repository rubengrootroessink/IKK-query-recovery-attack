Here is the November Industrial spreadsheet.  There are two outstanding 
issues.  Meter 1431, deal # 454436 and Meter 1373, deal # 244610.  I am 
waiting on word from Julie Meyers to get these in Sitara.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.  

You can find the spreadsheet in o:logistics/Aimee/Hadix TAccount NOV00.
