Maria Salazar has sent me some more maps that show more details of individual 
pipelines.   I like the details and formatting of the map that Kevin Hyatt 
sent out...so I think that would be good to use for the main map (although 
Maria pointed out that some of the pipeline details have not been updated).  
The maps that are attached below could be used for the "drill down" from the 
main map to the detailed maps (the customer would point and click on the 
company they want and then get to a more specific map with greater detail on 
the individual pipe).  What do you think?  What details do we want to show 
for the drill down maps?
