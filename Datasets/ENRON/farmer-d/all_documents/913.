Does it make a difference  if the information is communicated via a copy of 
customer "force majeure" letter or should it only be communicated
 via notes mail.  
 
There are several ways to communicate effectively issues that is beneficial 
to other departments, do you have a preference?

Deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of January 20. The 
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned 
turnaround.

It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation 
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown.

Please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer.

Thanks
