Anita,

Please be advised that 98-6725 has been placed on Stranger's Gas (per Daren 
Farmer) until a price negotiation has been reached.

Thanks

Jackie............see below for track ID. 
I don't see a deal for meter 6725 in path manager for days 1-20 thus I cannot 
create accounting arrangement for these.
