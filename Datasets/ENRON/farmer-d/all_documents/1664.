In 1925 Houston Pipe Line Company was formed to fuel a growing Houston 
economy.  Over the past 75 years, we have expanded our physical network 
across the Texas Gulf Coast, and we now offer a wide range of financial, 
commodity and risk management services.    HPL is the largest single supplier 
of gas to Entex and is one of the most flexible intrastate pipeline systems 
in the country due to our 118 Bcf Bammel Storage field.

To celebrate our 75th birthday, I am pleased to invite HPL employees and 
their spouse or guest to a company-sponsored event on Saturday the 9th of 
September at Moody Gardens in Galveston, Texas.  The attached invitation 
provides the details.  Additional information will be sent to you over the 
summer.  Please mark your calendars with this date, and I look forward to 
seeing you there.

Sincerely,

Brian Redmond
President - HPL
