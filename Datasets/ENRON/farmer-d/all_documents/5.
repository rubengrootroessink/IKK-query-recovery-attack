We should not be paying Tenaska's Lone Star transport for Sep.  That should 
be paid by Tenaska IV.  We took over the payments with October production.

Hi Guys,

Please do me and Bob Fisher in the Transport Settlements group a huge 
favor......Please let us know when the TXU/Lonestar  transport deals for 
Tenaska IV Texas Partners have been entered into Path Manager (for September 
2000).

I am holding the transport invoice from TXU/Lonestar for September 
2000....waiting to enter the "actuals" into our system for payment.

Thanks,

Kathy  :  )
