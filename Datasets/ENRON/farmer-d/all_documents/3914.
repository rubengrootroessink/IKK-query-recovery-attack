Subject: Tuesday, December 26th

We will need a small staff to handle potential trades for Wed. the 27th.  
Most of the pipelines are out of the office, so I would expect the work load 
to be minimal.  I plan on coming in, and would like to have a minimum of 
three on staff, so I need two volunteers (one offsystem, just in  case).  If 
anyone is going to be in town, please forward a number, in case we need to 
call any additional people in, or have you work on a laptop from home.  I 
will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss, or, you 
can schedule your day now, I have the calendars.  Also, I will be out on 
vacation Friday, Dec. 22nd and will need someone to send the nominations to 
the plants, I don't expect to have full system coverage, just HPL/HPL and 
HPL/ENA as needed.  Let me know if you are interested in learning how to do 
this.

Thank you,

Mary
