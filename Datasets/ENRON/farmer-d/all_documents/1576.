Shawna -  In addition to the meters sent to you in the earlier memo on the 
McMullen system, the following meters were shut in at approximately 12:00 PM 
on Thursday, December 9, 1999.  These meters were shut in order to install 
pigging facilities to remove liquids from the McMullen 12".  These producers 
should be brought back on-line sometime in the afternoon of December 10. 1999.

989638  Freeman Production - Maxine Field

Once pigging facilities are in place, the McMullen 12" will be pigged 
(sometime early next week, week of Dec. 13) and all of the producers in the 
following attachment will be brought back on line.
