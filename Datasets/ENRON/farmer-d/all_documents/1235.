Aquila split the volume between two points, that is why the deal changed.  
The total volume was still correct.  I just found out today, from Stacie, 
that a buy on EOL needs to be on the header and come from a PGEV Hub or Title 
Tracking Agreement.   I had previously been under the impression that 
whatever pipeline the customer wanted, buy or sell, was fine with us.  
However, keeping the purchases on Hub Agmts. will save Enron 
$.0025/transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier.
