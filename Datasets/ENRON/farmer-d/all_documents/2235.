I have a request from the ENA settlements group.  Williams Energy is billing 
the HPL purchase deals on the ENA invoice.  The accountant at Williams says, 
that by the request of the HPL trader, the deals are to be billed to ENA.  We 
would like to have the Texas deals billed directly to HPL.  If you do not 
have a problem with this, can you ask your counterpart at Williams to split 
the deals between HPL and ENA?  It would make the payment process much easier.

Thanks,
Megan
