Effective February 1, 2001 Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) will begin
operating TECO Pipeline under the name Duke Energy Guadalupe Pipeline Inc.
We are attempting to make this transition as seamless as possible with a
minimum of changes.

The only meter number change will be at the El Paso Field Services Waha
header.   In the past shippers have nominated at 00501723 whereas starting
February 1st you will nominate at 8000007.

For the time being, use the same nomination form you have used in the past.
Be sure to include both upstream and downstream contract numbers on your
