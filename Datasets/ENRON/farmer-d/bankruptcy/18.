Jeff,

Please find part 5 of the ENA deals that still need to be moved into the bankruptcy books as a result of our contracts auto-terminating.  I'm getting ready to leave the office for the day, but Bridgette Anderson will be working on the last few deals.  We have been compiling a list of deals that will need further review by Legal and/or Risk and will have these to you very soon as well.  

 
Sylvia Campos and Susan Elledge will be working on deal listings for contracts terminated by the counterparty.  

Please call any of the people listed above, Kim Theriot, or page me at (713) 710-6084 if you should have any questions or concerns with this data.  I will be back in the office tomorrow.

Thanks,
