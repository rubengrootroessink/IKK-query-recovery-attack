At Least Two Bids Seen For Enron Trading Ops - Lawyer By Carol S. Remond  01/07/2002  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES      NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) expects at least two bidders to come in Monday with offers to jump-start the energy company's trading operations.  "We expect bids today. Probably two or more," said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer who represents Enron in its bankruptcy proceedings in New York.  Bienenstock declined to identify possible bidders.  But a person familiar with the matter said that Citigroup (C), one of Enron's main creditors, would likely be among those bidding for Enron's trading assets.  Bids are due by 4 p.m. EST Monday. An auction will be held Thursday.
