FYI - This is the "Day 1" list that you worked on consolidated into one spreadsheet. As you can see the Logistics Managers for each desk, working with Suzanne and me will be responsible for getting this done. Suzanne is putting together a master binder and will start reviewing the requirements with each of you to get as much done ahead of time as possible. In the master binder will be the more detailed spreadsheets with the additional, and critical, notes you included.  

Let me know if you have any questions, tks. In addition Tammy is working on the TPA's and EBB's to get the major EDI pipes up and running ASAP.

Bob
