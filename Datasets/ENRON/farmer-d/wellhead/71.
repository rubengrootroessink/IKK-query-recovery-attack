The attachment provides details for a final total wellhead nomination for June 2001 of 727.856 Mmbtu/d.  Of significance, we have reduced the North Central nomination at meter 6633 from 25,000 Mmbtu/d to 14,000 Mmbtu/d.  Also, the 727,856 Mmbtu/d includes an approximate incremental 10,000 Mmbtu/d (from 22,121 Mmbtu/d to 31,591 Mmbtu/d) volume at the Spinnaker meter (9862) which is not yet flowing, but is expected to flow by the first of the month.
