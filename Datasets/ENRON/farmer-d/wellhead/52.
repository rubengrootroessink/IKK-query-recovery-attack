Bob, the referenced contract dated 1/1/96 as amended effective 4/1/2000 does include an evergreen provision.  Thus, please add May, 2001 to the existing sitara deal, 334995, at the current price, 90% of IFHSC, for a volume of 155 Mmbtu/d.

 Don, please prepare and circulate a termination letter for 96001985.

George x3-6992
