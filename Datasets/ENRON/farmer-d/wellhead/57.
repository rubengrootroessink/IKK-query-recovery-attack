Bob, we currently have a total of 16.817 Mmbtu/d nominated for purchases at meter 098-9862 as follows:

	Spinnaker Exploration Company, L.L.C		sit 379424		5,886/d		27%
	Ranger Oil Company				sit 533410		5,886/d		27%
	The Houston Exploration Company		sit 535119		5,045/d		23%

It appears that the Texas General Land Office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for May - see deal 535132, which shows 0 as the expectted volume.  Texas GLO has historically transported about 23% of the gas at the N. Padre Is. Block 883L.   

Once it starts flowing, the incremental 10,000 Mmbtu/d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above.
