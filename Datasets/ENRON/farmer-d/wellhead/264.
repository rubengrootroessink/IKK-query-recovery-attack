 Deal 138049 is committed reserve long term gas totaling 1,350mm per day 
which is a good deal.
 
 However, deal #:  348446 is a  duplicate deal which was overstated and 
should be zeroed out {bad deal}.
 
 This is Vance response to an inquiry made by Bob.
 
 Daren, do you want me to zero out  deal #: 348446 ?
