Tom,

The following production commenced to flow on last week and a ticket should 
be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price   Period

Texas Nom, LP(dba
        Garrison, Ltd.)  9656   500mmbtu/d  100% GD less $0.10 3/27 - 3/31


Susan will create a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of 
the deal once our geologists have gathered enough data to forecast the 
reserves of this well; at such time, this ticket should be zeroed out.


Thanks,
