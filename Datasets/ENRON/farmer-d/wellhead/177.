Gary,

When Spinnaker got paid, the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the 
month. Since Spinnaker was paid Gas
Daily pricing for the month, there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when 
the volumes are re-sent over on the actual
day of flow.  In my calculations (using Gas Daily less $.21 as the price) we 
are going to owe Spinnaker an additional
$ 220,398.57.

One issue that needs to be addressed is this:  should the additional money go 
directly to Spinnaker since they are allocating
out October 2000 production payments to Ranger and Houston Exploration?  

Attached is a spreadsheet showing where I came up with the extra money owed:



Thank you all!!

Christy

PS This does not address the issue between the onshore and offshore meter, 
this is just addressing the redistribution
of volumes for the month of October.
