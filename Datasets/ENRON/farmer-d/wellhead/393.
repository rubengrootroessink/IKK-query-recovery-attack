Daren,

This didn't help as I am unable to access any information on the file.

Bob,

Please see the attached file calculating an estimate of wellhead production 
for the month of April, 2001.  Please be advised that this is a preliminary 
estimate as I have yet to meet with the gas buyers and I have not received 
any customer nominations.  Our pre-nom meeting is on tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

Thanks,

vlt
