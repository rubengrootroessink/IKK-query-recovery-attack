Ami,,,
per our conversation, I would perfer the 2,000 difference be placed on the OBA
between LSP and Teco,

because we requested to cut the flow.
Thanks!!

Hey Tim,

For May 12, our supply shows that 8.000 did flow even though you cut flow
to 6.0.  Let me know how you want to handle the situation. Sorry for the
inconvenience.

Ami
