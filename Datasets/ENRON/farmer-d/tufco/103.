At the request of Lynn Handlin, please find attached a copy of the following:
   GISB contract form
   Special Provisions for intrastate gas
   Special Provision for interstate gas

Please review, and if interested in putting these contracts in place, forward to
me all required information on the first page of the GISB contract form. I will
then have the contracts prepared and forwarded to you for execution.

Please keep in mind that TXU Fuel Company is an intrastate pipeline and can
purchase interstate gas only under certain limited conditions. These conditions
are covered under item number 8 in the Special Provisions. Thanks.
