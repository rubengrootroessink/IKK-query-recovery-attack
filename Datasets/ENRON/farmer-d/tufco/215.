Anthony,

Daren Farmer on the Texas desk called me today looking for an active contract that ENA has with TXU Gas Distribution (formerly TXU Lone Star Gas) dated 11/1/97.  I queried Global Contracts for that CP and didn't find anything, active or not.  Please research ALL the TXU entities to see if you can find a physical contract with ENA with that date.  Please call Daren at x36905 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Stacey Barclay Richardson
