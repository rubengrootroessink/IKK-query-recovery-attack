With regards to the 29th, Gary (TUFCO) spoke with Lee (HPL) requesting the 
TAP volume to decrease at 2am. Mike (Valero) was unable to accomodate the 
request until 2:30am. Lee confirmed with Gary, and the volumes decreased from 
140 to 0 at 2:30am. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

I am still working on Lonestar volumes for Sept, but will let you know as 
soon as possible.

Regards,
Ami
