Janet,

I'm working with Chris on the Valero RFP.  Here is the 2000 data for Valero's gas consumption.  David Dyck at Valero did indicate that they would prefer one single supplier for the Corpus Christi #2 facility in particular.  

Thanks,

Larry and Jim,

Thank  you  for  expressing  your  interest  in responding to Valero Energy
Corporation's  Request  for Proposals for natural gas supplies. Please find
attached  a  file  containing  daily  consumption data for most of Valero's
major facilities in Texas, California and New Jersey. Certain other smaller
accounts  such  as  Valero's asphalt plants in California and Texas are not
represented at this time.  In lieu of daily data for these accounts, Valero
intends  to  provide  summary level data in the near future. Daily data for
the  Clearlake  methanol  plant  will  be  provided at a later date when it
becomes available. In the meantime, please refer to the RFP for the summary
data  and  associated  discussion  regarding  the  market  environment  for
domestic methanol production.

Please  treat  the  provided  data  as confidential per the Confidentiality
Agreement executed between Valero and your company. Power use data has been
sent  via  overnight  mail.  As  questions  arise,  please  send them to my
attention.

Thanks,

Dave
