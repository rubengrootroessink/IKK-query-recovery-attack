I just have to brag on myself as my game seldom affords me the opportunity.
Sunday after church, Tom Knox and I played 18 holes at Mimosa.  The weather
was perfect.  While my game stunk overall (118), I did manage par on one par
3 and two par 5's.  The best was at 14 --- a 545 yard par 5.  My drive was
280 yards (the ground was flat!).  I was on the green three feet from the
pin in 3, and then two-putted.  Those three pars however will keep me going
back.  Remember, I had a witness!

Thanks for listening to me brag.  And no, don't expect me to replicate these
feats on our next outing.  Hope all are doing well.  We're remembering
Rachel and Jake in our prayers each day.
