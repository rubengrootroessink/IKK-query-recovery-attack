ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

Fan Fares gives you the chance to spend some time in a city you might not 
otherwise visit. This weekend, enjoy yourself in Milwaukee.

TRAVEL TO MILWAUKEE

A friendly city with a decidedly sophisticated air, this midwestern gem 
offers plenty of art and cultural events, nightlife, and beautiful lakeside 
parks. And there's plenty to do indoors in Milwaukee, so don't let the 
February weather keep you away.

In addition to the professional basketball action on Saturday night (Indiana 
comes to town to play Milwaukee), here's a few other ideas to get your 
planning started.

THE HAGGERTY MUSEUM OF ART
Located on the western end of downtown on the Marquette University campus, 
the museum's collection includes works by Dali, Chagall and Man Ray. You'll 
also find an impressive collection of sculpture and contemporary glass.

THE MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM
This museum of human and natural history is one of the nation's best and 
often sets the standard for similar institutions. Everyone in the family will 
enjoy the engaging exhibits. You'll find 150,000 square feet of exhibit 
space, through which you'll be able to visit all of the world's continents. 
Find the museum and The Humphrey IMAX Dome Theater at 800 West Wells Street.
