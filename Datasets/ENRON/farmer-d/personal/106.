I have felt a renewed heart for God, a fresh spirit.   I have been in the word lately and Doug and I have to committed to prayer time  together each morning.  It has brought a more positive attitude, much joy,  and thankfulness on my part.  And, yes, satan has already tried to steal  that joy.  But he will not prevail, I will not let Him.  So in those  times when I feel that any bit of joy is seeping away, I begin to pray.  I  found this prayer to be refreshing and worded well.  Please read it,  it may just jumpstart your day and you'll be filled with joy.  Have a  great day!  Amber
Please  take a moment to relax your mind and
humble your heart to focus on  Christ.
Allow God, to be the only person on your
mind while you read  this prayer. If we can
take the time to read long jokes, stories,  etc.,
we should give the same respect to this prayer.
Friends that pray  together, stay together.
Let's pray...
 Father  God,
I thank You for this day. I thank You for my
being able to see  and to hear
this morning. I'm blessed because You are a
forgiving God  and an
understanding God. You have done so much for me
and You keep on  blessing me.
Forgive me this day for everything I have done,
said or  thought that was not
pleasing to you. I ask now for Your  forgiveness.
Please keep me safe from all danger and harm.
Help me to  start this day
with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let
me make  the best of each
and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear
from  You.
Please broaden my mind that I can accept all
things. Let me not  whine and
whimper over things I have no control over. Let
me continue to  see sin
through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil.
And when I sin,  let me
repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing,
and receive the  forgiveness
of God.
And when this world closes in on me, let  me
remember Jesus' example - to
slip away and find a quiet place to  pray. It's
the best response when I'm
pushed beyond my limits. I know  that when I can't
pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to  do
Your will.?Continue to bless me that I may
be a blessing to  others.
Keep me strong that I may help the weak. Keep me
uplifted  that I may have
words of encouragement for others. I pray for
those that  are lost and can't
find their way.
 I pray for those that are  misjudged and
misunderstood. I pray for those who
don't know You  intimately. I pray for those that
will delete this without
sharing it  with others. I pray for those that
don't believe. But I thank
you that I  believe.
I believe that God changes people and God changes
things. I  pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each
and every  family member in their households.
I pray for peace, love and joy in  their homes
that they are out of debt and all their needs are  met.
I pray that every eye that reads this knows there
is no  problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God.
Every battle is  in Your hands for You to fight. I pray that
these words  be received into the hearts of every eye that sees
them and every  mouth that confesses them willingly.
This is my prayer.
In  Jesus' Name, Amen.
