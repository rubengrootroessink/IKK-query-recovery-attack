Daren,
 
Now what? I see Ken is back and Jeff is  out. What a development. Jeff has a lot of his bud's in high places. Could be  many changes on the horizon.
 
How you doing? Moved to new building yet?  I'll be looking for my tour invitation.
 
How's the kids, wife, and home (read that  work project)?
 
Jen is home for a couple of weeks before  heading back to Waco. We are going up there to tour the new Law school (built  with tobacco settlement money -- so we feel like contributators). She has four  quarters down and 5 maybe 6 to go.
 
Son still in Florida. We plan to run over  there in September for a few days. Maybe do Disneyworld.
 
Jeni is supposed to get us tickets to the  Nebraska game in Waco this year. That should be fun. Speaking of football, I see  one Texas team high in the polls. The other???????
 
I got a new toy the other day. Sears had  a good sale on a power washer I've had my eye on, so I bought it. Just did the  patio and deck. God, I thought painting was mindless  work.....................
Also, found out from insurance company  they will be funding an entirely new roof (hail damage???). I don't like the  mess from that project but as old roof was a layover the old shake shingles I  will be glad to get rid of that and get decking down on roof.   
 
Know you are busy. Let me know the latest  when you have time.
 
Later,
Ken
