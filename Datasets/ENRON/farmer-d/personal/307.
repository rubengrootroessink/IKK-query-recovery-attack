is it possible that his first name show as "J Darren" ?   Daren is his middle 
name and the name that everyone addresses him by.    
We would also be glad to submit the change in SAP if the system will accept J 
Darren as the first name.
Please advise. 
Thanks for your help, hgm

Please note that the name in Pep has to mirror what is in the source system.  
Currently there is not a field in Pep for nicknames.
