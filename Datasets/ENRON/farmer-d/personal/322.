Hi again,
?
I can hardly wait for some good stuff regarding my "friend". I  do hope you 
understand I am not against the person or persons -- just the way  they do 
their jobs.
?
I can't believe Pat just left. Must have been a really bad  meeting. Who took 
his place?
?
I see Henry Hub was close to $7.50 yesterday. Amazing. Your  producers must 
be happy.
?
Trees -- ha. It is getting to be a choice between trees or  gifts. 
?
Markets up nicely, courts ruling nicely, Greenspan softening  his stance on 
interest, Linda not shopping as much as prior years. Looking good  today.
?
Later,
Ken
