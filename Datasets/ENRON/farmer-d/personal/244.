The message below was sent Friday afternoon and came back with an incorrect 
address. Merry gave me the corrected e-mail address shown above.

New developments. Merry and the baby went home this afternoon and he has now 
been named. He is Brandon Aaron Byington

Hi there, Darren & Tonya,

Merry and Doc had their new baby at 9:26 AM yesterday. No name yet. They are 
still trying to settle on one, so in the mean time, I'm just calling him "New 
Child" Byington.

He weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1/4" long. Merry, Doc, and "New Child" are 
doing fine. Doc was in there during the whole delivery (C section) so he says 
he was a bit shakey there a time or two.

Here are some digital camera pics I took when "N. C." was less thasn an hour 
old.
