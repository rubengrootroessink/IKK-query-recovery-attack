Hello Again,

My Monthly Newsletter is attached. Please read it and let me
know your comments.

According to a survey taken by HomeGain, homesellers hoping
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do
best to stick to moderately priced projects. The survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $80 to $2,800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells. The biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening, which typicall costs
about $80-$100 and gives an average return of 769% on the
sale price. Other big winners were cleaning and
de-cluttering (cost=$305-$339;; return=594%), landscaping
and trimming (cost $432-$506; return=266%), and fixing,
plumbing and electrical (cost $338-$381; return=196%).
