We should probably take this deal to zero.

Carlos - Please check with measurement to determine if this volume is 
correct.  We may have some bad information feeding through.

Julie-
Sales 
#451362

We billed Wyman Gordon 363 mmbtus at $4.7328 in Sept 2000.

 I spoke with Richard Moran at Wyman Gordon and he indicated that he has not 
had any physical gas deals with us in over a year and does not owe us the 
$1,718.01 we billed him for September.

Can you please validate if this is his gas or if this deal ticket should have 
been linked to some type of financial deal.  

Thanks- Katherine
