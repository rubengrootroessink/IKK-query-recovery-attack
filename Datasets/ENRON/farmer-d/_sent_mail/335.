No, we have transported on Tejas a few times this year also (on and off).  
Carlos should be able to tell you when.

Daren- Was 10/99 the only month we transported this Carthage gas on Tejas?

I phoned Doug Trachta at Tejas regarding this issue.  I appears that 
nominations were made under ENA's agreement 6520 on Tejas Pipeline Company 
from Carthage to Indian Hills.  However, both of these points are actually on 
the Tejas Gas Operating.  ENA doesn't have an agreement to ship on Operating, 
but HPL does.   I think we need to set up an accounting arrangement to 
accomodate this deal, it appears as though ENA would be "piggy-backing" on 
HPL's agreement as they actually own the gas.  It appears as though we need 
to move the volumes from Pipeline to Operating, at the very least.  How have 
other months been handled with respect to this transport?

Please let me know if I may be of any further assistance in resolving this 
deal.
