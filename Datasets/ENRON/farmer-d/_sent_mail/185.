Megan, 

I have created deal 514353 to capture the $.04 agency fee for the Tenaska 
deal.  This deal will have zero volume and zero commodity price with a demand 
charge of $.04 on 45,000/day.  Since there is no volume, Mark McCoy will be 
scheduling this deal as a zero nom.  Hopefully, this will allow the demand 
charge to flow through the system.  Let me know if you don't see this 
happening.  For Sep and Oct, you will need to get someone in Volume 
Management to create an accounting arrangement for this deal (pathed to the 
imbalance pool).  When actuals come in, you can give me the volumes and I 
will change the demand charge.  I took the demand charge off of the sale 
ticket (#384258).
