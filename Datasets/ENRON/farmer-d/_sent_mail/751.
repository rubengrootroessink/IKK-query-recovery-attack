Subject: Duke Energy Field 8/00

Please change the demand fee on deal 157288 for 8/00 from $9,575.45 to 
$6,143.64.  We need to reduce our payment to Duke.  When I adjusted the over 
delivery charge on the days we didn't nom,  the demand amount changed.  I 
waited until Duke agreed before I sent you this change.  

Thanks,
Megan
