KH, 

We created deal 229758 a while back to correct this.  You will need to get 
Vol Mgmt to reallocate volumes from #157288 to this deal to close it out.

Purchase 
Deal #157288

It appears that the price on PGEV should be Index less $.06 not Index less 
$.05 for the redelivery.
Let me know which is correct per the exchange agreement.

Thanks-
K
