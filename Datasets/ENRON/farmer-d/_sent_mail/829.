BH, 

If the Super Saturday occurred on a different weekend, I would help you out.  
However, we have a pretty important family weekend coming up.  Cole's 3rd 
birthday is today.  We will be doing a little celebrating with that.  Plus, 
we are putting our house on the market this week and are scheduling 
appointments to view other houses.  Anyway, I hope everything else is going 
well for you.  We need to talk sometime.  I will call you in a couple of days.

Subject: Enron Industrial Markets - Super Saturday Recruiting

I need your help!  On Saturday, 01/20/01, EIM is having a Super Saturday to 
recruit experienced Commercial Support personnel to fill many of our 
vacancies.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough personnel to do the 
interviewing.  To round out the Logistics team, I am looking for one more 
interviewer.  The current team is Roy Lipsett, Dan Hamilton and Del Davis.  
Both Dan and Del are new to Enron (Del started 1/8 and Dan is still 
transitioning his prior job and moving to Houston), but bring a wealth of 
Logistics experience for our industries.  I would love to have one additional 
team member to provide input from the Enron perspective.  Will this candidate 
fit into the expectations of Enron?  Will the candidate compete when compared 
to their peers.  Unfortunately, Logistics candidates below Manager have been 
difficult to find from the industry.  There seems to be a tendancy towards 
clerical skill sets but compensation at a Specialist level.  Consequently, I 
have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up 
to fail.

I know the sacrifice of a Saturday, but I would value the input that any one 
of you might offer.  We do expect it to be a full day commitment as we have 
several candidates, and we will have a follow-up evaluation session.  I know 
I can't adequately compensate you for your day, but I would be happy to buy 
you a dinner for two.  Please let me know ASAP.  Assuming worst case that noe 
of you are available, I would welcome other suggestions.

In advance, I appreciate your help.
