This gas should be allocated to deal 70499 (Unit Gas Transmission).  That 
point is already on the ticket (under ENA).

Daren:

During the period of 9/5/99 thru 9/6/99, the above meter recorded flow of 
3,962 Mmbtus.  There was no deal at this meter the month prior or after.  
Currently, Logistics has these volumes recorded to HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either a deal to 
record these volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline or Logistics needs 
approval to writeoff these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return the original to Clem Cernosek).

 APPROVAL to Writeoff the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss
