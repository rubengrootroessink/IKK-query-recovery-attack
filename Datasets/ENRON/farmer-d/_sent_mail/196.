This is the course.  The 7th is fine.  I also have Brandy looking into the 
tuition reimbursement deal.  Apparantly, the person she needs to talk to is 
out of the office.

Daren-

There is an effective communication course on December 7 (Thursday) from 
1-5pm.  Is this the one you suggested for me, and if it is, may I attend this 
one?  Please let me know.  It is listed through Ernie and is $200.  Thanks 
for looking into this.
