I created deal #439909 for August.

Jeff - I am assuming that the price for August is Gas Daily.  Currently, we 
have the September deal priced at Gas Daily also.  Since this was flowing on 
the first, should the price be at Inside Ferc HSC for September?

Sorry about that, I had some tech difficulty with the first version and the 
subject line, which was pertinent, was not included.
