Christine, 

Attached is the Entex file I mentioned in the voice mail this morning.  We 
really need to have these adjustments made in POPS today.  Please let me know 
if you can help with this.  Thanks.

Subject: Entex Adjustments for 5/00

I have reviewed the Entex actuals and adjusted Gas Control's Entex factor for 
the month of May.  I have found that Entex estimates have been overstated by 
approximately 10.0 Mmcf/Day.

Romeo:

Will you make sure the estimates that are in POPs are corrected to reflect 
the new volumes.  This should help reduce some of the UA4 that Daren and Pat 
are trying to locate.  

The attached file has the changes that need to be made.  Please let everyone 
on this mailing list know once the changes have been made.



If you have any questions please call me at 36449.

Thanks
Gary H
