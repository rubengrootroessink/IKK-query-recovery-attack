I made the following industrial changes for March 3rd:

Chevron  decreased to 9500/day.  This should remain for the rest of the month.

Lyon-Citgo increased to 34,000.  This is an increase of 10,000 that will need 
to be rolled daily until further notice.

Shell Cogen increased by 5,000 to 45,000.  This will need to be rolled daily 
until further notice.

Let me know if you have any quesitons.
