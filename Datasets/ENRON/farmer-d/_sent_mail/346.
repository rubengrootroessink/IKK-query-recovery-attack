Geoff,

Thanks for the pictures. Looks like the kids had a great time!

I hope you don't mind, but I've taken liberty to turn them into a web photo
album at http://24.27.98.30/pictures/08-05_Garrett_Gayle_Bday. If you want
to pass this web site address along to other folks, feel free.

If you want a CD copy of this web site, give me a yell.

Thanks,

Ram Tackett,  (mailto:rtackett@abacustech.net)
