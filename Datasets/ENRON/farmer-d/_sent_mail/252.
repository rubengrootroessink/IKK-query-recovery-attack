We have adjusted Suemar in Sitara.  And will probably adjust it again in a 
few days.  Since we bridge back estimates daily, the production at the 
Berryman well has been adjusted in the economics.  So, this will not have an 
impact on UA4.

Subject: Suemar Berryman; Gulf Plains Plant for Current Month

Daren,

As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for 
OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a 
physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is 
that we are "overproduced" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need 
to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a 
corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to 
keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not, 
please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month 
UA4.

Thank you,

Mary
