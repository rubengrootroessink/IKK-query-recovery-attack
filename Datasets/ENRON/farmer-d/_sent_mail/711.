Susan, 

I need you to do the research on this meter.  You will need to review the 
various scheduling systems to see how this was handled prior to 2/96.  You 
can also check with Volume Management to see if they have any info regarding 
the allocation of the point.  Let me know what you find out and I will work 
on getting a deal in place.

Daren

Daren,

The following months are outstanding UA4 issues which appear to need a 
contract.  Please research and let me know if this gas was actually 
purchased.  Thanks, Susan.
