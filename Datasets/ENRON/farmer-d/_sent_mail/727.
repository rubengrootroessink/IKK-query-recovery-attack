A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a record 
of a spot deal with them for that day.

Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The 
price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If you 
don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.

Daren,

I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February 
production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a 
deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this?

Thanks for your help.

Rebecca

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his 
term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not 
invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.
