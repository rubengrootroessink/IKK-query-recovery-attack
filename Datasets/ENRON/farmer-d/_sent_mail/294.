Darren,

How are things going?  Just a note to reiterate what we talked about 
yesterday.  Rick Hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee 
was for an outside counterparty.  This admin fee would be for the life of the 
project (through 2019).   Also, Mike Mazowita should be calling you to talk 
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John
