Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella
