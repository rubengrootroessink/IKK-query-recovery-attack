The price should be 3.56.  There had been alot of price and volume 
discussions for this gas day and 8/1/00.  I checked the notes and found that 
we actually settled at 3.56 instead of 3.58.

Daren-

Sell to Tenaska Marketing

Tenaska is indicating that the sale for July 2000 should be priced at $3.56.  
Could you confirm our sale price should have been $3.58?

Subject: Cleburne Plant

Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized 
through legal.  However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make 
some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers. 

Buy from Tenaska IV
 July 399763
 Aug 399773

Sell to Tenaska Marketing
 July 399791
 Aug 399797

Sell to ANP
 Aug 399814

The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".

Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany 
mail.  (I received both invoices this week)

 I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks.
