Daren,
Do you have any information on these deals?  We cannot collect the cash from 
Midcon if we can't prove to them the
deals are valid. 

Thanks,
Kris

Pat Dresner (accountant) at Midcon Texas says she does not show these deals 
in her system and she can not pay on them.  You created the deals in Sitara 
and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN 
trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someone 
at KN should tell their accountant about the deal.

Prod Mo. Entity     Point  Volume  Total Amount  Sitara #
1/2000  Midcon Texas Gas Services Corp. 0984132 20000  $51,600.00 157006
2/2000  Midcon Texas Gas Services  0984132 36000  $90,900.00 166523
2/2000  Midcon Texas Pipeline Corp.  0984132 80,000  $206,800.00 170133


Please let me know as soon as possible what you find out.  The 2/2000 
production invoices are due to be paid 3/27.

Thank You,
