Megan, 

I have changed the pricing on deals 452491 and 452475 for October flows to 
mtr 25000200.  These flows should be priced at $.10 + 1/2 % fuel.  The $.11 
that Lone Star billed us is incorrect on the last deal.  I'm not sure about 
the rates for mtr 20014903.  The person who can tell us should be in 
tomorrow.  I will leave a note for her.  We should have similar deal tickets 
for Dec forward.  I will check with Mark and Trisha.

Have you been able to work out these transport pricing differences for Oct. 
2000?  We have only been able to pay $4,000.00 of the $28,000.00 invoice.  
The pricing for Nov. 2000 (deal 452491) has problems too.  We have $0.01 for 
11/3 at meter 20014804 and TXU is billing us $0.10 at meter 25000200 and 
$0.02 at meter 20014903 for the entire month.

I have also noticed that we are not accruing any transport for Dec 2000 
forward.  We have received the Dec. 2000 invoice from TXU, but we do not have 
a deal to pay them.  We should be getting Jan. 2001 next week.  Is there a 
deal for these months?  

Megan

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,
Megan
