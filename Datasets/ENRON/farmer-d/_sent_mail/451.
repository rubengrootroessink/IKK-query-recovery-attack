ENA Gas Assets Group Outing

You have between now and June 6th to practice and get ready.  It's time to 
get in touch with you inner bowler.  That's right, we are going bowling!!!!  
Tuesday, June 6th all of Gas Assets, everyone under Brenda's direction, will 
be going Bowling.  We will depart the Enron building between 2:45 and 3:15 on 
buses (no not the yellow kind) and we head for Dynamic Lanes, where everyone 
will be placed on a team of 4, bowl three games, compete and cheat (just 
joking) for fabulous prizes and then return to the Enron building around 6:00 
pm, just in time to catch buses and go home.

FAQ
Is it mandatory that I go?

No, BUT you will be gravely missed if you are not there, you will be left out 
of all the inside jokes that are sure to come as a result of this event, and 
you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers for not attending.


 If I don't go bowling can I leave work / stop working at 2:45. ?

No.

If I do go does that mean I do not have to return to work to complete 
required daily tasks such as P&L?

No.
