Good afternoon Mr Farmer 

As I am sure you are aware we are in the procees of changing our banks, and 
the new bank "Citibank" was not able to process our charter fees for the 1st 
April, I , therefore have a cheque to send to you to cover this April 
payment.? Please could you let me know the best address I can send this to, 
you may want me to send it straight to you or to your bank.

I look forward to hearing from you.
