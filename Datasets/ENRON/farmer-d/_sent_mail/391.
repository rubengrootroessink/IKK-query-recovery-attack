Deal 93200 covers this meter.  However, we have a zero as the expected 
volume.  You can select "always send nom" in MOPS to get this to come over in 
POPS.

Daren - meter 1429, IND Sterling Gas Plant has flow beginning 6/12.  It is a 
very small volume.  Could you please create a deal for this?

Thanks.
