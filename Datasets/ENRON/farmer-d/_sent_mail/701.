Subject: displaying 4 digit year on your desktop

In case you were not aware, you have the ability to control the Date display 
format on your PC.  As we approach year 2000, you may wish to see all four 
digits of the year to insure that when you enter '00', the system recognizes 
it as 2000 vs. 1900.  Some of your column widths may need to be expanded to 
view these 2 additional digits.  To do this, go to:

Start/Settings/Control Panel/Regional Settings/Date tab, Short date style.  
You may want to change it from "mm/dd/yy" to "mm/dd/yyyy" then hit OK.

The screen print below may be helpful.  Please forward to others in your area 
that may be interested.  Thanks, d.n.
