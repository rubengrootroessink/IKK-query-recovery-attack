I have entered a one month deal in Sitara - deal # 416019 for referenced sale

This delivery is subject to an external expense transport fee to Entex - see 
old deal Sitara 93471 for details

Fee to Entex is 5 cents

PLEASE :  someone enter this transport info into deal # 416019 as I don't 
know how/what to do ....
