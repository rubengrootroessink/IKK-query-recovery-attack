You've got to love idiotic calls, don't you?  An onside kick after you've won 
the game?  What was Barnett  thinking?  

I don't think I'll ever watch another Aggie football game...ohh, the misery.  
I can't handle the emotional rollar coastar.

Anyway, How was Thanksgiving?  Did you make your trip out to pick up the 15 
ft christmas tree?  Or was it bigger this year?  We made the journey to 
Tuscaloosa.  The trip wasn't too bad.  That TV/VCR is a lifesaver.  I ate way 
too much, but it sure was good.  

Hope everthing's going good for you and the family.

Sorry about the game.

It was not a good year for the Corn Boys and  Aggies.

Later,
