Please call if I can be of any additional assistance.

Donald, please see Julie's email below.  This is the deal that was not in the 
system that I had asked you about.  Please let me know if there is something 
else that I need to do.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

I'm not sure if you got this resolved, but Donald will need to have someone 
put a deal in, either a spot or has it been firmed up.

Subject: C&E Operating, 11/99 production

Hi Julie, I have a question and I wasn't sure of who to start with.  I have a 
new meter for C&E Operating, meter # 0989813 that started up Nov.29.  I have 
a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29th and 30th, a 
total of 660mmbtu.  The problem is there is nothing in the system for meter # 
9813 for 11/99 production.  I looked in Sitara,( sitara # 132030 ) and the 
deal  starts for 12/99 production.   I checked with Donald to make sure and 
he says that the meter did start up 11/29 and the price is HSC less $.10.  In 
order to get this deal into the system, who do I need to talk to???

Thanks,  Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
