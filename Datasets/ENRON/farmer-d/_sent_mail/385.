 First of the month  industrials are coming along fine.  I will finalize my 
pathing tomorrow, Thursday,  and set up buybacks and swings by the
    end of day Friday.
 
     The industrial "Buyback & Deficiency Deals" worksheet  has captured the 
necessary data to help Gas Control & the on-call scheduler as well as  
      myself and Client Services.
      I  will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day Friday.
 
      I am on vacation during the week of July 5th thru July 10th.

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.
