Tim, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person.

Bill Bailey with Southwest Garment & Laundry in Irving Texas is looking for an offer for gas supplied to their business under an 18-36 month term.  The last year of volume flow is:

Dec'00	1023
Jan'01	972
Mar	951
Apr	936
May	821
Jun	831
Jul	743
Aug	577
Sep	540
Oct	581
Nov	727
Dec	797
Jan	1098

Bill is needing a price as quickly as possible.  He is apparantly getting pressure from accountants to quickly tie up this supply.  His phone number is 972-438-2730.

Thanks.

Daren
