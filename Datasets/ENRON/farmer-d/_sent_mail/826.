Hey, Mom.

I got your e-mail just fine.  Is your computer fixed up now?  

Cole had a great time at his birthday party last night.  When we were walking 
out of Chuck E Cheese after the party, Cole asked me "Daddy, am I three 
now?"  He got some good presents and got to play alot of games.  It took him 
forever to go to sleep.  He really loved the Blues Clues game ya'll got him.  
The packaging was coming open when he got it yesterday, so Tonya let him open 
it before the party.  He played it in the car going to the party and on the 
way home.  I think I'm tired of that game.  He can't play it in the car 
anymore.  It so funny to watch him play though.  He will repeat the question 
and go "hmm".  Anyway I need to go.
