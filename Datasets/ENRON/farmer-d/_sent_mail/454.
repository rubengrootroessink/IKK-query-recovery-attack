Nagesh, 

Please resort the pipeline order on the Texas/HPLC position screen in CPR.  
The current sort makes it difficult for us to manage our trading position 
each day.  The arrangement  (from the top of the screen to the bottom) that 
would most benefit us is listed below:

Houston Pipe Line
East Texas Gas System
NNGB
Oasis
PG&E Valero
All remaining pipes listed in alphabetical order by pipe name.


Please look into this and let me know of any problems in making these changes.

Thanks.

Daren
