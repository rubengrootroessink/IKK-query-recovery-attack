Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the delivery period

.  If you need any additional information or have any questions, please contact me at 35656.  Thanks.  EMV
