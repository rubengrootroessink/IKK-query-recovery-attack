Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

Did you survive bid week?
 
I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff left?
 
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)
 
Gotta run. Almost have my *&%$#!!@# taxes done. If people  had to write a personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some  big changes. It sucks.? ?Later,?Ken? ? ??
