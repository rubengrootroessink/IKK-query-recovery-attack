I have rolled or input the following deals for October.

Crosstex 138553  2
Duke  418429  139
Hesco  394798  500
Swift  418431  322
Tri-Union 418432  700
Vintage  403367  300
Whiteoak 418434  96
Whiting  418436  100

So, I am showing that the only deals we have outstanding for Oct are:

Camden/9858  3000
Heatherlock/6879 544  (previous deal#133010)
North Central/5228 3000

Julie - Please check these deals for the correct contract/terms.  Also, 
please look into Heatherlock.  Vance is noming gas for this deal.  However, 
the deal ticket does not have an evergreen flag. When I tried to roll another 
month, I got a message that another contract was needed.

Thanks.
