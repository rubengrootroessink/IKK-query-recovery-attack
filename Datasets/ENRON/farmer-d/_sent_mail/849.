Subject: Announcing a New Enron Brown Bag Seminar - "How to Win a Bowl Game"

The following seminar will be given several times this year.  The 
distinguished list of speakers is as follows:

   Bryan Hull
   Chad Landry
   Tim Blanchard
   Bob Cotten

A cameo appearance will be made by Dr. Mick Walters, esq.  Of course, this 
seminar will be moderated by Yours Truly.  

Sign up early, since there were so many Texas teams in bowl games, and 
therefore so many losers,  the seminars are sure to fill up, rapidly.  

P. Love - I am sure it is little consolation, but at least you covered.

     
     P.S. Jody you better get with us soon and then fly immediately to Miami 
to give this invaluable info to Bobby Stoops.
