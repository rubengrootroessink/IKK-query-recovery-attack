Hey, AC!  

How are things going for you?  Liking your new freedom, wild girl?  I hope 
your having fun.  I'm sure missing you on Entex.  I'm already feeling the 
heat from TM.  With the cold spell and the change in weather forecasts, I 
have to re-evaluate Entex everyday.  But, that's the way it always is over 
here.  I've been meaning to e-mail you, but I always remember after I leave 
the office.  Anyway, let me know how it's going.

Later, 
D
