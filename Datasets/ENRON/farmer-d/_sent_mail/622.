I've extended the deal for the rest of the year, with a -0- nom.

Daren - Deal # 97929, meter 1450 expired Nov. '99.  Is there a way for you to 
extend the deal or create a new one since there seems to be a little bit of 
flow each month?

- Aimee

Aimee:

There is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month.  The 
reason for the error is that the deal, # 97929 has expired.  Please determine 
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it?

To fix this I will set up an accounting arrangement but what I need from you 
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to 
put the deal on.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Fred
