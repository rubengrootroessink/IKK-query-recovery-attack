Hey, Ken.

Well, the folks are fine.  But, they have a few friends who lost just about 
everthing.  In fact, one family found only a couple of boxes of salvagable(?) 
items from their home (only one family picture) .  I understand that alot of 
homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save.  It was very 
bad.  What made it worse was the freezing weather coming in.  When we talked 
to Tonya's parents, they were really in shock of bad it was.

 Have you been battling those Christmas mobs?  I took friday and Monday off 
and tried my luck at it.  I didn't last too long.  It doesn't seem right to 
be cussing everyone out at Christmas...I think I hate people now...I think 
I'm becoming a scrooge.   Well, I hope ya'll are doing good and staying in 
the Christmas mood.  Cole is excited about Christmas (wants more Hot Wheels 
and monster trucks).  Jake doesn't have the foggiest idea what's going on 
except that he wants to rip every ornament off of the tree and eat it.  We've 
told him "no" so much that he shakes his head back and forth and smiles while 
he's grabbing for one.  He is a handful.  Jake has also started taking 
steps.  He just turned 9 months old this month.  That's a little over a month 
earlier than Cole started taking steps.  

Anyway, I need to go.
