The bridgeback will take care of changing the volumes from the 1st.

Patty Boling from Vintage called and wanted to know why her nom was at 630 
for the first when it should be 320.  This was one of the ones that the 
system pushed the Jan numbers over.   We have it changed back to the 320 from 
the 9th on due you want me to change the volumes from the 1st to  the 8th 
from 630 to 320. Let me know.
