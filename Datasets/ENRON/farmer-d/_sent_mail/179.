Daren,

How about tomorrow morning.  Mary said that that would be a good time.  I 
will just come down and find you after our morning meeting.  

Thanks a lot.

Mike

Mike, 

You can come down anytime.  The mornings will be the best time to learn, but 
you can spend as much time as you want.  Since things are so crazy, I may not 
be able to answer all of your questions immediately, but can answer them 
later.  I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.  You can start with 
me tomorrow or next Tuesday, it's up to you.  We usually start trading around 
8:30.  We usually start the day at 7:30 with the Gas Control and Weather 
meeting.

Daren,

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

Thanks.

Mike
