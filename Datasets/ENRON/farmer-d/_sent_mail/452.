Tom, 

Please handle this.  The deal is already out there for this time period.  You 
will probably need to send a zero nom.

Daren - During the Saxet Thompsonville outage, May 8 - May 11, the meter 
flowed a small volume with no nom.  Can you set up a deal for the days that 
flowed?

 5/8 .012
 5/9 0
 5/10 .087
 5/11 6.970
