Daren,

I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on 
the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we 
have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few 
days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85% 
of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine 
what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt.

Mary
