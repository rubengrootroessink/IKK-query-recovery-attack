Hey, Ken.

Well, I don't know what I'm going to do.  We will have a Texas Desk, but I 
don't really want to continue here.  I may look into Brenda's group (Pulp, 
Paper, Lumber, Steel).  I will most likely interview with AEP to see what 
they have to offer, but it has to be very good in order for me to leave the 
Evil Empire.  I am just glad they finally anounced the sale.  Some folks are 
upset and concerned about the whole deal, but I'm glad it's happened.

Anyway, I meant to let you know how our Christmas went with the boys.  Cole 
loved everything.  He had a great time and was sad to see Christmas come to 
an end.  Jake is a little different.  We spent $60 on a couple of things for 
him.  He hasn't touched them more than twice.  He found his new favorite toy 
the day after Christmas:  it's one of those soft cooler things you carry your 
lunch in.  He found that in the bottom of our pantry and now carries it 
around everywhere.  Now we have these two big plastic things just taking up 
more room in our already crowded house.

We started our house hunting last week.  I think this is going to be a long 
process.  Tonya's out looking today.  I'm letting her make the first cut.  I 
will come in on the second round.  We will probably put our house on the 
market in a couple of weeks.  We have a few small things we want to clean up, 
fix, etc., before we list it.  According to the other sales in the 
neighborhood, we should make a little money.

I hope everything is going well with you and the family.  

Later.

D
