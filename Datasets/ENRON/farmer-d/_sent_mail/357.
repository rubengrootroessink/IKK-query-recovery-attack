The term contract with Four Square attached to deal #138049 has been 
terminated.  Therefore, we need to take that deal to zero for August 2000 
forward.  Additionally, we entered into a base load (August only) deal to 
purchase the gas from Four Star at mtr 6599 (#348446).  The 1,500/day should 
be schueduled on this deal.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 Deal 138049 is committed reserve long term gas totaling 1,350mm per day 
which is a good deal.
 
 However, deal #:  348446 is a  duplicate deal which was overstated and 
should be zeroed out {bad deal}.
 
 This is Vance response to an inquiry made by Bob.
 
 Daren, do you want me to zero out  deal #: 348446 ?
