I rolled deal 150325 for the first 3 days of Jan.  I expect this point to be 
zero for the rest of Jan.

Daren - there is flow at meter 1386 for Jan 1-3.  The average flow is 
828/day.  The last deal associated with this meter is 150325, Dec. 1-4, 
2000.  The counterparty is Hampshire.  Could you please look at this and let 
me know if you put a deal in for these days?

Thanks.
