Mary, 

Please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter.  I 
am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect. In POPS, the estimates vs 
acutals look odd.  The gas that was coming to us in June, is going to Koch in 
July, so we should not be receiving anything.

Subject: Extend Deal

I have flow at meter 989602 for July without a deal to allocate to.   For 
June production, deal number 276494 was at the meter.  Please either extend 
the deal or create a ticket.  If you have any questions, please call me at 
ext. 35251.

Thank you,

Mary Jane
