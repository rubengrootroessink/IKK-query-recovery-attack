Hey, Byron.

We may be interested in your sofa.  Send me the pictures when you get a 
chance.  Now that we are moving, we've got a few empty rooms.  Thanks.

Hello friends,

Leslie and I have a sleeper sofa, a real sturdy and heavy one, that we are
wanting to get rid of.  It has a very comfortable bed and would be great for
an extra room in the house.  It is in great condition other than some cat
claws in the arms...done before I cut out the claws.

I have pictures I can e mail if you are interested.  We will give it away or
sell it to the highest bidder!

Byron
