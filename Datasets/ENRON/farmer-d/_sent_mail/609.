Tom, 

I changed the meter on deal 156161 from7012 to 7341.  You will need to repath 
and renom this in MOPS.  Also, you will need to make sure that the welhead 
meteres are linked to 7341 in POPS.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Daren,   I just talked to Mary and she said that they developed the meter 
987341 for the meters that you had nominated under the 987012.   Under 
Aggregate 7012 is 4045;  6026; 6114; 6427; 6848; 9755 ;  these should all be 
under the 987341.  Do we need to renominate these meters or do I just move 
them in pops.  Let me know Daren  I aim to please ( I think that's a southern 
term!!)
