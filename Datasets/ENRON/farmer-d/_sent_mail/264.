Sandi, 

The exisiting contracts on Lone Star are sufficient to cover deliveries to 
the plant (95,000 Mmbtu maximum daily quantity).  In the event that we have 
to transport excess gas to alternate locations, we will be using an ENA 
transport agreement and charging the expense back to Tenaska IV.

Daren,
Will there ever be a need to utilize transport to get supply to the plant 
other than through the 2 Lone Star agreements? If so, would we be using 
Tenaska transport agreements or ENA?
