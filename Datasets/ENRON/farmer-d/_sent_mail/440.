Hey Daren,

We're back on this issue again.  There is gas out there for days 1-3 and 6-20 
but the deal is only good for 21-31. 

Can you assist Anita and I w/a deal number to place the 1st 20 days on.  
Anita is attempting to close this issue.

As usual, thanks for your help.

Jackie,
We are back on this issue again...........the deal was only good for day

Stephanie still thinks this should be for Encina.   Please advice.

Thanks

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks
-Jackie-

Anita, have you found out any further information about this meter.  Encina 
still beleives that we owe them for this gas.

Thanks, Stephanie (3-6004)

Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.  

Thanks

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
