Subject: HPL Noms Files - Did Not Upload

So sorry....

I do not know who exactly to send this email to....

I do not know whose HPL nom files these are.  Whoever was trying to send noms 
to HPL between 4:16pm and 5pm on Thursday 1/20/2000, your noms did not get 
uploaded into POPS.  Please re-send if you have not already.

The production unix machine we process the edi noms on ran out of space.  
When the machine runs out of space, it pages me, but unfortunately no data 
can be saved in the edi files.

I was trying to free up space and after I was done (like 1 hour later, ie. 
6pm), did I notice that these nom files had zero data in them.  Because they 
have zero data in them, I do not know what gas dates or contracts were 
suppose to be in the file which is why I do not know if these are ECT, HPLR, 
HPLC.

We are suppose to get a bigger unix box installed the weekend of 2/5/2000.  
This running our of space has only happened twice in the past year that I 
remember and that it affected the edi processes in some way on those 
occasions.

Call me if you think these files are yours and you need some help in knowing 
how to re-send.
