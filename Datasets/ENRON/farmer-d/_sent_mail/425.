Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000 
forward to deal #292249.  This should help some with amount of time it takes 
to update and bridge back this deal.  He is adjusting the swap tickets also.  
You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok.  

The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time 
involved in updating the deal.
