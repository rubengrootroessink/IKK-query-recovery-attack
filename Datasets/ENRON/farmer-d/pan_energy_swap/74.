Here are the cashout amounts for 5/00 and 6/00 for Duke Energy Field 
Services.  We also need to enter a demand fee to account for the excess of 
103% charge on the sale side.  I have those amounts below.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

May 2000
Deal 157278 $2,486.00 excess charge
  $2.38  cashout

Deal 157288 $71.85  cashout

June 2000
Deal 157278 $920.21  excess charge
  $208.88  cashout

(There is no purchase cashout for 6/00)

Thanks,
Megan
