Daren:
I am taking over the Duke account from Katherine and am having trouble with 
8/00 production.  It looks like we have some spot deals included in the 
exchange deal 157288.  I think days 9 - 31, which are priced at GD - 0.10, 
need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot.   Let me know if you 
agree.  Also, can you confirm for me that days 8/5 and 8/6 are suppose to be 
exchange?  The sale volume for those two days was zero, so there was no 
exchange.  We have not received any statements from Duke yet, so there is 
nothing to verify our volumes.

You may also want to look at Sept. 2000 for deal 157288.  It looks like spot 
deals are being included in the exchange deal.  Those will need to be moved 
to a new ticket if they are spot.

Thanks,
Megan
