Daren:
Per conversation with Ryan McGrath @ AEP in Ohio, he & Genaro Mendoza @
Enron are trying to settle 05/01 gas sales, netout. Per Ryan he is missing
3 sales deals (Sales to AEP by HPL or ENA ),  @ WAHA Hub, that he stated,
per his understanding, Genaro is not reflecting under ENA. The info that he
provided  re: the missing deals are as follows:
   WAHA HUB, 7900 @ $4.18 or   $33,022.00
   WAHA HUB, 7900 @ $4.09 or   $32,311.00
   WAHA HUB, 7900 @ $4.365 or $34,483.50

I checked with Julie Meyers, (see e-mail below), and she suggested that I
contact you. Can you help with this one? I don't reflect any 05/01 sales to
AEP in Unify.


Thanks!
Tess
