In follow up to our discussion yesterday, here is the information I am using to describe our Waha HubCo project as it relates to the compression services deal with Unocal. 

As you know, we are in discussion with NNG about managing their storage agreement and with Sid Richardson/Transco to develop an "intrastate" header system for Sid Richardson's gas that will also be connected to the Unocal plant.  We need to keep coordinated on these discussions.

Regards,
Brian
