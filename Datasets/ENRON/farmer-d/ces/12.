Subject:	RE: Deal 819348

I'm assuming that since this deal is on the new Texas Desk, and that no new deals have been negotiated under CES counterparties that this deal is actually a truncated deal that was split to move open production from ENA - IM Texas (which I believe no longer exists as part of the post-HPL/AEP processes) to ENA - IM Lonestar. The deals have been split several times & when this occurs, as they are all part of the original contract #. Basically (assuming that this was the case) it becomes a "1 of 3" scenario. The deals are kept on the same contract number to help track the continuity of the pieces. Although changing to a new contract will not skew anything, it is generally best to try to keep them all together. (Unless the deal was split for a contract or counterparty issue). Desk splits just basically move the deal to a new book. Since the move was already made, I'm just going to let it stand unless anyone have any objections.

Also, since this is a CES deal there is not a need to reconfirm as none of the CES deals (those still carrying the CES prefix) were to be confirmed by ENA.
Thanks all!
Cyndie

I was researching deal 819348 (CES - MidCon Texas Gas Services Corp) and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract 96035432 (in fact, the GTC Firm had THREE deals attached).  Since one of the deals ended 03/31/01, we won't bother correcting that one, but this deal needs to be moved.  I set up contract 96061912 and attached it today.  THIS DEAL STILL NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED BY CYNDIE BEFORE THE CP IS INACTIVATED.

Elizabeth, could you please revalidate this deal?

My team, could you please add this one to your daily deal count report?

Ellen, could you please reconfirm if necessary?

Thanks, all.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
