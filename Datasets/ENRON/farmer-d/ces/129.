With pre-bid coming up, how should I handle CES? Who will be responsible for 
June info? Also, who on the trade floor will be the Devon contact? Bob 
Superty asked me to be the point person initially, so maybe he has another 
person in mind (Ed Terry or Kathy Kelly - secondary contacts) that he would 
like to handle it besides someone on the Texas desk. This way it could free 
our group up from that task. Part of the reason I was handling it was because 
I wanted to make sure nothing that affects Texas slips through the cracks, 
especially in the beginning. Please advise.
