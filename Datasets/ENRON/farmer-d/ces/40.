Rita, 

Since this is the case, I think we need to change the way we are booking this 
deal.  Currently, the CES-Devon purchase is on 8348, which is a dummy inlet 
to the plant.  Rather, we should probably just have the ENA purch at the 
tailgate, 986363, with a D2D ticket that transfers ownership to HPL, if 
necessary.  Please let me know what you think.

Mary
