Daren, I wanted to check with you on the current status of the of TXU Pipeline imbalance for Tenaska IV.  I noticed on the July statement I just received that the imbalance was at 125,374 MMBTU.  I am not sure if you have been told, but Enron recently entered into a sale agreement with El Paso to sale our interests in this plant by the end of September.  Talking with Rick Hill, he did not want to have a large imbalance liability with the pipeline at the end of September.  Do you think this imbalance will be significantly resolved by the end of the month?  You can call me at 3-7280 if you have any questions.  Thanks.

James
