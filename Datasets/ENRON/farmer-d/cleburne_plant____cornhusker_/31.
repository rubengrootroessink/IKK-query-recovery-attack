I looked at the service records and, for Oct 2000 through April 2001, we have paid $381,263.04 to TXU for transport.  We have another $159,745.14 in draft status.  The two amounts total $541,008.18.  I'm not sure why we have items in draft status.  Antoinette Beale handles the transport payments and I think she is out today.  I know she was having trouble with the volumes coming over.  I have left her a message to call me when she gets back so we can finalize those payments.  The May 2001 estimates total $57,249.44 in the system.  Let me know if you need any more information.

Section 6.4 of Tenaska IV's gas transportation agreement with Lone Star requires the shipper to pay transporter $1,040,000 in transportation fees and/or deficienty payments from the initial delivery date through December 31, 2003.  Do we know what the payments to Lone Star have been to date?  If not, can we find out by contacting Lone Star?
