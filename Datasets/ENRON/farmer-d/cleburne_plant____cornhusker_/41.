As you may know, the Generation Investments Group is in discussions with El Paso on the sale of upstream equity interests in the Cleburne, TX generating facility.  As part of El Paso's diligence, they've asked to meet with our experts in tax, insurance and gas management matters pertaining to the facility on Thursday, June 21 or Friday, June 22.  We intend to schedule three separate meetings in either the Enron Building or 3AC.  Please let me know what your availability is for a meeting on your area of expertise on either of those two days.  

Thanks.

Rick Hill
Generation Investments Group
