You can send your things to 3210F.  That is Liz's old desk.

I just received word that I will not be moving to the other building tomorrow.  I will be moving down to 32.  I will be out on Thursday and Friday for my brother's wedding, but will be on 32 starting Monday.  Daren, Mary will handle Waha from her new desk for those 2 days.

Also, do I have a home on 32 to have my things sent to tomorrow night?  Let me know if there is anything more I need to know.

Thanks.

Mike
