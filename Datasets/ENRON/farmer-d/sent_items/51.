Matt, 

Each month, prior to bidweek, I pull up a monthly range in Path Manager to get a feel of how many of our swing customers operated in a prior month (or a month in a prior year).  I have never had problem with this before, and I have done this task every month since Unify was put into production.  When the problem occurred this month, I was attempting to view Apr 1-30, 2000 on Houston Pipe Line, with HPL as the shipper.  This information is very important for my bidweek preparation.  So, I need to continue perfomorming this operation each month.  If needed, I can wait until 5 pm top view the range.

Darren,
Do you know if you were running pulling up the Path Manager for a date range around 10:51?  How do you normally pull up the Path Manager?  Please let me know as we're attempting to find out what caused this problem and if we should restrict access on the date range functionality.  If you were only pulling it for a day, that would be okay.
 
Thanks

Brian, 
 
At 11:20am this morning, a stored procedure (source_dest_list_range_sp, Line #172) being run by Daren Farmer caused the tempdb transaction log on unifygasp to fill up.  This procedure is run routinely by many other users on a daily basis without incident.  At the time of the failure, this stored procedure had been running since 10:51am, or roughly 30 minutes.  I was notified via automatic page at 11:24am; the page indicating that there was 200MB free.  I immediately checked tempdb, which was by full by this time.  Three attempts to clear the transaction log prior to 11:30am finally resulted in a cleared transaction log.
 
Kishore noiced shortly thereafter that there was a problem in the way that Sybase was accounting for its free space, a condition which may have been crucial to the failure since nearly 5GB of space was apparently unavailable to the transaction log.  A reboot of unifyprod2 at 1:40pm cleared this condition.
