Ed, 

I believe that Jill was going to show EEX a bid with the understanding that any deals on HPL would go with the pipeline after the sale. We were working under the thought that we need continue to conduct business as usual for HPL until the sale is finalized. The HPL piece is just a portion of supply that we are bidding on, and Jill was going to present them with bids for their total package (Enron and HPL).  Let me know what you want to do. If you don't want to place a bid, I will pass that on.

Daren,

It is my understanding that Enron should not be attempting to purchase wellhead supply on HPL per the contract
