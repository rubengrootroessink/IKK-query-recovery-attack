Vance,

Deal tickets have been created and entered in Sitara as noted below.  Deal # 652448 was entered by Risk as a term purchase at a price of IFHSC less $0.14.  You have indicated the price to be Gas Daily less $0.14.  Which price is correct?

Bob

Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty			Meter			Volumes	Deal #	Price				Period		Global No.
Comstock Oil &Gas			9872			500mmbtu/d	652448	100% GD less $0.20		3/30-3/31	96057106

HESCO Gathering Co., LLC		9885			1100mmbtu/d	733139	100% GD less $0.14		3/30-3/31	96058382

FYI, we will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of the deal beginning with the appropiate month.  Additionally, these are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.
