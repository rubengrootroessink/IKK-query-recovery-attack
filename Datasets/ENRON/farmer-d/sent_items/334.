I'm sure that the Panenergy deal is all yours.  I definitely understand your concerns.  Good luck over there.

Well...I'll be going back to my old job.  AEP made me an offer last week.  I really wish I could stay, but the worries and the stress have done me in.  I need a little more piece of mind with my paycheck.  My last day will be the 26th.

Hey, maybe I'll be lucky enough to get PanEnergy back.

Thanks.  Glad to know you are still here.  I'm not sure when I send an email now if the person on the other end is still here.  I will be leaving, though.  I've given two weeks notice.  I'll let you know who will be taking over this gem of an account.

What's the big deal?  It's only one digit...But, if it will make you happy, I will fix it.

Can you look at this again?  I'm missing the 7 before the decimal point.

It's that time again.  Please remove the price on deal 384258 for Nov and add a demand fee of $3,096,547.98.

Thanks,
