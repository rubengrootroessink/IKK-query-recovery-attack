Thu, 

I talked with Lee Papyoti about the Equistar buybacks.  I created deal 675086 as an ENA buyback.  However, after you have allocated the volume between the Equistar plants, please get with Lee and have him look over everything.

Daren,

I am trying to make up the gas for ENA deals on meter 1552,8024,1062, (deals 240061, 378904, 394489, 487588).  Per Anita, these need to be kept whole.  I have the option of a buyback or swing on 1373....but, there is not enough gas at meter 1373 to do this.  Please let me know if there is another way I can achieve this.  

Thu

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA deal whole.  What do you suggest?

Aimee,

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there is another way.

Why do you need it extended?  This deal may not be able to get extended.  Which meter are you having problems with?

Aimee,

I am so sorry...I don't know what's wrong with me.  The deal is 343421.  If you can't extend this deal please let me know.  Thanks

Thu

I don't have access to this ticket.  It is an IM Canada ticket.
