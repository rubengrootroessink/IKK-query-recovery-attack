Effective immediately Sean Riordan @X5-4298 will be responsible for Deal Validation issues.  He is taking over all my current duties as I will be moving to a new group.  I will be helping Sean with Deal Validation issues until 10/19/2001. 

Please let your group know that they should now be calling Sean for assistance.
