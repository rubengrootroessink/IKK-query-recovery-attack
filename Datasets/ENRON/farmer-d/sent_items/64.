Daren - did we have a purchase from Beaumont Methonal on 2/9?  I show a deal of 5.000 on deal 611178.  I confirmed a total of 13.000 (deal 603107) for that day.  Were we buying back 5.000 or was the deal reduced to 13000?

OK thanks! Will be there shortly. Also, Joanie received a call from Beaumont stating that there is a sale to HPL on 2/9 for 5,000 mmbtu. This was reflected on the supply  draft and Buddy Majorrwitz looked into this before he/we released invoice and said that there were no sales to HPL from Beaumont. Do you have any support or documentation re: any/ all 02/01 prod. sales to HPL ? If so, can I also get a copy of that support to fax to customer?

I still handle meter 1428.  I checked my notes for 2/13.  There was an intraday change from 18.000 to 0.  When it was changed to 0, the meter had already flowed 3.811.  It is a valid volume.  If you have anymore questions, please let me know.

Aimee -
Per conversation with Rosa Brown and Thu (In Volumes Management, Beaumont Methanol is a swing deal, by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr. Thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428.

Do you still handle the sales allocations for  HPL meter # 981428? If so, can you confirm 02-01 sales (on HPL, Meter # 981428., Sales Deal # 603107), to Beaumont Methanol (which we've invoiced them ), vs. Chyral Hankins' e-mial to buddy Majorwitz below? The only date that is really in question is sales for flow date 02-13-01 (She reflects noms of 0 vs. the 3,811 mmbtu that we invoiced them).

Thanks,
Tess Ray
