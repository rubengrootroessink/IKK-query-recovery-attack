Hey, Ken.  How's everything going?  I thought about you yesterday here at work and wanted to call but I lost your number.  Send it back to me when you get a chance.  Anyway, we re-started one of the activities you used to love:  balancing Exxon Katy without going through HPL.  It has been a nightmare.  In fact, the guys are still trying to balance the first (it's now noon).  It's been one daisy chain after another.  One small piece changes and it affects 3 other people.  I get tickled every time I think about you going through that.  It has been quite a bit different trading without HPL.  Yesterday, I handled Waha pretty well.  But I got bent over for the weekend.  It has been pretty tough balancing out each point without having transports and storage.

Did you have anything going on over Memorial Day?  We stayed home and worked around the house.  Nothing exciting, but a string of bad luck I'll tell you about sometime.

I hope ya'll are doing good.  Talk to you later.
