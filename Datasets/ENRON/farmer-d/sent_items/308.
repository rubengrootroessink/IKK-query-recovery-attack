Annette, 

The transport statement we received from Lone Star did not show that this gas flowed.  That is why we have not paid yet.  We are in discussions with the pipe to find out what happened.  I will let you know as soon as something is determined.

To recap what we talked about this morning.  The following deals were done for June.  ENA is not showing these deals in you system so therefore they won't pay.  

6/7	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.71	between Roger & Daren
6/12	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.78	between Roger & Daren
6/14	sold 5000 to ENA @ 4.16	between Roger & Daren
6/20	sold 10000 to EOL @ 3.95	between Roger & EOL
6/23-25	sold 10000/d to EOL @ 3.57	between Roger & EOL

Thank you, in advance, for your help with this.
