Elizabeth, 

Can you re-send the file with the attachement?  I accidentally deleted the first message and I don't have access to the file online.

Hi All, 

Attached is the OPM Monthly Hours Survey for September.  I need this returned to me by NEXT Wednesday, September 26th no later than 5:00pm.  

Please do the following: 

1.)  Please click on your region's / cost center's tab in the attached spreadsheet and enter the appropriate percentages 
     of time that you and your employees spend on each of the tasks listed in the spreadsheet.   

2.) Please verify that the Charge Allocations listed in the spreadsheet are correct and that the correct percentages are allocated to each of the trading desks.  

3.)  Please note that the percentages currently in the spreadsheet are from last month (with the exception of groups in EES).  Please change any of these numbers as is     appropriate to reflect September's activities.  

4.) Please make any other changes that may be needed regarding employees, titles, etc.  


Please note that the spreadsheet is located on   O:/logistics/management/time allocation/OPM September Totals
