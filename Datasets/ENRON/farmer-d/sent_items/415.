We are in the same building.  The move got postponed until next week.  Using the same badges.  I have the same phone #.  Parking is the same.  I believe that the drive down here is open, may be some slowdown on the way out, not sure.  Whew...I think I covered everything.  See you in a little while.

Let's og today if you can, or tomorrow.  I'm available anytime after 11:00.
Are you going to try your badge again?  They are reviewing the photos now,
along with new scanners.

   Hi,

   How are you doing? Still feel like lunch?

   I'm sad about Enron's demise. A lot  of people got hurt on this one.

   What the hell ....... I feel like lunch  and you probably need to get
   out of there so let me know what's good for  you.

   Ken
