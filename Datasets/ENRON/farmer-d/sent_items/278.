Hey, Ken.  We are in sad shape, aren't we?  I was on vacation last week, th=
rough Monday.  Not a good feeling coming back to a sub $20 stock price and =
an SEC inquiry.  It never really seemed possible to me that Enron would be =
here.  Other than concerns for my future, everything is going fine.  Things=
 really are ok, I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to.  I actually s=
tarted talking to them about it.  But on Wednesday, they made a few changes=
 that I'm not so sure about.  Ed Gottlob (recently made VP) was put over th=
e origination desk.  (I heard that they weren't too pleased with Ducoti and=
 Bilberry.)  With that move, they needed someone else to run the trading de=
sk.  That person is our fast-talking friend, Carey Metz.  That blew me away=
.  I believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the fina=
ncial risk.  Apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in Columbu=
s.  He's also going to stay in Columbus with this responsibility.  So, this=
 may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the fam=
ily.

The home-life is going well.  We have 3 year-old soccer every Sat.  My love=
ly wife signed me up to be the coach.  I'm going to get her for that one.  =
It is fun, though.  Those kids are funny.  They don't care where the ball g=
oes, they just keep kicking (even through the woods).  Looking forward to H=
alloween.  Cole is going to be a policeman, Jake is going to be a jailbird/=
prisoner.  Cole has already handcuffed Jake a number of times, he loves it.=
  My vacation last week was very good.  It was the first extended vacation =
that I have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff pl=
anned.  It was one of the best vacations I have had.  We spent 2 days in Sa=
n Antonio doing the zoo and easy stuff like that.  The rest of the week, we=
 did things around here (like Children's Museum).

Big game coming up this weekend.  Do you think your Huskers can pull it off=
?  I think OU's going to win it, but it should be a great game.

How about the 6,7, or 8th for lunch?  Later.
