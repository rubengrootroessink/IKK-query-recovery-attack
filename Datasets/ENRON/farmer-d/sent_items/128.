I have changed the demand fee.  But, is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from Williams?  I don't want to pay Tenaska until we get the money from Williams.  Additionally, I believe that we need to keep the volume at 45,000 for the admin fee, since we originally nominated 45,000/day.

We have the actuals from TXU for Tenaska IV for March 2001.  The receipt from Williams was not kept whole, so we have money to recoup from Williams and repay to Tenaska IV.  Please change the following deals.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Deal 384258	change demand fee from $2,653,694.95 to $2,607,176.02
Deal 514353	change volume from 45,000 to 44,590

Thanks,
Megan
