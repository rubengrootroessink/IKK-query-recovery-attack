Hey baby, honey-bun, goodlookin, goodlovin, sexy sweet thang!

We may need to start talking to Byron or someone about investing and all of that.  Can you find out how much he charges, one visit and continuing?  he sent out an e-mail about ira's.  they are waving fees for those for lifetime thru 12/31/01.  

Anyway, I love you.
