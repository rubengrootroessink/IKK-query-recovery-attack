Go ahead and adjust the deals to bring us in balance.  What is the daily flow for the Saxet well now?

In looking at  the MTD prod. vs. nom numbers, we have consistently been under nominated by about 2,000/day at Three Rivers and 2,000/day at the Saxet well.  We are making our imbalance worse, cumulative.  We need to update our forward position and our nomination by 4,000/day to stay in balance to entitlements.
