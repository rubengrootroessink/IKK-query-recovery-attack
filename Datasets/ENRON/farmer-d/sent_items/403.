ENE @ 9.90?  I don't think I will be able to eat for a week.  Maybe you should bring a bullet next week and put me out of my misery.

hey Ken,

Let's do lunch next week.  We are moving into the new building this
weekend.  I'll be able to show you around (if I'm still here).

We had a tough football weekend.  It's about time we got beat.  We
didn't deserve the wins we had.  Anyway, I've got to get to work.
Trying to break $12.00 today.  It's kind of odd...moving into a brand
new building when your stock price has reached an all-time low...
