Mike, 

I would like for you to move with HPL to the new building to continue training.  I spoke with Ed the other day and let him know this.  Let me know if you have any concerns with this or if you have any questions.

Daren,

I will get with Ed later to find out what his intentions are for me.  If I am not moving to the new building, then I would like to meet with you soon to discuss how all this will work.  I will be out Thursday and Friday for my brother's wedding in Phoenix, but if we can meet before then, I would appreciate it.

Thanks.

Mike

Mike:

Would you please get the George Smith and/or Daren Farmer.

I don't think you will be moving to the other building.  We still want
you to work on the Texas desk.  As soon as you and Ed are ready, we will move you 
back to the 32 floor.

Thanks  

bob

Bob,

It looks as if my days in HPL are numbered as the transition gets closer and closer.  If you have any time, I would like to discuss with you further the exact plans for me.  

I was told that I would be moving over to the other building with this group.  I just want to set up when I will be moving back.  I would like to slip right in and begin work immediately.  I would also like to get a clearer picture on what I will be doing.  I have a few more weeks to learn from my current group, and I will better be able to take advantage of that time if I can have a better understanding of my role in the new group.

Thanks.

Mike
