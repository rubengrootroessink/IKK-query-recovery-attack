hey Ken, 

Let's do lunch next week.  We are moving into the new building this weekend.  I'll be able to show you around (if I'm still here).

We had a tough football weekend.  It's about time we got beat.  We didn't deserve the wins we had.  Anyway, I've got to get to work.  Trying to break $12.00 today.  It's kind of odd...moving into a brand new building when your stock price has reached an all-time low...
