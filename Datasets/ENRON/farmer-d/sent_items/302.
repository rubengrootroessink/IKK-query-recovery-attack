Subject:	October Real Estate Newsletter

Dear Friends,

Cannot believe that we have just entered the fourth quarter of this year. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas & then 2002.

It has been a busy year and if interest rates keep going lower, and stay low for a while, that should stimulate the economy and the real estate sector as a whole.

Please go out and make the purchases you were planning to make and contribute to stimulating the economy.

My October newsletter follows and I hope you enjoy reading it. Here is a link to my "October Real Estate Update":

This newsletter is full of interesting and useful information that I think you will enjoy whether you are a buyer, seller, homeowner, or renter.

This month's issue includes topics such as:

"How To Re-Finance With An Eye Toward Future Rates";
"Getting the Most From Your Home Inspection";
"Charitable Contributions";
"Why Do You Need So Many Reports?";
"Moving Tips Ease Your Pain";

Plus a roundup of September real estate activity as well as much more advice and information.

I hope you enjoy this monthly newsletter. If you have any comments, please e-mail them to me. Or, if you would like to see a certain topic covered in future months, let me know that too!

If you do not wish to receive this newsletter each month, please reply to this e-mail with the word 'REMOVE' in the subject line.

Sincerely,

IONA ALPHONSO
