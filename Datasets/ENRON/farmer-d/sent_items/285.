FYI - Big day Monday to get everything cleaned tracked and balanced in order to run the draft that night. I'm waiting for a call to see if we can only draft through the 14th to alleviate some of the burden. Sorry for the short notice I was waiting for clarification from Settlements.

Wendy, Richard please coordinate how the scheduled quantities turn on/off will work

Tks - Bob

Yes - on an ongoing basis, we will be running a mass draft on the night of the 15th each month.  We also have reporting requirements for the last day of the month, but our normal draft process will cover that.  Let me know if you have more questions.  Thanks.

Bryce - have you got a plan in place yet on what will be required going forward?

Leslie, Bryce - Want to let the troops know what the plan will be moving forward on your monetization effort regarding the need to be tracked and balanced by a certain date. 

Please get back to me, tks - Bob.
