Cynthia,

$4.87 is the correct price for this deal. Waha did not trade above 4.94 on 3/23.  This is an EOL deal, so Conoco should be able to easily check their records to confirm this.

Daren, Conoco invoiced HPL at $5.87 for 03/23 at PGEV/Waha and deal ticket 685350 shows $4.87.  Can you confirm the price?  Thanks.
