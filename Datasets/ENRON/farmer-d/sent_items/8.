ENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, =
Texas, in which , Enron has ownership interest.  Our role was to manage the=
 fuel requirements for the plant.  This includes scheduling, invoicing, and=
 settling the natural gas supplies and transportation.  In addition to the =
daily activity, ENA has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the=
 baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs.  Any profits/loss=
es are passed on to Tenaska IV.  ENA is just paid a monthly fee for the ser=
vice.  Rick Hill is my contact person for the project. He is looking into f=
inding another party to handle this fuel management responsibility.  If he =
can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms, we will need to =
find some one with the Enron estate to handle this.  The problem with Enron=
 continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market (no =
customers willing to trade with us).  So, the project is losing value.  Ple=
ase give me a call when you get a chance.  Or, maybe we can meet sometime n=
ext week to go over this.  My schedule is pretty flexible.
