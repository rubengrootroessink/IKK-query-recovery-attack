I would like to recommend a promotion for Mike Olsen.  Mike has been instru=
mental to the Texas Desk.  With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one=
 scheduler with Texas experience.  Mike took on the responsibility that two=
 people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling). =
 He trained our new hire, Jay Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling =
processes at the Katy Hub.  Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity a=
t the Katy hub passed through the pipeline.  Mike used his knowledge of the=
 Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effecti=
vely schedule our transactions.  Since June, Mike has handled the logistics=
 activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasi=
s, Guadalupe).  Mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he=
 saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.  In July, I began tr=
acking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (=
on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees t=
hrough the hub).  Mike used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relati=
onships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we s=
cheduled under our contracts.  In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.  M=
ike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his =
business.  With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split=
 my time between Logistics and Trading.  Truthfully, I spent the majority o=
f my time with the trading.  Mike handled the daily logistics responsibilit=
ies.  He acted as lead, supervising and training Jay, our other team member=
.  Mike performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk.  M=
ike came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, =
accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects. He came =
to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations. He has advanced quic=
ker than any of the schedulers I've seen.  In fact, he has gone from very m=
inimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and process=
es to other people in the industry with more experience than him.  In short=
, Mike has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team.  His abilities and h=
ard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fu=
lfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to =
close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals. =
 Mike is a superior employee.  His knowledge, ability, and hard work are es=
sential to the success of the Texas Desk.  Please support him with a promot=
ion.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information.=

Thanks.
