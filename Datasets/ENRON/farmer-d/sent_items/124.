Hey, man!

Well, let me tell you what's' going on.  Every evening and every weekend fo=
r the last month and a half, I have been painting and working on the house.=
  The previous owners of the house had the worst color scheme going (pink i=
n one room and a portion of the entry way, lime sherbet green in the other =
portion of the entry way).  There is a lot of trim, 4 doors, and a 20 ft ce=
iling in the living room and entry way.  So it is taking quite a while to c=
omplete.  One reason it is taking so long is other things keep breaking (di=
sposal, toilet flanges, alarm system).  In the middle of trying to finish p=
ainting, we ripped out the floors in the bathrooms and entry and laid tile =
(I got the floors ready, we paid to have the tile laid.).  Tonya wants ever=
ything done now.  It doesn't bother her that I haven't finished a single pr=
oject since we started the whole renovation thing.  But, IT'S KILLING ME!  =
I would like just one finished product.  One small room would be fine.  The=
 house is looking a lot better, though.

I'm trying to not let the work take time away from the kids, so I usually s=
tart after 8pm each night.  Plus, when I do work while the kids are running=
 around I pay a high price.  Last week I was painting the baseboards in the=
 dining room, with the gallon of white semi-gloss next to me on the floor. =
 I had earlier used Windex to clean the window seal and had left the bottle=
 in the middle of the floor.  Jake was coming into the room, watching and c=
limbing up and down the step ladder (6 ft;  he climbs to the very top like =
it's nothing.  Other people come in and see him up there and freak out.  We=
 just let him go.).  He is big into cleaning (guts it from his mom), so whe=
n he saw the Windex he ran and picked it up.  I told him to "take it to Mam=
a".  He started out the doorway, but came back in and walked behind me.  I =
just kept working, thinking that he was watching me.  Then I noticed out of=
 the corner of my eye that he had moved closer to me.  When I turned to loo=
k, I just lost my breath.  Jake had dipped the Windex bottle down into the =
paint can, pulled it out and was holding the bottle over our brown carpet. =
 White paint was just pouring off the bottle.  It looked like someone had p=
oured paint straight out of the can onto the floor.  Thank goodness it was =
latex, after about 45 minutes we got it cleaned up.  Cole has helped me wit=
h some of the work, such as sanding the walls.  But, he carried his work a =
little farther than I wanted.  Yesterday, he had a friend over.  They got h=
is tools (play sander/grinder, circular saw, screw drivers), climbed up on =
his bunk bed, and decided they needed to take the texture off the ceiling. =
 You should have seen the mess.

I am taking a break this weekend though.  Cole and I are going camping at L=
ake Livingston.  I am really looking forward to it.  I'm trying to start so=
mething with him (and will include Jake when he gets a little bigger)  wher=
e we do a guy thing each month.  Last month I took Cole to his first Rocket=
s game.  He loved it.  They are getting too big, too fast.

At work, I guess I'm becoming a full fledge trader.  I will be getting my o=
wn book in a couple of days.  I'm pretty nervous about that.  There's not a=
 lot of activity in the training/coaching area around here (hard to believe=
, huh?).  But, we'll see how it goes.  The last of the HPL/AEP people are m=
oving out of the building tonight.  Everything is on course to close the sa=
le on June 1st.

Anyway, I hope you and Linda are doing well.  We'd like to have you over if=
 we ever get the house in presentable shape.
