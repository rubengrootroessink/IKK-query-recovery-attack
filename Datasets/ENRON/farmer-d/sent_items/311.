Bryce, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person in your group.

I need someone to look into deal Sitara #833675, referenced below.  Why were these deals actualized to zero?

To recap what we talked about this morning.  The following deals were done for June.  ENA is not showing these deals in you system so therefore they won't pay.  

6/7	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.71	between Roger & Daren
6/12	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.78	between Roger & Daren
6/14	sold 5000 to ENA @ 4.16	between Roger & Daren
6/20	sold 10000 to EOL @ 3.95	between Roger & EOL
6/23-25	sold 10000/d to EOL @ 3.57	between Roger & EOL

Thank you, in advance, for your help with this.
