Aimee, 

Please take care of this in POPS.  It looks like we've already hit the 50,000 mark on #572910.

Just want to make sure volumes are allocated to two different tickets correctly for March:

Sitara - 572910 - gets 50,000 MMBtu TOTAL for the month .... after 50,000 on this ticket, all remaining volumes go to ...

Sitara 643510 - the swing ticket

THANKS

Lee
