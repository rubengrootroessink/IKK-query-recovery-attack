Daren - was there a deal for 5.000 at CP&L on Feb. 21?  CP&L shows 5.000, but I have looked in MOPS and there is not a deal.  Can you verify whether or not there was a deal for that day?  Thanks.

Aimee

Aimee,

I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct?

Thanks for your help.

Rebecca
