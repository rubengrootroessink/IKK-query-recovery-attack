I have attached a revised schedule of the EEX deal.  I have included our bid price and  additional notes for each field. If  you will re-print the quote sheets, I will enter our bids on them.  Additionally, since we are bidding to buy the gas delivered to the "liquid" areas, please make sure that our agreements with EEX state that the gas must be pipeline quality and must be able to be delivered into the pipes specified on the attached schedule.  Let me know if you have any questions.
