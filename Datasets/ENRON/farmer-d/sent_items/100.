Gas Daily Waha is the correct price.  I have changed the deal ticket.

Please confirm the pricing for TXU Gas deal #646679 for March 8, 2001.  We are currently showing the Katy Hub Gas Daily Midpoint for that day, but TXU shows the Waha Hub Gas Daily Midpoint.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rebecca
