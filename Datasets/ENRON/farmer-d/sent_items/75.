We do not have storage in a facility on PG&E.  But, we do use parking and lending agreements regularly.

We don't have storage on PG&E do we?  I think that is park and lend.  What do you think?  I have put together the schedules for Spindletop and Bammel.

Please provide the information requested below as soon as possible.  Improvement in this process will help minimize flash-to-actual variances.

Has any progress been made on this?  So far, I have only received information on Cove Point.

We show that there is physical storage on the following pipelines:

CENTRAL -  Mid Continent, Moss Bluff, NGPL, and Reliant.
TEXAS - Bammel, Centana, and PG&E Texas Pipeline.
WEST - Colorado, PG&E (one contract), PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest, Questar, and Williston
EAST - Cove Point, Dominion, Columbia Gas, Gulf South (Koch), National Fuel, Sonat, Tennessee, Transco, Egan, and Napoleonville.
SITHE - Union

Please provide the requested information below.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Gas Accounting is initiating a project to ensure consistent treatment of physical storage between flash and the GL.  To that end, please provide the book codes and cost of inventory schedules that you have for each of the physical storage facilities.  We will also need what you show as the 1/31/01 inventory balance for each.

David, 
I believe that we already have the information for Bammel.  Please provide the info for other Texas desk storage, if any.  

I would like to have this information as soon as possible.

Thanks, everyone.
