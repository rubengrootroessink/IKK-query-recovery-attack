Daren,
Julie Meyers sent me the list of buyback/sale/swing tickets
- I told her some expire 4/30/01 and asked if they were to be extended. 
She didn't have any knowledge of any being extended to May - do you know who to ask?
			undertake	sale		swing
Beaumont Methanol 	696599 		696585		696594
Union Carbide				699730
Valero			478227		454447

Thanks - Julie
