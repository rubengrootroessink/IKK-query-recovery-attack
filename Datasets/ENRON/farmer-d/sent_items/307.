The supply from the desk-to-desk transaction (#1075281) is pathed to the transport.  The 1023 contract is an ENA agreement.  So, deal 1075281 transfers the gas to ENA.  ENA then transports the gas on it's agreement on Lone Star.

I see the new path for the desk to desk in Nov 2000.  You pathed it as a buy/sell.  Should it be on contract 1023 where the old path was?  We have a transport statement from TXU for contract 1023 that has 21,309 mm.
