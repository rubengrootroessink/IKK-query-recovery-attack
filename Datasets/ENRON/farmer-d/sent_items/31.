Hey Ken.  Well, I'm still here for now.  It's hard to leave.  We have all t=
aken quite a bit of time off (out all last week and a couple of days the we=
ek before that.)  I'll only be here a couple of hours today.  But we had a =
great Christmas.  The kids have been so excited.  I made the mistake of get=
ting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles.  You can hear them=
 all through our neighborhood.  The neighbors have already asked my what I =
was thinking.  Cole wanted 3 things (a play airport, a pirate ship, and Buz=
z Lightyear).  He got them all.  With each present, he kept getting louder =
and more excited.  Jake was primarily interested in in opening presents, he=
 didn't care what was in them.  That kid gets more out of ripping things up=
 and tearing things down than any kid I have ever seen.  In fact, the other=
 day, Cole and I were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go.=
  Cole likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly.  So, he was=
 working hard at making this tower stand up and work (it ended up being abo=
ut eight feet tall).  Well Jake was chomping at the bit to run through it. =
 After holding him off for a few minutes, I let him go.  You should have se=
en his eyes light up.  You would have thought it was the biggest event of t=
he year.  He tore through it, smiling all the way, saying "again, again."  =
It has been so fun spending extra time with the kids.  My mom and sister ca=
me in the weekend before Christmas.  Tonya's parents and sister came in Fri=
day.  With the couple of days between their visits, I remodeled our downsta=
irs bathroom (strip wallpaper, paint, hung a border, hung crown molding).  =
That was my first try with crown molding. It turned out ok.  Thank the Lord=
 for wood putty.  So, we've been pretty busy.  But, it's been fun.

How was your Christmas?  Was Santa Claus good to you?  I guess your kids we=
re in.  I hope you had a wonderful time.  I'm looking forward to Corn Boys =
bowl game.  Anyway, I need to go make a call on a tee time.  Tonya's dad an=
d I decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of bal=
ls and break a few clubs, while out in the cold.  It doesn't make much sens=
e, does it?  But then again, most things that men do don't make much sense.

Later,=20
