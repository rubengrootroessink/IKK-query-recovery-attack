We recently purchased house with a spa in the backyard. After filling with water and adjusting to the correct ph and bromine levels, the water smells like mildew.  Is there a way to treat this chemically?  I thought that the smell was coming from the cover at first. But, I have thoroughly cleaned the cover inside and out.  Could the smell be coming from the air/water lines?  It appears that the previous owners did not take care of some things around the house.


Thanks.
