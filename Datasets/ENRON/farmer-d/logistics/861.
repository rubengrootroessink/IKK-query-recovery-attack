Sheryln,  I'm forwarding this to Daren to get your answer...  Daren, deal 
141186 (El Sordo) volume 102....  deal 138605 (Torch) volume 343...  Megan 
Parker thinks that all of this volume should be under Torch...  What do you 
think?

I have a volume issue with meter 986315 for 1/00 production.  The volume has 
been split between El Sordo and Torch Rally.  I think all of the volume 
should be under Torch Rally.  Please let me know if you find something 
different.  The old months have already been corrected.

Thanks,
Megan
