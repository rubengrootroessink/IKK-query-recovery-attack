Daren,

This has not yet shown up in Unify.  Did you use the same deal ticket?

The above deal was in the system for 7/1/00 to 12/31/00.  We have had 
continued flow on the following dates...

1/4/01 to 1/8/01
1/29/01
2/7/01 to 2/28/01

The total flow has been 2804.

Can this deal be extended to cover the January and February flow?
