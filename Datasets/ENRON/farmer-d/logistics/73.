The pricing for the base deal is based on the GD, but it's the average of the gas daily plus .02, right? And I was told that Sitara could not handle this pricing structure, that it had to be calculated and entered as a fixed price. Is this correct?

Valerie, 

The pricing on the base deal should also be based on GD.  I have changed the price to GDP.  Let me know if that doesn't correct that piece.  Jay is currently looking into the volume issue.

Jay,

For June, I need a couple of things changed in Sitara: 
Deal 819592 - the commodity price needs to be 3.6318
Deal 819594 - the commodity price needs to be WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A+.02

And for July............
It looks like we're missing some volume............
Deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55,000 per day allocated. AND in Sitara this deal should be priced at $3.0505.
Deal 895691 - swing deal - currently has 234,000 in the scheduled column and it should be 441,000 based on the spreadsheet I sent. Did you have some conflicting volumes? I'm resending what the volumes should be. AND the pricing for this should be at WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A+.02.

 << File: 0107 daily swing.xls >> 

I think that should do if for now. I'll wait to see how these changes come across. Please notify me when these changes have been made. Thanks!

Valerie,

In reference to a note sent to Darren Farmer:  Houston Pipleline mistake on June 18th

The volume of 50,000 for deal 819594 was a mistake.  The proper value was 30,000 just as you had mentioned.   Everything should now be fixed.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks, 
Jay Smith
