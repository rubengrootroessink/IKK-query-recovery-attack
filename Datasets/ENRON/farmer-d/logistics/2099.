Daren- 

Do we have the buy/Sell deal for El Paso ( formerly Teco)  for January 01 
Prod?
The old deal numbers were 235670 for the sale and 137870 for the purchase.

Megan,

I was unable to extend the deal for Teco # 137870 and #235670 becaus e it has 
been suspended.  Teco is no longer the counterparty.  Has the name changed?

Mike, 
Have you heard anything about extending the buy/sell ticket for TECO yet?   
Today is the last day we can make changes in the system.
