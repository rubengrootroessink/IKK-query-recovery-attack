Daren I have three meters that have flow in Feb but no deal.

gas plant fuel.  Last deal used was 289396 could you extend it.
2. meter 1601 had flow on the 15 &18.  This is Southern union Lockhart.  Last 
deal used with them was 285350 Hpl or 259208 ENA. 
3. Meter 1598 had flow the whole month 1-28.  This is MT Enterprise C/G- 
Panther.  The last deal used  is 284 620
