Sherlyn,

Per our conversation earlier today, I need an accounting arrangement  set up 
for meter #980072 for the month of January so I can move the volumes from the 
stranger's gas contract over to the HPL 215 contract.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.  Thanks, Susan.

Daren,

On January 15 and 16, HPL bought some gas from Western Gas Resources at the 
Aquila Header (10.000 and 5.000 MMBTU's respectively).  This was a late 
Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in POPS, the gas was scheduled 
on the stranger's gas contract.  However, deal ticket #143709 was never 
updated to reflect those late changes.  Please let me know if you want me to 
update the deal ticket.  Thanks, Susan.
