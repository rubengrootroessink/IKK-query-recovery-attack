D - When you get a chance, I would like to go over what has been allocated

Daren - Pat gave me a a spreadsheet showing what should be allocated to 
Greens Bayou.  I checked the deal ticket (286824) and it ends on 6/17.  There 
is still two more days that need to be reallocated.  Please let me know if  
you can extend this deal or create a new one.

Thanks.
