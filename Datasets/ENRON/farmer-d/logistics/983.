Is there still a problem with this?  We need HPLC to nominate for 1/99 
forward at meter no. 6884.  Please let me know the status.  Thanks, Mary

I'm not sure what's going on, but I DID NOT see a TECO  deal ticket in MOPS 
for Houston Pipeline Company anywhere (January 1999 to March 1999).  I DID 
see one on Houston Pipeline Company Resources.

As my original note stated, I think this is a buy/sell which means that TECO 
Gas Processing should appear in both the Market and Supply depending on 
HPLC's position.

Please let me know something ASAP.

The sitara deal needs to reflect 3/99 forward.  1/99 and 2/99 was done.  
Thanks, Mary

Mary, this is the message I left a voice mail concerning.  In addition to the 
other producer at this meter, the following needs to be setup:

POPS HPLC transport delivery  12-41500-203 done (there)
MOPS HPLC sale to Teco GP  12-86978-101 NEEDED (think this is buy/sell 
arrangement); no deal ticket.

Gary Lamphier is looking into the Exxon Jack Creek receipt flow at meter 6884 
- make final determination on whether it's either HPLR or HPLC.  The deal 
setup in POPS and MOPS as HPLR.

Summary:
Need HPLC sale to TECO related to transportation  delivery in POPS.
Final determination on whether the current HPLR purchase from TECO at Exxon 
Jack Creek is correct or should HPLC be purchasing from TECO - starting in 
February 1999 business.

Thanks for you help,  3-9768

Melissa's second sentence refers to the Teco Gas Processing Company 12/1/98 
contract covering meters 6884 and 419.  This contract was obtained in 
connection with the Seven Oaks/Turpentine Lease Line renewal, and it doesn't 
appear to have hit the system.  Please ensure that the contract is set up and 
filed.

George, 

At the 9th WorkDay meeting you had asked if we had seen the paper on the 
above referenced.  I have checked our database, and it appears that we have 
not.  The contract in the system does reflect at GS at this point. 

I also checked on Teco Gas Processing Company, and it does not appear we have 
seen the paper on this one either. 

Thank you, 
Melissa
