Please follow the instructions below.

Why:  A suggestion was made (by Carlos) to centralize transport nominations 
we receive by email.  We now have an email account set up: 
HPL.Scheduling@enron.com.  The group is to let our customers know this is 
where all nominations need to be sent.  This way, if people are out (or no 
longer with us), someone will be able to receive the nomination change.  I 
have also created folders for each shipper.  As each nomination is addressed, 
the file is to be moved to the folder for later reference.  If the file is 
still in the "inbox", it has not been addressed.

Any comments to this, I would greatly appreaciate feedback.
