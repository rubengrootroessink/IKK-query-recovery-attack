Mike,

Sorry,

Yes this is still on.  I talked to everyone except Daren.  Just did and he is
fine with this approach.

Too many plates in the air.

thanks

bob

Bob,

I wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple weeks ago.  We had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down with Daren and working the off system scheduling.

I was talking with Daren last night and he had not heard anything about this.  I plan to begin working with Mark and Mary next week to learn how to schedule these pipes.  Before we begin this, I just wanted to make sure that what we had discussed is still planned.

Thanks for your time.

Mike
