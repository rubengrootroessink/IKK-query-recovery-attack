Daren,

We are not receiving timely information from the Hub regarding our Park and=
 Lend Agreement.  I have not received an update since Tues or Wed of last w=
eek.   Mike has been phoning them furiously for information and has been to=
ld that they don't have it, or it will be ready later.  Per GISB, final sch=
eduled numbers on EPNG, NNG, and TW are reported at 9:00 am the following d=
ay (ie. Sunday final will be out at 9 AM on Mon.).  Prior to the transition=
 from PG&E, we received our balance by 9:15 or 9:30 AM.  I realize that the=
 transition has been difficult, they are never a cake walk, however, this t=
ype of information is crucial.  Further, they have not provided any final n=
umbers for the month of April, we should at least be able to receive a "bes=
t available" number, and the Interstate Pipes, due to GISB, have final sche=
duled numbers available on the first of the month.  I submit that ENA shoul=
d not be held liable for payment of the $0.03/day rate, as we have not rece=
ived the information we need to balance the agreement.  If EPGT plans to ad=
minister fees, then balance information should be communicated on a timely =
basis.  We may want to check the terms of the agreement, and/or negotiate a=
 reduced rate for the month of May.

Thank you,

Mary
