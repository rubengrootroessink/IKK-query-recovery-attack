Daren,

 I must be missing something.  Can I meet with you today and show you what I 
have?

Daren,

 There are only two deals on PGEV pipeline: Deal #156071- valid 02/01/00 - 
02/29/00, and Deal # 208083 - valid for 02/01/00 - 02/06/00.  Should there be 
another deal for days 7-29??  Thanks

Thu

tracked. and balanced.

Daren,


This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out.  Unfortunately, I do 
not allocate PGEV.  Also,  Sherlyn has actualized PGEV and she has the 
support from the pipeline for the 1746918 volume.  Please let me know if I 
had missed something in our conversation.  Thanks

Thu
