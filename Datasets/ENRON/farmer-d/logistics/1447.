Thanks for your spreadsheet.  One thing I still need from you is what 
commercial teams your group was supporting overall ?  In addition, I noticed 
you allocated 15 hours to the activity ES002 - Non Routine Trade Monitoring & 
Reporting.  What commercial team(s) was this 15 hours spent supporting?

Thanks!
Suzanne
