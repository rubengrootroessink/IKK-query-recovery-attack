Daren - 

-FYI-


Exxon supply at Mobil Cayanosa has fallen off due to problems, so starting 
9/9 there nom will go from 5.000  down to .520 and going at least through the 
weekend 9/11.  Stacey has already bought gas from Duke to resupply (the 
difference 4.480) Midlothian at Duke Pegasus, in addition to the 8.600 
incremental she bought there.  So for the weekend, we should have a sale to 
Midlothian of 13,080 at Pegasus.
