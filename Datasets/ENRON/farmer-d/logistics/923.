Daren,

ATEs shows that your team has one specialist for 1497 in January and 
February.  Please let me know if ATEs is incorrect for the month of January 
and February.  If there is a specialist in your team, we have not received a 
survey from this person.  This lack of information prevents your expenses 
from being 100% allocated out to the commercial teams.  Please fill out the 
following survey and return it to me ASAP.  If you have any questions please 
call me at 3-3859.

Thanks,
Shari
