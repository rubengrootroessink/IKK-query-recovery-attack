Subject: HPL Deal Downloads

I've attached two files with HPL deal information.  The file named HPL Deals 
with 3rd Parties contain all HPLC deals and ENA Deals on HPL.  I plan to send 
this file to AEP by Tueday morning unless I hear of any objection.  The 
second file named ENA Texas Offsystem Deals contains deals that I'm not sure 
if they are a part of the sale or not.  I am asking David Baumbach to review 
this file to let me know what needs to be excluded.  I will hold off on 
sending the second file until their is consensus on the content.  -  Tommy
