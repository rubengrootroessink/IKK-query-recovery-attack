On Tuesday, March 7th, Tejas took gas from us at Oasis Katy and gave it back 
to us at Tejas Laporte to help us out during an outage for $.02/mmbtu.  This 
transaction has not been scheduled correctly.  There are two deal tickets in 
Sitara to cover the Oasis portion of the deal:  #213145 covers ENA selling 
the gas to HPLC for HPLC to transport on Tejas.  Deal #213370 covers the 
transport usage on Tejas from Oasis Katy to Laporte.  I have edited this 
ticket to add the $.02/mm charge.  There needs to be a Tejas expense contract 
at Laporte, #665, to cover the approx. 25,000mm received there on the 7th.  
These volumes are currently sitting on the Laporte OBA.

Jackie-  if you would work with Carlos he should be able to walk you through 
getting this scheduled correctly in all systems.

Thanks.
