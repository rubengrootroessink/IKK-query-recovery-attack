Mary,

As in my email below to Daren, we are seeing some OA variances between flas=
h to actual on the PLE contracts on PGEV for 10/00-12/00.  I have verified =
with Thu Nguyen of what the statements from PGEV show and that is also what=
 we have booked in Unify and recorded to the G/L as an imbalance.  However,=
 when looking in CPR (under CPR Pipeline Exchange), there was not anything =
flashed for those months, thus our OA variance.  I seem to remember that St=
acy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month o=
n occassion, in those few times that we do, 1)it should be relatively small=
 and 2) in the following days of the next month, we should have worked the =
imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month.  I=
n a voice mail from Daren today, he seemed to think the same thing was happ=
ening or even that by the end of each month, we were balanced to zero.  Can=
 you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had =
an imbalance and if we should have, why there would have not been anything =
flashed.  If we should not have had an imbalance, then we'll need your help=
 to figure out what went wrong in that PGEV shows an imbalance on their sta=
tements.  Let me know what you think.........


Thanks,

Daren,

When I look back in CPR for the delivery periods of 10/00 - 12/00 on CPR Pi=
peline Exchange, I do not see anything being flashed as an imbalance, i.e. =
the buys and sales always equal in CPR.  However, we are booking an imbalan=
ce every month on the parking and lending contract.  Should there be someth=
ing in CPR for these volumes?  Let me know because it is causing an OA vari=
ance for us.  Thanks!
