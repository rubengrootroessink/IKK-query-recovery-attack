It is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers, 
however, If the pipeline allocates the shortage to ENA then we need to follow 
the contract language and bill accordingly.  Just remember that we allowed 
makeup  on the 18, 19, & 20th for a total volume of 5K over 3 days so that 
will apply toward the 4th and part of the 9th.  All other volumes should be 
purchased back  per the language in the contract.  Remember they have a 
tolerance of 5% below the nomination.

Thanks,
Janet

For days 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 28,  we are short at the aggregate 
meter.   Should the Reliant transport and Sales or do we charge Reliant a 
penalty?

Also, I notice that at meter 1554 we have 3rd party transport this month.  
This look strange because I've not seen them here before.

Please advice.

Thanks
