Darren:
ENA was invoiced by Coral Energy for two deals on Tejas for June 2001 that I do not see in the system.  The first deal was on 6/1 for 5,400 at $3.87.  The second deal was on 6/13 for 22,000 at $4.25.  Do you know anything about these deals?  I think we would show it on ExxonKaty, but I can't find anything in path manager on ExxonKaty or Tejas.
