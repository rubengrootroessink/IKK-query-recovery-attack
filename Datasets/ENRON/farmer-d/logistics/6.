Thanks Jay!

Tammy/Richard:
You may want to let the schedulers know, although they may already.

Richars/Tammy:


We will be killing about 2000 deals in Sitara tonight. Whenever a deal is touched in Sitara, it will bridge over to Unify. THese are Desk2Desk deals, and should have minimal impact on you.
