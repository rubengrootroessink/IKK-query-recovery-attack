For Mar00, Siatar # 139055, you will need to make adjustments to the risk 
assignments etc., as I have made some changes to the booked deal.

For March 1 to 10, Enron Methanol will take zero volumes (they will be down 
for maintenance - a force majeure situation)

For March 11 to 31, they will take 33,000/d at a price of Gas Daily HSC mid 
flat.

Thanks

Lee
