Could you please help me out with this.  I've called Gary Lamphier, but no response and Client Services needs to get an answer.

Elizabeth,

	Deal # 649741 is a 05/01 sale to BP Energy. BP is claiming that this deal should have been invoiced by HPL and not ENA. My contact also claims that this was confirmed by Gary Lamphier. I am not sure if Gary is with ENA or HPL. Is this something you can look into or do I need to send this to someone else?

Thanks,
Genaro
