FYI------Guadalupe had a plant go down today 2/27, and therefore had to get 
some gas off Oasis, so they took all 40.0 from AEC back into the Aquila 
Header, so I moved the deals to reflect this on WGR (Aquila Header ).  
Guadalupe deals:  594527 & 578932.

They said there is a chance they will have to do it again tomorrow.

Let me know if you have any questions.
