Per my conversation today with Lorraine Ibrom @ PG&E (El Paso), she has 
informed me that some maintenance work is being done on the Yeary (sp?) 20 
in. line.  This will affect meters 6040 PG&E Riverside and 584 PG&E Agua 
Dulce, beginning at 11:59 P.M. on January 8, 2001 and ending at 9:00 a.m. on 
January 12, 2001.  She has informed me that for this time period there should 
be no nominations at these points.  Thanks.
