This meter has not been disconnected.  The measurement tech turned in a 
temporary disconnect to MIPs (about 2 months ago) because the meter has not 
flowed for approximately 4 months.  This allows the measurement tech to forgo 
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service.  Scheduled 
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice.

Thanks
Gary
