Thanks Darren, I appreciate it.  We all know how often Enerfin's numbers 
change. Chances are we would have had to reverse any entry we made.

Sorry about this, Victor.  I didn't even pay attention to the date.  I was 
thinking this was October business.  We will definitely be able to do 
somthing with this on our side and not involve the East Desk.

I'm assuming from your answer that this is free gas for HPLC at this point.

Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out about 
this?

I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up and 
running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in 
Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so 
small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let 
this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???

I welcome your thoughts.
Victor

Jackie, 

Please get with the East Desk on this.  If they agree, we can roll the deal.

Daren,

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume 
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?

Thanks
