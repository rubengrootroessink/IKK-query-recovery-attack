Daren, Sitara has two different prices for May 31,2001 causing a problem.
According to Lee Papayoti, the price for the swing volumes should
beHSC_FLW+1High.GDP.D.A.  However it is priced at HSC.GDP.D.A with the 31st
being priced at both.  This is causing Settlements to be overstated by
419MMBtu and $1,432.66.  Any help you could give would be greatly
appreciated. My phone # is 713-571-3273.

Jack

I tried to get into the Sitara ticket # 373590 to correct the swing pricing
....but I am not allowed to access it beacuse it is a deal from when we
were at Enron and I can't access those deals ....

Please ask Joanie or somebody as to what to try next, as I am at a loss!!

Lee
