Ray Calles (TETCO) told me today that he will put the OBA in the mail either 
tonight or first thing Monday.

Thanks for your help.

Don't we have an OBA at this point now?

Daren,

I know it's first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3/15 (71 
dec.) and 3/23 (35 dec.) but the deal (Sitara #213005) doesn't cover these 
two days.

Can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in Sitara so that I 
can clear my exceptions for Volume Management?

Thanks
