Subject: System 550 Unmetered Gas

 On 5/10/00 a pipeline leak was found on system 550.  By the evidence found 
it is believed to have been present for several months. We need to go back to 
at least January '00 for corrections.  Please input this gas loss to the 
system 550 balance. The estimated gas loss for January through April is as 
follows:

 January: 103,058 MCF 105,066 DTH
 February: 97,219 MCF 99,114 DTH
 March:  106,015 MCF 108,082 DTH
 April:  95,214 MCF 97,070 DTH


Gas loss for May will be forwarded as soon as we obtain the pressure readings 
from meter 
986501-10.                                                                    
                                   Attached is the supporting documentation 
used to calculate these volumes:





If you have any questions please call.
