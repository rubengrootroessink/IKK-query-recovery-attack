Subject:=09BCP Seat Assignments
Importance:=09High

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Busin=
ess Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31s=
t Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will=
 report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to yo=
ur original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This w=
ill hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st=
 floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, yo=
u will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6p=
m.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel=
 free to contact me at any time.

Regards,
