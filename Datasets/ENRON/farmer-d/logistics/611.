I will be out of the office beginning Thursday, 12/24, returning on Tuesday, 
1/4.  In my absence, I have asked Steve Venturatos to be the point person for 
Texas Operations.

I realize that many of you will be working over the New Year's week-end to 
ensure a smooth transaction into the new year.  In advance, I truly 
appreciate all of the efforts.  Additionally, I would like to be kept 
informed on any critical issues, mainly so that I have no surprises when I 
return.  Therefore, I have provided numbers below where I can be reached.  I 
will leave it to your discretion as to whether you call me or leave me a 
voice mail in the office.  As you all know, I would rather be informed than 
surprised!

wonderful and safe holiday!
