GISB IR Meeting - 11-13&14, 2001

SUMMARY:  
Finalized the Transactional Information (FT, IT, and Capacity Release).  This information will be access via the Upload of a Request for Download of Posted Datasets.  Majority of the two days was spent developing the data dictionary for the new Producer Imbalance Statement.  The Producer Imbalance Statement is not a mandatory dataset.  Exxon was the only producer present.


DETAILED NOTES:

Informational Reporting
Where should the reporting be located in the GISB Books for the IT & FT Reporting?
?	In Cap Release books
?	General book
?	IT & FT into noms and cap release into cap release
?	Create a new book called reports
?	If we create a new book, we will have to do an executive summary.
Should reside in Capacity Release book since the Upload Request for a Download of Posted Dataset is the request document.

Update the Upload of a Request for Download of Posted Datasets to include code values and technical implementation to support the request for Transaction Information IT,  FT, and capacity release datasets.
?Add "?withdrawals, or and transactional reports" to technical implementation.
?Add code value, "Transaction Information Firm"
?Add code value, "Transaction Information Interruptible"
?Add code value, "Transaction Information - Capacity Release"

Update the Response to Upload of a Request for Download of Posted Datasets to include code values to support the request for Transaction Information IT,  FT, and capacity release datasets.
?Add code value, "Transaction Information Firm"
?Add code value, "Transaction Information Interruptible"
?Add code value, "Transaction Information - Capacity Release"

Executive Summary for Capacity Release, under the Capacity Release Process/Datasets/EDI Transaction section modified with the below:
?	Add the IT & FT reporting datasets under the mandatory datasets in alphabetical order
?	Page 4 of Executive Summary - add new section describing the dataset.    
Title: Transactional Information - Transactional information consisting of reports from a TSP provider detailing information for new or amended transportation service or capacity release transaction.  These reports are requested through the use of a Upload of a Request for Download of Posted Datasets and Response to Upload of a Request for Download of Posted Datasets.

?	Business Process and Practices, under Overview
o	First paragraph "Capacity Release Reports consists of the following datasets: ?. the Transactional Information - Interruptible, the Transactional Information - Firm,  and Transactional Information - Capacity Release
Voting:
?	Put together a rec form and data dictionaries and bring back next meeting and vote.

?	Not a mandatory document
?	One account per point.
?	Modify Contact Person Data to Preparer Contact Person Data
?	Cumulative Imbalance changed to Ending Imbalance Quantity
?	Current Month Entitlement  - Quantity of gas each interest owner is entitled to take of the total production deliveries

?	Interest Owner Decimal changed Interest Owner Percentage - Percentage of gas owned by the Interest Owner.  Usage - mandatory.
?	Add - Transportation Service Provider Data group - At detail level.
?	Add - Transportation Service Provider data element = a code value that uniquely identifies the TSP. Mandatory.  
?	Add - Transportation Service Provide Name. Mandatory. 
?	Grand Total All TSP's = The total of all production deliveries made to all TSPs from a given location.   Mandatory.
?	Total TSP = The total of all production deliveries made to a specified TSP from a given location.  Detail.  Mandatory.
?	 Ending Imbalance Qty =  Cumulative imbalance for an interest owner delivered to a TSP. #20
?	Current Month Entitlement -  a quantity of gas each interest owner is entitled to take of the Grand Total - All TSP for a given TSP. #16      
?	Interest Owner Percentage - Percentage of the gas owned by the Interest Owner dedicated to specified TSP.
?	Add discussion to the TIBP the definition of PPI.  PPI is related to Interest Owner Percentage.  PPI is the portion of the production interest dedicated to a TSP.
