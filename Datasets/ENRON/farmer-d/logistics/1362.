Karen/Sherlyn,

Gary has placed this in Daren's lap.  Please read the below information that 
was requested of me from Daren. 

This is the latest.

I'll get back as soon as I hear from Daren again about my response to him.

On day 5 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is a delivery nom of 10.0 pathed to the ENA 
201 K.  On day 16 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is not a deal (which is strange 
because day 16 in POPS references Adonis).  The deal on the 5th was a swing 
deal.

Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.
