This is to confirm our telephone conversation of earlier today in which we advised that the October 5, 1998 Contract for Sale of Natural Gas between Lower Colorado River Authority, Buyer, and Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., Seller, for Natural Gas Supply to T. C. Ferguson Power Plant, Sim Gideon Power Plant and Hilbig Storage has NOT been transferred to Houston Pipe Line Company and/or AEP Energy Services, Inc.  Rather, the Contract remains an asset of Enron North America.  You should contact Tom Martin at 713.853.3079 to discuss this Contract.
