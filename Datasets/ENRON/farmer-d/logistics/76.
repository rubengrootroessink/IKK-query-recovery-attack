It looks like we have a consensus on down time for Unify Gas Production on Saturday.  We will be bringing the server down at 6pm.  Please make every effort to have your work done by that time.  The server should be back up by 10pm.

Thank you all for your responses and cooperation,

Michael,

The west desk schedulers are using path manager to schedule until 6:00 pm. We're hoping that the maintenance can start after that time. Thanks.

We will be performing maintenance on the server for the Unify database on Saturday, Aug. 18th.  This maintnenance will fix the problem that caused Unify's Gas Production database to hang indefinitely today (Tue., Aug. 14th) during our nomination time.

Please reply and tell us when we can shut down the Unify Gas Production system for this maintenance on Saturday, Aug. 18th.  We are targeting 4pm.
