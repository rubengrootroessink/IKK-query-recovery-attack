Susan,
Here is the note that I sent Daren .  I never have scheduled a Park and Ride 
and have no idea on how this should be set up.

Daren,
Just a quick note to follow up on UA4 issues.

For desk to desk deals, we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not 
a Co 16 contract with Co 16 and attaching an ECT transport contract to the 
backscreen.

On Park and ride deals, I am under the impression that the Park and ride deal 
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a 
subsequent month.
If this is true, was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous Co 
89 entry.  I am not sure whether an ECT transport should be attached.  I hope 
you have some insight on this issue.

Let me know
HC
