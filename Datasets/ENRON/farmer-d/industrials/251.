We should check with gas control as to why gas is flowing at all and/or 
whether this is a valid reading ....

Gary/James - let us know

Thanks

Daren - Meter 1428, Beaumont Methanol is shut-in for December.  There has 
been flow of 69 and 65 on days 2 and 3.  Should a swing ticket be put at the 
meter?  The last swing deal was 451907 for 11/00.  Thanks.

Aimee
