Daren,
I have HPL Resources meter 988055 wasn't sure if I should path this for April 3rd's deal change.
and I have Mobil Oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30,000 that change to 50,000 for the 3rd.
I didn't path them since they are industrials and Aimee's notes told me to path Industrials -
except for a few exceptions.
Thanks, Julie
