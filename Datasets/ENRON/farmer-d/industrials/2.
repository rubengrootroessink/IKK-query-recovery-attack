	I spoke with Dan Burns at El Paso yesterday.
	He notionally gave me a $0.04 rate from Exxon Clear Lake
	or comparable source.  Seems a bit high.  
	
	HPL quoted us $0.025 from Katy on the Marathon Refinery
	RFP last week but they wanted $0.25 for swing transport.
	
	Gary talked to Exxon and Tejas about sourcing gas into
	Crosstex (was CC Transmission) at Banquette.  Exxon 
	apparently sells their equity gas at the tailgate of King Ranch
	because of recent changes or elimination of their Tejas
	transportation agreement/s.  

	Lets discuss,
