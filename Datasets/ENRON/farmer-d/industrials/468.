Gary - We did not deliver gas to Phillips on Dec. 1.  Also, I am not sure if 
the plant was down, but we did not deliver to them on Dec. 2-4.  If you have 
any questions, please let me know.

Phillips said we shorted them gas on December 1st so they pulled it on 
January 1.  Can we verify that we did not deliver 5,00 on Dec. 1?  If that is 
the case and this was a firm sale, we owe him some gas at Dec Index less 
(.045).  Which is bad!  Let me know what happened in Dec before I can put 
this deal out in Jan.

Gary, 

Have you negotiated a price on this?

Daren - meter 1517 has a nom of 0/day for Jan.  It flowed about 5.400 on day 
1. This is a valid flow.  Could you please extend the deal from Dec. (deal # 
506192) or create a new one?  Thanks.
