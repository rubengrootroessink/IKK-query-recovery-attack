Need price correction for 04/01/01 - 04/30/01 for deal # 413462 to agree with info from Lee below. Currently, deal shows for 04/01 first 10,000/d @ HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP DH.    Sitara audit shows dfarmer changed price on 05/08/01/

Thanks!
Tess

SA 413462 is not the buyback, it's the swing ...

the first 10,000/d under SA 413462 should be HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A.
anything over 10,000/d should be HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA

this is for all months from Oct00 to Sep01

Please advise on the 04/01 price for sales deal #SA 413462 on this buyback (Swing deal). The contract shows the price for 04/01 should be the same price as shown for 03/01 & 05/01 (i.e. 04/01 price for deal # SA 413462 should be: 10,000 @ HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A. & 11,000 @ HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA).

Thanks!
