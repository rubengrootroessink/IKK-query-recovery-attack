hello kay, got your e-mail.  i haven't made a list yet.  i was in bay city all day today, came home with a bad-#@# head-ache, back ache, have had dirreah all day,  then i come home to find out i have to be in the dentist tomorrow for at least 2 more hours. they have to grind my teeth down some more.  she told me her lab was picky. they called her and told her that she needed to grind some more because they want a perfect look and needed more room to make them look like the wax model they did. oh yeah the rest of the crap above is all a bad pms symptom,  i started spotting tonite so the next three days or gona be a doosy.  well i'll get back tomorrow ok.                love ya, bev
