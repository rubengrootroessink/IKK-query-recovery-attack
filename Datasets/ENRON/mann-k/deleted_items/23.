It looks like I'm the only one here today, except for Carol, and she's only here until 11am.  I'm off Friday and Monday, so have a happy New Year's.  How was your Christmas?  Kristine's sister was killed Sunday!  Needless to say, that is very upsetting, and she and Emma are up in Nebraska.  Her 2 little girls are in critical condition in the hospital while the family is a mess.  That girl was 35 years old!  It's so sad, and I just feel helpless that I can't do anything for Kristine!  
 
New York was great!

I'm going to take today as a vacation day, since what I need to do today I can handle from home.
 
I'll be in tomorrow.
 
Thanks,
 
Kay
