Kay, I will be working late tonight on a turbine proposal to Allegheny four MH1 501F turbines.  Ron Tapscott and John Schwartzenburg wanted to structure it somewhat off the NorthWestern Generation transaction this past April.  I have a copy of the April 26th Letter Agreement but have some questions.  It is possible that the proposed deal might not be as complex as the one you worked on.  If you could call me tonight or perhaps early tomorrow morning I would appreciate it.
W-713-345-2520.

I am working with Rose on this also.
Thanks

Randy

Ron,

Thanks for the information. Will discuss with Kay.  

I need to talk with you to find out more details of the deal for example what you are proposing to send, when do you need the document (I think you mentioned tomorrow) (Are you thinking of an LOI to be included as part of a bid package), who are the parties (Can't tell from your 12 Nov memo), when would closing be.  Does Enron Brazil Power Holdings own them outright now or they held by some other entity where we would be acting as agent for the sale.  If so do you know who  would we be assigning Enron's Brazil's interest in the MHI turbines,  The letter that Chris forwarded dated September 14th between Enron Power Brazil was attached.  Who prepared this. Is this the Nepco letter you referred to.  Will give you a call.  

To meet your time schedule, I do need to know more specifics on what you intend to accomplish.

Randy, please call me or Ron about the attached. teh goal will be to turn dox tomorrow to move the sale along.

Kay -  word is you worked the Northwestern deal. Ron wants to borrow from the Northwestern deal as this sale wil need to be done as a sale of the entity, not just the contract. Apparently, there is more of a  customs issue involved here than a consent issue, but some of the mechanics will be similar. Could you talk to Randy about the Northwestern sale and get him connected up with the dox? thanks.

 this is the letter agreement for the sale of the mhi equipment at port of export.  the letter agreement below is for the northwestern deal which embodies the sale of interest in company as part of the structure.

thanks, ron.
