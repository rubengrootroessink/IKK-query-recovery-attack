Jordan is taking Christina Mordant's last job, Corp Development.  Dan is convinced that he (Dan) will be laid off, and I'm worn out trying to talk him out of the feeling. Is Carol going back to Swaps?

I'm taking Wednesday off.  It will be very quiet all week. I may take the opportunity to run some errands.

See you later,

Kay
