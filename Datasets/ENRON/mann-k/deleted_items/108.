Hey Mom, it's of course very quiet here as well. There is still no one
around, but I know the action will pick up soon. I have read all three of my
books now, but that means it's time to write, which is the hard part. I'm
having a really hard time with the short paper I'm trying to get done. I
wrote something last night, but it's no good!! Oh well--I think I'm going to
really try to finish that up this morning and move on to one of my longer
ones. I realized last night that I did not leave my apartment ONCE
yesterday. That is just ridiculous--I've got to get out today or I'll go
stir crazy. I tried to call y'all Friday night afer I went shopping, but
there was no answer. It just made me think fishing was good, and you guys
were out there getting keepers til late in the night! Oh by the way, I think
I may be home Thursday night. Our plane leaves for New Orleans at 11 on
Friday, which means we must be there by 9:30, and that would mean getting up
and going really early from College Station. It's not for sure yet, but I
think it would be a good idea. Do you think there's any way y'all might be
able to pick us up on Sunday? I think the flight gets in around one. Again
this isn't definite--just an idea, but Mikey said he was going to see if his
dad could drop us off on Friday to avoid parking charges. Anyway, it's time
for me to get to reading and writing. I hope the Pink House trip was a
positive one and that fishing continued to be good. See you either in four
days or just three weeks...Almost done!

Love,

Paige
