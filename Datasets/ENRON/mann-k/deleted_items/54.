I just received a call from a legal head hunter and instead of giving her names, I told her that I would forward around some information about the job and ask that any interested party call her.  I didn't really know who to send this to (you were the first three people that I thought of who would be a good fit) and encourage you to forward this to anyone else who might be interested.  I don't know if anyone is looking (and don't really care).  I am just trying to be friendly and forward the opportunity in case you might have an interest.

The recruiter's name is Barbara Gelber and her phone number is 305-466-4670.

The opportunity is for a lawyer with power plant development and finance experience.  It is an in-house opportunity and you would have to move from Houston (the location (which Barbara would not disclose) is someplace sunny).

Feel free to call, if you are interested.

Stuart
