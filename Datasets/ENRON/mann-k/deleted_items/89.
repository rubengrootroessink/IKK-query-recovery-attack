I am coming over in a minute to look at the Northwestern Closing Binder.  If you want, I will stop by Kay's office.

I would like to see it before we send them anything.  I'll ask Kay for it.

Kay,

Attached is a draft of the Dynegy CA (bilateral).  The only executed bilateral CA we have in place with Dynegy is one prepared on their form.  I have not reviewed it, just talked to Kay Young.
