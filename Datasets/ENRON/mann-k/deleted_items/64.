Ron,

After spending sometime this evening going through the detailed Letter Agre=
ement dated April 26th which was attached at the bottom of your note today,=
 I concluded that this was most likely the final Definitive Agreement that =
was used to close the sale.  I have a call into to Kay to confirm this and =
 talk with her tomorrow).  It is more detailed than what I believe you woul=
d want to include in the first LOI to Allegheny outlining the deal.  (Note =
the  NEPCO letter you sent later is in the latter format and envisions that=
 a detailed agreement would be negotiated and entered into between the part=
ies (ie EPC Contract). (Nepco's letter to be modified to exclude the turbin=
e purchase from the procurement scope.) =20

After working with the detailed April 26th letter and seeing that it was qu=
ite complex for the current stage of discussions, I decided to look into Ka=
ys' Blue Dog data base. There I found a letter dated March 26 (also referre=
d to in the final April 26th Letter Agreement as the Initial Letter Agreeme=
nt).   This letter I believe was the LOI originally sent out to outline the=
 deal and ultimately led to the April 26th Definitive Agreement.   A copy i=
s attached below for your review.  If this is the concept of the type of pr=
oposal you want to send out in conjunction with the NEPCO proposal which we=
 could incentivize by the pricing concept that you referred to in your note=
 to Ben this evening, then please review this version in the morning rather=
 than the April 26th letter.  If it is consistent in concept, format and ap=
proach then I will use this letter as the basis to detail your project deal=
 and include the input I expect to receive tomorrow from Rose Engeldorf on =
the financial structuring of the parties for whom ENA would be acting as ag=
ent to sale the turbines.  Let me know if you agree with this approach.  I =
believe it will facilitate finalizing a draft that everyone would be happy =
with by Thursday.

From a practical concept ENA and Nepco, like we discussed, would should sub=
mit separate but cross referenced proposal letters concurrently (ENA for th=
e turbine sale and Nepco for the  EPC proposal minus the turbines.   The in=
centivized pricing mechanism mentioned in your note to Ben thus could be ad=
dressed  via a cross reference in the respective letters should that be the=
 commercial decision made.

Randy

Randy, please call me or Ron about the attached. teh goal will be to turn d=
ox tomorrow to move the sale along.

Kay -  word is you worked the Northwestern deal. Ron wants to borrow from t=
he Northwestern deal as this sale wil need to be done as a sale of the enti=
ty, not just the contract. Apparently, there is more of a  customs issue in=
volved here than a consent issue, but some of the mechanics will be similar=
. Could you talk to Randy about the Northwestern sale and get him connected=
 up with the dox? thanks.
