Hi Sheila,

Didn't know we were still in the turbine market.  I'll have Pete send future invoices to you unless you suggest otherwise.

Thanks,

Kay

These do not include that last round of changes that we made in getting Longview done.  Once the dust settles I intend to "update" the World Hunger docuemnt.

	In response to your request, attached please find the last
copies (7/20/01) of the World Hunger Form Agreement and the Exhibits.  I
do not know if these documents were ever approved by the "businesses".
However, the forms did serve as the basis for Longview.
