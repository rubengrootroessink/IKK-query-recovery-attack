Also, no outside counsel for my divestiture.  I had proposed, taking the initial cuts at the documents and including counsel for regulatory and "sanity" checks.  MH said -- do it in-house.  Interestingly, I thought that was how we would want to do it, but Jeff initially had suggested using counsel.  Do you want to go to lunch off-campus?
