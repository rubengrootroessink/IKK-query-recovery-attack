Dan hasn't expressed that he feels like he'll be laid off to me.  You know, who knows what will happen.  I feel like whatever is meant to be will happen.  I don't know what Carol will be doing, she's just homebasing out of 38.  I'll be here this week, but like you, I feel like it'll be very quiet, so maybe I can get some things done too.  I have Christmas cards to do!  We took family pictures yesterday.  My brother and family were in their Salvation Army uniforms.

Please keep me informed if you hear anything, and I will do the same.

Jordan is taking Christina Mordant's last job, Corp Development.  Dan is convinced that he (Dan) will be laid off, and I'm worn out trying to talk him out of the feeling. Is Carol going back to Swaps?

I'm taking Wednesday off.  It will be very quiet all week. I may take the opportunity to run some errands.

See you later,

Kay
