She is taking over Global Finance Legal. I heard Peter and Travis will be working with her.  I asked what Dan will be doing, but the person I talked to didn't know.  I think this just happened Friday. I don't know what I will be doing.  I suspect someone will be doing the power stuff.  I do wish I knew.  

I am afraid Dan would worry if he knew about Julia unless she has left him a message. If I hear anything I will let you know. 

Did you hear Alice quit? Couldn't risk the uncertainty.

I'm looking forward to the long weekend!
