Kay,

I talked to Reagan regarding the potential Dynegy transaction.  I am preparing a CA as follows?

Parties:  EPMI and Dynegy, Inc.
Bilateral
Purpose:  Discussions regarding one or more potential transactions involving EPMI and Dynegy regarding energy capacity and ancillary services.

For the time being, Reagan has decided not to limit these discussions to the Entergy control area, but rather leave it wide open.

Kathleen
