I only have 4 in my box, and none were the ones I gave you.  Thanks!

Kay, do you or Alice have any invoices in your IBuyIt Inbox?  If so, why don't you forward them to me, and I'll do them for you.   
 
I don't want to send in these invoices you gave me today until I find out if they are in either of the inboxes.  I'd hate to duplicate payments.
 
Thanks!!!!!
