I've recopied below Miss. Code Ann. Sec. 77-5-727. Subsection (u) appears t=
o answer your question, at least as to purchases of electric power. I'm not=
 aware of anything under the joint action agancy law that empowers the enti=
ty to buy gas on behalf of its members.

Section 77-5-729 provides authority for the member utility to contract with=
 the joint agency to purchase power. It's recopied below as well.

? 77-5-729. Contracts by members to buy power from joint agencies
Current through End of 2000 3rd Ex. Sess.
References
Any municipality which is a member of the joint agency may contract to buy =
from the joint agency power and energy required for its present or future r=
equirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified pro=
jects.  As the creation of a joint agency is an alternative method whereby =
a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of o=
wnership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality =
so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the cont=
ract whether or not a project is completed, operable, operating, retired or=
 decommissioned and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, interfere=
nce, reduction, curtailment or termination of the output of a project or th=
e power and energy contracted for, and that such payments under the contrac=
t shall not be subject to any reduction whether by offset or otherwise, and=
 shall not be conditioned upon the performance or nonperformance of the joi=
nt agency or any other member of the joint agency under the contract or any=
 other instrument.  Any contract with respect to the sale or purchase of ca=
pacity or output of a project entered into between a joint agency and its m=
ember municipalities may also provide that if one or more of such municipal=
ities shall default in the payment of its or their obligations, with respec=
t to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in that event the remain=
ing member municipalities which are purchasing capacity and output under th=
e contract shall be required to accept and pay for and shall be entitled pr=
oportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the capacity or output=
 which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such c=
ontracts with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output, power or=
 energy from a project may extend for a period not exceeding fifty (50) yea=
rs from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous o=
peration;  and the execution and effectiveness thereof shall not be subject=
 to any authorizations or approvals by the state or any agency, commission =
or instrumentality or political subdivision thereof except as in this artic=
le specifically required and provided.
Payments by a municipality under any contract for the purchase of capacity =
and output from a joint agency shall be made solely from the revenues deriv=
ed from the ownership and operation of the electric system of said municipa=
lity and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or=
 equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the mun=
icipality or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, except the reven=
ues of its electric system, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing=
 power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of any o=
bligation under any such contract.  A municipality shall be obligated to fi=
x, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for electric power and=
 energy and other services, facilities and commodities, sold, furnished or =
supplied through its electric system sufficient to provide revenues adequat=
e to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all ot=
her amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenu=
es, including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on bo=
nds heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related=
 to its electric system.
Any municipality which is a member of a joint agency may furnish the joint =
agency with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its el=
ectric system or facilities and may make available for the use of the joint=
 agency any personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal, whic=
h is a part of its electric system or facilities.
Any member of a joint agency may contract for, advance or contribute funds =
derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or f=
acilities to a joint agency as may be agreed upon by the joint agency and t=
he member, and the joint agency shall repay such advances or contributions =
from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of =
the joint agency, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by t=
he member and the joint agency.
