If you want me to write up the complete definition for each of these, let me 
know

If you have questions, let me know


Receipt Point definition(s)


FOR POWER

The receipt point and delivery point definitions are identical as they apply 
to MDEA proper at the Entergy - MDEA interfaces.

The receipt point and delivery point definitions for EPMI and third-party 
transactions should be as defined in each individual deal/transaction 
Confirmation.

(IE, you have four power definitions)


FOR GAS

The receipt point for gas is defined in each individual deal Confirm where 
gas may be purchased, and then transported to MDEA.

There are 3 delivery points for gas:

for Clarksdale it is the interconnect between Texas Gas and Clarksdale

for Yazoo City you have (a) the interconnect between Southern Natural Gas 
(Sonat) and Mississippi Valley Gas for the Yazoo City Power Plant (Sonat 
Delivery Point)
                                   (b)  the interconnect between Mississippi 
Valley Gas (MVG) and the Yazoo City Power Plant (MVG Delivery Point)



Off Peak Definition

This is the same definition as the ON PEAK definition, except the off peak 
hours beginning and ending are the opposite of the on peak hours.


Transmission Services

Transmission Services means the analysis and/or procurement of transmission 
capacity as part of the Scheduling Services by EPMI as MDEA's Scheduling 
Entity.



Scheduling Equipment

Suggest either don't refer to a list at all, or you can say such equipment is 
included in the list of equipment on the Exhibit ?, but try to name the 
specific equipment.


Term

It is simply my preference to let the one year term evergreen automatically 
each year unless prior notice is given by either party.  I don't think anyone 
else has a particular preference, unless you do.  Don't know if MDEA has a 
preference on this.


Contracted Resources

Thought we had an Exhibit for this already called Off-System Contracted 
Resources, so I will get it to you separately in a few minutes.  We also have 
a blank Existing Transaction Exhibit.  I thought that we might blend the 
Contract resources and the Gas Transportation Agreements into the Existing 
Transaction Exhibit.

Subject: List of questions

Hi guys, 

Here's a list of questions as I'm working through MDEA.  Actually, some are 
questions, some are reminders of things you were going to send me:

Receipt Point - need def'n  RR
Load info - I was going to plug in something, or we were going to have an 
exhibit to describe.  RR
Off peak defn - RR 
transmission - we've added transmission services, but it isn't defnd.  Any 
suggestions?
scheduling equipment - do we want to refer to the list?
term - previously I was instructed to take out the evergreen renewal, now is 
it back in?  If so, is the mechanism in the first draft ok?
contracted resources - I've added in a def'n - we need a schedule. Name, 
date, subject matter of contract.

More questions to come, but I wanted to get this to you asap.  Reagan, you 
might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items.

Thanks!

Kay
