Mr. Priest's office had notified me this morning that the second and third attachments below were diffcult to open.  I am resending them as the attachments immediately below.  If anyone has further problems, please be aware that the second and third attachments are the standardized  text portions of the EEI Master Agreement, without any modifications by Enron, and are available at the following  website: http://www.eei.org/   You must go to "Energy Issues/News" to get to the menu with the "Standard Contract".
