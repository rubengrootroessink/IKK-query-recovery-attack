Kay -- Just some housekeeping questions:

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process of sorting out the "Costs" definition so that it works better with the other parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done this week and have them call a special Board meeting.  They have done this in the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this by May 31.

Thanks -- David
