Kay -- The fuel activity is so limited in scope that a separate Exhibit is 
questionable.  If you don't want fuel in the contract body, then why not make 
it a subset of the marketing plan.  Fuel activity is directly linked to power 
marketing when running their units. Thanks -- david

Hi David,

Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.  

I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits, but 
we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you.  
It just seemed that it would easier to work  with in the exhibits.

Kay

Kay -- Do you want detail about our specific power and gas activity 
obligations in the body of the contract, or in the Marketing Plan?  Is the 
fuel plan included in the Marketing Plan?
