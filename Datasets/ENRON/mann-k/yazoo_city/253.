Kay,

Here is the Cover Sheet and Attachments for the above C/P.  I wasn't sure about the due diligence on the "agency relationship" so was unsure as to whether to put those riders in.  I have attached those riders so you can advise me.  The Agreement is housed in your directory minus the General Terms and Conditions.  When you are ready to send the Agreement then I can attach the GTC.

Thanks,
Genia
