I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the ILA until June 15.  

I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I thought I would give you a heads up.

David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.  If you have your preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.

Thanks,

Kay
