What about this?  Is this the QSE defn? [Rorschach, Reagan]  No, that would be Qualified Scheduling Entity that has a very lengthly ERCOT definition.  This was greatly simplified to eliminate any confusion.  I think it is OK as is. 

"Scheduling Entity" means an entity contemplated to be recognized by SPP, and fully qualified under SPP rules and regulations, to schedule the transmission of Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services from the Facilities.
