That means it is recognized, not  "contemplated to be recognized", then?  Is there such a thing as a recognized scheduling entity, or do you just schedule on their behalf? [Rorschach, Reagan]  SPP does not have such an entity at this point.  However, everyone expects this to happen sometime soon.  If this is causing probelms or commitments on our part because this is not even in existance, we should think about deleting reference to SPP rules and regs.  Once the scope of an SPP defined scheduling entity is proferred, we can discuss any additional efforts required on our part to meet and be in compliance with that scope.

What about this?  Is this the QSE defn? [Rorschach, Reagan]  No, that would be Qualified Scheduling Entity that has a very lengthly ERCOT definition.  This was greatly simplified to eliminate any confusion.  I think it is OK as is. 

"Scheduling Entity" means an entity contemplated to be recognized by SPP, and fully qualified under SPP rules and regulations, to schedule the transmission of Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services from the Facilities.
