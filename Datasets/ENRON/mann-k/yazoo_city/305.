Attached is a memo discussing the law applicable to the Power Marketing Agreement.  

After discussing the matter with some attorneys around the office, the unanimous response is that North MS/Delta/Coahoma County is not going to be a favorable venue for any litigation involving Enron.  Juries all over Mississippi have recently become enamored with redistribution of wealth.  The demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the Clarksdale area suggest that a jury trial would not be a good experience for Enron.  

If you have any questions about the memo or other topics, please contact me.  Have a good 4th of July.

Thanks, 
John Brunini
