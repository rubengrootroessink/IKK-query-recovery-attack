Kent just asked for a copy of the latest version because he wasn't sure
he had a copy of it and wanted to know if the "businesses" had approved
the forms.

Hi Pete,

To my knowledge Enron and GE aren't discussing any turbine purchases
(maybe I missed something).  Did Kent mention why he wanted the forms?

Unless Sheila Tweed or one of her folks commission more work, I wouldn't
expect that there would be any more charges on this matter at this time.

Thanks,

Kay

	In response to your request, attached please find the last
copies (7/20/01) of the World Hunger Form Agreement and the Exhibits.  I
do not know if these documents were ever approved by the "businesses".
However, the forms did serve as the basis for Longview.
