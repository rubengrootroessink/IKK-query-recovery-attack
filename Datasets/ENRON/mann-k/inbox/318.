Threshold is $50mm FMV of assets being sold.  Don't think we can get to that point.

I'm out (in SF) and off Wednesday. What's the status of the deal? Were we going to require them to get DOJ approval?

I can be reached by fax today and tomorrow at 415-383-1613.

Ben,

I need to get you to resign from the Montana Megawatts BOD.  Will you be in this week?  If not, we can handle it with fax/fed ex.

Kathleen, 

Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.  Thanks.
