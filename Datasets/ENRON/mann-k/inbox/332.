Ben,

After reviewing the Montana Megawatts file, it appears that you have already been removed as officer, power of attorney, etc. so you are good to go.

Hope you and your family have a nice Thanksgiving.

Kathleen

Ben,

I need to get you to resign from the Montana Megawatts BOD.  Will you be in this week?  If not, we can handle it with fax/fed ex.

Kay

Kathleen, 

Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.  Thanks.
