Do you know who the associated traders are?  If not I guess I can ask around I just thought you would know.

Thanks,

Neil,

In our efforts to sell  the Portland MAN the lawyers need copies of all of these contracts to go over assign ability.  Could you send the contract numbers or just explain the contracts to Danny Clark.  Danny said he could gather the contracts and get them to me.  This is needed ASAP as usual.  Thanks for your help.


Thanks,

Coop
