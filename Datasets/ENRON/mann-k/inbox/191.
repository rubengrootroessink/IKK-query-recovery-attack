Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil
