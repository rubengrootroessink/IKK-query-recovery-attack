    Kay,
     No, I have not heard anything about his departure.  Thanks for the
heads up and please let me know when you learn anything more about Dave's
situation with the company and any consulting relationship.

Please don't say anything, but I heard yesterday that Dave K is leaving
Enron very soon. I haven't talked to Ben, so I don't know if he will be
consulting with us. Have youheard anything?
