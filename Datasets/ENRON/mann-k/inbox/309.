Please provide final GSA so that I can forward to Jode.  Tasking Letter is not processed until GSA is executed and language has been agreed upon.  I will process once I received the executed GSA from Jode.  
Kay, I have a note that you would like to see if before I added to the approval process.
 
Thanks and best regards,
 
Adriana

Allan,
 
There comments appear to me to be more commercial.  I'm not bothered by them.
 
Adriana, have you had a chance to give the tasking letter some thought?  It would be good to be able to wrap this up at one time.
 
Thanks,
 
Kay
