I will print when I get in this am.  It may be that I need to use good ole Word Perfect.  If the last page you are talking about are only the instructions regarding duties of POA, then its not very important.  See you later.

I am having a difficult time printing the POA.  The last pages don't print and the margins are wide. Can you help?
