Just a quick reminder:  we need to finalize our position in response to DEP's now-filed motion to consolidate the two proceedings.  Also, I need to speak with Dave and Scott Osbourn this week so that we can formulate our interrogatory responses, which I need to serve on Friday evening.
Many thanks!
Ryan
