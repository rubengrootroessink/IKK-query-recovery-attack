I got this email from my professor who didn't seem at all affected when I
told him my grandfather was going in for surgery. You never know who is
going to be touched. Also, my girls here gave me flowers when I got home.
It's really strange to be here where everyone is really concentrated on
homework and listening to music, etc... I cried a lot on the way back here,
and I turned off the radio for a long time. I never do that, but I felt like
I needed to talk to PopPop in quiet. This stinks. My heart hurts. I know
it'll get better, but it was so recently that we were all laughing in the
hospital room. I just have so many questions that will never be answered.
Well I need to get moving on my group project. Keep in touch.

Love,

Paige

Dear Paige,

I was saddened to hear that your grandfather passed away.  I am sure he
considered his life significanly enriched having you as a grand
daughter.
