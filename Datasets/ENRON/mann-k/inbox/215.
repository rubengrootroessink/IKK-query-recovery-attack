The attachment wasn't the important part. He always attaches something to
emails...It might be the syllabus or something. I just thought what he wrote
in the body of the letter was really sweet. Oh, if you do happen by Hulen
Mall, could you pick me up one of those nail things? I have showed it to
everyone, and they think it's amazing. If not, no biggie. I'll be up there
sometime, and I can take care of it. How are you two doing? Are you getting
stuff done? Is there anything I need to do to help you or Mimi? Just let me
know. I have to get ready for my tour now.

Love,

Paige

I can't open attachments - can you cut and paste?

This will be hard. Don't forget to pray. And be patient as there is no
timeline.

Love,
Mom
