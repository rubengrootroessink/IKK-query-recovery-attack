Kay,

Jode Corp may terminate this Agreement upon one hundred twenty (120) days prior written notice to EBS of such termination.  Promptly after such termination by EBS, EBS will pay Jode Corp in full satisfaction and discharge of all liabilities and obligations owed to Jode Corp, all fees owed for Services pursuant to schedule of payment and a prorated portion of the monthly amount pursuant to schedule of payment.
