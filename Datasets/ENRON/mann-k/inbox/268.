Kay,

I just received a call from GE (Jeff Darst and Steve Swift) in which they said that NorthWestern was asking for GE to sign documents that would enable NorthWestern to buy out Enron remaining interest in the LLC.  I am unaware of any discussions with NorthWestern with regards to this.  Please give me a call, and be advised that Jeff and Steve are going to call you.

Thanks,

Chris
