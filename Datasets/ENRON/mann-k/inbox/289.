Andrew, per Arshak's request I am sending you the attached spreadsheet for your review. 
please give me a call when you have a minute so we can go over what Arshak wants to accomplish.

Arshak is looking to have an addendum to the original Akamai contract to reflect the accelerated payment schedule according to the spreadsheet. please keep in mind that the start/end dates might change 

Thanks
Moe
