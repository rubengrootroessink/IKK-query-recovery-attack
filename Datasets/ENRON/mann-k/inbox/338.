Scott,
 
Please have Paul Hastings draft language and forward to Kay Mann for review.  Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.

Subject: Enron Storage Payment



After discussions with Chris Booth of Enron, we agreed the best way to

handle the outstanding refund to Enron for the storage of the units (equal

to $48,000), is to net the amount from the balance to be paid back to

NorthWestern.

Chris, did your lawyers draft the paperwork to approve the reduction in the

payment, or do you want Paul Hastings to do so?  Please advise.
