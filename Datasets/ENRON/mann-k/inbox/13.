Just a reminder that I have the Greenberg Traurig invoices in my IBuyIt inbox when you have signed off of them.

Randy Pais had passed those invoices that you gave to me for him on to Bart Clark and Kay Mann.  Bart said it wasn't all his work so passed the invoice to Kay Mann.  She took them all.  She may still have them or possibly her assistant.
 
Thanks...Kristi

I gave you guys some invoices to get approved that are in my IBuyIt Inbox, and I've never received them back.  If you have any that have been approved, please bring them to me so I can get them on their way. Thanks!
