Pursuant to section 8(a) of the Letter Agreement, please be advised that ENA made a payment to General Electric in the amount of $386,342.00 on 10/31/2001 (fed ref # 4378).  Please note ENA has not yet received payment for $48,000 from NorthWestern for the storage invoice submitted 9/28/2001.  For your convenience, I have attached a copy of the storage invoice.
