      Kay and Ryan,
         Steve indicated last evening that he was trying to converse with
Kay and Ben today  at  12: 30 CST/1: 30 EST and wanted to know if I was
available then, which I am.  I am also generally available the rest of the
afternoon.   As Ryan indicated, I am sure that we can coordinate our
schedules to be available this afternoon. 
         Please let me know when you have a prospective time firmed up.
Otherwise, I should be available this afternoon. 
          --Kerri

Kay,
We are generally around.  I spoke with Kerri last night and she suggested
there might be a call around 12:30 CST, 1:30 EST today.  I am available for
an hour beginning at that time and then again after the conclusion of my
2:30 EST meeting.  The problem is that I don't know how long the latter
meeting is going to take.  I know Kerri had planned to be generally
available beginning at 1:30 EST, as well, but I am not sure exactly how her
schedule looks.  I am sure we can put something together, though.
Ryan
