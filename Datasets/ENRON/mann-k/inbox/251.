I'm happy to look at another format.  This was the one Michelle gave me.

Kay,
I have everything I need with the exception of the wbs. coding, contact name, physical address and tax ID #.   I believe Allan is getting all that info for us.
We will be using this format from now on? 
Best regards,

Adriana
