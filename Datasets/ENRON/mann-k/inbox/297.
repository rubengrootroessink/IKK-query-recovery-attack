  <http://clk4.com/redcross/images/MS_RCR2280_DEM_r2_c1.gif>	September 11, 2001 forever changed the landscape of our country and the life of every American. We have never faced a disaster of this size, scope or intensity but we're meeting the challenge. Conversely, we have never before received such overwhelming support from the public. Americans like you have responded with an outpouring of love, labor, blood and generosity. The American Red Cross depends solely on voluntary donations of time, money and blood. Without donations from you and others, we would not be able to carry out our humanitarian mission.

America has spoken loudly and clearly. The Red Cross is honoring the national call for relief efforts to be directed solely toward the people affected by the September 11 tragedies. The immediate and long-term needs of the people affected by the terrorist attacks are our highest priority. We're moving more money to the families of the dead and seriously injured victims quickly by extending our Family Gift Program to cover a full year of living expenses, providing additional payments for the next six months based on need.

25,000 families already have been directly helped by the American Red Cross. Through your support of our disaster response efforts, millions of meals have been served, tens of thousands of people have received mental health and grief counseling, and millions of dollars have been dispensed to families in dire need to cover costs of transportation, childcare, mortgage or rent payments, funerals and related expenses.   <http://clk4.com/redcross/images/graphic2.gif>Thousands of people have been displaced from their homes, and the Red Cross is there offering funds for groceries, lodging, clean-up and recovery. More than 45,000 Red Cross volunteers and disaster workers have worked at Ground Zero where they have been caring for construction workers, police, fire personnel and emergency medical technicians.

The American Red Cross will spend $275 million in support of people affected by the disasters by year end, about half of the $542 million that has been received to date. We continue to assess the needs of those affected by these tragedies and will offer families even more assistance in the months ahead.

The Red Cross was the first organization to give such support and has provided more cash assistance to the families and dependents of loved ones lost in the September 11 attacks than all other major humanitarian service organizations combined. The Red Cross will help with recovery efforts throughout the weeks, months and years to come - for as long as needs exist.
