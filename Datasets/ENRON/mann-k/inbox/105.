Kay, I hate to sound stupid, but............do you want all of the letters redlined or just the highlighted one?  You want the date at the top of the letter to be September 13, 2001 right?  Have the changes been made that these guys are talking about or is that something else?  Do you want me to do a new version or just put on the track changes to pick up all the changes that have been made to the letters?
