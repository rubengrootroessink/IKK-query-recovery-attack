Mr. Harp,

Please find below attached protected copy of the GSA that you received today via FEDEX.  I spoke with Allan earlier and he mentioned that you needed to revise parts of the language.  Please make your changes in the document below and submit your red lined changes to Mrs. Michelle Hicks with our Legal Dept via email.(michelle_hicks@enron.net)

Thanks and best regards,
