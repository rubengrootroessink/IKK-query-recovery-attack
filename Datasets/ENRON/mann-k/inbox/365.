I coded the King and Spalding invoices in IPAYIT yesterday. Before coding, I had to forward the invoices to Ben for his approval. So, they should be processed and paid soon through IPAYIT. 

Thanks-

Tonya

Good morning,

I forwarded to you over the last three weeks approximately 8 to 12 invoices for coding.......Kay Mann wants to resolve these invoices today.     Will you please code the invoices as the following or return them to me.    My last day at Enron is tomorrow (3 p.m.), so if you don't get them to me, please process them and inform Kay Mann of the status.

Coral Energy - Cost Center 107319

Project Blue Dog - Split 50/50 between Cost Centers 107319 and 150273

or Cost Center 107319 (second choice)

Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this matter.
