The additional income for Northwestern will be booked by the end of this week. - This isn't supposed to be split with Calger is it?

Kay - all legal invoices for Delta should be split 30% Ben Jacoby cc#107319   70% Chris Calger  cc#150273.

Theresa:

I wanted to follow up on a couple minor items.

Have you booked the $102,010 discount associated with the Northwestern deal as income?

On the Delta Power LM 6000 deal, I believe the legal invoices should be split according to the income allocation. I think the split was $4 million to Calger, and $2 million to me. 

Thanks,

Ben
