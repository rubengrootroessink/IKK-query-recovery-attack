Thanks, Kay - Your e-mail solved the mystery, I think.  I have checked the
signature block in our pleadings, and they list a fax number which is not
our firm's main fax number (I assume it is a satellite fax machine somewhere
near Kerri's or Paul's office). I'm sure that your fax went to that machine
and no one on this end got it to me.  I don't know where the satellite
machine is located, but will follow up on Monday.

In any event, I served the answers sans signature (so that our objections
have been preserved), and will send out a version including the signature
once the hard copy arrives.

Ryan

Ryan, 
 
I asked my assistant to fax and fed ex the signature page.  The fax
address I gave her was the one on the pleadings (as was the address).
Was that the correct office?  I gave it to her at 345 CST, and it would
be very unusual for her to not send it fairly soon after that.  I've
left her a voice mail to see what's up.
 
Thanks,
 
Kay
