My goodness, you certainly were up early this morning!  I slept in until 7:00.  Getting ready to go pick up my niece so she can make Christmas presents for her parents and grandparents.  We should have a great time!
 
I will get with you on Monday regarding work matters.  I think regarding CA I and CA II, I don't remember making closing binders for the normal 5 or 6 internal distributees (maybe I did and am just getting too old to remember).  Maybe I should retire?

Probably, but that's just the turbine contract.  The other closing docs are more impt, and I have those.
