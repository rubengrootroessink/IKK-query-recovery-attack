Jeff,

I received an invoice for storage for the month of November, but would request that this invoice and future invoices for storage instead be sent to NorthWestern.  Under the terms of the assignment, NorthWestern has the obligation for storage charges from October forward.  I know this might be a little confusing since Enron has the ongoing payment obligations for the original purchase contract and the first two change orders.

Please feel free to call if you need to discuss this matter further.

Regards,

Chris Booth
