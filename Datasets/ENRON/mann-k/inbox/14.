Thanks for your help.  The next step is to work on the Tennessee pipeline documents.  Hope you have some time or do you want me to coordinate the pipeline stuff with someone else?

Good suggestions.  Take a look at this proposal.  I have talked with Julie Smith this morning and they are still interested in transacting with ENA despite the negative press.

Thanks,
