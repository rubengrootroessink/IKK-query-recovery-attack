I had told Mama that I might not come, but since they know they are going to
do the test, I'm coming. I'm hoping to leave Austin around 10 ( I have to go
up to school and do a couple of things).

Drive safely!

Lisa

 Is it your anniversary? Isn't it right around now? How many
years? Congrats!
 
 I think I have decided that I am going to head up to Ft Worth in
the
 morning, after I get the kids to school and wrap up a couple of
things at my
 school.
 
 Do you know your plans yet?
