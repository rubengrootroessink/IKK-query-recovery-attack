It may also makes sense to keep the arrangements separate.  The City's claim pursuant to its power deal (presumably with ENA) is likely a general unsecured claim that gives them very little hope of actually collecting.  Sandhill is not a debtor (not yet anyway) and is an assets/commodity that can be freely assigned.  Just a thought.

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

Stuart:

Here is my shot at your memo.

I will have the accounting spreadsheet from Theresa Vox today.
