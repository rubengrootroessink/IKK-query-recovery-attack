Ben/Mike/Jeff,

Here is a quick update and a request for your assistance:

On Wednesday, November 22, ENA sent West LB a 5-day notice indicating our 
intent to exercise the purchase option by Friday.
On Friday, November 30, ENA will execute the purchase option and at that time 
own the 4 turbines for the Austin project.
Hopefully, by the end of the week, ENA and GE will execute the breakout 
agreement which will ensure, primarily, that the GE warranties attached to 
the 4 Austin turbines are completely conveyed to ENA.

Attached is the latest draft of the GE Breakout agreement between ENA and GE. 
 In order to complete the breakout agreement, the lawyers need you guys to 
review section 10 regarding site specific performance guarantees and provide 
comments.  Also, please let us (Kay Mann and myself) know what Exhibit F and 
U should contain.  The GE lawyers indicated they would provide the first 
draft soon.

Let us know you thoughts as soon as possible.

Regards,

Eric
