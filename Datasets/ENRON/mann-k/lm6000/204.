Subject: Exhibit B-1

Santa just dropped this off.  It is the missing Exhibit B-1 electronic 
version for the GE Break out contract.  We are in the process of setting up 
arrangements with GE to supply Power System Stabilizers for the GTGs.
Until the Break Out Contract is finalized, it is best to call this a draft.
