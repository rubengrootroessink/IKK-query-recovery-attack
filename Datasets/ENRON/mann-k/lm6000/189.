Hi Dave,

I received a signed change order from Randy Milcer (not sure about that)
yesterday.  The form he signed indicates that ABB will be paying Enron, and
has one small mistake in the amount of payments made on the cancelled
transformers ($400 off).  With your permission I will substitute the
correct version so ABB gets the money.

Thanks,

Kay
