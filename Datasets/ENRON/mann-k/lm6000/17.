Here are my comments after reviewing the below change order: (i) the cover 
page refers to an enron 2-99 deal which does not correspond to the cover page 
of the executed turbine purchase contract with GE.  To what does this refer 
if a different deal and if the same deal, please conform.  (ii) the effective 
date is stated as March 6, 2000.  Given that the agreement between Enron and 
WestLB and the purchase agreement between WestLB and GE weren't signed until 
May 12, 2000, if any backdating is needed (I'd like to understand why it is 
for new equipment orders), it can't be before May 12th.  With respect to the 
effective date and the overall placement of the order, has this $4.65MM 
acquisition been dashed?  The current effective dash only contemplated the 
turbines, not any ancillary equipment.  I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC 
contact for this transaction.

Regards, Lisa
