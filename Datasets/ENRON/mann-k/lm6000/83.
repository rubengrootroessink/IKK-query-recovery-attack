My prior e-mail was undeliverable.  Here is the message I had sent earlier 
this evening:  I hope to be e-mailing to you shortly a clean copy of the ABB 
Transformer Purchase and Sale Agreement, as well as a blackline showing the 
changes made from the WestdeutscheLB Agreement dated July 14, 2000.  We have 
run into some formatting problems, which we believe are due to problems of 
the system being able to read some of the formatting codes in the original 
WestdeutscheLB Agreement that we received via e-mail.  I hope to have these 
remedied shortly.
