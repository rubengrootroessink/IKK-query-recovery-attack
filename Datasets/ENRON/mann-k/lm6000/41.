Ben,

The unit deliveries that go with revised milestone 10 are units # 21&22 that
actually occur by March 30, 2001.  I've already pushed back payments as far
as I can for Units 19,20, 23, & 24, by splitting the 10% into two 5%
payments from the earlier agreed to 2/15 date.  So the deferral of 5% of
contract to 7/30/01 more than accomodates the later ship dates.  The value
for delaying ~ $ 17.5 mm for 75 days is already benefitting by $ 365,000
assuming 10% cost of money.  That's the best we can do.  Sorry if I didn't
make myself clear.

Please call if we need to discuss further before concluding the Change
Order.

Thanks,

Lee

Lee:

Looks good except I've gotten approval based on unit #19 being delivered on
May 15, based on our discussion last week. I'm happy to go back, but I
think the payment schedule should tie to the unit delivery; i.e. either
push the payment schedule back, or move the unit delivery date forward.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Thanks,

Ben
