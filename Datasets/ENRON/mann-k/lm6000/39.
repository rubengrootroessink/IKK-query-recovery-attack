Chris,

Below, is the confirmed shipment dates for the change order equipment that
you currently have on order with us.

A couple of these (modular control room, 50 ft and retrofit to add Power
System Stabilizer to generator) need new line items in Exhibit N-2 when
writing up the change order.

Thanks,

Lee
