Kay:

Here are our comments for meeting.  Sorry I couldn't get them to you earlier
but Lee and I couldn't talk before now.  We meant to just talk them all
through anyway as you can see.  Maybe you've got more.

Our biggest concern is that the law firm seems to keep wanting to make the
document better, when they should just leave it the way it is.  We certainly
can see who pays them.

Kent
