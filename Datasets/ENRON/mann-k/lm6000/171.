The following items need to be added to complete the exhibits:

1. Exhibits B-1 and H-2 need to be added.

2. If one is warranted, a Seller Parent Guarantee should be
included as Exhibit C-1.

3. Does Exhibit F need to be updated and revised before signing?

4. In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5. For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all
documents that it should have received by now.

Pursuant to your directive, Exhibit N-1 is no longer used.  We have
assumed in the Agreement that the Unit Liability Amount for each Unit is
$15,653,175.  The contract terms formerly in Exhibit U have been
incorporated into the Agreement.

Brett,

Just a few comments.  Exhibit H-2 Training and Exhibit B-2
Specifications
need to be added.  Exhibit N-1 does not have the unit price.  The
Contract
Terms do not have the contract price.

John

I failed to forward this to you guys yesterday.  Please work to come up
with consolidated comments as soon as possible.  Same comment on major
problems as opposed to small comments.

Thanks,
Brett

The first of these two documents contains the key terms of the GE
contract
for the ESA deal.  It was prepared by GE.  Your comments would be
appreciated.

Here's what I think we should have on the ESA exhibits.  Let's see if it
will hunt.

Thanks,
