Please call Bruce Silvers with Bingham & Dana in Hartford, Conn, and tell him 
my trip has  rescheduled.  Please see if he is available to meet on Monday 
afternoon, preferably in New York (although I'll confirm later).  I think it 
might be helpful if Nick Palatin was available as well.

Thanks,

Kay
