Subject: FW: Draft Bill of Sale

Here's the bill of sale I promised to you.  Why don't you arrange a call/mtg 
with Rose and me to discuss form of notice/information.  We should probably 
start with the WestLB Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption form and 
redraft it to include what we want and think the bank will require in 
addition to what they asked for.

And here is the bill of sale, also opened and saved on our system. If Mike 
had a more recent version of this I don't think we got it. - KW
