Does that mean we will do the pre-pay?

Kay,

I spoke with Jake and Lee about the payment schedule.  Lee currently is happy 
to give us 6% to repay everything on 15 May.  I told him we were shooting for 
the end of April, but he is attempting to maintain some continuity with the 
existing payment schedule.  We can probably push him to get it earlier.  

Jake is a little unhappy with 6%.

Steve
