Well, I personally would like your input, although I'm not clear who will end 
up with it.

Kay

I snooped around and found out that Ann Elizabeth White is the author (I 
don't know her, but she is with Barbara Grey's group).  I really think we 
should revise portions of it.  Do you want my input?  I am making some 
handwritten changes to talk to you about.

This was sent to me by one of the developers.  I believe it relates to an 
expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.  I don't know 
which lawyer has been working on it, so I'm sending it around to see if 
anyone claims it. Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been 
working on it.

Kay,

This is the format for the land options that Robert Shaw of New Century is

Thanks,
