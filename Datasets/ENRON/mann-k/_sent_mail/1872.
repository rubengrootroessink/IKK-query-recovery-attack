Good idea about taking the sausage.

Are you going to the store?  If you do, I could use some Diet Coke, silver 
and gold.

Sounds great!
I wish I would have thought to get some smoked venison out at noon. We could
have cooked a package and the taken some with us this weekend. Do you want
to take your dad some?
See you tonight sweetie.

Guess what?  The closing party isn't until Feb. 8.  I had the wrong week!
Glad I didn't show up on the wrong day....

BEAUTIFUL weather.  Might want to sit outside and have a little cocktail
(or equivalent) tonight.  I had Mexican food for lunch, so popcorn for
dinner!

Love,

Kay
