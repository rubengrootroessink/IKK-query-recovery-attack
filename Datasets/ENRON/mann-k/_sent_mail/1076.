I would love to take you up on it, but I'm already lined up to go.  I'll take 
a raincheck!

Thanks for thinking of me.

Subject: Monkey Business

My recollection is that each of you is somewhat of a baseball fan, as I am.  
I just happen to have 4 great seats for Opening Day at Enron Field, for which 
I very much need company to help me enjoy.  I would love it if each of you 
could join me.  The game starts at 4:05 pm, so it might require leaving the 
office a little early.  But of course we would be discussing serious business 
the entire time so that it would be fully justifiable to anyone interested.  
I will bring my legal pad to take notes. 

Let me know.  Hope you can come.
