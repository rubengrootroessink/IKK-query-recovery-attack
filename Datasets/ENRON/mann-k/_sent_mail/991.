Steve is in my office and he agrees with the approach.

Subject: Update on Proposed HSR Fee Split

Kay:

I have left two messages with Steve Thome but have not heard back from him.
In the meantime, Greg Lang called.  I advised Greg that our tentative
proposal is to pay half (not to exceed $25,000) of the HSR filing fee, but
that this has not yet been approved by Enron.  He balked at the $25,000
maximum, and said he would let his client know.  I am to get back to Greg
when Enron approves a proposal on the issue.
