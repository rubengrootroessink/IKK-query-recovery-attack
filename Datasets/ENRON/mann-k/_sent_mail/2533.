I'm out of the office until around 1000 cst, but I'll call.  In the 
meanwhile, please have the draft revised to reflect this payment arrangement.

This stuff is going fast and furious, and an executed ESA contract will be 
required for ESA closing their financing on the 13th.  That's why it is first 
in line.  We will need to start on a facility agreement for a project known 
as the Fountain Valley project (aka PSCO).  Also, I'm going to try to get ABB 
focused on doing their facility agreements.

I've asked the commercial team to prepare an update spread sheet for the 
turbines to confirm the payment terms.  I hope to have it this am.

What is your direct line?

Kay

Could you call me.  This is the first I've heard of the 25% of Change
Order 3 being added to the January payment.  That is NOT reflected in
the last draft that was sent out.  I had included all of Change Order 3
into the January payment.  The only deal that I was aware of where ENA
was doing the 75/25 split was the CA Energy Agreements.

The first facility agreement which needs to be finished is the ESA
Facility
Agreement.  Peter and/or Chris, could you please send/re-send the most
recent version with a email stating any open issues, copying everyone on
this email.  We need to get this one ready to sign tomorrow, if at all
possible.

My understanding of the commercial deal is that the scope should include
change order #3, with 75% of the value of change order #3 payable on or
before Dec. 27, 2000, and 25% of change order #3 being added to the
January, 2000 payment.

Kent/Lee, sorry I didn't mention this in our phone call this afternoon.
That's what happens when I'm not working from my list.

Thanks,

Kay
