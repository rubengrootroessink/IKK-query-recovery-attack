I'll make the change.  In addition, I have not received responses to the
questions I presented in my cover e-mail accompanying the agreements
yesterday.  I would propose that we not distribute the agreement again
until these changes are incorporated.

Mike:

Based on our telephone conversation, the only comment we will include in
the contract is 1 below, i.e. we are not going to change any commercial
terms of the deal. Thanks for your help and patience in this process.

Ben

Ben/Kay,
After reviewing the contract with Dave we found only a couple of points
that we
would like to mention;
1) 1.48 the Maximum Liability Amount should be $768,000 USD
2) The unit will not be delivered until the last 10% (ten percent)
retention is
paid and we will post the surety bond as shown in in Exhibit D
3) ABB would not buy back the unit except from Enron.

Please let me know if there is any way that we may further assist you.

MIKE
