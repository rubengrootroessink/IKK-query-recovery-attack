Looks like the changes are relatively minor, but I feel better!

Attached is the "term sheet" with some suggested revisions (identified by
strikethrough and underlining).  We suggest that you simply call the "late
charges" interest rather than any other term.  This type of business
transaction is exempt from the usury statute in terms of any maximum rate
and thus it is best to make it clear that the late charge is "interest"
rather than something else.  The other changes I made were merely to
clarify the method of calculating the interest on overdue amounts.  I note
the the contract you provided does include a provision for interest on
overdue invoice amounts.  Under the contract, interest is the Citibank
prime rate.  I assume you will set this term sheet up as an amendment to
the agreement.
