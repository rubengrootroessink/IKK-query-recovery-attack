JD approved referral of this to Keffer et al.

Fred is anxious to get something to the counterparty - his preference is 
yesterday.  I would think that a discussion with Fred about the deal might be 
in order today, even if by phone.  What is your availability?  John/Carolyn, 
have you had a chance to review the draft I sent you, and do you have any 
notions about how to structure this deal?  Is the format ok?  Can we  make it 
more seller friendly without being ridiculous?

When the initial draft is ready, it will need to go to Matt Gockerman (ENA 
Tax) and Herman Manis (structuring accountant).

Ciao,
