Subject: InterGen Guaranty Agreements

Kay:

I have just received from John Jones one executed original of each of four
InterGen Guaranty Agreements.  Please advise of handling instructions. 

Also, with regard to the form of disbursement instruction letter prepared by
Lari Paradee, I have advised her that the disbursement instruction letter
should not provide for execution by InterGen, but should instead provide for
joint execution by both ENA and SEL.
