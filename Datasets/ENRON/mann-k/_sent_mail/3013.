Hi Charlotte,

I'm not sure what we are doing at Thanksgiving, but at the most we might go 
to Palacios, which means that we would be gone no  more than Thursday and 
maybe Friday night.  I haven't talked to Paige about her schedule yet, but I 
know we need to get organized. Also, I think Michael is out of school that 
Wednesday.  Again, I need to check.  More to come.

As for tomorrow (BOO), we forgot to watch for sundown.  I know, that is hard 
to believe.  We will update tomorrow!

Kay

Subject: Michael

   As usual, Michael was a delight.  We want to see Beauty and the
Beast on Ice.  It's on November 22-26.  Let me know if the family is going
to be out of town and if not, what date would be best.  I assume Michael is
out of school Thursday-Sunday, but don't know.  I would love to get him
interested in things like this.

   We passed U. of H., and I told him that was where Mom went to school
to learn to be a lawyer.  He informed me that he was not going to be a
lawyer.  When I asked him what he did want to be, he said, "a boss so I can
tell everybody what to do."  I explained that you could not be a boss
directly out of college, but he was firm.  That's what he wants.

   He's funny watching videos.  I would try to sneak in reading a book
or looking over something, but he was emphatic.  He wanted me to "watch the
video at the same time he did so we could talk about things as they
happened."

   Let me know about Beauty and the Beast.  See you tonight to trick or
treat.
