These guys are driving me nuts.  I assumed they could take the technical 
specs from the existing master agreement and recreate it for the breakout 
contract.  Apparently not.  Could you send me, or tell me who I could get to 
send me, the exhibits to the previous master agreement, so I can show them 
what we  need, for basis conditions, scope of work, purchase price, etc.  
Thanks,

I am not sure what you are asking for both maybe the scope of work.  I 
believe the scope should simply be six combustion turbines complete with 
spring option and four exhaust  STACKS.  The water injection skids were 
options also.  I am on vacation but please call me at 936-399-4831 as son as 
you receive this.
