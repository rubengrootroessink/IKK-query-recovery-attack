We had a wonderful, quiet weekend. The wine was very good.  I drank it 
without food, as it was nice and light, which is how I like my reds.  It 
would have been good with a tomato based pasta, I think.

How do I find out how much vacation I have?  I know there's a system on the 
intranet.  I want to plan some time off this year, if possible.  I know how 
difficult it can get the longer I wait.

Thursday I won't be in until around noon. More Michael stuff.
