No one is signing for CA Development today.

Ben or someone from the commercial team initials, not legal.  I just initial 
the signature.

Subject: Quick Question(s)

1. Who is going to sign for CA Energy Development II, LLC and for ENA?

2. Do you want to initial all of the pages of the Facility Agreement?

Also, I need you to initial the docs where Enron is signing.

Please let me know about 1 & 2.

Kathleen
