Subject: GE Facility Agreement

I reviewed the GE Facility Agreement for CA Dev I and CA Dev II.

Section 6.1.2 of each Facility Agreement references the $1,829,000 payment 
which is required to be made on each turbine on or before 1/15/01.  This 
amount ties exactly to the amount shown in the most recent payoff calculation 
from Global Finance ($1,759,000 progress payment and $70,000 change order).

I am currently revising the Exhibits (1, 2a, 2b) for the Notice of excercise 
and the Bill of Sale to show the Purchase Amounts that correspond to the 
TurboPark payoff numbers.  I will forward those Exhibits to you shortly.

Fred
