Hi there,

I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.  I'm fairly confident 
that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement, but he hasn't called 
me back today to confirm.

Ms. Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail.  Could one of you return her call 
for me?  I'm tied up.  You might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a 
call.  I'm booked until around 130 for anything which would last more than a 
few minutes.  I'll check with Ben.

Thank you,

Kay
