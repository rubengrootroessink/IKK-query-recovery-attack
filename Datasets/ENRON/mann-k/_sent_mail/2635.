Am I begging too much?

Can you mail her package tomorrow?  I meant to ask today, but I got home so 
late I didn't get things together.  I put one of Michael's airplane pictures 
in there.

If all else fails we can take Michael to Fort Worth.  My mom would love to 
watch him as she wants him to be exposed to Fort Worth culture.  (a better 
grade of  bean dip).

I'm very excited!!!!

Love,

Kay

Hi,

You must be busy these days.  I remember this time of year - and I don't 
really miss it.  Cleaning and exercising were my favorite procrastination 
activities.

Neil and I would like to schedule a brief Neil and Kay vacation over the 
holidays.  We are looking at December 27-30, so we would be back before New 
Year's Eve.  We will pay you handsomely (in cash!!!) for keeping Michael for 
those days/nights.  What do you think?  We have found a room at the Inn Above 
Onion Creek.  I know Michael would be so excited to spend the time with you. 
We can give you guys a generous allowance to make things easier, and you can 
drive the Lexus.

Do I sound like I'm begging yet?  I'm working really hard these days, and a 
few days of no responsibilities sounds GREAT.  

You should start watching your box at the end of the week.  Hope it gets 
there before Saturday, since I know the SU post office is closed.

Love,

Mom
