I need to finish up an agreement and have it sent to a man by the name of 
John "Steinbow". Please call him and get the correct spelling of his name, 
his address and his fax number.  If he (or his assistant) needs an 
explanation, I need the info to complete an agreement requested by Mark 
Bernstein.  (Mark doesn't have the info, but doesn't want John to know he 
doesn't have it, so please don't call Mark to ask.)

Steinbow's number is 914 697 2418.

Thanks!

Kay
