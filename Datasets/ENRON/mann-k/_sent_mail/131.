Kay:

The Escrow Agreement that is attached appears to be in final form and
contains all of the changes that we requested.  As a result, will you
overnight the sig pages and the incumbency certificate to Tremaine Wright?
If you prefer, you can courier the documents to my attention, and I can
coordinate getting them to Paul Hastings.  Tremaine needs 3 sig pages and 1
incumbency certificate.  Thanks.

Regards,

Marisa
