I think you'd better stick close to home and smile when she gets back.

I can't do it that week. I'm on travel black out because my wife is going 
away for the week and I have the home duty (first time she's ever done this 
in 6 years so I probably need to let her go - as if I had any say!).

How about something the following week?

Ben

Hi Ben,

How's about the Acccounting/Finance presentation at noon on May 23rd, then we 
can all go to the Astros' game at 305?
