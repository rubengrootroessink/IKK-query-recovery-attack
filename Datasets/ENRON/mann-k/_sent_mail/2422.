I had a really big lunch, even cake, so now eating out of the fridge (if at 
all) sounds ok.  I got a really nice bottle of white wine from Andrews & 
Kurth.  I put it by the window to cool off. 

I've worked with three trial lawyers from K & S, and they are really good.  
However, K & S represents American Express.  Keffer tells me that you used a 
guy at Bracewell that you liked, and that this person has now started their 
own firm.  John drew a blank on the name, but will call me back with the name 
and number.  

Enron also likes Gibbs & Bruin, a litigation boutique in Houston. I believe 
the main contact's name is Robin Gibbs, but that is also the name of one of 
the Bee Gee's, so I could be wrong.  Can you check the internet and see?  If 
not, I will look in a minute.

Love,

Kay
