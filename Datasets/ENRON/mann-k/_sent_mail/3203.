Per your request.

Is the contract supposed to be an off balance sheet contract?  I'm supposed 
to be working on the changes necessary to make this one 97-10 compliant, but 
I haven't done it yet.  Maybe you will beat me to it, which is fine by me.

Here's the next to last iteration of the form contract before we christen
it officially "FORM 2000 - Rev. 00",clean and compared. John R will need to
take this, diddle with it,  and use the product PDQ for a couple of crisis
applications, but before it becomed and gets advertized as "Form 2000" I
woanted to collect  last comments from you guys and get some fine tuning
from  our litigation mangers  onthe arbitration and dispute resoluton
materials, which is to be on my desk by the end of the day.
Because of Johnnie's urgencies, I did not have the chance to pretty up
format and section and page numbers, please forgive. We will get it next
time.

You guys also have the un-revised draft exhibits. I think Rigby was to
revise to try and revise them to fit  the form - I await the draft exhibits
withbaited breath.

Please collect your thoughts and we we schedule a time to get tehm in.

Angie, please print both attachemenst and this e-mail for me.
