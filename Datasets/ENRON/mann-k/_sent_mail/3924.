Hi Rusty,

Here's my only comment, which I sent directly to Karen.

Karen,

I have in hand the Ledford agreement.  My only comment is that on its face it 
does not appear to limit the Ledford's to the relief described (no 
sole/exclusive remedy clause).  Does that occur by operation of law in 
Illinois?

Thank you for your assistance.

Kay
