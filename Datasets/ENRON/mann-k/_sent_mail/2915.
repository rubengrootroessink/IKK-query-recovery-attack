Do you have a copy of an itinerary for me or have you already sent it?  I'll 
print this as soon as Dan's job is finished.  I'll take care of the rest.

Please print the attached on letterhead.

I'm leaving for Connecticut shortly, and will be back in the office on 
Thursday (or so I exepct).  Please handle the following

Call David Runnels at A & K and tell him thanks, but I can't use the opera 
tickets this weekend.

Cancel my RSVP for Carrin Patman's lunch tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay
