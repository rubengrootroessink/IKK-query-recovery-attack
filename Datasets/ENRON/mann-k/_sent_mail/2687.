I'm not usually a Galveston person, but it might be worth considering in 
December.  Might be best with Michael, though, so we could go to Moody 
Gardens and the Strand.  What I don't like about Galveston is the water 
(duh).  The San Luis is set up for kids, and has a neat view.

Guess I have itchy feet.  I haven't be on the road in a couple of weeks!  All 
I see at the house is responsibility, and we never do anything anyway.

Any ideas?
