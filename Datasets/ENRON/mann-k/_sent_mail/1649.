		?EDMUNDS' REVIEW
		
		Nissan's hardy Pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a 
new path to the premium outlet center. Though the exterior may exude that 
tough-guy outdoorsy image, the interior has always been comfortable enough 
for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty. 
Though the old 3.3-liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end 
grunt, the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked 
against newer competitors. 
		So revel, all you who seek liberation from urban ennui -- the Pathfinder is 
finally energized by a stouter V6, based on the Maxima sedan's stellar 
powerplant. When mated to a five-speed manual transmission, the 3.5-liter, 
DOHC V6 engine produces a mighty 250 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of 
torque. Matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 10 ponies but add 25 
foot-pounds of twist, still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go 
mountain climbing, as well as merge onto freeways without fear. 
		The Pathfinder comes with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive, the 
latter of which provides a shift-on-the-fly transfer case that can be engaged 
at speeds up to 50 mph. On LE models, an automatic All-Mode four-wheel-drive 
system can be specified for 2001, giving you one more reason to skip paying 
the extra tariff the Infiniti QX4 commands. All-Mode operates in 2WD, 
automatic 4WD, 4WD-Hi and 4WD-Lo, all selected using a simple rotary knob on 
the dashboard. 
		We've long admired the Pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling, 
further enhanced by solid unibody construction. The interior, one of the 
friendliest of any SUV on the market, is spruced up for 2001 with an updated 
instrument panel. A new dual level center console with a padded armrest and 
12-volt power source will organize all your gewgaws. 
		You can choose from three trim levels -- the XE, which for the 2001 model 
year comes with standard power windows, mirrors and locks, and a security 
system; the sporty SE, which gives you a choice of automatic or manual 
transmission along with sporty trim; and the top-of-the-line LE, which 
includes fog lights, Bose audio system, and fake wood accents. 
		All models come standard with 16-inch wheels, full-size spare tire, a CD 
player and ABS. Side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in 
leather-wrapped seating, which is available only on SE and LE. Those same 
models, when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic 
transmission, can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system, which 
includes a 6.4-inch flip-down LCD screen, video player, and ports to plug and 
play a PlayStation 2 (And we all know how important that will be after 
Christmas, don't we?). A "Birdview" navigation system, shared with the 
Infiniti QX4, is also available, but we don't recommend it. While the 
"Birdview" perspective is interesting, teensy, tiny, little, itty-bitty 
buttons control the thing, along with some of the climate control functions. 
Get a map. 
		Items that remain static from last year include a substantial maximum cargo 
carrying capacity of 85 cubic feet (surprising for what appears to be a 
relatively small vehicle). Some of this space, in our humble opinion, should 
have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations. 
		Despite a few quibbles, we're thrilled that Nissan finally rectified the 
Pathfinder's main problem -- horsepower. With this updated, competitive 
package, we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of 
the Dodo.
