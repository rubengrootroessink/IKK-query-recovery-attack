Did you ask Lee for a finance contact?  I can't remember.

Kay:

Greg Lang called this morning to request financial statements from GE
Packaged Power, Inc.   

FYI - I have spoken with Estelle Lawrence, our contact at Citibank, and she
advises that the process must start with one of their sales representatives.
A sales rep will call me back to get an understanding of the transaction and
provide an estimate of the required fees.  I will let you know.
