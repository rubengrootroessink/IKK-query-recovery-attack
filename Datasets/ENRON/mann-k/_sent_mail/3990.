Kay,

Attached is the final draft of the Two-Train Contract for the Pastoria
Project.  The parties have agreed in a side letter to complete the contract
for the third train (which should be nearly identical) by July 31, 2000.

The execution copies of the Two-Train Contract were signed by GE and
returned to me today and should be on their way to West LB tomorrow for
execution.

There were two changes to the Two-Train Contract that were hand marked by GE
on the execution copies and are not reflected in the attached electronic
copy.  Both are minor.  The first is that in the Notice provision (Article
XXV) the name, telephone number and and fax number for the GE contact person
is crossed out with an indication that the person will be named at the Order
Definition Meeting.  The second is that the Xonon Technoloy was excepted out
of Section 30.12(f), which is the provision stating that the equipment sold
by GE under the contract is of the same type, model etc. sold to other GE
customers and has no demonstrated trends of failure.

Please call me with any additional questions.

-Erica
