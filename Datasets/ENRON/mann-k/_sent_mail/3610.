For future reference, Brian Barto does not participate in these calls.  No 
need to retract the invite at this point.

Subject: Time Change for Weekly GE Conference Call

The time has changed for the weekly GE Conference call from 9:30 a.m. CT to 
1:30 CT starting tomorrow, September 6, 2000.  The dial in numbers and codes 
will remain the same.

Dial In:  1-888-285-4585
Host:  121970 (Kay Mann)
Participant: 536220

We usually have seven ports, but tomorrow there are only six ports 
available.  I didn't think it would be a problem since several of you are in 
the same area and could go in one office.  In the future, we will have our 
seven ports.  Thanks, Suzanne (x37340)
