kay - believe me, i understand.  plz also understand that ben's lastest 
guidance to the team (see my last email) was for me, chris booth, and you to 
meet with outside counsel to assess/divine the strength of our "case" with 
respect to siemens-westinghouse.  again, plz see my last email on guidance 
received from ben.  per your note, both chris and i are prepared to meet with 
you next week to start/continue the process.  since you have outside counsel 
covered, then we are good to go.  your thoughts?  are you available next 
week?  plz understand that i am not trying to infringe on your turf.  
regards.  scott.

Scott,

I'm handling outside counsel, and spoke with him this week.  I'm prepared to 
give legal advice on the issue.
