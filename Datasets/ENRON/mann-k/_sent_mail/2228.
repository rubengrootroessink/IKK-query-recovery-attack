Subject: RE: Invoice Language

All, 
I need to apply for a Texas sales and use tax permit for CAED I and II very 
soon.  Who has the current corporate data on these LLC entities (such as 
business address, names of managing officers and directors (i.e., persons 
authorized to execute documents on behalf of the LLC's), and the federal EIN 
numbers)?  Also, have these entities registered to do business in Texas?  
Anyone, please help if you can.  Thanks!

Carolyn, 
In addition to the invoice change, the periods should be removed from 
"LLC" on the cover page, in the first paragraph of the first page, in 
Section 1.78 and on the signature page of each Facility Agreement.  The 
change relating to invoices is that the address of the invoices in 
Section 6.7.2  should be as follows for one of the Facility Agreements: 
CA Energy Development I, LLC 
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P. 
c/o InterGen North America L.P. 
909 Fannin, Suite 2200 
Houston, Texas 77010 
Attention: John Jones 
Fax: (713) 374-3901 
and as follows for the other: 
CA Energy Development II, LLC 
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P. 
c/o InterGen North America L.P. 
909 Fannin, Suite 2200 
Houston, Texas 77010 
Attention: John Jones 
Fax: (713) 374-3901 
  
Thanks, 
George

Kay Mann is looking for your requested language providing that GE will 
invoice the LLC directly.  I am unable to find your request.  Can you 
please 
furnish this, as Kay intends to address this with GE today.  Thank you.
