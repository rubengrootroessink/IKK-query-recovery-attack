   This sounds good.  I would love for him to participate.  Since it
would be at Enron, I can't see any problem.  If you were out of town, I
could take him home or work it out with Neil.  Anyway, if Paige is accepted,
I would be happy to be backup.  Since the pickup is at Enron, in case of an
office emergency (which I seriously doubt), I could pick Michael up and
bring him to my office for the short time required to finish the job.  As I
said, I think this is moot, but we would have it covered from all angles.

Hi Charlotte,

We are starting to check out our options for the summer, and one of the
things we are considering is the day camp that Enron is involved with.
They pick up and deliver from the Enron building, and I was wondering if
you might consider picking Michael up from here (Enron).  I suspect most
days he could go to your place.

I have no idea if this is the direction we will go, but I thought I would
run it by you early on.  I have to think about how much travel I might
have, as it might be hard on Neil to take Michael downtown in the morning.
Paige has applied for a job at Enron, though, so if that worked out we
would be in good shape.

Here's a link.   They have some neat themes.

Have you heard of any other good day camps?  You seem to be plugged in
fairly well.

Thanks,

Kay
