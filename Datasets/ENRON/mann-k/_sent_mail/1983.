Hi Ben,

I got an opinion from outside counsel.  I'll give it a look so we can 
discuss.  I'll move it up on the list.

Kay:

We really need to get on top of the situation with the 501D5A. I believe SW 
is now taking the position that the generator was delivered under the terms 
of the contract, and risk of loss resided with us at the time of the "event". 
I furthermore understand they are taking the position that if we want a 
replacement generator, that we need to execute a change order. Kind of makes 
you feel like you're getting squeezed...

At the end of the day, we've got $25 million in a CT without a generator. ENA 
will get saddled with these costs if we do not find a resolution either 
through a buyer or a settlement with SW.

I really hope we can focus on this in the next couple of days. FYI, both 
Chris Booth and Ron Tapscott have been drafted on this effort. 

Thanks,

Ben
