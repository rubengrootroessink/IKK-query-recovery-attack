We also used CompareRite.  However, when the system swithched over the
weekend, our current tool bars no longer work with Word as presently
configured. In addition, those documents that had automated headings.
etc. now are incompatible with the new versions.  We are having an
outside vendor try to clean the documents up so that they will be
compatible and Houston IT is working on fixing our tool bars.

I've found CompareRite to work with long documents.  Plus, these
documents
started out as WordPerfect documents and were converted to Word, which I
think creates problems with Word comparisons.  I figure it is a Gates
conspiracy...

Here it is as a Word file, just in case:
