Hi there,

I think a good next step while the counterparties are reviewing the docs is 
the creation of a closing checklist, since we have a good starting point with 
the Intergen closing list.  We can get organized on putting together a 
package of the next traunche of docs, such as the parent guaranty, escrow 
agreement, etc. 

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  You might want to check the docs I sent out to Jake to make sure I 
didn't put a Panda in a Delta doc.  I checked, but I need to be double 
checked.  Another good reason to use XYZ's until the finalist is selected.
