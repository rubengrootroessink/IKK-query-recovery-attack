Cory,

Please see comments in attached file.  I changed the date to July 14th
assuming we can sign on this date.

 <<agree_6_13_00.doc>>    <<TsCs_6_28_00.doc>>      <<pricing_06_23_00.xls>>

I'm hoping you can rewrite these files incorporating these comments as well
as Shelly's comment below and Mike Neuman's comment from his 6/28 email
copied below.

Parent Guarantee-We feel the dollar amount for the parent guarantee should
be raised from $33Mill to $37mill to allow us some room in case of change
orders.  In any event, the Contract Price is approximately $35mill.

Thanks,
Jon

          Jon and I met with East Coast Power this morning to discuss
the contribution by El Paso of the GE Turbine for the Linden 7 Site.  The
assignment clause in the GE Terms and Conditions currently permits the
assignment by the buyer to an affiliate without GE's consent. The word
affiliate is not defined but we should be able to take the position, as a
49% equity owner in East Coast Power, that it is an El Paso affiliate.  I
would recommend that to clarify, we include the following clause after the
word affiliate in the Assignment Section: (including but not limited to East
Coast Power L.L.C.).  Andrew, Bob and Coralyn, pls advise if you would like
to take a different approach. I also expect that we will have a credit issue
when the Contract is assigned to ECP as GE is now, I believe, getting an El
Paso Energy Corp. Guaranty. According to Bob Licato at ECP, GE accepted an
ECP assignment without an Enron guaranty on Linden 6 due in part to the
presence of GECC as a lender/equity participant in ECP. We can discuss this
with GE when we inform them of the planned assignment to ECP.  Finally, I
would advise that when we get GE to sign a letter accepting the assignment,
we confirm that the GE warranties flow to ECP.
