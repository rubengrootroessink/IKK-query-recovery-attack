Hi Dale,

I thought I'd send this along.  It is the first draft of the "break out" 
contract for the ABB transformers which go with the LM's.  I thought Sheila 
told me that your stuff is in immediate need to getting this and the LM break 
out in shape.  This has not been reviewed with ABB yet (in fact, I haven't 
read it yet), but just in case you want to give it a look, I thought I would 
pass it along.

Kay
