Works for me.  We are leaving to check in to the hotel, then back.  I had to 
cancel manicure/pedicure ( and charged for it)  A hint that a gift 
certificate for same would work might be appropriate.

Jacoby's assistant just called and wanted your home address.  Apparently Ben 
is going to send you something or someone (manicurist/pedicurist) to your 
home.  I told her you liked champagne too if he wanted to get you a beverage 
and also that you would be leaving to go celebrate your daughter's birthday a 
little later this afternoon.  I didn't want them sending out someone and you 
not be there.  I can see you now with the phone in one hand and a manicurist 
on the other or better yet, a glass of bubbly!
