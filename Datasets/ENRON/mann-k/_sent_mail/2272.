No one has said anything to me about closing next week.  Lee Johnson is on 
vacation next week also, so GE won't be around.

Do we have the anticipated closing date for the LV Cogen deal?  I wasn't
planning on returning to the office until January 3.

EECC may have this.  Can you check with whoever your team is working
with,
or do you want a copy job of what was in the master agreement?

Exhibit B-1 was not in the electronic version of the West LB Agreement.
Do you have an electronic version of this?  If not, can we get a copy
from Lee?

For Las Vegas the West LB exhibit is the appropriate Exhibit.

For the Enron South America and CA Development deals, we have used the
attached Exhibit B-1 (with all changes accepted).  Should this also be
used for the other deals as well or should we use the B-1 from the West
LB Agreement?

Kay,

I had a copy of the last redline for Exhibit B-1.  Don't have execution
copy.

On Exhibit h-2, Training -- I'll look for it, but think Kathy had it
last to
identify it as H-2.

Thanks,

Lee

Lee (and others),

Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic
version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless
there is some reason to handle it otherwise.

Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do
you
have more copies of that document that we can attach?

Kay

Folks,

John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for
the
ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on
Guarantee
Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change
to
the Emissions Test Exhibit.

John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2,
this
is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
circulation.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect
scope
of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit
liability
amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads,
guaranteed
delivery schedule for purchased options.

This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire
contract
document.


Regards,

Lee

Kay,

I edited the Termination Schedule replacing the term Purchase Amount per
unit to Unit Liability Amount for consistency with the new structure.

This is the most recent draft of the exhibits.

The following items need to be added to complete the exhibits:

1.   Exhibits B-1 and H-2 need to be added.

2.   If one is warranted, a Seller Parent Guarantee should be
included as Exhibit C-1.

3.   Does Exhibit F need to be updated and revised before signing?

4.   In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5.   For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all
documents that it should have received by now.
