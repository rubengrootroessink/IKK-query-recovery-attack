Good.  I'm ready to get at least one thing off the "to do" list.

Stamp of approval.  Mike J. Miller is the right guy from ENA to sign.  Please 
let me know if you have any trouble getting a signature from any of the 
parties.

Thanks,

Mitch

Gentlemen,

I've revised paragraph 5 to reflect our discussion.  Also, I made a change
to paragraph 7 to include technical bulletins per Mitch's request which we
did not discuss on our call.

(See attached file: WestinghouseProposal to Resolve Issues on Enron - Dec10
SWPC.doc)

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Kay
