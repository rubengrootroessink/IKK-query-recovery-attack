Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement an=

supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new=20
iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable=

process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of recei=
pt=20
and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issu=
e=20
resolution.=20

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the wa=
y=20
you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these change=
s=20
will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit=20

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?
Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the=20
purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your=
=20
responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for=20
non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you=
=20
should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.=

What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and=

services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  Yo=
