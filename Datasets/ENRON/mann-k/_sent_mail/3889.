Both of those sound pretty good.

Paige is so excited.  She got a $1000 pay check.

Hi.

I'm kinda tired this morning.  I guess I just need a bit more sleep.

Michael tried to push the envelope this am.  He wanted to eat some more
after he had brushed his teeth (I told him breakfast was over, so no more
food) and wanted to go back in to get a toy to take (nope).  He handled the
frustration ok.

Do we have anything planned this weekend?

Ta ta for now,

ckm
