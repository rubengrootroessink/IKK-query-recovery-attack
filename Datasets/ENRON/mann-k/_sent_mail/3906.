Hi Kay,

The menu is as follows:

Appetizer                          Mocambo Shrimp
Salad                                Smoked Trout on Baby Spring Greens with
fresh                                                             lemon
vinegarette
Sorbet                                Mango
Entree                                Filet Mignon (will be cooked medium

otherwise advised)
                                            Duchess Potatoes
                                            Honey-Glazed Carrots

This is what I wrote down when you and I discussed the menu.   We will put a
candle on your father's dessert and I will play "Happy Birthday" while the
family sings.

We are looking forward to having you back again.  If there are any changes,
let me know.
