I thought I recalled you suggesting that changes we used on the LM 6000 deal 
be incorporated into a "master".  Maybe I misunderstood (not the first 
time!!!)

I don't know for sure but Kathy may be the better person to respond.

I haven't seen it.

Is there a master contract that Kathy (or someone) has been collecting

I was under the impression that GE was to put together a written list of 
their specific concerns that we could review prior to any meeting.  Status?

Have you had any further discussions with John Schroeder about dates and 
agendas?  If not should we call him together?  I have most recently been 
blindsided by BlueDog and I think we need to get this show on the road.
