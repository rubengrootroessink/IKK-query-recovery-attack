Good morning.

I didn't wake Paige up this am.  I told Michael he could wake her up when he 
wanted to, which I presume didn't take long.

It feels good to be back.  Last week really wasn't a very good week to take 
off, and I was really stressed. It helps knowing that I have a holiday in two 
weeks!  I'm glad, since Michael is off then as well.

Did you make friends with your venison (or was is pork)?

Love,

Kay
