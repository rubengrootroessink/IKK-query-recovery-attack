I have a change in plans next week.  My dad is having surgery in Ft. Worth, 
so I will be heading that way on Monday.  I was planning to be on vacation 
anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft. Worth which I 
would not have had otherwise.  I will manage client expectations accordingly.
