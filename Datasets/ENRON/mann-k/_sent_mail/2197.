Opps.  We do have to pay for the account.  I was afraid we were going to send 
the big hunk of dough!

I thought we had to wire $12,000 (give or take a little) somewhere.

WHOA.  We are not wiring money, we are receiving money.  This should occur 
either Jan 12 or 15.

Minor detail.

Citibank just confirmed that they will also accept faxed signatures on the 
Escrow Agreement.  Have you approved it yet?  If so, and we let accounting 
know to wire the funds to Citibank before 2:00, we can get the $ in the 
Escrow Account by tomorrow.  Otherwise, the funds will not get there until 
Friday.
