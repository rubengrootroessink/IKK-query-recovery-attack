I have forwarded this email to Kay Mann and Peggy Banczak, whom I believe 
have the information you are requesting.  I expect you will hear from them 
shortly.

Brian,
I work with Jeff Smith in GE Power Systems commercial finance for the Mexico
region. Can you provide me the name/phone of a finance contact in Enron who
can provide the bank address, account number, etc. for Enron, in order for
GE to issue the $25MM refund to Enron (under the termination agreement dated
June 22nd)? Thanks.
