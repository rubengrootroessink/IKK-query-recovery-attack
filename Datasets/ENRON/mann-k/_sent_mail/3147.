Kay,  Attached is the TECO contract and the blank form of EPC and Exhibits I
believe ENA has used in the past.  None have stood the test of financing (at
least since NEPCO has been doing ENA work).

Karen Jones called me on the same subject so I am emailing her a copy as
well.  I'm flexible in regard to making these documents more compatible with
lender requirements.  Let me know if I can help.
