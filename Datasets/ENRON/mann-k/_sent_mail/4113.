Stan,

I have one minor question.  

Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days following 
y event? 

I would expect to see language along the lines of "If notice to proceed is 
not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then...".  I see the 
deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of this 
EPC different terminology is used.

Kay
