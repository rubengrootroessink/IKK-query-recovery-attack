Sounds good to me, although we are likely to find different purchasers want 
other stuff as well.  Kinda like on the turbine stuff - each counterparty has 
wanted something different.

A letter whereby a party agrees that in the event of a change of control of 
its counterparty, it will not use such change of control event as a basis for 
challenging the enforceability of the agreement that it has with the 
counterparty.  At least in our context this is what Fred means by estoppel 
letter.  He has a very good point that we should incorporate this concept 
into our further assurances clause in our option agreements.
