No surprises with CW.  She's very nice to me, but she does like to keep very 
specific hours.  I get the impression that leaving 15 minutes past 5 really 
bothers her.  Just watch, and see.

She told you she'd be there, but she didn't know where to go.  I get a bit of 
attitude here  Didn't you say she was no nonsense.  Oh, and get this, Mary 
Cook has asked if Chaundra has made up the list for assistants willing to 
work overtime for her yet.  Apparently, Chaundra won't do the OT.  I only do 
OT for my people, and I can't believe she doesn't have a better work ethic.  
Meow!!!!
