Subject: SW501D5A - Montana Power

I spoke to Tom Loberg of Montana Power today regarding the status of our 
discussions on the D5A. He advised me that part of their merger deal with 
Northwestern Corp required that projects such as the one contemplated for the 
D5A required the approval of Northwestern's board. Montana presented the 
project to Northwestern's board today, but the board declined to grant such 
approval. Tom declined to provide me any further insight.

We will of course immediately begin to pursue other sales opportunities for 
this turbine. FYI, our exclusivity agreement with Northwestern expires 
tomorrow.

Regards,

Ben
