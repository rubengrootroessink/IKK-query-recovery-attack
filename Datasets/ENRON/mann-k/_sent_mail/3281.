Everything went fine.  I hope Dan is ok.  Did the antibiotics not work?  I 
know he has been worried, but I thought he was feeling better. Now I'm 
worried.

How old would you mother have been today?

I was wondering about Karen.  I wasn't sure what her title was before.  

I haven't checked voice mail yet.  Heather called on my cell phone, which was 
fine.  

I hear the Mark (NYC) is VERY nice.  I hope to get back earlier than 600 on 
Friday, but not early enough to come in.  I'll figure it out tomorrow.

Ciao,

Kay
