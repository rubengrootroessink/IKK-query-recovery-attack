When do you want to go?  The weather should be getting nice later this week, 
and I need to gush about the IAOC.

Kay,

Since we can't seem to connect on the phone (a bit busy, are we?) I wanted 
you to know I forwarded Paige's resume to the recruiting people.  They will 
not start summer internship recruiting until late January/early Feb., so I'll 
check back with them in a few weeks.

Take care.  When are we going out for drinks?

Heather
