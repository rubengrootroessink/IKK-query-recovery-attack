Good morning!
Boy, it's been non stop since I walked in. Someone broke into Brett's and
Stephen's offices last night. They trashed a lot of offices and stole small
amounts of cash from some employees desks. Nothing really big taken. There
were several laptops out and they found the keys to several cars but left
all of it alone. One of the cars was Nancy Bs new suburban. Doesn't make
sense...

Michael is very concerned about Bronco and that Charlotte won't be able to
find him tonight when they get home.  He is really taken with Bronco...

Gota go.
