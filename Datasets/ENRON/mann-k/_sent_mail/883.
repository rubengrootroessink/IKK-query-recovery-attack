some comments

A.  1st sentence --Remove "a" before dual fuel.  Change delivers to deliver
"Costs"  (xi)  Add "SPP or" before "Serc-imposed
"Protocols"  I don't think there are SERC Protocols (this may be from ERCOT 
agreement).
"Serc ISO"  There is not such thing yet.
"SPP"  Add "Reliability" after Electric
