I know you don't have enough to do...

I can't access the press release part of the Enron intranet site.  There is a 
blurb that appears at the bottom of all Enron press releases, which is one of 
those Enron is a leading blah blah blah.  If you can easily find that blub, 
would you mind forwarding it?  

Sorry for asking.

Thank you again for participating in our Roundtable discussion.  Everyone
was very pleased at the way the discussion went.  As I mentioned earlier,
the Texas Lawyer will publish a brief description of your bio and your
company. Please e-mail me what you would like written about your company.
If you could get it to me by the end of Tuesday, that would be great.
Thanks.
