	FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards
Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM	?Mail this article to a friend 
	DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2000-- 
	New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants 
	FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of 
contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R) 
(DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract 
is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and 
operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison 
Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for 
$100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in 
Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using 
methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter 
of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA. 
	Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions 
	FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction 
project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using 
coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs 
for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell 
Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing 
emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced 
by using a fuel that is essentially free. 
	"The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two 
decades," said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL. "This 
application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power 
generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions." 
	According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions 
from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with 
coal mining operations. A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell 
power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources. The 
U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane 
capacity. At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for 
FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion 
market. 
	"The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in 
benefits for all concerned," said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of 
FuelCell Energy. "Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be 
remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a 
liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces 
electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important 
milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets. 
The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate 
the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users." 
	Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End 
	The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell 
Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape 
Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell 
capabilities at remote sites. The Coast Guard operates several hundred 
unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio 
navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as 
lighthouses, structures, and buoys. Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer 
efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation. The 
methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell 
Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources. 
	"This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of 
fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment", said Walt 
Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development 
Center. "We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its 
promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other 
systems." 
	"In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are 
other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such 
as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other 
communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells," 
said Leitman. 
	Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high 
efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through 
combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of 
producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less 
noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process. 
	About FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
	FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a 
leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power 
generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel 
processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a 
product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and 
reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation. 
FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power 
plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW.. The Company has been 
developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S. 
Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory 
(NETL). The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on 
developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate 
clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the 
customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and 
industrial applications.
