I don't really like the organization of it much.  I think things need to be 
moved around and re-organized.

Kay,

I have gone through the first 37 pgs and landed on the Energy Mgmt Svcs Agmt 
when it occured to me that I really could use an education on the contract 
structure.  So I am backing up to outline the doc(s) to see how everything 
fits.  Call me when you get a few minutes...I need a lesson.

Thanks,

Reagan

Well, don't get too excited until you read it.  There's lots of stuff I just 
had to put place holders on, but we'll get it all filled in.

Here's a starting point.  I've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like 
this [ ], but I'm sure there are more questions than [ ]s.  I'm really 
unclear on the financial aspect of the deal.

Reagan, I didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in, as I thought it was 
better to get the doc in your hands (and Mr. Fairley's) for a detailed review.

Kay
