Do you know if we had TECO sign a confidentiality agreement?

Who is the counterparty to the participation agreement?  I thought we were 
just sending out  the public documents.

Thanks,

Kay

Just so you know, Ben and Fred have provided copies of the Participation 
Agreement and Option to Lease between us and Fort Pierce Utilities Authority 
to TECO.  Both documents contain "Confidentiality Clauses".
