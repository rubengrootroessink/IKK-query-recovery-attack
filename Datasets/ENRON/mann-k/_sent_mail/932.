my printer just froze, and I want to look at the doc to finish the 
reorganization.  Could you pretty please fax me the first 14 pages (I have 
the last).  Also, could you look at the stuff I've highlighted in yellow.  

I haven't put all your comments in, but I will in a minute.  Don't get 
discouraged, the draft is closer to finished than it looks, it is just the 
changes are in my head.  It won't take too terribly long now.

I've set up the exhibits as a separate document to make it easier to move 
around the doc.

I think it would be kind of strange to send a draft without the most basic of 
commercial terms included.  Stranger things have happened of course!

Many thanks.

Kay
