Hi guys,

I want to make sure that you are comfortable with whatever services are being 
provided by Piper Rudnick, so that there won't be any surprises when the bill 
comes in.  Could you give me a brief outline of their scope?  

Thanks,

Kay

Mason Hall,  Livingston County Coordinator, has confirmed that the County
Agriculture and Zoning Committee, other key County officials and staff would
like to join us for a tour of the Lincoln Energy Center on August 22, 2000.
Current plan is for a bus to pick up participants in Pontiac at 10 a.m. and
to  return by approximately 2:30 to 3:00.  Lunch will be served at the site.
Mason anticipates approximately 15 to 20 participants.  We are also planning
to invite certain Township and City of Pontiac officials and should consider
other potential invitees including neighbors and other politicians.
