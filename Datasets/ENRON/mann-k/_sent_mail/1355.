I would want to make sure that the structure of the deal goes through 
Herman.  There may be a tweak or a change which can have an impact on what 
gets booked on mark to market basis, etc.  He may have absolutely nothing to 
add, but I wouldn't take the chance.

Will do.  Should I forward the assignment agreement to Herman (it's just a 
boilerplate assignment and assumption agreement between two affiliates?)  Of 
course, after I talk with Fred, it makes sense to speak with Herman and Matt, 
but it doesn't seem to make sense before then.  Let me know if you think 
otherwise.

Don't forget that Herman reads everything, and to ask Fred if this deal will 
be DASH'ed.  (I don't know if it should, but probably so.)
