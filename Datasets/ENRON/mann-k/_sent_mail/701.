Hi Kay,
 
I wanted to follow up with you and let you know I have confirmed reservations 
for you, Heather and Anne.  Group rates apply to six or more so there is a 
possiblity that the rates will change if they other three guests do not 
confirm reservations.
 
 Please contact me if you have any questions.  I'm looking forward to meeting 
you.
 
Have a great day,
Cindy Viator
