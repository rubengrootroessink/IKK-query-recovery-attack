Hi Rob,

I think we would prefer if you would route the document back this way, and 
Sheila or I will send it to the folks at GE.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: GE - Form Purchase Agreement

All - Attached is a rewrite of Articles 20 (Indemnity) and 27 (Limitation of 
Liability) of the draft agreement which includes our collective thoughts.  

Rob - I understand that you "volunteered" to pull together our changes to the 
draft agreement and to then forward on to GE.  

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks.

Scott
