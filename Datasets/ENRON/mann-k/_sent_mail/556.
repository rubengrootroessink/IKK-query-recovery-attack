Subject: ENA/PPL Escrow Agreement


Estelle and Barbara:

PPL's lenders have requested two items relating to the escrow prior to
funding:

1.  Fax copy of the Escrow Agreement signed by Citibank; and
2.  E-mail confirmation that the escrow account has been opened.

Can you please furnish these items as early as possible on Thursday morning.
The parties intend to fund the escrow before 10:00 central time.  The money
needs to make one stop before it gets to you, so the earlier it can get
started the better.  Please furnish these items to the following
individuals:

1.  Carolyn M. Campbell (fax 713-751-3280) (ccampbell@kslaw.com)
2.  Greg Lang (fax 203-674-7646) (gregorylang@paulhastings.com)
3.  Isabel Parker (fax 212-277-4001) (iparker@freshfields.com)

Thank you.
