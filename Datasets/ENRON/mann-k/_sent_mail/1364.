And a tough crowd it is.  I'm up for it. He seems genuinely happy for you.

Yeah but how about that Memorial Office.  We should take John out for drinks 
-- not only is he inside sick watching the other kids play, but he a lot more 
kids inside with him.

Frightening roster.

I am left speechless by your kind tribute.  Of course, there is a more
cynical interpretation of your words, but surely you meant them to be read
in the most favorable light (my ego prevents me from reading it otherwise.)

I'm happy  to let everyone know that Cheryl Costa has joined our group as a
regular member. This is very timely for us, and she will be focusing on
finishing off the documentation for the Electro Bolt project as a priority
matter.

We have had to re-juggle the seating plan a little to accomodate this and
other changes, and the moves will occur this weekend.  Cheryl will be
moving into the office presently occupied by Bob Sevitz, who will be moving
into the space presently occupied by Mike Lewis.  Kristi Dobbs will be
moving into the space just outside of John Rigby's office presently
occupied by boxes. The Carlos Sole Memorial Office presently occupied by
his memory is reserved for the new attorney who will fill in for Carlos
(fill in only, of course, there can be no substitute).

I will be scheduling a meeting Friday, if not over lunch then in the early
afternoon to discuss a few minor developments with you guys and to get some
thoughts from you on the TurboPark and other off balance sheet models.
