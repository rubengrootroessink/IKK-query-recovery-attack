Allyson says we can scratch around in the dirt a bit (I'm paraphrasing), so 
I'm sure some site preparation is ok.

I'm not sure I like her availability stuff as inserted. Maybe we should leave 
some space for some wording, but not give them actual language today.  It is 
such a big issue, I hate for us to get into a box which won't work.

I'm going to check around again for the OEC stuff.  I still haven't seen 
anything.

I'll tell Nancy we will meet her in her office around 11:00.

As for meeting with Herman, should J Keenan be included as well?
