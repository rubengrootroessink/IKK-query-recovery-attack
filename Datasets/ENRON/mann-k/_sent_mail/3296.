Thank you for the heads up on the Schaeffer parcel.  Just a reminder that if
we want to use that site for a laydown parcel it may be necessary to obtain
approval from the County to do so.  After Thursday night we can discuss the
proper method of confirming this with the County.  Please keep in mind that
while a we hope to obtain approval of a motion on Thursday night, formal
approval will not occur until next month's ZBA hearing when written findings
will be adopted.

   Mark,  FYI  -  I plan to approach Mr. Schaeffer (the 28 acre tract
to the
   immediate west of the site) to option that tract as well once we get
done
   with the ZBA on Thursday (assuming it goes off without a hitch).

   We want to option that tract so it could be used as construction
laydown,
   and more importantly to control the parcel across from the plant
site.  The
   plan would be to buy the tract, but let him have rights to farming
it -
   once we're done using it for laydown.  This gives us a buffer tract
for
   sound mitigation etc. as well.

   Titan Land Development Co., L.L.C.  holds the options on the  3
properties
   in Livingston County. If  you were to acquire those properties and
develop
   the Facility it is my understanding that Titan would be the entity
that
   would be the owner of the Property and the Facility.  The proposed
   Conditions were drafted to apply to the party defined as the "Owner"
and
   not
   specifically to Titan or ENA.  Proposed Condition No. 12 provides
that:

             The Special Use approved by this ordinance and all of the
   conditions, obligations and rights provided for herein shall run
with the
   ownership of the land and the Facility.  For purposes of this
Special Use,
   "Owner" shall include the owner of the Property and the owner and/or
   operator of the Facility.

   Therefore, the conditions of the Special Use, including the
obligation to
   make the Escrow payment, should not apply to Titan until acquisition
of the
   Property or development of the Facility.  In the unlikely scenario
that
   Titan was to acquire the Property but not develop it, failure to
satisfy
   the
   Conditions should only relate to the right to use the Property for
the
   Facility.  I am working with the County to get a copy of the final
   ordinance
   or resolution (they have not completed it yet) to confirm that it is
   consistent with this proposal.

   Please let me know if I should pursue the balance sheet treatment
with your
   tax department.  If you have any questions or I can be of any
further
   assistance please let me know.

        Mark,

        I've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the Proposed
Conditions to
        Special Use for Livingston Energy Center.  Is Titan Land
Development
   the
        Owner?  Will it be necessary for Titan to make the escrow
payment
   prior to
        exercising the relevant land options and the commencement of
   construction?

        I do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the
   deposit
        would impact the balance sheet treatment, but I understand from
Fred
   that
        we are not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this
   project.

        Kay

        As you know we are scheduled to appear before the Livingston
County
   Zoning
        Board of Appeals ("ZBA") tomorrow evening for initial approval
of
   the
        Livingston Energy Center (the "Facility").  Assuming, we
receive a
   vote to
        approve the Facility, the ZBA will be approving the Conditions
of
   Approval
        of the Special Use sent out yesterday for everyone's final
approval
   and
        sign-off.   Please note that we have incorporated into these
   conditions the
        stormwater management conditions, township and county highway
   roadway
        conditions, and other matters. If there are any changes or
   modifications to
        these conditions, our ability to incorporate may be limited if
they
   are not
        received by 4pm today.  Of course, if necessary, we will
attempt to
   make
        modifications after that time.

        It is possible based on on-going negotiations with the County
and
   our
        neighbors that additional changes may be required today or
tomorrow.
   We
        will of course contact you immediately if that occurs.  If you
have
   any
        questions, please do not hesitate to call or email Karen or me.
   Thanks.
