Sheila, as I mentioned in my voice mail, there are a couple of items I need 
to follow up with you on:


1. Turbine Purchase Agreements - diligence item for the bank.  I have most of 
these, I think.  I can check with Kay to develop a list of these and get them 
copied for the bank.  I think I can get some out the door this evening - 
Millbank is very anxious to see them.

2. Project LLCs - Millbank would like a list of these and a set of formation 
and/or operating docs. for each of them. 

3. Developer as EWG - the bank has asked if the Developer could/should have 
this designation by the mid-November close.   I don't know if EWG is a 
plant/project specific designation or if it is "personal" to the entity 
applying for it.  Could you let us know?

4. Mortgages on site land - the bank is proposing that we give a 60-day 
negative pledge while we prepare a mortgage in the bank's favor on the real 
property in connection with a project site.  Is 60 days reasonable?  


Thanks,


Rose
