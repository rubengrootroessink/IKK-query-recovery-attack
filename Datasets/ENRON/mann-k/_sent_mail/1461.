Subject: Paige Update

CKM,

I spoke to Althea Gordon in the Recruiting Dept today regarding the poor 
treatment Paige received in the recruiting process.  Here is her response.

First of all, Paige should have received a rejection letter and a hold 
letter.  The rejection letter was from her submittal to the analyst process 
on her own.  The hold letter supposedly says that, based on referrals, she is 
on a waiting list and will be contacted for interviews provided there is any 
space left in the summer analyst class.  Basically they have offers out to 
what they call "first-tier" schools and are waiting for responses.  If they 
have any spots left, they will interview any candidates that are "on hold" 
based on resume review.

I asked why she didn't merit an interview right out of the gate and she told 
me it was because she was from a smaller school where we don't normally 
recruit and she lacked experience in Enron industries (sounded like a canned 
answer to me).

Will you check with Paige and see if she did get this "hold" letter?  I want 
to push to at least get her an interview, but am sensitive to making too big 
a deal about it and hurting her chances more than helping them.

I'll also talk to Charlene Jackson who runs the Analyst and Associate program 
and see if she has any advice.

Heather
