Kathleen,

I will initial and leave these in my office in a file folder with your name.  
Carlos has my proxy on the consent.

I'm also leaving you with a couple of original CA's for Fred.  He was going 
to email them to the other side for comment, so HANG ON to the pages I signed.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Signature Page

Ignore earlier version, ECT no longer exists so there is a change in the 
signature block to read ENA Corp. f/k/a ECT



PS Michelle checked in her voicemails and shot me back a positive one in 
response to the one that I left on Tuesday (ie, there's interest and we need 
to find the right fit.)
