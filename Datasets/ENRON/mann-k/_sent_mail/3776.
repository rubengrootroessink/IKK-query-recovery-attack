Have you left yet?  Don't you have an appointment at 3:45?  I'm telling 
people you have gone to an appointment outside the office.

That is so kind of them considering the last minute notice.  It's probably 
easier to do them all at one time anyway.  Are you coming into the office on 
Friday.  Will you get your tickets before you leave this afternoon.  I guess 
you don't need them though.

I went out to lunch and it's so hot outside.  I'm just now cooling off after 
about 3 big jugs of water.  Of course it's running right through me.  

Let me know if you need me to do anything.

I'm flying to somewhere (probably DC) tonight, returning on Friday.  Ozzie is 
making the travel arrangements, so you don't need to do anything.  I'll let 
you know what else I find out.

Thanks,

Kay
