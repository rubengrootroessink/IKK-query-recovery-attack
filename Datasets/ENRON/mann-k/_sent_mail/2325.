definitive word.

Kay/John:

NRG has signed the CA.  I'm planning on sending them the clean drafts of the 
LLC Agreement and Letter Agreement drafts provided by Carolyn last week.  
Please let me know if these drafts have been superseded or not.

Also, I understand from Ben that the deal with Coral is scheduled to close on 
Thursday.  I would like to know on a more definitive basis if this is indeed 
true.  NRG remains very interested in the equipment.

Please advise.
Thanks,
Jim

Jim-your e-mail to Carolyn Campbell was just forwarded to me.  The changes
to the confidentiality agreement are ok.

Since Carolyn will be out most of this week, please direct any
correspondence regarding this matter to me.  Thanks
