Here are my observations:

I'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty.  I 
agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk 
for a performance problem.

Is the reference to the "State" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?

As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a 
confidentiality agreement (with an exclusivity provision) signed, and in my 
opinion should not be presented as being a done deal.
