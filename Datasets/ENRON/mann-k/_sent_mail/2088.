Kay:

Per your request, enclosed is a proposed letter to SEL enclosing the final
facility agreements.  I have included a "receipt acknowledged" signature in
the proposed letter, although I believe this is optional as long as our
courier, upon delivery, obtains a signature acknowledging receipt.  Please
advise of any comments.  Thank you.
