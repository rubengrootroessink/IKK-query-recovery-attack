I thought you would enjoy this.  And I didn't make any comments about being 
right about not going to a MEGA university.

Hey. I just had a "Thank goodness I go to Southwestern" moment. I was
walking to get help from my professor for my test tomorrow (we ended up in
there for an hour and a half!), and I saw Dr. Parks, a business professor I
have had but do not have right now. He told me that he got a compliment on
me and my tour Friday by one of the prospective students' grandparent's.
Then I was walking upstairs, and I saw a professor I have not had a class
with since FRESHMAN year. She asked how I was, etc... And I told her I was
going to Dr. Early's office for help on Money and Banking. She asked how
the class was going, and I told her it's a ton of work, but it's do-able.
Then she said it's do-able for you, of course. You were always so good (or
something like that). I had her for SOCIOLOGY (not for my major or minor or
anything). So, I just got complimented nicely by two professors that I
don't even have a class with this semester, and then I got outside help for
an hour and a half. Yikes is this place ever awesome! I just thought I
would share.:)

Love,
PMR
