My opinion is that there is that the letter agreement is not ready to be sent 
out, and won't be for a day or two.  It can't be sent out until the CA is 
returned to you signed.

Subject: Form of Letter Agreement for Purchase of Membership Interests & 
Draft CA for Northwestern Corp.

Kay,

Chris Booth has been contacted by Northwestern Corp. regarding the purchase 
of our 7EA's.  Chris believes this is a very positive potential sale and 
there is no broker involved.  Attached is the CA for your review.  I used our 
form from your "Confidentiality Agreements" folder  (Chris would like to send 
the draft to Northwestern via e-mail this evening if possible).

Also attached is a copy of the Letter Agreement for the Purchase of 
Membership Interests that was prepared by Carolyn Campbell (per Chris Booth). 
Since the Northwestern Corp. transaction will be a turbo park deal (and you 
are the Queen of Turbo Park), Chris asked for your review and approval or 
comments.

Thanks
