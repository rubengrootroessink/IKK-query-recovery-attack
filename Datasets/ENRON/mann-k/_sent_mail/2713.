Opps.  When you wrote back earlier I thought you were responding to me and 
not Rose's email, so I made a couple of changes and sent it out to 
everyone.    

The Barnas affiliate language required an affiliate to own or operate the 
plant (not construct), and I was unclear on the time frame when that had to 
occur.  I'll explain what happened and apologize to him if he thinks we 
re-traded, and can back off of the changes.

The insanity continues here. 

Kay

I was pretty much Ok with Rose's changes but your thoughts are good too, 
although we spent a lot of time on the affiliate issue and I'm OK with an 
affiliate owning or consturcting the plant.  Please carry on in my absense.  
I've turned into a hostage and do not know when I may be permitted to return.
