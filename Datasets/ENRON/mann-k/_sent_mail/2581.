Hi Al,

My suggestion is that you capture the change order with change order #1 for 
PSCO's break out contract.  If it needs to be paid before year end (which it 
probably does) you can put a payment date of December 20th, and it will be 
paid out of TurboPark.  This approach has been discussed with Lee Johnson at 
GE, and he is fine with it.

Thanks,

Kay
