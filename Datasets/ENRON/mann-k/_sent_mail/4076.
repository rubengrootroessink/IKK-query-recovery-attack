Ben noticed a mistake in the ABB contract - one I missed.  Enron's address 
was listed as 1400 Louisiana.  I could not figure out where that address came 
from, as it had been correct before.  I asked Kathy and she told me that she 
changed it from Smith to Louisiana because she thought that was the correct 
address.

Ok, now I'm scared.
