Neil left to go hunting this am, Paige leaves for school tomorrow, leaving 
me, Michael and our new puppy (mid life crisis dog) to our own devices.  I'm 
taking the day off tomorrow, and Monday is an Enron holiday, so I'm looking 
forward to some Kay time, working in the yard (weather permitting), watching 
Oprah, etc.

Boys............whatcha gonna do?
They love that stuff.........
Missy, our friend Susie, and I went to the usual Elvis
impersonator thing at Chuy's on Richmond Monday night.
Walked into a full force cat fight on the way in...one
girl screaming Lesbian at the top of her lungs, and
dropping the "C" bomb all over the girl she was
beating up. Waiters had to get them out of the place
and into the parking lot.  Very exciting. 
Dinner with family and Dad's widowed friend Claude,
and his daughter Lisa who we have known forever.  Good
folks.
Any plans for you?
