Ben,

I spoke with the VA Power contact today who is responsible for the 
interconnection agreement.  His name is Wayne Duman (804.257.4096, 
Wayne_Duman@dom.com).  

He suggested e-mailing him dates when Enron was available to go to Richmond 
to discuss the interconnect.  I don't know if you want to go or if you plan 
on sending one of the developers, but will you schedule this meeting (since I 
won't be negotiating this part of it).

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any problems.

Heather
