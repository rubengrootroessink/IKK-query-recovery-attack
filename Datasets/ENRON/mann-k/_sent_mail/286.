Subject: World Hunger- Section 9.6 Additional tests

Per the conference call of Wednesday, I revised Section 9.6 (with Scott=20
fixing my drafting).  Attached document contains a redline of the section.

he=20
concept with Jim Sutherland- he agreed with relaxing the unilateral=20
requirement in the case of GE.  We would not want to do this in the case of=

other vendors.
