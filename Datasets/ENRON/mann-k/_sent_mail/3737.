Hi there,

Paige is still here.  I think she may leave tomorrow.  Have you ever visited 
her website?  Here's a link:
http://www.southwestern.edu/~recordp/

You might trying clicking on the link to see if it takes you directly to her 
web page.  She will have the same email address again this year.  I suspect 
she will have the same mailing address as well, since it is a box number.  

Michael slept well this weekend.  He had a great birthday.  He takes his 
dinosaur everywhere.  It is so funny, because the button gets pushed 
accidently when it is being hauled around, so it is constantly growling.

We saw a few drops of rain, but nothing to help the water bill.  The smog is 
horrible.

I'm in town all week this week, which is nice.  Neil and I have a birthday 
party to go to for our neighbor Donnie (he was at the party) on Friday, so 
Michael will spend some time with Charlotte again. She should be off of most 
of her restrictions tomorrow, so maybe he will get to see her more.  

We went to the Astros game last night, and they actually won.  Sammy Sosa hit 
a home run harder than any I've seen before.  Even some of the Astros fans 
clapped at the sheer force of it.  The pitcher said he watched it, just 
because he had never seen such an awesome hit.  

Too bad about the heat, but what the heck can you do about it anyway?

Love,

Kay

Hi Kay Kay,Just wanted to say Hi. Did Houston really see rain today? We had
about five drops. We have had a nice quiet week. We did buy five pounds of
shrimp from Grassy Point. Has Michael rested up from this birthday party?
We plan to be here until sometime next week. Has Paige gone back to school
and will she still have the same email address? Tell neil Dad will sent a
fishing report when he has one. He really has not fished much. It's just to
hot. Love,Mother
