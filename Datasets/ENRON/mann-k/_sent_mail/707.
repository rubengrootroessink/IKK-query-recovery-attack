Subject: michael

I am just now getting started with work. John met me at the door the first
thing and we talked for almost an hour and a half about a new game plan he
wanted to get my thoughts on. If it hadn't been for my training seminar at 9
I don't know how long we would have talked.

The school nurse called and asked that we keep a watch on Michael for pink
eye. He was taken to see the nurse because his left eye was red. He first
told Norris he rubbed it. Then he said he poked himself in the eye. The
nurse says she doesn't think he has it but there is a case of pink eye in
the class. She said when she asked the teacher if she should call me Michael
said absolutely! She said he was fine and there was no reason to pick him up
early.

Love, NM
