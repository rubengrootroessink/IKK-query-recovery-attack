I spoke to Sheila and Steve a few minutes ago and we all agreed to
reschedule the meeting for next week.  Steve is to check with his guys as
to what day/time will work for GE next week and I will do the same with the
Enron folks.  Steve and I hope to coordinate and firm up the schedule this
Friday at which time we will notify each of you.
