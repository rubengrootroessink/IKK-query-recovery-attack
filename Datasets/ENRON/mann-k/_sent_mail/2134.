We discussed this with Mike last night.  He is going to get the number for 
us, as it is buried in a data sheet somewhere.

I've already made the change to the CA Energy Development/ABB Agreement.
All we're waiting for is guidance on Exhibit A.

Sure.

The fix we want to make on the drug/alcohol policy is as follows:
instead
of a reference to a specific numbered policy, the purchaser will provide
ABB with a copy of their policy, and ABB will comply with it.

Peter--I saw the breakout contract for the CA project that you sent out.
Could you send me the current draft, in whatever shape it's in, for the
Fountain Valley ABB contract?  I need whatever you have first thing
tomorrow ( for dealing with NEPCo, our EPC contractor to arrive at a
final
EPC contract price, not for dealing with GE or E-Next Generation LLC).
Thanks.

Al Larsen
