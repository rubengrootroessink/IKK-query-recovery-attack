Kent,

There isn't anything attached that I can open.  Am I doing something wrong?

Kay

Subject:  Revised Change Order #4

Here is the Change Order number 4 that I should have sent out earlier.
Lee,
stated on the phone call today that there may be additional comments, so
please reply to all if there are so we can revise the Facility Agreements
accordingly.

CST.  That was right, right?

I'm going to have the outside lawyer involved for the purpose of turning
the revised draft, so long as you don't have an objection
(objecting=volunteering to turning the next draft!)

Gentlemen:

Attached is a draft of the facility agreement, without reference to WestLB.
It just came in, so I haven't reviewed it.

It looks like 330 tomorrow will work for this group, unless you tell me
otherwise.  I'll get back to you with the location.

Kay

Enclosed please find clean and blacklined versions of the GE Contract.
The blackline of the Agreement identifies the changes from the draft I
sent you. Note that no blackline of the Exhibits was necessary because
it contained no references to WestLB.
Regards,
Paul
