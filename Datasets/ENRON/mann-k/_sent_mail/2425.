Volunteers:

Many thanks for volunteering to help with this great cause.  Listed below are 
the volunteers for the CPS BEAR table for Monday, December 18.  Volunteers 
please plan to arrive at the CPS BEAR (Be A Resource) table in the lobby of 
the Enron building which will be located by the down escalator.  We will need 
to have the table staffed from 10 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  You will be collecting 
cash contributions for the Children's Protective Services BEAR program.  
Enron employees will receive a $10 coupon from Sun & Ski Sports for any cash 
contribution.        

Braddy, Martha
