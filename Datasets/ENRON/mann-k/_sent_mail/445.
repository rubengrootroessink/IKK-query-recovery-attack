Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.
