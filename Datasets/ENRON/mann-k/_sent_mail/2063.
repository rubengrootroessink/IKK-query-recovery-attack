Subject: Revised notices for CA I and CAII

I'm attaching the notices for CA I and CA II.  Please pay particular 
attention to CA II, since it is the first time it has been circulated.  
Obviously, we will need to insert the final purchase numbers.

Lisa, I set it up so ENA is consenting, which tracks the language in the DCMA.

Kay
