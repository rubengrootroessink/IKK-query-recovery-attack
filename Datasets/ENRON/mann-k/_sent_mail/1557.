Kay :  Are you the reigning fuel cell person?  Might you know if there is any 
interest in a project with Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority?  Have a 
request for a c.a. for a new recycling project (pulp and paper I think)  with 
them and have an existing agreement re fuel cells done  by Chris Gaffney last 
spring.

I'll check with Peter.  Were you aware there is  an existing agreement re a 
fuel cell project with CRRA?  Do you know of any continuing interest in that 
project?  I'll check as well.  We may want to amend that one or terminate it  
if that project is dead, to avoid any confusion.
