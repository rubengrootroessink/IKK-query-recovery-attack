I know a couple of their lawyers from a prior transaction (Doug Turner and 
their GC, whose name I've now forgotten).  Don't know who they will have on 
this one.

I'm off to the Astros, but would like to visit with you tomorrow, if you will 
be around.

Thanks,

Kay

I'm looking forward to working with you on this.  I wonder who opposing
inhouse counsel is at TECO?
