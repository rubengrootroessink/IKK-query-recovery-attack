Marcelo and John,

As we have discussed before, we need to document that the price we are using 
for the LM6000's for Electrobolt  is "fair market value".     There are 
several third party sales at Enron that may be applicable to help with this 
exercise.    Kay Mann has offered to help with this,  but  to compare 
Electrobolt's LM6000's to the other sales, we need the equipment list for the 
LM6000's---i.e. what attachments are included with these LM 6000's.    

Kay, what do you need to help with this.   Is it a full equipment list, or 
some other equipment summary.    Could you please describe.   I believe 
Marcelo or John Ayres are the most likely to be able to provide the 
information, but am not quite sure what to ask for.      Thanks.    

Mary
