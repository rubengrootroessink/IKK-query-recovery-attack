You are referring to the purchase and sale agreement, right?  I'm not asking 
him to do anything on the LOI.

I haven't spoken to him in person.  I'll address it when we connect.  Are you 
available this afternoon to talk to him with me?

Kay

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)
