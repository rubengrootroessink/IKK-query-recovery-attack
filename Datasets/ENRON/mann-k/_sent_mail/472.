Kay: The issue has arisen as to whether the current draft of the GE contract 
incorporated comments of Rose Engeldorf and Lisa Bills.  I want to make sure 
that Rose and Lisa have the current draft, and for that reason have asked 
Peter to send it out.  The plan is for Peter to maintain control of the 
document as he has in the past and to re-issue a draft that incorporates the 
comments.

   I know that GE recently had a small comment, technical or scope
related,  but I don't recall if it was before or after the 24th. I was
unaware of Tom's involvement, so I want to make sure the comment was
addressed.  

   I'm happy to hand the reins over to someone else to handle
signature.  I suspect I'm creating confusion as well.

   Yes Kay.  It shlould be the last version from Peter Thompson of
AK sent April 24th.  Tom Constantine and I just left Peter a voice mail
to ask him to resend to Tom for a double check.  I wil ask Tom to
forward it to you.  I have nothing to add to these contracts, and want
to get out of the loop to eliminate confusion.

   This does not mean I will not help or answer any questions, just
that Dale has asked Tom to act in Dale's place on this, and I don't want
to screw things up....

   TOM - when received or confirmed from Peter, would you please
send a copy to Kay Mann as well (as requested below).
