I think that's fine.

I will be available at 1:30 pm CST today.  With regard to turning the
document, I will be traveling on Thursday.  Therefore, I believe the
earliest I could have a draft of the agreement (w/o exhibits, w/o
override letter) is Friday evening.  If we could wait until Monday
delivery, I could have drafts of both the agreement and exhibits.

Yes. Let's do 1:30 for an internal call.  I'll get Suzanne to send out
the
dial-in instructions.  Let's make sure that the GE guys know NOT to call
in.  Thanks!.  I know that John Schwartzenburg will be late since he is
TurboParking until 2 pm but let's proceed at 1:30.

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft
contract and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either
later this week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and
suspect
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we
will let Mike and Steve know as well.

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30
am
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the
end of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting
of
the Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough
to
get that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in
Principle
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?
Our
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.
I'll
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next
Wednesday, but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order
to
get the Longview Turbine Contract going.
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available
tomorrow
morning.
