It is an hour and a half west of Memphis.  No where.  You can smell the meat 
processing plant.  Hey, you would probably like that!

Great trip back.  I spent yesterday in Clarksdale Mississippi.  Don't make a 
point of spending your vacation there!

Can you email me Glenn's info so I can send him the hard copy?

I enjoyed our time together, and look forward to more adventures.

Kay
