Wouldn't it be nice to not have a fire drill at the end? At least we will be 
ready.

I'm can't wait to see what their lenders will come up with.  Ben's hoping it

Great.  I will focus on the closing checklist to ensure that all of ENA's
closing deliveries are in order well before closing.

Did I tell you that I spoke with GE about the assignment, and their initial
response was very positive.

NorthWestern is predicting closing in July.
