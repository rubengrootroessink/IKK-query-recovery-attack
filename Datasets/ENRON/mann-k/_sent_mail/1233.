Hi John,

Operational Services

In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with t=
he=20
commercial businesses they support, we are pleased to announce the followin=
g=20
organizational change will be effective immediately.  A new business unit,=
=20
Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which wi=
ll=20
include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Compa=
ny=20
(EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Producti=
on=20
Corporation (NEPCO).

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, =
as=20
Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new=20
organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale=20
Services.  NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under=
=20
John Gillis, President.

With the majority of EE&CC and OEC=01,s activities focused on assets and=20
projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the effort=
s=20
of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.  While EEOS will be a=
=20
stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely=
=20
with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabiliti=
es=20
in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best=20
practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will al=
so=20
allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation=
=20
of resources to these projects.  Consistent with this approach, Development=
=20
Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units=20
which they support. =20

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=
e=20
variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical=
=20
that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20
construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron=01,s assets=
 on a=20
global basis.

This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhanc=
e=20
these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage=
=20
as we advance our business strategy around the world.

Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments.

Mark Frevert & Dave Delainey
