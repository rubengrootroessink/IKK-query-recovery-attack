We had a very good work session with GE today to iron out the details of the 
break out contract.  We expect to have a draft on Monday, which should be 
close to final as far as the form goes.  I have also asked A & K to prepare a 
memo outlining what will need to be done on a project basis to complete the 
document.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kay
