Ok, I give up.  What's an estoppel letter?

Subject: Land Options - Estoppel language

Given the challenges that Carlos and I are currently encountering while 
trying to obtain an estoppel letter from our Illinois landowner (Bob 
Konicek), I believe that it makes sense on all our future land option 
agreements to include language obligating the Seller to provide such letters 
at our request.  This language could be easily included in the cooperation 
section of the agreement and would likely go unnoticed or unchallenged by the 
Seller.  It would simplify the site monetization process and avoid the Seller 
being able to extract value from us in exchange for providing such a letter.

Fred
