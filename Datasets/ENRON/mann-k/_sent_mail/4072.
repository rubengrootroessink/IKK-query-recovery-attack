Kay:

He was in meetings all afternoon and hasn't had a chance to review the 
changes.  He will try to get you and Dave connected on Monday to discuss the 
assignment issue.  I think that is the only outstanding item.

 I sent a copy to Old Eagle Eyes Dieball for his final review and approval.  
I'll have you sign off on Monday (I hope!)

Enjoy an Enron-free weekend.
Kathy
