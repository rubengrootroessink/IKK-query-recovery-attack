Gentlemen:

Attached is a draft of the facility agreement, without reference to WestLB.  
It just came in, so I haven't reviewed it.  

It looks like 330 tomorrow will work for this group, unless you tell me 
otherwise.  I'll get back to you with the location.

Kay

Enclosed please find clean and blacklined versions of the GE Contract.
The blackline of the Agreement identifies the changes from the draft I
sent you. Note that no blackline of the Exhibits was necessary because
it contained no references to WestLB.
Regards,
Paul
