Charlotte,

Michael hasn't bounced back yet - still getting fever up to 102.  I spoke 
with Delores, and she said Rey said that Michael had a pretty good dose of 
strep, so it will take 6 doses of medicine to get it under control.  I'll see 
how he is in the early am, but I may not take him to school, just so I can 
watch him another few hours.  If you will be at your office tomorrow I'll let 
you know how he's doing.  Maybe I can leave on Saturday.  I know he will be 
very upset if he doesn't get to spend time with you this weekend.

Kay
