Well, maybe it makes more sense to write it like this:  (see below)

Well, let's try again then.  How about this (I left off reference to=20
"States"):

Enron North America Corp. (=01&ENA=018 or the "Protected Party") is prepare=
d to=20

No biggie, and understandable.  When we sell the equipment we structure it=

like we did on the CA deal - we sell the special purpose companies that wil=
l=20
own the equipment at the time of sale. =20

I will be happy to conform the NW to this form if that is what you want.  I=
n=20
the form with the paragraph below, I thought "(i) the potential sale of one=
=20
or more of the Protected Party's power plant development projects and/or on=
e=20
of more of the special purpose companies which own such projects in [states=
]"=20
 was to be used for particular sites where we have existing land options we=
=20
are trying to sell, and that when we were trying to sell equipment (i.e.=20
7EA's) we would refer to these as "gas fired electric generation projects"

My mistake.

The form we have has this as the first paragraph, which is different from t=

form attached.  Could you conform the NW one to the form?
