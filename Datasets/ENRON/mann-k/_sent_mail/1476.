Stuart,

If you need a copy of the executed Westinghouse letter, you can find the 
original on my desk, I believe on the left hand corner (looking out).  The 
letter we are waiting for is merely an acknowledgement that LJM doesn't need 
to sign.  I think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders, but I 
requested it anyway.
