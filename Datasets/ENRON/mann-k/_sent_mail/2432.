Subject: RE: Hola

thanks-Carlos talked to me yesterday and is excited at the prospect of the
Mexican work.  

Rose hasn't called me yet-thanks for the intro.

More tickets are available-as many as you want (I think you're the only real
fan in the group).  Hadn't heard the Biggio story-I'll check into it and
pass any gossip.  I think Asmus will be a good addition, but we still need a
good starter.

We are getting the Enron treatment from Coral.  I hope Carolyn told you I
called yesterday - Coral was looking for Shell approval.  I'm guessing it
is in a coma.  I usually have 30 voice mails, and I have had 4 today, which
tells you something.  Good  time for Michael to be sick!

Carlos has interviews today and tomorrow with ENA.  I think he is looking
good for Mexico.  You guys are the absolutely best qualified for that
business, and I'll start planting that seed when I can.

By the way, thanks for the great job on Coral.  Did you hear from Rose on
the HSR on TurboPark?

We do want Astros tickets for next year - at least 15 games.  Are more
available?

I heard that Hampton had an issue with Patty Biggio (thank goodness, these
salaries are absurd), and I guess I'm glad to see Ausmus come back.
However, he is not a substitute for a pitcher.  And how is Shane?

Ciao,

Kay
