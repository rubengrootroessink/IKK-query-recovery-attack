Subject: FPA Designations

Please change the FPA designations of the following entities to add the 
designation of ELEQ.

CA Energy Development I, L.L.C.
CA Energy Development II, L.L.C.
Salmon Energy LLC
Merchant Energy Ventures LLC

I noticed that CA Energy Development I and II have a list of Enron employees 
as officers.  I believe that when ENA sold part of its ownership in these 
entities that the co-owner may have appointed a new slate of officers. Could 
Matt please verify that the Corporate Secretary has been given current 
information for the data sheets.  I understand that one Enron employee is a 
director of each of these entities.  I believe that it will be important for 
FPA Interlocking Position Reporting for the Corporate Secretary to reflect in 
the Data Sheets the name of any Enron employee who holds an officer or 
director position.
