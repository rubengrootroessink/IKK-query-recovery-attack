I wouldn't worry about the call.  We are just collecting to do lists.  I'm 
thinking a half hour.

if it's 1 PM, could we do it at 2? (last lunch with dad).  I'm available in
the morning.

Hi there,

I suggest a brief status call tomorrow at 100 central to assess where we
are and what we need to finish.  How does this time work for everyone?

Thanks,

Kay
