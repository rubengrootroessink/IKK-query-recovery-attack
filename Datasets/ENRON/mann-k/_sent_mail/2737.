Rose,

I suggest putting [brackets] around commercial operation as the date we can 
assign without consent.  As of now commercial operation is not a defined term 
(I hope it will become a defined term), so we may want to agree to a 
different milestone.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: GE Assignment Language

I took the Mike Barnas language and added in all the "unreasonable to 
withhold consent" language from GenPower, to which I added the "financing 
structure" language.


I have attached a red-line, which you will need to "view" rather than 
"launch."  Please let me know asap if you think that this will fly with GE, 
or if the language needs to be softened at all.


Rose
