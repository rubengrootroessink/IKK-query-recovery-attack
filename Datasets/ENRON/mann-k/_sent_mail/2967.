Hi Scott,

I have these questions:

What do we mean by configuration?  We are telling them that we will give them 
the configuration by date x, but I'm not sure what we mean.

What was decided on spare parts, if anything?

I know it is repetitive, but could you email me a basic timeline of what you 
see as the key dates for site designation, shipping, anything else you can 
think of?  I've started a timeline but would like to cross check.

I was hoping to have it done before noon, but the 930 conference call will 
impact that.  I have a meeting this afternoon from 230 until 500 or so, so 
I'm trying to get done before then.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: P.O.

When you have the draft P.O. done, I would like to block of some time to 
discuss it.  I will leave my schedule fairly open today.
