The problem is in getting the original in their hands (where?) by tomorrow.=

Does it have to be an original?

Kay:

Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the proble=
m
altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an
hour or so to finalize the mechanics on this.  Thanks.

I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.

I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are
coming from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.

Kay:

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?
