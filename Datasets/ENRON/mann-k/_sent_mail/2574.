Hi,

I'm back.

I'll give you the short version.  I spoke with John, and he tells me he sent 
Mark and Vicky a  note saying that you  had paid your debt to society and are 
free to explore other options.  Pretty good stuff.  

I want to hear what M. Cash said, and who else you are meeting with.  Maybe I 
can lay some ground work.

Kay
