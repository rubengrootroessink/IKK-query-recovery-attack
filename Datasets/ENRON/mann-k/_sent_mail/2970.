Hi Dale,

We are meeting with GE tomorrow to talk about this.  Please let me know if 
you have any suggestions or comments.  Ditto on the ABB agreement which I 
forwarded not too long ago.

Enclosed please find clean and blacklined versions of the GE Contract.
The blackline of the Agreement identifies the changes from the draft I
sent you. Note that no blackline of the Exhibits was necessary because
it contained no references to WestLB.
Regards,
Paul
