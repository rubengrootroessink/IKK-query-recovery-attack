Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) "WestLB" should be changed to "Purchaser"
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be "Agent's" person to approve change orders, not 
"Purchaser's"
2.2:  "Purchaser" should be used rather than "WestLB" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

Regards, Lisa

Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:



I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after "WestLB". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay
