Here's a free look at someone else's deal.  I don't know what role Enron has 
in the deal after sell down.

Here is a copy of the agreement, made all the more ugly by my redaction 
"surgery."

I have put some terms that you will want to think through carefully in 
italics.  I totally removed some other provisions that were particularly 
deal-specific (e.g. an obligation to offer to sell them the project if we 
decided to abandon it--I know, it's damn weird, but they were hung up on some 
strange things).

Let me know if I can answer any questions.
