Scott/Stephen, I'm trying to summarize the essence of these performance 
guarantees, similiar to what I have for heat rate.  I'm sure I've got 
something on output and probably reliability, but can you give me a thumb 
nail sketch of what we are looking for on the rest?

10.3.1   Heat Rate Guarantee.  Seller guarantees that the Heat Rate as 
measured for each of the Units 
as demonstrated during the Performance Test, shall be __BTU/kWh. In the event 
the Heat Rate exceeds the Minimum Heat Rate Guarantee, Seller shall take all 
necessary actions to correct, retest the deficient Unit and cause the 
deficient Unit to meet the Minimum Heat Rate Guarantee.  Failure to meet the 
Heat Rate Guarantee shall prevent Acceptance, unless Purchaser explicitly 
waives this guarantee in writing.  

{we have a definition of heat rate}

10.3.2   Electrical Output Guarantee.  
  
10.3.3   Emissions Guarantee. 

10.3.4   Water Consumption Guarantee. 

10.3.5 Sound Guarantee.

10.3.6 Reliability.

Thanks,

Kay
