My recollection is that I gave it to Sheila around the time it came in, but I 
wouldn't swear to it.  I'll check around here.

Subject: A&K Invoice

Hi, Kay:

Sheila asked me to track down a few A&K Invoices for her. 

One of the invoices relates to a matter entitled, Preparation of Form TU, 
dated July 31, 2000.

The invoice number is 10103851 and the amount is $25,165.00.

Have you seen or do you recall this invoice?  If so, would you happen to know 
where I might find a copy?

Thanks, a million,

Ed
