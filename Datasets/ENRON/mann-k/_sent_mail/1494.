Charlotte,

Great story!

Neil is at the Astrodome now. You might be able to reach him on his cell or 
by pager.  If I hear from him I will have him give you a call.

I'm in Florida, and looking out my window I saw an alligator swim by.  
Wouldn't Michael go crazy?

Bye,

Kay

Subject: Michael Funny

   I forgot to tell you this.  When we were at Blockbuster last time,
Michael was trying to talk me into buying two videos.  I explained to him
that we were spending Mom and Dad's money and that we had to stay within
limits unless we had permission.  He decided on Dinosaur, but really, really
wanted another monster video.  He then started his jury argument with me
about how much I would enjoy watching that monster video at my apartment
when he was not there.  A couple standing near us was cracking up laughing
and said he is clearly going to be a lawyer when he grows up.

   Neil, I will probably take Michael to my apartment today so I can
have something on cooking while he is watching videos.  You can call and
confirm.  Since you are coming from the Astro Arena, won't it be just as
convenient for you?
