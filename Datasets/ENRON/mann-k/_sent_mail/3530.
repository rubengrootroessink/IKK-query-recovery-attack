Let me clarify.  She sold the place when the city put in bike lanes because 
it screwed up the parking.

I've heard wonderful, divey things about the Roll-in.   A top prospect.

That's awful about the aquarium and the owner! Bicycling can indeed be 
hazardous. The Roll-in is my next vote on the dive tour.

Hey there.

I don't think I've been fishing since July.  Geez, it is half way through 
September.

I'm in Chicago today (NYC yesterday).  A whirl wind tour.

I hear the Aquarium closed - killed by bike lanes.  Two weeks later the owner 
died.  We need to find a "new" dive.

Kay

Yeh-huh. I sent an e-mail. I will dredge up and resend. Been fishing lately?

I'm either losing my mind or my email.  Did you send me an email re GE?  I 
thought I saw one, but now I can't find it. Is that a trick, and if so, how 
do I do it?  

Could you resend it, please?

Thanks,

Kay
