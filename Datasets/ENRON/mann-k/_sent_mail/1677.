Fred,

I think Kathleen will be a big help to all of us in improving the flow of 
paper.  I trust her to work up initial drafts of option agreements, subject 
to my quick review and the review of local counsel.  

Thanks for your cooperation.

Kay:

The Fehrs and Ledfords did sign their respective option agreements last week 
prior to our Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.  I am expecting Karen Way to 
forward you an executed original copy of each agreement.  I will check with 
her on the status of this.

With regard to the policy, I understand your point.  Rusty and I will work to 
better co-ordinate with you in the future.  Perhaps we can lever off of 
Kathleen for agreements such as the Schaeffer option.

Let me know.

Fred

Hi Guys,

Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go 
through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.  In the 
future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to 
the process.

Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?

Thank you,

Kay

Kay:

This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
(312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.
