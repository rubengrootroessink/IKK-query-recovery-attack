I had a big lunch, so something light sounds good.

Subject: dependent care

I spoke with a lady in St Louis HR who said she paid in advance for her
child last year. She said it does not matter when you paid. She suggested we
ask St F for a quarterly statement. That's what she used last year and had
no problem whatsoever getting reimbursed. I bet we are not the only folks in
this situation at St F.

I confirmed the fence installation for Wednesday 11/8 at 1:15pm. I will be
at an HCA luncheon that morning for 1 hour of CE and should be finished in
time to be at the house by then.

Any thought on what you would like for dinner?

Neil
