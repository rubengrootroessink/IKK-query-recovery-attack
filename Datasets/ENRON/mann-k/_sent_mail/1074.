We are trying to close with Delta, and they saw a March 20th draft.  Also, I 
had it  revised to take out E Next and substitute the llc.  So now I have two 
versions.  Just trying to get it clear.  I've spoken with Lee about revising 
the contract to pick up the new contract, leaving the "old" turbine in the 
master agreement, to be included in the LV Co Gen break out contract.

Couldn't be simpler.

The answer is yes-sort of.

The last thing I heard, 3 of the 4 current turbines are to go to Delta, with 
the 4th (August '01 delivery) to go to LV Cogen 2.

The real twist on this now will be the fact that we will need to somehow 
break the 4th turbine out from the contract.  At the same time, we have to 
confirm that the pricing (and related LD's, etc.) that would otherwise apply 
to the new turbines actually get assigned to the Delta turbines (in order to 
make our EPC contract for LV Cogen work right.

No headaches, eh?

Is this for the  turbines being sold to Delta as opposed to the new 
replacement equipment?

Thanks,

Bill Williams has confirmed that the attached version of the LVC-2 contract 
is the final form.  I have added a footer stamp identifying it as "Rev 5 - 
3/27/01".  Everything else is identical to the draft circulated March 12.


The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  

Thanks.
