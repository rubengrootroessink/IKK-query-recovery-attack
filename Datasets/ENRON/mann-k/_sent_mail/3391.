I have in mind a contract that EECC and NEPCO will agree is the ENA form 
contract, so that there isn't a need to come up with two different contract 
forms.  Is that too high of a mountain to climb?

Hi John,

Question. Can we agree that a form contract will work for both EECC and 
NEPCO? Sure would make life easier.
