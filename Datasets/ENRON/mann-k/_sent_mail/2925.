Subject: VEPCO files Interconnection Proc. at FERC

On 10/27/00, VEPCO filed interconnection procedures at FERC (Docket No. 
ER01-247)(Protests due 11/17/00).  These largely mirror CP&L's 
interconnection procedures that were recently approved by FERC.  Therefore, I 
do not think that Enron should protest or intervene.

Customer is required to pay for the cost of a new system impact/facilities 
study if the study information/interconnection/upgrade costs change due to a 
customer higher in the queue losing its queue spot.
System impact studies should take 60 days or less.  Facilities studies should 
take 90 days or less.
