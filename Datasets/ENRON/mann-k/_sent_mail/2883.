As usual, the lawyers are the last to know.

Stuart is working on a transaction to sell the asset (Gleason), and therefore 
this ageement needs to be documented asap, which means in the next few days.  
Please review the attached and give me a call.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay -

I've reached a verbal agreement with Westinghouse on the LD issues.  I've 
attached a letter outlining the agreement.  Could you review from a legal 
standpoint?  Call me with questions.

Thanks,

Mitch
