I would line up CA next.  

Let me look over what Lee sent then I'll call (or you can call when you get 
free).

How was the game?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

Lee Johnson and John Ayres are going to meet Monday morning at 8:30 to
go
through all the technical information in the contract to confirm
everything.  They should get back to you very quickly with any changes.
I
think the primary thing they are discussing is using a combined
guarantee
rather than single unit.

Thanks,
Brett
