Thanks for writing - I deleted your message and then hopped on another
conference call.  How about 330?

Kay:

Per my voice mail, Greg Lang wanted to schedule a call for 3:00 central
time
today to raise something that the lenders brought up.  Please advise if you
are available, or if not, what time would be convenient later today.  Greg
says it should be a 15 minute call.  Thanks.
