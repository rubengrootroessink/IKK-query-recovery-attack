I think your "final" office changed when your group changed - the East 
Origination/Gas Trading Group is in the southeast quadrant of the floor and 
they have given you 3882, just  four doors down the hall from where I am 
now.  The construction workers are gone for the day if you want to stop by 
and see it.

Hi Mark,

I thought I was in my "final" office.  Where am I moving?

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a 
completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, 
November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.
