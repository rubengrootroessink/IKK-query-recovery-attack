Attached are drafts of the documents to effect the transfer of two GE 
turbines and one ABB transformer to CAED I and CAED II.  The dates and 
amounts are bracketed, as pending the determination of the closing date.  We 
will need sets for both CAED I and CAED II, with II receiving the 
transformer.  These will be prepared with the forms are agreed.  

These documents are subject to internal Enron review, but in the interest of 
time I am sending the documents to everyone.

Thank you,

Kay
