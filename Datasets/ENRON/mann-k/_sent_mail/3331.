I am attaching a new blackline and a clean version that you may print off and
sign. I have now become aware that there may be a problem with our ability to
have all interconnection facilities in place in order to allow for a July 1,
2001 Commercial Operation Date. I can push the issue with our folks to make 
sure
what they are saying is correct, but I need a signed off Agreement by Enron to
reflect the seriousness of Enron to do this project. I believe all of the 
issues
have been addressed and the words reflect our understanding of this deal. If 
you
agree, please print and sign 4 copies (2 for Enron, 2 for us). I will need 
this
back immediately as I will be out of the country starting the middle of next
week until the 23rd. In order for this deal to have a chance of moving 
forward,
it must be executed before I leave.

What is the status with the Westinghouse turbine issue?

Please call if you have any questions. Thanks

Gary
