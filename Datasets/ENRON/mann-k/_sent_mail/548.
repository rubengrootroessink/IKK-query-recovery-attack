Kay, 

Does the LOC go in the name of Salmon Energy, LLC or Pegasus?  or who?

Hi Guys,

Delta has asked when the LOC can be issued for the final payment.  We have
every expectation that payment will be made on May 2nd, and we will know
for sure by later today.  Would it be possible to have the LOC by Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kay
