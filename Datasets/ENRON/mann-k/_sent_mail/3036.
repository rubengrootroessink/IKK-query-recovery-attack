Sorry to hear about this weekend.  It is kind of sad that Mary Susan doesn't 
have other options for her birthday.  Not that you guys aren't fun....

Michael and I've been home with strep since Wednesday.  He hasn't gotten 
better, but I have. So, I'm not going to San Antonion, just heading for GTown 
tomorrow.  I haven't decided whether I'm taking Michael. If he is feeling 
better, I'll leave him with his sitter, Charlotte.  Since he has been ill, 
I'll probably head back to Houston EARLY on Sunday, and won't wait for Paige 
to get up.  Sorry it didn't work out with girls, but I understand.

Love,

Kay
