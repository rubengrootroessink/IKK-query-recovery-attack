Hi Matt,

Sheila tells me that you are working on the docs requested by Global Finance 
for Turbopark (does this ring a bell?)  If you can get me the docs on this 
LLC, I'll see if we can pitch the angle Sheila suggested.

Thanks,

Kay

Yes please.  I do not know of a single project LLC that is ready to commit to 
Phase II Turbo Park.  So I suggest we send them corporate docs from 
Pleasanton Local Reliability  Facility LLC and tell them that all of our 
LLC's are basically the same.
