Kay,

I took a whack at redlining for CO#1 Fountain Valley Agreement.  You'll need
to do some touch-ups, I believe.

Let me know what other changes will be necessary.

Thanks,


Lee

Gentlemen,

Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since
we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process
this as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we
need the site specific stuff for this project.

Kay
