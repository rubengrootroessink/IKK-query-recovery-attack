I thought you might enjoy this.

You should have seen Michael's eyes while he was riding in that Mercedes 
convertible yesterday.  He was speechless, and you know how rare that is!  I 
suspect we will be hearing about it now...

Kay,

I am so glad to hear that Michael is doing great at school.  Neil has told
me he loves Marilou's reports that he is attending so well without meds.

He really is a precious boy!  Yesterday you would have thought that "having
poop on one's shoe" was the greatest thing on earth.  He absolutely
delighted in telling ALL of us WHY he was wearing only one shoe!  He was
giggling the whole time!  At the conclusion of the session when he walked
out to Neil, I heard him ask, "Well, how's my shoe doing?"  How do you two
keep from laughing the whole time with him?  Just writing this is making me
laugh!

Have a great time together at the rodeo.   He'll love spending the time with
you!

Sharon
