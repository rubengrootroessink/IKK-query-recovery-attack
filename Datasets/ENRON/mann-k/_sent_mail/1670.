Please draft a letter to the guy listed in the first email below (Hartzell at 
ITM), using the stuff in Chris' email as the body of the letter.  Save under 
General LOI, and I'll finish the letter.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay or Kathleen,

I would appreciate your advise.

Thanks,

Kay

P.S. Here is the comission language.

David:

We are very interested in working with you on a nonexclusive basis regarding 
the disposition of certain equipment we own. To the extent you identify a new 
prospective buyer that we are not already working with, and we close a 
transaction with that buyer, we will pay you a commission of 0.6% of the 
transaction value. Of course, we cannot provide any assurance that any 
transaction will be consummated, as any transaction we enter into will be 
subject to a variety of approvals including but not limited to Enron senior 
management approval.

We look forward to working with you.

Sincerely,


Chris Booth

Chris,

The only problem I have with the CA is that I believe section 7 is in
conflict with the confirming email on the commission. Other wise, I do not
think that I have any problems.
