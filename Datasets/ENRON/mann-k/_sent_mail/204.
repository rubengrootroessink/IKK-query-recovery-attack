This is just too funny not to pass along!  Have a great weekend!


Subject: Three Kick Rule 

A big city lawyer went duck hunting in South Louisiana. He shot and 
dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other 
side of a fence. 

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on? his 
tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, "I shot a 
duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going in to retrieve it." 

The old farmer replied. "This is my property, and you are not 
coming over here." 

The indignant lawyer said, "I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. 
and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and 
take everything you own." 

The old farmer smiled and said, "Apparently, you don't know how we do things 
in Louisiana. We settle small disagreements like this with the Louisiana 
Three Kick Rule." 

The lawyer asked, "What is the Louisiana Three Kick Rule?" 

The Farmer replied. "Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me 
three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up." 

The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he 
could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The 
old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and 
walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy 
work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second 
kick nearly ripped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on his 
belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up. 

The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get 
to his feet and said, "Okay, you old coot now it's my turn." 

(I love this part......) 

The old farmer smiled and said, "Naw, I give up. You can have 
the duck."
