Kay -- We should check each on a case by case basis.  We probably would be 
better off using any definition from the ILA since it was already found to be 
acceptable by MDEA unless there is simply a better definition in the ESMA or 
some inherent conflict or gap relative to the scope of the overall 
agreement.  For any that are not obvious to you, please do not hesitate to 
continue shooting questions at us for clarification.  Should we look at 
Ancillary Services?   Thanks -- David

What is your preference when there is a  conflict between the interim 
agreement and the last draft (v23) of the ESMA.  (For instance, the 
definition of ancillary services.)  Shall I just ignore the ILA, or does it 
represent the customers' expectations?
