There's nothing special here.  Just cloudy.

I took Roscoe in to get neutered.  Neil just couldn't handle it.  Men are so 
funny like that.  Now I'm going to run some errands.  I hope the weather gets 
better for this evening.  They are still covering the weather 100% on the tv, 
and it looks like it is getting better.  Still more of a deal south of here.
