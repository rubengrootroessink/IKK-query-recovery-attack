I would really appreciate your advice.  I have to learn it somehow, and I 
know that you have an excellent idea of what works.

Thanks,

Kay

Mark is the signer of opinions and I know what he will sign and what he 
won't, so I'll be glad to help you through it but it's

They have a financing out in the letter agreement.  We have to use 
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver GE consents, but I don't recall 
anything about in other financing docs.

Is someone in the dept designated as the opinion reviewer?

I guess I'm not sure I know what's in the letter agreement.  If it's a done 
deal, I'd say no or at least maybe.  We only give due authority opinions and 
we try to narrow our obligations to lenders under Consent Agreements

Nice touch, sending this the day after the letter agreement was signed.  Can 
you enlighten me on the ENA procedures and sensitivities to these types of 
docs?

Thanks,

Kay
