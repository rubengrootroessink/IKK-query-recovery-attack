Gentlemen,

Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?  I would 
appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.  I have 
the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm trying 
to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I'm open Tues am and most of Wednesday.  I can probably work my schedule 
so that I'm available quite a bit of next week.
