I'm working through the "agent for" issue, and thought I would share the 
info.  I've asked our local counsel for  a bit more direct answer (ie, his 
opinion).

Subject: Joint agency as reseller of power

I've recopied below Miss. Code Ann. Sec. 77-5-727. Subsection (u) appears to 
answer your question, at least as to purchases of electric power. I'm not 
aware of anything under the joint action agancy law that empowers the entity 
to buy gas on behalf of its members. 

Section 77-5-729 provides authority for the member utility to contract with 
the joint agency to purchase power. It's recopied below as well.

o 77-5-729. Contracts by members to buy power from joint agencies 
Current through End of 2000 3rd Ex. Sess.
References
Any municipality which is a member of the joint agency may contract to buy 
from the joint agency power and energy required for its present or future 
requirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified 
projects.  As the creation of a joint agency is an alternative method whereby 
a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of 
ownership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality 
so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the 
contract whether or not a project is completed, operable, operating, retired 
or decommissioned and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, 
interference, reduction, curtailment or termination of the output of a 
project or the power and energy contracted for, and that such payments under 
the contract shall not be subject to any reduction whether by offset or 
otherwise, and shall not be conditioned upon the performance or 
nonperformance of the joint agency or any other member of the joint agency 
under the contract or any other instrument.  Any contract with respect to the 
sale or purchase of capacity or output of a project entered into between a 
joint agency and its member municipalities may also provide that if one or 
more of such municipalities shall default in the payment of its or their 
obligations, with respect to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in 
that event the remaining member municipalities which are purchasing capacity 
and output under the contract shall be required to accept and pay for and 
shall be entitled proportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the 
capacity or output which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such 
contracts with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output, power or 
energy from a project may extend for a period not exceeding fifty (50) years 
from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous 
operation;  and the execution and effectiveness thereof shall not be subject 
to any authorizations or approvals by the state or any agency, commission or 
instrumentality or political subdivision thereof except as in this article 
specifically required and provided. 
Payments by a municipality under any contract for the purchase of capacity 
and output from a joint agency shall be made solely from the revenues derived 
from the ownership and operation of the electric system of said municipality 
and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or 
equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the 
municipality or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, except the 
revenues of its electric system, and neither the faith and credit nor the 
taxing power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of 
any obligation under any such contract.  A municipality shall be obligated to 
fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for electric power and 
energy and other services, facilities and commodities, sold, furnished or 
supplied through its electric system sufficient to provide revenues adequate 
to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all other 
amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenues, 
including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on bonds 
heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related to 
its electric system. 
Any municipality which is a member of a joint agency may furnish the joint 
agency with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its 
electric system or facilities and may make available for the use of the joint 
agency any personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal, which 
is a part of its electric system or facilities. 
Any member of a joint agency may contract for, advance or contribute funds 
derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or 
facilities to a joint agency as may be agreed upon by the joint agency and 
the member, and the joint agency shall repay such advances or contributions 
from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of 
the joint agency, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by the 
member and the joint agency.
