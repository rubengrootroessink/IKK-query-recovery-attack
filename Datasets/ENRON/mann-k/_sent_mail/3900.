We need to keep in mind the 30 day deadline to provide notice.  We don't want 
to give them any room to wiggle. We can always send another notice later.

Mitch/Kay -

I would include reference to two (2) major issues, the one stated on the unit 
non-performance at varying ambient temperatures and second being excessive 
vibration.  The rest of the letter looks fine.

Kay -

Not yet.  I wanted to wrap up the repairs on unit 1 first to see if we should 
add that to the mix.  Now that Mark is back, I'd like him (vice Mike Miller) 
to be the signer.

Mark, thoughts on the attached?

Has the letter gone out?

If this letter has not yet gone out, we should include the kitchen sink of 
perceived problems. I agree that the letter should be short, but lets 
eliminate their argument that we did not give complete notice.

Mitch,

Here's a first draft.  Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls 
which we need to raise.  It is better to be all inclusive than leave 
something out.



Richard, any ideas or comments?

Kay
