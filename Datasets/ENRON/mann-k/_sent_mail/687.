I am not sure if any additional items are necessary.  However, the following 
jumped to mind, and I am guessing there may be others:
1-Required Disclosure - what if disclosure is required by a legal proceeding?
2-Remedies - what, if any, remedies do we have for disclosure

My other quick thoughts are:
1-I agree that solicitation does not belong
2-Enron should be changed to enovate and we also need to cover affiliates, 
i.e. - the rest of Enron and Peoples.

That is all I can think of at the moment.  Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks - Gregg

Good timing.

You mentioned that there were a couple of things you thought should be added 
to the "employee/consultant" form.  Could you email me the topics so that I 
can take a look and make changes.  Once again I expect to be on an endless 
conference call, but I can work while I talk.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate
sign the other agreement.

If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks for your assistance.
