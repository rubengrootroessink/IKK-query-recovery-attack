SU was fun, but there was  a little incident with a streaker (more like a 
stroller on stage).  Otherwise, it was great.  Paige did really well, and she 
was front and center for most of their act.

I don't know what we are going to do about Thanksgiving.  Neil and I are 
negotiating. I neglected to discuss it with Paige this weekend, of course.  
It is hard to believe it is only a few weeks away.

Michael and I are both better, although he didn't get better until Friday 
night. 

Hi to all!

Love,

Kay

Subject: Hi!

Hello!

How did things go in Georgetown? I just wanted to see how it went and tell
you again how sorry I am that things did not work out so that we could see
you. Also, are yall going to Palacios for Thanksgiving? Are you staying at
the bed and breakfast? I think we are going to come down on Saturday morning
and we were thinking about getting a room for that night. Bobby claims that
the pink house becomes the house of snores when we all stay there. He may
have a point!

Are you and Michael feeling better??

Love you!

Lisa
