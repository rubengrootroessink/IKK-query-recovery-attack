This looks good to me.  We'll track down Janet if that is ok with you.

Kay,

The enovate appointment looks fine, but I made minor changes to the signature 
block if that is okay.



The enovate appointment looks fine if Janet can still sign as Managing 
Director of ENA.

Hi.

This is one of my top priorities.  I think it looks fine.  What do you think?

Kay - have you had any chance to give this some thought?  We are about to 
take some actions that require Board approval so I would like to get this 
finalized. Let me know.  Also, I am trying to get back on the Intercompany 
loan stuff.  I am going to be in Houston next week and have Wednesday pretty 
open.  Are you going to be in town?  If so, maybe we could get together for 
half hour or so to go over the loan stuff.

Thanks - Gregg

It looks like your memory serves you well.  Section 6.8.2 allows the Managing 
Member to designate officers of enovate.  I revised the original appointment 
declaration you prepared to reflect Laura as VP.  Take a look at it and let 
me know if it works.  If so, I will probably ask you to have Janet execute it 
at your convenience.  

Thanks - Gregg
