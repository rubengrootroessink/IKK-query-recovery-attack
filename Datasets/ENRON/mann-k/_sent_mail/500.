 Dear Kay,
 
As of this afternoon, we have not received Enron's original signature pages 
for the Letter Agreement and Guaranty.  Have these been forwarded to our 
office?  If so, please advise as to how they were sent and the expected date 
of delivery; if not, please let me know when you will be able to send them.
 
 
Thanks,
Tremaine Wright
