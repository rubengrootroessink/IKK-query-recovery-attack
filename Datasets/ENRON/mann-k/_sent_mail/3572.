Subject: Edgecombe Energy Fac. CPCN Public Data Requests 1 and 2

The ENRON window for responding to the two staff data requests is rapidly 
closing.  Final staff testimony will be this Friday.  In order to coordinate, 
facilitate, and review our submittal, a team meeting is scheduled today at 
1.00 pm in room EB2934.  Please let me know your availability.

Thanks for your help,
