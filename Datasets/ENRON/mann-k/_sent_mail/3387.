Matt, Since so much of this related to tax, I thought you should have a look 
at it.

Rusty/Fred, I'm not sure of the context of the presentation of the 
information.  Is this something which is going to the public, or to the 
governmental entity involved?  If there is something which will be 
distributed to the public, then we should consider having Enron's PR group 
bless it.

 As many of you know, we have received a number of written questions
from Livingston County which were presented to them by residents.  Enron and
our firm have  prepared and  attached an initial draft response to those
questions.  Copies are provided in Word Perfect and Word for your
convenience.  Certain of the responses deal with specific areas for which
each of you are responsible.  While we have attempted to utilize the
information that you have previously prepared, it is critical that you
approve the responses.  Please review the proposed responses and fax me any
changes or call me by noon tomorrow.  While I'm quite interested in any
comments you may have on any of the responses, please be prepare to
specifically approve or modify the following questions:

 1. Pollina - Questions 1 - 7;

 2. Farnsworth & Wylie - Questions A and B;

 3. ENSR - Questions 8, 9, A and B; and

 4. Everyone else - Everything.

 I hope to speak to each of you, but if you cannot reach me please
call Karen Way at 312-368-2152.
