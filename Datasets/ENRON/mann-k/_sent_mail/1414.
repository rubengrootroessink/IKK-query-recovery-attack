I made a couple of minor revisions.  Jake has given us until when he gets in 
tomorrow.



I changed Turbine Agreement to Turbine Contract (one place in the LOI), and 
added responsibility for filing fees in the llc agreement.  Perhaps it it 
redundant.

I'm not sure I'm on top of the LLC agreement.  Maybe we can discuss in the 
am.
