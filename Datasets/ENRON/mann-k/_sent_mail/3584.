Here's what's hot, what's not:

Virginia Power - don't know how hot it is.  We should know more on Monday. 

Chicago - just finished commenting on the Hub Agency agreement.  I would like 
to visit there next week. As you know, the Manlove monetization is still on 
the list.  Laura sent me her comments to the LOI yesterday - relatively mild, 
so the LOI should be going to Peoples in the near future.  You have the list 
that Gregg prepared on commercial/legal to do's, and he and I will work on 
those things next week.

LM stuff.  General consulting business; form 97-10 EPC for affiliate, form GE 
contract (drafted by AK) on the list.

ESA/ENA turbine sale.  Sent Ben a draft MOU.  Not a time hog.

Miscellaneous development stuff - land options, etc, for Fred and Rusty.  Not 
very time consuming.

Opps, I'm late for a meeting!  I can give you whatever details you need.  All 
things considered, I'm in pretty good shape.
