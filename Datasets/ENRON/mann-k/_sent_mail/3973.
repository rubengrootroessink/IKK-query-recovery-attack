Look at it this way, we've got MOST of the information.

Brian Barto might have the info also.  I left Brian a voice mail and asked 
him to call you or me back with the info.  He is pretty bad about returning 
phone calls, though.

I just sent him another email with the document attached.  If I don't hear 
from him, I will definitely give him a call.  Cutting out those 2 columns did 
nothing for the length of the document, so the print is still small to fit on 
one page.  I think it's readable because I can see it!

It might work better if you call. Steve is very nice.

I've sent several emails trying to find out Cheryl's last name and Jeff 
Darst's information with no response.  I'll try again.
