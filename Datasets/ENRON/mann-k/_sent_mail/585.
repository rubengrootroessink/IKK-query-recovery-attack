It is our responsibility to pay the fees, which I hope will need to be paid 
today.

Thanks,

Kay

Is Enron responsible for paying these fees?  If so, when do they need to be 
paid?

thanks,

Hi Theresa,

I'm not sure if Steve Thome mentioned this to you, but Enron is opening an 
escrow account in connection with a transaction with Delta Power.  He 
suggested that I forward the wiring instructions for the payment of the 
escrow fee of $10,500.  Please let me know what other info you need to tee 
this up.

Thanks,

Kay
