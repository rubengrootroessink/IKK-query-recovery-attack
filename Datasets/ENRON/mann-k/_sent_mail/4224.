Subject: Re: Enron Monterrey/Vitro  

Jeff and Reynaldo Garcia spoke on this subject at length, and Rey convinced 
Jeff that spitting was necessary.  AT that time the Enron Contracting entity 
was not specified to be Energia...    If you want to unsplit the documents it 
will add additional time in excess geting a consolidation agreement completed 
I think.  Please include Rey in your quest for closure.  PS  GE is now OK 
with the split.

I need help getting closure on the Consolidation Agreement.  I hope that we 
do not invent other issues as well.
