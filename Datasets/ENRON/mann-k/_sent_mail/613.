Subject: ENRON DELIVERABLES

 I just received a phone message from Rick Vicens @ Delta Power explaining 
that Hancock funds would not be able to be scheduled for release for 
Wednesday AM due to Enron's inability to deliver Escrow agreemens and Turbine 
Contracts, consents, etc.  in a timely manner.

 This deal has been sitting out their to long and there is a concern that 
Delta is buying time in order to survey the power markets in California.  
Delta issued an RFP earlier in the week for power sales from their Pegasus 
project and asking for responses by Thursday 4/26.

 Immediate closure is critical.  Please provide me with the complete list of 
Enron Deliverables that are outstanding and standing between Enron, Delta, 
Hancock and Funding.

Regards,

Jake
