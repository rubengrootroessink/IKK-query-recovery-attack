Hi Pete,

We may have a conference call with ABB on Wednesday.  Would you or Chris be 
able to call in?

Thanks,

Kay

THANKS and Merry Christmas!

I spoke to Suzanne Adams earlier.  She said that she had all of the
documents and was inserting Exhibit H-2.  Hope the closings went well.
I will be taking a lap top with me and checking my voice mail at least
twice a day if you should need me.  I'll be back in the office on
January 3rd.  Have a fun time in Austin.
