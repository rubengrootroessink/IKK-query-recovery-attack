To all:

Attached for your review and comment are forms of the initial notice letter, 
assignment and assumption agreement and bill of sale that we intend to 
deliver this Friday for a closing the next Friday on April 27.  In addition, 
please note that Rose and I are still coordinating the preparation of the 
Prepayment Notice as well as the UCC-3s.  Please call or email me with any 
comments or questions that you may have and thank you in advance for your 
attention to this matter.
