I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really=

to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive=20
commercial direction.

Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I=20
haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the=

bogey calc doc is a bit rough. [Rorschach, Reagan]  Exhibits are rough.  I=

need to make a list of Exhibits called out in the current doc version, pull=

them all together, and clean them up.=20

Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff? [Rorschach, Reaga=

  Yes.  I am not exactly sure of the context....but try this on for size: =

Clarksdale is subject to an Entergy transmission constraint that from time =

Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge=20
problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway t=

combine the two at once, given the short timeframe? [Rorschach, Reagan]  I=

Kay,

We are starting to run into some scheduling constraints for next week, at=

least with Bob Priest.  I'd like to get together with Bob and Marvin early=
=20
next week to discuss the agreement--moving toward finalizing before June 12=
. =20
Bob is only available Monday.  Bob and Marvin think it is a good ideal to=
=20
then meet with RW Beck.

I'd like to email Marvin and Bob the next version sometime today?
