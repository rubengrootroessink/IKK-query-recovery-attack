Subject: ESA equipment purchase

Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.
 
Kay
