Well,  there's an argument to be made that the remedy for breach of an option 
agreement is us suing them for specific performance, ie, making them sell us 
the land.  Since we shouldn't have any obligations under an option agreement, 
I don't worry about arbitration.  Let me think about it, though.

For some reason we did deleted the Arbritration Paragraph in the 
Electrocities Option Agreement.  Shouldn't I add it to this new Option (seems 
kind of important).
