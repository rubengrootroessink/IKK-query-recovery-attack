Hi Dave,

I was wondering if you have had a chance to look over the draft facility 
agreement? We would like to make some progress on the form this week.  In 
fact, you may hear (or have heard) directly from Dale Rasmussen, who is an 
Enron lawyer supporting one of the projects at issue.

There are also some change order type changes which need to be captured in 
words and made a part of the individual facility agreements, or integrated as 
changes to these agreements.

Thanks for your assistance,

Kay
