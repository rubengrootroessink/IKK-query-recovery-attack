Not exactly a "yes, we can close on Wednesday".

Subject: Coral closing Schedule - Part II

George called back to let me know that Coral/Tejas is now out and Intergen
is taking over.  George forwarded current drafts of the documents to John
Jones of Intergen.  George has told John that Enron is interested in closing
on Wednesday, and John was to  review the documents over the weekend.
George believes he has conveyed to John that the documents have been
negotiated on the buyer's behalf, but George is uncertain whether Intergen
will find it necessary to negotiate additional or other issues.  (It is
George's understanding that John Jones is in the legal department).  I tried
to contact John Jones directly (phone 713-374-3919), but as of late Friday,
he has not returned my call.
