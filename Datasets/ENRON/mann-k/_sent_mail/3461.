Gregg,

Sheila was telling me that Enron has an ISDA agreement with Peoples, and 
there's some guaranty language there, also.  I'll try to track this down.

Kay

ps I've asked Sara for the ISDA agreement.  I'll let you know when I get it.

I have not received anything from Clement regarding the corporate guaranty 
issue.  He recently worked on a guaranty for a deal with Alliance.  I don't 
know where we stand on either an umbrella guaranty or third parties.  Any 
thoughts or assistance is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Gregg

This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv 
company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the 
entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what 
you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.

As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided 
by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.

Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate 
guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.

Thanks,

Kay
