Hi Heather,

Any idea what the analyst starting salary might be?  If not, can you point me 
in the right direction?

I know you don't have anything better to do, but I really appreciate it.

Kay

Mom,
Quick question...Do you have any idea what the average starting salary at
Enron would be straight out of SU? We are doing this for a project! Thanks!
