Good morning.

So did I get moved?  If so, please don't worry about unpacking.  I actually 
prefer to do it myself anyway.

I'm not checking voice mail, so if anyone calls I'm on vacation.  Period.  
I've spoken to Sheila and Gregg Penman, and I'm taking care of what they 
need, but if I take on anything else, I might as well pack Michael up and 
come to the office today.

Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.  See you Monday!

Kay
