He just came up here to meet with Chris Booth.  I asked him if you had told 
him anything and he said "Oh, you mean about Peggy?  Well, there is no way I 
can do Mexico and all this stuff too".  I think he is a little overwhelmed 
right now.

You got it.  I asked Carlos if he still speaks espanol.  You should have seen 
his face.  He looked like he had swallowed a bug.

Needless to say I had a pretty good idea of the location of the bottleneck.  
Otherwise, I would have called you.

Peggy Banczak quit.  She told me herself, so it must be true.

Kay,

I think your memory is correct.  You asked me to get this stuff to Ed, which 
I did.

Subject: GE contracts

In speaking with Lee Johnson this am, he mentioned that he is still missing 
final contracts for PSCO and CA Development.  I seem to recall that Sheila 
had asked someone to pull this together, and that I had given Kathleen the CA 
Development stuff.   I could be off track, but that's how I remember it.  
There's probably someone with a better memory.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Kay
