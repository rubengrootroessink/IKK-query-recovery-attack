I'm glad she sounds so good.  Maybe she can be a back up for next Thursday.

Subject: Choc

Just got off the phone and she wants to pick Michael up from school on
Friday the 27th. I told her we would be home around noon on Sunday and she
said that was find but they might be out and about! She sounded great! She
is busy on the 21st so I thought I would try grandma again. I plan on
stopping by this evening to work on the pager issue.
