Enron has signed the docs, except for the revised escrow instructions, yet to 
be received.  Ben will be coming to  your offices at 900, so he can sign the 
instructions at that time.

I've pulled the financing documents from the stacks.  I hope to have a copies 
of the docs tomorrow, and if so, I'll have something to give Intergen.

See you tomorrow!

Kay
