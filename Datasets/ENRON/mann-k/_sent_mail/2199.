Sorry about the serial emails.  

I need electronic versions of the final acknowledgement letters for both ABB 
and GE, so that these can be emailed to them.  

Please prepare a closing list.  Between this and the financing side, I'm 
chasing quite a few documents.

I hope to have the escrow agreement signed today, but I would really like to 
know we have the amendment finished.

Thanks,

Kay
