Hi.  Just checking in.  Michael and I are having a nice morning.  I've got my 
computer plugged in to my home line, but my cell phone is on.   Michael has 
an appointment at 230, so I will be out of a while.  

This is great stay home weather.  I have fires in the fireplaces.  All I'm 
missing is the smell of bread baking!

Kay
