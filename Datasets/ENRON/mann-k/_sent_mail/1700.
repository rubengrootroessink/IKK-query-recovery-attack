Could you check out the sitter thing?  We could drop off Michael and take the 
Enron Field shuttle.  I don't need to stay late - I'm sure 2 hours would do 
it.

I would like to go to the Enron booth but it's truly your call. I bet we can
get Choc to help but I need to call her asap...
That's neat about the head of the PTL group.
I think you should do some mom and son stuff with Michael. Your right about
me and a large group of people on a boat...
love, NM

Hi.

How's it going?

Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a
little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.

The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her
know if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.

I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.
I figure you guys have lots of "guy only" stuff coming up, but there aren't
a lot of "mom/son" opportunities.  (be realistic)  Maybe we should take a
Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.

Love,

ckm
