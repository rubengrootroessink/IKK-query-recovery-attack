Hi Gerry,

I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.  I remember 
seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if 
payment isn't due yet.  I always thought that was strange, and sure created 
clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does 
Dewey remember?  If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave 
many folks who would have done so.  I guess they could have changed the laws, 
though.   Sorry I'm not more help.  I've forgotten more than I've remembered.

If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday 
at Keneally's, staring around 7.  I'll buy.  I can't  believe she is 21. Very 
disruptive of my self-perception.

Ciao,

Kay

Hello Kay---

I need some free legal advice and you are my favorite attorney.  I'll buy
you a drink as payment in kind.

Try and remember El Paso work in Arizona.  Arizona has statue that says you
must make a twenty day preliminary notice to file a lien.  If you don't file
such notice you waive your right to ever file a lien.  I remember this from
our previous work out there.

We have a vendor who is supplying services to one of our subcontractors.  He
has sent us a twenty day notice to file a lien.  There is no dispute but he
is sending the notice anyway.  I understand all of that.

My question is this----it asks for us (BE&K) to sign and acknowledge receipt
of the notice.  It doesn't exactly read like I am required to acknowledge
receipt.  What do you think or remember?  Am I required to sign the notice
or not.  Minor point I know, but I'd rather not raise the flag in
Birmingham.

Thanks.  I really just want to hear from you and this is all I could come up
with for an excuse to write.

Gerry Turner
