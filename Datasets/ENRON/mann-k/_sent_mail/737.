David Duran can sign the certificate.  Can he certify his own name?  If so, 
we want him to also be a signatory.  Authorized signers should be Dave Duran 
(managing director),  Michael J Miller (vice president) and Kevin Presto 
(vice president).

Kathleen, please verify the way these guys like to sign their names, and 
current titles.  Let me know if you think we should use someone else.

Chris, we need a name and a call back number for whoever will be watching for 
the wires.  They will be a call back person. Other call backs are me (using 
cell phone 713 3047816), Ben Jacoby (415 265 8365).

Thanks,

Kay
