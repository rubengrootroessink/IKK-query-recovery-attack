John,

I appreciated your help.  I'm glad we got to do a real deal, even if it was a 
strange one.  More to come!

I'll check on the sitter, but dinner on the 2nd sounds great.

Kay

Kay-thanks again for the opportunity to work with ENA on the InterGEn deal-I
hope you were satisfied with us.

Could you and Neil come to our house for dinner on Feb. 2?
