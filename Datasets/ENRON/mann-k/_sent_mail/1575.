Hmmm.  Very interesting.  I doubt AIG thinks of itself as being in the middle.

Ozzie,

I want to retain the option of keeping Alamac (create a control area), and 
selling New Albany.   From a desk perspective, retaining at least one control 
area is strategically important, and if I can sell New Albany for $175 
million and keep Alamac for $20-30 million, we may want to do that.   

Given the strength in the long term gas market ($4.50 - 5.25/MMBtu over a 15 
year period), it is much easier to hedge the forward value of a coal plant.   
On  the other hand, peakers are literally worth zero on a forward basis, 
given low heat rate forward pricing.

Can we remove AIG from the middle, if necessary?
