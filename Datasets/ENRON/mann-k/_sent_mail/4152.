Sorry guys:

I added the clause on the Parent Guarantee and without thinking, made it a GE 
obligation.  It was supposed to be an Enron requirement.  So I have corrected 
that in Clause 15.  GE already has the same obligation in the Contracts.  

John Schroeder:  This will be the Version that we execute, so please forward 
this one to your guy in Mexico.
