Kay-Carolyn is out until tomorrow.  She has the originals.  Can you wait
until then?  If not, I'll retrieve them.

ABB is asking for its original of the facility agreement.  In fact, I need
to get originals of the ABB and GE facility agreements to ABB and GE.  When
can I get those docs?

Thanks,

Kay
