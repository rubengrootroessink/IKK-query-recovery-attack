Subject: LM6000 Contract Payment Allocations

Folks:

Based on our meeting with GE last Friday, we have decided to allocate post 
Nov. 15th payment obligations to the stand-alone LM6000 turbine purchase 
agreements as set forth in the attached spreadsheet. Please let me know if 
you have any questions or comments.

Regards,


Ben
