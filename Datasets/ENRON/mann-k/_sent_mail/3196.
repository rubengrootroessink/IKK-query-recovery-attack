Would you believe I don't know how late the maid stays?  I think on most 
Tuesdays she comes in the afternoon, but beyond that I really don't know.  I 
don't know if Paige will be here still, but she might.  Buy you really don't 
need to do that, as we don't mind getting it whenever we next come to 
Palacios -  makes the fun last longer.  We won't even celebrate our 
anniversary until the weekend, as I will be out of town Tuesday-Wednesday 
(New York), and Neil is gone Thursday-Friday (Dallas).  Tag team parenting!  

Love,

Kay

Dad and I knew you were busy this monthbut wanted you to know we were here
and fishing was pretty good. We are going home next Saturday so we can get
back.We will probably come back the next week-end. We will be here all the
monthof Nov. Lee and Pat  are coming the 4th of Nov..Joyce and kenneth are
coming the next week-end. We have your Anniversary present here,also part
of neil's Birthday. we can't mail them, so would it be O.K. if we bring
them to Houston Tuesday afternoon and leave them with the maid? Isn't that
the day she works? How late does she stay?  We love you
