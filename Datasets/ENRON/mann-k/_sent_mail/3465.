I don't know what I have in mind.  Austin?  Palacios?  

I'm still struggling with the concept that if we see my parents for a 
holiday, we have to include your mom, or vice versa.  That just wasn't how it 
worked in our family growing up - we typically spent holidays with one or the 
other, rarely with both. I'm trying to figure out the rules.

I haven't heard from St Francis yet.  

Kay

I would think so. What do you have in mind?

Anything from St F? I haven't followed up with after school care there. I
don't have the information they sent. Do you?

Here's a question.  If we have Thanksgiving dinner in Houston with your
mom, would we have flexibility to do something afterwards?

Just checking...
