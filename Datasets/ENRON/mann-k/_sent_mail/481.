11 should be fine.  Jake called.  He wants to go to dinner tomorrow.  
Actually, he wants Ben to take us to dinner (I am going to invite Ben).

The list includes:

You
Me
Caroline
Carlos
Jake
Ben
Fred

Can you make it and ask Caroline if she can make it?  Can you think of anyone 
else?

Does Pappas Steakhouse sound OK?

Kathleen is coming up to help me set up.  How about 11?

If you see Kathleen, can you give her the membership certificates?  I'll have 
a stack for Duran later.

No, I just glossed over it.  I am a speed reader... I only read every other 
word.

When do you want us to come up?

I've asked for it separately (second item below).  Did I misunderstand your 
question?

I'm setting up a table with all the stuff for signature now.

Kay,

Do the retainage LOC's flow from the receipt of funds letter, or do we need 
to tee up those separately?

Good morning.

In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the 
following today:

GE parent guaranty
LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
Opinion of counsel

And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.

Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co Gen 
contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.

Thanks,

Kay
