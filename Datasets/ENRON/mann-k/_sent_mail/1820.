I've sent it to the Finance group who will obtain LJM signature.  If I have 
any problem (ie, it looks like it won't be done this week), I'll let you know 
so maybe you can expedite on the commercial side.  I'd like to give them a 
day or two first.

That's the correct amount.  The payment is due, according to the contract, 
"10 business days of complete execution of this agreement". Kay is getting 
the last sig now.  Kay, can you advise when you expect execution?

Mitch -

We are trying to finalize the costs for the 2000 peakers and Mike Miller said 
that you are working on the settlement with Westinghouse.  Is the amount 
still estimated at $1,567,099?  Do you know when this payment will need to be 
made?


thanks,
