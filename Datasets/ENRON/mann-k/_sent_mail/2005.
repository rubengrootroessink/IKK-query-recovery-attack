Thanks for hanging in there and getting it done.  

How come you didn't tell me that you didn't get Ben's initials?  I never 
expect to have to follow up with you to see if you did what we discussed.  I 
just always assume that you've taken care of it, unless you tell me 
otherwise.  I don't want to change my expectations.  Deal?

Just wanted you to know the docs went out Friday night.  I guess you figured 
out from Janet's comment that I did not get Ben's initials on the documents.  
She wasn't upset about it though.  Anyway, just wanted to acknowledge my 
mistake.

See you and have a good weekend.  I had to come in today to get some stuff to 
work on for Stuart.  I think I will go by Hebert's on the way home!
