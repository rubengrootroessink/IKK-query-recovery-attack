I  checked all my emails, and I don't have any indication that I 
received/reviewed this version of the document.  The redline is the redline 
against the last version I have on file.  If the other folks sign before it 
has been reviewed internally, it is possible that changes will be required.  
It won't be extensive.

I will ask Karen Way to call me before making changes to drafts, or at least 
advising me via email so that things will flow more smoothly.

Kay,

I don't get why we're changing this document at this time.  This deal has 
already been signed by the landowner and Herman said it was o.k. as it 
stood.  
The only thing we decided to do was keep track of our renewal option since at 
the time it comes up we will exceed the 5% deal.

I ran a redline from the last version I had electronically. 



I've forwarded the current version to Herman for his review and approval.  
Due to some of the changes, Enron may need some revisions as well.
