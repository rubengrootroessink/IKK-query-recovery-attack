"Hello, my name is....."
You are cordially invited to a Northeast Region Off-site to be hosted by Jeff 
Ader - NE Origination.  This off-site will allow us to formally meet each 
other (since we haven't really done that yet) and discuss our goals as a 
group for the upcoming year.  Some things we would also like to touch on will 
be the  responsibility to generate income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead 
strategy formulation, provide information and generate strategic positions.  
Come prepared to discuss whatever questions or concerns you may have.

  Time:  Tuesday, January 16/01
    12:00pm - 5:00pm
  
  Location: Hyatt Regency Hotel 
    1200 Louisiana (across the street)

  Conference
  Room:  Dogwood A & B  

   
  * Lunch will be provided



                  

Hope to see all of  you there.  If you have any further questions feel free 
to give me a call.
