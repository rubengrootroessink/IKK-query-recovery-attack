Stan, 

Could you please me send me the electronic file of the executed EPC 
contracts, including the consolidation agreement?

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Assignment of GE Contract regarding Vitro Project


Following discusions with Kay Mann and Robert Stephens we revised the 
Assignment Agreement to have the payment terms for the GE Turbine 
incorporated in the Assignment Agreement and to provide Enron North America 
the option to have the GE Turbine either returned to it or returned to EEIM 
upon  termination of the EPC Contract.

Attached is a revised clean version of the Assignment Agreement and a redline 
showing how the revised version is different from the original.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 221-1524 with any questions.

Stan Jensen
