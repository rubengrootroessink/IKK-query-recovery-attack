I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of 
where my computer would be if I was there.  It is a lawyers name (which of 
course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.  It may be 
David something or other.  Could you email me that name and number?

Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?

Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.

Kay
