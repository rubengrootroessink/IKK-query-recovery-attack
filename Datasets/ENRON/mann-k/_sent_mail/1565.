As I mentioned to Scott, we are engaged in active discussions with PB (on 
behalf of Co Op City) concerning whether Enron will have any role in the EPC 
activities. In light of those discussions, I suggest that the meeting 
scheduled for today be postponed until after Mark and I speak with PB 
tomorrow  afternoon.

I discussed this with Mark, and he is fine with postponing the meeting.

Thanks,

Kay
