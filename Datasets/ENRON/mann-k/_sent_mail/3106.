Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be 
appreciated.  

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility 
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay

Paul,

When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting
urgent.

Thanks,

Kay
