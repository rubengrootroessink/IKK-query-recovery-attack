FYI.  I don't know what I think about this email.  I will say that I've heard 
good things about Clark, but haven't worked with him.  Also, there is a big 
difference between a transmission project and a power project, since 
tranmission assets are treated differently from an accounting standpoint.  
Obviously, I don't consider the question of who is handling this (internally 
or externally) to be resolved, pending further discussions.

Understand from John Moore that there is a new solid fuel power project being 
discussed for the Brownsville area, and that you will be involved.  I would 
really like to talk to you about this at your convenience.  As you may know 
from John, we have been very involved with the Tex Mex transmission line 
project that we have done with BPUB and that has just received board 
approval.  We have a very good relationship, I believe, with BPUB, the Port 
of Brownsville and their respective counsel from that transaction.  John also 
seems to believe the deals with BPUB and the Port will be structured along 
the same lines as the transmission project, and as the draftsmen for not only 
the docs with BPUB, but also the Port,  we are also obviously very familiar 
with these documents as well.  

Could we possibly talk about this project at your convenience?  We would 
really like to do a deal with you and your team and given our background on 
the first project, it would seem to make a lot of sense from your point of 
view as well.  I would be happy to drop by to discuss staffing, timing, etc. 
whenever it would work best for you.  

Many thanks - look forward to hearing from you.
