Hi Reagan,

Is a conference room available on 29?  We are having a hard time finding a 
meeting place.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject:  VEPCO interconnection agreement

How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO
interconnection agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19?

I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm.

Details to follow...

Thanks,

Kay
