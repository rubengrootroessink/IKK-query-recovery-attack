That would be great.  We can leave his "stuff" by the front door.  I know he 
will have things he wants to bring to show you.

Michael asked me for advice yesterday.  ("Mom, I have a problem...").  He now 
has 2 girlfriends, Ashley plus a new one, Marilyn.  He was torn.  He decided 
to stick with Ashley. Oh, the problems of a 6 year old!!

Michael is very excited about the weekend.  He just doesn't think it will be 
long enough!!

Thanks for everything,

Kay

   No problem as far as I am concerned.  I can just pick up the
antibiotics and anything Michael has forgotten on the way back after I pick
him up.

Hi Charlotte,

I'm glad you wrote, as I was going to write you.

Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.  He is on two
antibiotics which he takes twice a day.  I'm trying to figure out how to
get these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.  Obviously, if
Michael  isn't doing great I won't go.  Currently, he feels fine, and only
feels bad when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the
fever should go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know
if you aren't comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on
Saturday, or not at all.

Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is
Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.

We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday
night I will be staying in Round Rock (going to Paige's homecoming in
Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.

Michael says hi, by the way.  He is watching me type this.

Kay

           Don't forget to let me know where you will be staying in San
Antonio.  Also, what is Michael's doctor's last name.  I know it's Reynaldo
something.

           Thanks.  Have a great time and don't worry about Michael.
