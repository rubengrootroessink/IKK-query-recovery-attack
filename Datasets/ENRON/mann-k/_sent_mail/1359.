I had coconut cream  pie for lunch (also tuna).  I feel so guilty.  Light 
dinner for me.  And maybe a vodka (NO WINE).  

If I can get time to call Nathaniel, I will.  I'm in a conference call now.

I feel guilty about being gone Sat. night if Paige is home for SB.  It does 
sound like a good weekend weatherwise.  I can check with her to see her 
preference.
