Speaking of tennis, Michael asked Neil if he can teach him how to play.  Neil 
said no, since he doesn't know how.  I told him I can play, and now Michael 
thinks I should play with him, then he will teach Neil.  Very elaborate plan!

Remember how we used to hit tennis balls against the house?  Can you believe 
we never broke a window?  We have a detached garage, but the door is metal.  
I can't imagine how loud that would be!

I remember trying to encourage Paige to swim, bike, whatever.  Pushing NEVER 
helped.  She can swim and ride, so I guess it worked out ok.  She never 
showed any interest in playing on a sports team, even though she used to go 
to my softball games.  Whatever.

Time to go home!

Love,  Kay

Hi! It's good to hear from you. This is just a quick note, that I'm not sure
you'll even get in time. But, I just got off the phone with Mother and she
asked me to ask you to call her when you get home, or she'll call you around
6:30.

Dad's sonogram is scheduled for next Tuesday at 3:45. I think that's what
she wants to tell you.

Well, Annie is outside pounding the tennis ball against the wall. I guess I
should go and give her a glove to pitch to. Oh, by the way. When she was
Michael's age we signed her up for t-ball. She spent the first practice in
tears. So, we pulled her off and waited before we started her. Now she loves
playing the game.

Enjoy the beautiful afternoon!

I love you!

lisa
