We've reserved the two upstairs bedrooms which are connected by a porch with 
telescope.  Do you have a prefence as to which you want (just is case we get 
there early)? 

You can look them up at http://www.bbhost.com:8008/moonlightbaybb/

We have Moonlight and Roses and Moonglow.

Ta ta for now,

Kay
