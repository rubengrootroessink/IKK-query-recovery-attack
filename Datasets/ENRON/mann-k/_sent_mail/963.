Here's a starting point.  I've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like 
this [ ], but I'm sure there are more questions than [ ]s.  I'm really 
unclear on the financial aspect of the deal.  



Reagan, I didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in, as I thought it was 
better to get the doc in your hands (and Mr. Fairley's) for a detailed review.
