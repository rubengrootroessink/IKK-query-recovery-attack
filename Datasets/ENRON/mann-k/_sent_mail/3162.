Chris Calger will sign for ENA on #2.  I believe his title is a vice 
president. Dale Rasmussen has offered to handle signature. I haven't gone 
through all my emails to see if it is ready to go.

Janet will sign #3 and #4.

Kay:

Is Rev 8 ready to be signed?

If so, who will sign it for ENA?

Please let me know if I should be taking care of the signing.

Thanks.
Kathy
