Why don't you try feeding her again at night?  Maybe she will sleep better.  
I feed Jack twice a day, and he is still skinny as a stick.  Isn't she on the 
thin side anyway?  

All dogs go through adjustments.  She may be trying to find out who is the 
boss.  There are lots of little tricks I can tell you about to show her you 
are the boss.  I'll try to make you a list while you are gone.  CRATE TRAIN 
HER!!  It is one of the best things you will ever do for yourself.  She may 
fuss at first, but she will love it. Crating her will calm her down. I 
believe the Pointer Rescue people agree.

I think I'll try the treat approach and see if that helps.  I scold her and 
then tell her I love her and pet and kiss her and she pops right back.  She's 
not a dumb dog, just a stubborn dog!

I'm not feeling very good again today, probably lack of sleep!  She was 
looking pretty drowsy herself this morning too, she didn't get her 10 hours 
of sleep.  I bet the neighbors are just loving us.  Oh well!

I'll print this out now.  How many of those pigs ears can I give her at 
night.  We feed her in the morning and she's hungry again at night.  Although 
dogs are pigs and always want more.  Help!

If I had a printer, I wouldn't ask you to print this, but since I don't....

Thanks,

Kay

PS  Don't worry too much about Ruthie.  You'll get her figured out.

ESA, EECC and Finance Teams,

Attached for your review is the Electrobolt EPC Contract (our doc # 
39444.04), which incorporates the negotiated provisions of the Electrobolt 
MOU.  To assist you in your review, I have also attached (1) a blackline of 
the Electrobolt EPC marked to show all changes from the RioGen EPC Contract 
distributed October 17, and (2) a blackline of the Electrobolt EPC marked to 
show all revisions to the EECC form EPC contract.

Please note that the comparison document, prepared by DeltaView, shows new 
text in blue double underscore, deleted text in red strikethrough, and moved 
text in green (double underscore at the new location, strikethrough from 
where moved).

Please call if you have questions/comments.

Regards,
Dave Gohlke
