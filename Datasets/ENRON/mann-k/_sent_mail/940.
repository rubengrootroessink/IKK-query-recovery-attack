Hi Reagan,

Could you locate, cut and paste and email me the definition of "native load" 
from the Entergy tariff?

I need the location of the interconnection for the defn of delivery point.

Aren't we missing some time in the defns of On/Off Peak that you gave me.  
Aren't 2 hours missing?  Is on/off peak an everyday thing, or seasonal?

What are we going to do about defining profit (and costs)?

Do we need to give a place for meetings, and if so, where should these 
meetings be? (13 c).

More to come...

Thanks,

Kay
