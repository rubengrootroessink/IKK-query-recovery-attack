Here's the latest version.  It looks ok to me.  The most substantive aspect 
of it is that Calumet Power (or its affiliate) could end up the indemnity 
obligations under the agreement.  (in other words, an entity without a lot of 
money to fund indemnity obligations)  In my opinion this isn't important in 
the context of the option.

Unless someone objects, I'll tell PERC that Enron is ready to go with the 
assignment.
