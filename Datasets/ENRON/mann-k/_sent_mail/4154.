Brain,
This version is OK.
Looks like you have some extra text in the headings for items 14 & 15, for
the other software package.

John,
*   GE can sign this version of the consolidation agreement (Brian can
edit the headings for 14 & 15).
*   The last versions of the On & Off Shore agreements can be signed
(Those with Brain's 12/Jun/00).
*   The "Letter (Termination) Agreement" can be signed (The version with
K. Mann's 13/Jun/00).
Please advise status of GEIOC signature on Consolidation Agreement and
On-Shore Contract

Regards,
Jeff Smith

Sorry guys:

I added the clause on the Parent Guarantee and without thinking, made it a
GE
obligation.  It was supposed to be an Enron requirement.  So I have
corrected
that in Clause 15.  GE already has the same obligation in the Contracts.

John Schroeder:  This will be the Version that we execute, so please forward
this one to your guy in Mexico.
