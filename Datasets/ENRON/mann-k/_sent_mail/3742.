We are at the MOU stage.  Need to keep off the balance sheet duly noted and 
emphasized in a commercial meeting last Friday.  Commercial leads at ENA and 
Global Finance are out this week, so no progress at the moment.  The 
information I was given is that we want to get it done by the end of 
September.  How does this sound?

Kay

PS  Also includes 2 transformers.
