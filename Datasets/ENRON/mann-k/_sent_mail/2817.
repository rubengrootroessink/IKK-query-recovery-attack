I emailed Jeff and told him what I'm up to today, by the way.

I've made changes to the attached document. I modified the prior draft so 
that the Purchase Amount is reduced by the full amount of the two 
transformers being cancelled ($1.572 million), and so that the Cancellation 
Charge of $323,200 be paid upon execution of the Change Order.

Kay, if you're OK with this, please forward to Sandridge for ABB's review and 
approval.

Regards,

Ben
