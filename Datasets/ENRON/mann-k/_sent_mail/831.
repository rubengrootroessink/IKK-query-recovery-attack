Subject: ENA/NorthWestern: Revised Letter Agreement and Exhibits


I am attaching for your review marked and clean copies of the following
documents:

1. Letter Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and NorthWestern
Generation I, LLC;
2. ENA Promissory Note (Exhibit A);
3. First Amended and Restated LLC Agreement (Exhibit C);
4. Escrow Agreement (Exhibit F); and
5. ENA Guaranty (Exhibit G).

In addition, I am attaching a preliminary draft of Enron's form of
Assignment and Assumption Agreement (Exhibit B) with the caveat that the
document remains subject to changes pending further review by Enron.  Please
note that I am not attaching (1) a copy of the GE Guaranty (Exhibit E)
because we are satisfied with Paul Hasting's draft of this document and (2)
the LLC Promissory Note (Exhibit D) because Marguerite will circulate this
document as soon as she is done preparing it.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Marisa Reuter
