Subject: Planning Meeting for Clarksdale/Yazoo City

Last night Marvin Carraway, General Manager of Clarksdale Public Utilities, 
presented our LOI to his board.  They approved it, and he signed it.  
Thursday night Bob Priest, General Manager of Yazoo City Public Utilities, 
will present to his board and sign it as well.  The two cities formed a joint 
action agency called Mississippi Delta Electric Agency (MDEA).  

Everyone should have received the LOI via email on Monday.  Let me know if 
you didn't.

We need to have MDEA functional by May 1 to coincide with their exit from the 
Municipal Electric Agency of Mississippi (MEAM).  David Fairley and I are 
planning to visit Clarksdale and Yazoo City Monday and Tuesday to talk with 
them about all the activiy that is about to start up.

In order to identify and coordinate all of this, we would like to have a team 
meeting.  If I left anyone off of the distribution list, please have them 
attend, and I'll get them added.

Time:   11.30 am Thursday morning (3/29/01)
Duration: We have the room for 2 hours
Place:  EB3321
Food:  Lunch provided

I am pulling together an agenda/list of known issues and will email out later 
today.  If I don't get to everyone before then, send any ideas/issues to me 
by email.

Thanks,

Reagan Rorschach
