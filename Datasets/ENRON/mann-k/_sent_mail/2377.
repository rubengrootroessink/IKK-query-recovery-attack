Hi Carolyn,

In order to discourage Ben from continuing to direct outside counsel, please 
address as much correspondence as possible to me, or to me and him.  Ben is 
terrible (and shameless) about violating Enron policy in this regard, and I 
don't know that I can stop him, but I do need your assistance in curbing him 
as much as possible.

Thanks,

Kay
