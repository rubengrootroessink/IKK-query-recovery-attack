I believe we are in a position to finish this contract today (or tomorrow) =
if=20
we can get buy in on the change in assignment highlighted in red below (las=
t=20
paragraph of 22.2).  Previously, the unfettered right to assign arose at=20
Acceptance.  This change allows us the flexibility to pay for a unit and=20
assign it to anyone, and not have to wait until the unit is satisfactorily=
=20
completed, installed, etc.=20

Please let me know if this change is ok, and if WestLB will be in a positio=
n=20
to sign this agreement tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

ARTICLE XXII.  ASSIGNMENT

22.1   Assignment by Seller.  This Agreement may not be assigned by Seller=
=20
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which shall not be=20
unreasonably withheld.

22.2   Assignment by Purchaser.  This Agreement or any right or obligation=
=20
contained herein may be assigned, from time to time, by Purchaser or Agent=
=20
without Seller=01,s consent to:

(i) Agent (in the case of an assignment by Purchaser) or an Affiliate of=20
either Purchaser or Agent;

(ii) a joint venture, partnership, limited liability company or other simil=
ar=20
entity in which Agent or any of its Affiliates is a venturer, partner or=20
participant with no less than a nineteen and one-half percent (19.5%) equit=
y=20
interest;

(iii) any Lender;

(iv) any Indemnified Party;

(v) any entity for the purposes of financing or sale of the Facility;

(vi) any party (1) for which Agent or any of its Affiliates has agreed to=
=20
construct or develop a facility using the Equipment, or (2) to which the=20
Agent or any of its Affiliates has agreed to convey a power plant project=
=20
which it has under development; or

(vii) any contractor or developer (including, without limitation, Enron=20
Engineering & Construction Company and/or NEPCO) which is retained by=20
Purchaser or Agent or any of its Affiliates to construct or develop a=20
Facility using the Equipment.

In the case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or (vii)=
=20
(other than  Enron Engineering & Construction or NEPCO), Seller shall be=20
entitled to request and receive an appropriate guaranty, letter of credit,=
=20
payment bond or other reasonable form of payment security, in amount not to=
=20
exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time o=
f=20
the assignment, unless the assignor agrees to remain liable for all future=
=20
liabilities under this Agreement.  A letter of guaranty, letter of credit, =
or=20
payment bond provided by an entity rated BBB+ or better shall be deemed to =
be=20
an appropriate form of security for the purpose of this provision.

Except for (i) through (vii) above, this Agreement or any rights or=20
obligations hereunder may not be assigned by Purchaser or Agent to other=20
parties without the prior written consent of Seller which shall not be=20
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Seller agrees to respond to=
=20
any request for consent within thirty (30) Days following its receipt of su=
ch=20
request.  Any failure to respond within the foregoing time period shall be=
=20
deemed to be a grant by Seller of its consent to the proposed assignment.  =
In=20
determining whether Purchaser or Agent shall be permitted to assign this=20
Agreement, Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its=
=20
consent if the proposed assignee does not have substantially the same or=20
better credit quality than Agent unless (a) the proposed assignee provides=
=20
appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other assurances of payment=20
issued by an entity or person with substantially the same or better credit=
=20
quality than Agent, or (b) the assignor agrees to remain liable for all=20
future liability under this Agreement.  Purchaser or Agent shall have the=
=20
right to assign or pledge, from time to time, all or any portion of its=20
right, title and interest in, to and under the Agreement as collateral for=
=20
financing of any Facility without Seller=01,s consent.

When duly assigned in accordance with the foregoing (including, following a=
ny=20
collateral assignment, upon foreclosure by any collateral assignee) (i) thi=
s=20
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the=20
assignee (and all rights hereunder, including, without limitation, any and=
=20
all warranty rights, shall be assigned to the assignee as if such assignee=
=20
were an original party hereto), and (ii) the assignor shall be irrevocably=
=20
relieved and forever discharged of all liability under this Agreement so lo=
ng=20
as the assignee executes an assumption of such liabilities.  Any other=20
assignment by Purchaser or Agent other than as permitted hereunder shall be=
=20
void and without force or effect.=20

Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, in connection with any=20
assignment permitted under this Section 22.2 to any assignee, the Purchaser=
=20
shall have the right, from time to time by Notice to Seller and without=20
Seller=01,s consent, to (i) designate such assignee to be the successor of=
=20
Purchaser hereunder, (ii) designate such assignee to be the successor of =
=20
=01&Agent=018 hereunder, (iii) designate such assignee as a sub-agent of th=
e Agent=20
hereunder, and (iv) designate that such assignee has succeeded to all of th=
e=20
rights and obligations of both Purchaser and Agent, whereupon=20
(notwithstanding the first WHEREAS clause hereof, but subject to any=20
subsequent appointment of an =01&Agent=018 hereunder) each reference to =01=
&Purchaser=018=20
hereunder shall be deemed a reference to such assignee acting in its=20
individual capacity and each reference to an =01&Agent=018 herein shall be =
deemed=20
deleted.

Upon any permitted assignment of the rights under this Agreement to acquire=
 a=20
Unit or Units, and the assumption (in accordance with the terms hereof) of=
=20
the obligations related thereto, Seller shall enter into a separate purchas=
e=20
agreement with the permitted assignee (each, a =01&Facility Agreement=018).=
  The=20
terms of each Facility Agreement will be in strict conformity with the term=
s=20
and conditions of this Agreement, except for site specific changes as agree=
d=20
by the Seller and such assignee.  In no way shall the Facility Agreement=20
increase the liability or responsibility of Seller, Purchaser, or Agent und=
er=20
this Agreement.

The parties further agree that the provisions of this Agreement relating to=
=20
assignment will only control the assignment of Purchaser=01,s or Agent=01,s=
 rights=20
and obligations under this agreement prior to payment of the Purchase Amoun=
t=20
(except for the Retention Amount) of the Unit to be assigned. Following=20
payment of the Purchase Amount (except for the Retention Amount), Purchaser=
=20
or Agent shall be permitted, without Seller=01,s consent, to: (i) assign al=
l or=20
part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (ii) convey any=20
ownership interest that it may have in the Facility and/or (iii) convey any=
=20
ownership interest that it may have in the entity which may own the Facilit=
y.=20

22.3   Agreement with Lender.  Seller agrees that if requested by Purchaser=
,=20
Seller shall enter into a direct agreement with Lender under which Lender i=
s=20
permitted to "step into" this Agreement.
