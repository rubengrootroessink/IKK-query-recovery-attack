I feel bad.  I'll at least leave a message for him this weekend.

Subject: RE: Larry

He has left town by now. They are going to a wedding in College Sta. and
will not be back until Sunday. I told him e-mail was the best way to talk to
you. He said he would try to call one time and if he didn't reach you it
wasn't a big deal.
Any more thoughts on what you would like to do tonight?
NM

Larry left me a voice mail.  Would you mind calling him and telling him
that I am tied up on a conference call that is likely to last until 500, so
I can't call him until after then.

I would really appreciate it!!!!!!!!

XXXXXOOOOOO
