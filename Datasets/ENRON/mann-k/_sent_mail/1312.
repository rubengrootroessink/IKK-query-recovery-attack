My dad is having some health issues, so they couldn't commit to next week.  I 
cleared cancelling the conference with Elizabeth, so please take the steps 
necessary to call that off.  Carlos' wife is due the 23rd, so I may need to 
cover for  him.  We'll see.  I do hope to take Michael and Rosco to Palacios 
where we can hang out, fish, play in the sand, etc.  In other words, no big 
plans, which I'm happy about.  I think Neil will miss Rosco as much as 
Michael, but he probably looks forward to having the house to himself for a 
few days.

Anything on the conference yet?  Aren't you going to see your dad with 
Michael next week?

Just a reminder that I am planning on being on vacation with my son next 
week.  My clients are aware of these plans, and I have hopes that things will 
go without a hitch.  I will be able to retrieve email and voice mail.
