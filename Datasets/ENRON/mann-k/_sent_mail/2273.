Kay,

Do you know who signed on behalf on ENA on this agreement back in June, and 
if so can you notify them that this needs to be signed again with the lone 
amendment being the Counteparty to ENA on the original LOI was General 
Electric Company, not GE Power Systems and GE Int'l.  Let me knwo if you have 
any questions.

Steve
