Hi Carlos,

Could you please get Dick to sign this?  Can he sign for NEPCO also?

Two original sigs is enough.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: THE agreement

With high hopes that this is the FINAL final version, I'm attaching what I 
believe to be the execution copy.  Some things have been cleaned up, and 
Brownsville has been added to paragraph 5.  I'm going to start collecting 
signatures.

Thanks,

Kay
