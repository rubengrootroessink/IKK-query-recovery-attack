I would mention Carlos in the email, or have it shown as sent by him.  If it 
were me (and not him), I would have you send it under your own name, but 
explain that you are helping Carlos.

Subject: Indian matter

I am getting ready to send Michelle Blaine a question regarding some proposed 
gifts that Mat Gimble and crew want to give the "new" Seminole Indian Chief.  
Would you rather the question be sent by you?  If so, let me know and I will 
explain, otherwise I will just copy you on the e-mail.
