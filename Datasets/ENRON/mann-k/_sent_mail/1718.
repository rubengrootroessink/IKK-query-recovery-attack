I'll forward the email and you can print and fax.  No big deal.

I made a mistake - forgot to send it to Lee.  I'm so sorry!  Do you have it 
and I can send it to him or will he be here in person.  I didn't write it 
down and it completely slipped my mind.  I really am terribly sorry.

Hi there,

Lee doesn't remember getting a fax from me yesterday.  Did you get a 
confirmation back?  It was the same fax that was sent to Pete Thompson.

Thanks,

Kay
