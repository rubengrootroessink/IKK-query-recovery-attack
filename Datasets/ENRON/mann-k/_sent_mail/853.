This is the first of two emails I'm sending you.  Lee revised the Salmon 
contract you did, and now it needs to be "unrevised" in these ways.

Kay:

I'm on the phone with Lee and he agrees that we need to put the stabilizer
back in.

This will change the various amounts, I think, as follows:

Unit Liability Amount:  14,103,675
Maximum Liability Amount:  56,414,700
Purchase Amount:  50,785,900

The rest of the document is okay.  We are still waiting for the lender docs
back but don't expect any show stoppers.  Lee will be back in the office
tomorrow and can sign documents (if the agreements are okay), and date
effective today if that is a requirement for Enron.

Otherwise, we'll wait for your instructions.

Kent

Me again.

Here's the version I referenced in my earlier email.  I believe we need to
restore the stabilizer stuff, but I wanted to get agreement.

Thanks,

Kay

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).
