200 is late enough for anyone to be out.  I'm all for the limo taking people 
home at that time.

I am concerned about Michael AND about imposing on Donnie and Lynn.  Are you 
taking Friday off?

I called Mikey and asked what was the latest he thought the limo would be
needed. He said 3:30. I asked if 2am worked and he said absolutely. He also
said he didn't think it mattered to Paige if it was an SUV or a standard
limo. So what do you think, SUV or standard limo?

I'm not sure what you mean about how to balance Michael. I know I'm
concerned about him getting up early and wanting to go home. That would not
be a good thing. This party is for and about Paige, and you too. I want the
two of you to be able to share this time with out you being concern about
Michael. I will be in charge of Michael Friday morning. I don't mind sitting
second chair so to speak. What do you think?

to balance Michael, etc.

working on it now...
Thurs 6/7 6pm to midnight it's looking like...
For an SUV 14 passenger it's going to be about $750.00
For a std 12 passenger limo it's going to be about $590.00
Any thoughts...
