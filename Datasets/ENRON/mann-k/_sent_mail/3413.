Subject: Quick Meeting of the Power Assets Group.

PLEASE, if possible, attend a 30-minute meeting today in 38C1.  I have a 
couple of announcements and I would like for everyone to clean off your desk 
and bring every single invoice you have to me.  Our existing procedures are 
not working now that Erica has left and we need to develop a new system.   If 
you can't attend, please see me as soon as possible.  Thanks!
