Subject: LLC Agreement Details

Kay and Ann:

Please advise of the names of the persons who will constitute the directors
of the new LLC (three appointed by Coral and one appointed by Enron).  Also,
please advise of the date (appearing in Sections 6.2(a) and (c) of the LLC
Agreement) after which the put and call may be exercised.  These items
appear to be the only outstanding information required to complete the LLC
Agreement.  Thanks.
