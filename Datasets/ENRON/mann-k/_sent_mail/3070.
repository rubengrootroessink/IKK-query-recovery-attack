Hi Barbara,

I'm on the phone with the GE folks right now, as we have a standing 
conference call with them every Wednesday at 130.  I'm familiar with the 
people and the contractual terms at issue, and will be happy to discuss it.

Kay

Kay I received a call from Dwight Beech,who used to do powere-type work....he 
is now in a different group.  While in that group he formed a relationship 
with individuals at Jones Capital Corp. They have somehow discovered that 
Enron has the above mentioned turbines and they wish to purchase 2 or 
more......I understand from Dwight that there are restrictions which affect 
ENA's right to sell the turbines to 3rd parties and that there may be ways to 
structure around these.

Please call so that we may discuss Ben Jacoby has been speaking with Dwight 
and wants a basic term sheet AND a confidentiality Agreement.   bng    I 
presume from our discussions you are familiar with the GE issues.
