Is this for the escrow or other docs?  I know Citibank does not require a 
corporate seal.  What BS!

Kathleen is out sick, so it will be a day or two.

Subject: ENA/Blue Dog: Incumbency Certificate


Kathleen:

Paul Hastings would like ENA to resign the Incumbency Certificate, since the
original Certificate did not affix the corporate seal.  Could you coordinate
this and make sure the seal is affixed to the new Certificate?  Thanks.

Call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Marisa
