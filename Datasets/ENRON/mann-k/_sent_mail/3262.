It will escalate over time. That's how it worked for me.

I'm not really discouraged, but some of the time I don't think I'm really 
earning my keep, if you know what I mean.  These Options are really keeping 
me busy, and they are interesting.  After working with Deborah, I guess I'm 
just used to doing more.  So, I guess I'll just relax and enjoy the new job!

Hey, don't get discouraged yet.  There are lots of interesting things going 
on around here.  The stuff I'm working on is very interesting as far as I'm 
concerned.  Now, it isn't always as WEIRD as what you were used to.
