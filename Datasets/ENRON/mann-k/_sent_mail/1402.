Lisa,

Sorry, I should have included you in the initial distribution.

Ben Jacoby and I are in negotiations with NorthWestern Corporation in a deal 
to place the two GE 7EA's (Blue Dog) turbines.  NorthWestern has indicated a 
strong interest in adding the dual fuel option to the February 2002 delivered 
turbine.  We hope to have NorthWestern sign the LOI by next Friday, 16 
(3/16/01) and pay the "Development Fee".  This transaction should be similar 
to the Intergen deal, with the exception that instead of moving two turbines 
out of the 24 LM 6000 master contract, we plan on assigning the entire Blue 
Dog contract to a LLC that Enron will own 100% at the time of transfer and 
then sell 80% to NorthWestern.

I want to have the change order ready for execution once we come to terms 
with NorthWestern.  In the event that the deal blows up, we will probably 
execute the change anyway.  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
concerns.

Chris

Chris,  Global Finance (Lisa Bills) needs to be kept in the loop on this, 
since this is in TurboPark.

Renee and Brian,

Please prepare a change order to add dual fuel to the February '02 delivery 
turbine.  The price and commercial information is below.  I have gotten Jeff 
Darst to extend the deadline to exercise the change order to 16 March 2001.

Please make sure we get the change order prepared before the deadline expires.

Chris
