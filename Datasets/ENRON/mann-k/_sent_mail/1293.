Dear Mr. Keffer,

Thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate
person with the Astros organization. In keeping with our family tradition,
I am a huge Astros fan, and would appreciate the opportunity to get a
"behind the scenes look" at how a professional sports organization works.

This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an
honor to be a part of it.  Any assistance you can give in putting me in
touch with the right person would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

Paige Record
