I'm flying home tomorrow, but I won't be in the office.

Does today look better?

WE NEED CARLOS!  I've picked up several new deals this week, a couple of them 
would be perfect for Carlos.

You sent it to me and I will get into it today.  Yesterday was a zoo.  I 
guess we also need to talk about the changes in officers of enovate.  When 
are you coming home?

Hello Kay -

It's been a long time since we've last spoken and I hope things are well.
In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related
to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly.  I finally
have reviewed them and have a couple comments.

The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
each agreement.  Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a
confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction.
However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular
agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in
connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual
relationship.  The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's
and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement.  Accordingly, the proposed changes
are my attempt to clarify the usual text.

Please call if you wish to discuss.  I believe my procrastination has
resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your
attention to this is appreciated.  Thanks.
