Subject: Meeting with Public Staff

I talked with Gisele Rankin, attorney for the Public Staff, about tomorrow's
meeting/conference call.  The Public Staff has not completed its review of
the material we filed on Friday, but, as I suggested to you yesterday,
Jeffrey, they will have questions about the PPA with VEPCO, gas supply and
annexation issues, and follow up cost data.  Gisele said they will also have
questions about a recent report regarding Enron's plans to build a 144MW
pure merchant facility in North Carolina to go on line next summer.  If she
thinks of anything else she will let me know.

I expect the following people from the Public Staff to be present:  Gisele
Rankin, attorney; Dennis Nightingale, engineer and head of the Electric
Division; Tom Lam, engineer and member of the Electric Division; Mike Maness
and Elise Cox from Accounting, and Tom Farmer or Calvin Craig from Economic
Research.  In other words, it will be crowded.
