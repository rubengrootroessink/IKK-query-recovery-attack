John and Fred:

I'd like to get together with you guys next week to discuss the status of the 
unit and what we do from here on out. The deal with Calpine is not 
proceeding, and we need to communicate to ENA management exactly what the 
overall status is of the unit including the generator, and what our action 
plan is to resolve issues with SW and dispose of the unit.

Are you two available Wednesday 3 PM next week? Please advise.

Mike, Ron, Chris, Kay, please advise of your availability as well.

Thanks much,

Ben

I received call from Mart T of SW.   Following are two names with telephone 
numbers of SW people in Houston who can arrange a time and access for the 
insurance adjustor to see the wet SW generator.

POC's

Willie Smith

281-604-5240

and 


Andy Kemsley

I would appreciate it if you would let me know when the inspection is 
arranged and when it to occur. (A telephone call would work best).    I think 
it makes sense for us to have an Enron project management/ technical 
representative present.-  Will you have someone from your office present- it 
might make sense given the  history on this- your call as to the present of 
an Enron RM person being present.   I assume we would have to inform the SW 
point of contact the names of the Enron people.
