I am so sorry to hear about Annie.  Did it break in a different place? I 
think they sometimes have to wait for the swelling to go down to really tell 
what is happening.

Michael had a good time. Thanks for having him.  He was SOOO excited when 
Paige got home yesterday.  He is just crazy for her.

Thanks for the bird house.  We are going to put it in the kitchen on top of 
the cabinets.

All is fine here.  Just buzy as usual!

Love,

Kay

Hi Sweetheart. We really enjoyed Michael's visit. He was very good. We were
real proud of him. We,also were glad to have a short visit with you and
Neil. Hope Paige made it home for your great meal.
Wanted you to know Annie rebroke her right arm yesterday. She fell off a
chainlink fence. May have surgery next Monday to put a pin inthe arm. I'm
not sure why they wait until to decide. She and Lisa will be home for a few
days. We have offered to help out if needed. When michael cut is toe, I
remembered we need a note from you and Neil giving us permission to take
him to doctor,if we need it. [Pray we never need it]
Iknow you are busy getting ready for your trip. Can't wait to hear about
the hotel. Unless needed we will be here until Saturday. We love you,Mother
