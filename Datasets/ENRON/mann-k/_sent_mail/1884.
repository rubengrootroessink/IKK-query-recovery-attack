Here is one option.  The problem would be getting him picked up when I'm out 
of town.  Charlotte might be able to help.  Also, there's the Presby church.  
I wonder if SOTW has something.  He might enjoy a visit.

I just got to work and got my computer up and going.  Yes, the whole ordeal 
was 1 1/2 hours.
