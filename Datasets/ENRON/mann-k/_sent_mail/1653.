I ate at the Met, so I had a big lunch.  Fridge foraging is fine.

I would get the stone delivered as early as possible, so that I can pace 
myself.  Bob said he ordered 1700 pounds, if I am remembering correctly.  
Guess I should go look.

Wow, I just got this message...
I think we should put the camera out of reach before there's no more film...
I think we should call and have some stone delivered on the 19th. or even
this Saturday. How much do you think we need?
I'm glad your not sore and I think you are doing a great job with the yard.
Eat out of the frig tonight? I'm thinking a sausage wrap and tater
tots...Love, NM

Good morning,

Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits
today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.

So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard
looks.

I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is
looking better, though.

Hope you are having a good day.

Love,

ckm
