I had a nice trip in.  I tried a slightly different route, and it was 
uneventful.  Kinda slick, though.

How much does it cost to mail a letter now?  Is is $.34?  Of course I have a 
bunch of 33 cent stamps.

I have no clue how much rock that would be.  I should measure the length of 
the beds, then I could compute how much to get, at least sort of.  There's 
some grass to be dug up also.  I think I will start with the Advil today!

I think you are right about the 1700...that's a lot rock!!

Michael saw Coach Chris getting out of his car this morning. Talk about
excited! I didn't think he could get out of the truck fast enough... I
walked the paper work to the school office.

Hope your trip in was not too bad. There were three accidents between school
and my office...

I ate at the Met, so I had a big lunch.  Fridge foraging is fine.

I would get the stone delivered as early as possible, so that I can pace
myself.  Bob said he ordered 1700 pounds, if I am remembering correctly.
Guess I should go look.

Wow, I just got this message...
I think we should put the camera out of reach before there's no more
film...
I think we should call and have some stone delivered on the 19th. or even
this Saturday. How much do you think we need?
I'm glad your not sore and I think you are doing a great job with the yard.
Eat out of the frig tonight? I'm thinking a sausage wrap and tater
tots...Love, NM

Good morning,

Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits
today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.

So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard
looks.

I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is
looking better, though.

Hope you are having a good day.

Love,

ckm
