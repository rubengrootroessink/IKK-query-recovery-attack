Subject: Master Turbine Listing

Tammy Shepperd and myself have been asked to maintain the status of Enron's 
turbine position.  This list includes the 24 LM6000s, all other ENA turbines 
and all Enron turbines to the extent information is available.  The file 
includes 3 worksheets:

Turbine Inventory:  lists the turbine, delivery, ownership, project 
commitment and other related items.
LM6000 Status:  includes delivery, configuration, project commitment and 
other related items.
LM6000 Assign:  less detailed schedule with the delivery, project commitment 
and current availability.

In the future, to maintain the integrity of this information, the file will 
NOT be emailed, but will accessible from the following location in a Read 
Only format:

O:\NAES\Master Turbine Listing.xls

It is our view that requiring users to access the actual directory will be 
the most efficient method of assuring the user is receiving up-to-date 
information.  As project needs arise or change, please email or contact Tammy 
Shepperd at (713) 853-6589 or myself at (713) 853-3526.  In addition, if 
there is other information that would be useful, let us know.

Thanks,
Mathew Gimble
