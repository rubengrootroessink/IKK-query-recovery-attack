1.  There will be a sound guarantee.

2.  Output & efficiency we definitely want FCE to exercise commercially 
reasonable efforts to achieve their expected specifications.  I am not 
certain on the other guarantee points.  My answer will be influenced by what 
ENSR and the technical people tell me.

Steve--Have you received the specifications and guarantee points for the 2.4 
MW units.  Have you forwarded to ENSR?
