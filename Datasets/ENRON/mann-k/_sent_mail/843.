I think Lima would make a great bobble head.  You better get there early.

I received an email from Alfons telling me he was resigning from Technip.  
I'm clueless why he sent it to me.  Talked to Gerry last week.  He says he is 
going to put his Kingwood house on the market.  Hmm.  I hear lots of the old 
gang is working with him now.

Have you gone to your reunion yet?  How was it?

Gotta go home but I didn't want to not write back today.  Hope you find all 
your Easter eggs.

Kay

I have to have one for the back of my car!

A friend of my Dad's gave him dice to hang on the rear
view mirror of his new 2001 Cadillac.  And he hung
them.  Kevin says some cable guys cracked up next to
them at a ligth on San Felipe yesterday.
How have you been?  How is your Dad?
