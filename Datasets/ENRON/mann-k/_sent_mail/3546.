Hey Ken,

I'm so sorry.  I'm not trying to hide!  I just found out I have a 300 flight 
to NYC on a deal I know little about, then on to Chicago, no hotel rooms in 
either city but GOTTA GO, not sure of the return. In short, I've been 
Enronized. I picked up your number on a scrap of paper instead of the travel 
agent's number (different scrap of paper I still have not found), and when 
you answered I couldn't figure out who I called. At least your email helped 
me get back to reality.

I apologize for the confusion, for not getting back to you, etc.  Please 
don't read anything into it other than your glimpse into Enron. My sense is 
I'd better not commit to anything this week, since I literally don't know 
whether I am coming or going.

Thanks,

Kay

You can run but you're not very good at hiding!
