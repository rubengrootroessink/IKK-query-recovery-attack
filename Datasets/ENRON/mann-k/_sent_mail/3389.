This is the one you looked at and left me comments.  Your comments aren't in 
this draft (timing), but I want to pick them up in the next go round.  When 
we get together to discuss stuff, maybe we can review this.  It is difficult 
to get your comments over voice mail, as I'm  just not that quick!
