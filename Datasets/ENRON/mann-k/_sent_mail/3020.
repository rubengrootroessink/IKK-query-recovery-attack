Carlos, you have much  wisdom for such a young buckeroo.

If Debbie can't decide and if you can't use the PaperCity photo (it realy is 
a good pic), I'd go with the first one.  I must say that all of them look 
pretty, well, serious.  Kinda Gore-like, you know.  

Ok, that was a low blow.  I was just kidding!!

Kay

I would opt for the photo that you had in your Paper City article about you 
being the commentator at the polo matches as that photo conveyed a more 
rugged and stylish image.  I see these pictures and think -- "Al Gore, no 
George Bush, no Al Gore, no George Bush, well I can't make up mind, is there 
a Ralph Nader picture that I can choose from?"  All that being said, if they 
were my pictures, I'd let my wife decide, otherwise, I'd be subject to an 
eternity of second-guessing.
