I suggested yesterday that you ask Sheila about the timeframe, and you told 
me you would just go ahead and do it.  I'll just tell her it isnt' ready. It 
doesn't matter to me.

I asked you yesterday when you needed these binders.  It's a good thing I had 
them almost done.  I would appreciate it in the future if you would give me a 
heads up on what is happening.  This morning Dan, Sheila and you are all 
needing things, and I'm only one person.

There is a 130 phone call today regarding the stuff you are putting together 
re GE.  It would be helpful if it was ready a couple of hours in advance.

Thanks,

Kay
