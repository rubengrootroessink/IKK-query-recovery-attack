Hi Clark,

Good to hear from you.  I'm headed to NYC this week, so lunch doesn't look 
good.  I would love to see Nancy, though.  She did a very nice job for us.

I can't find any information on Corey.  Can you give me a little background 
information?  I couldn't find him in the BP directory or website.

Hope all is well with you, and I hope we can get together soon.

Kay

Subject: Catching up


Hope all is well.  I know it has been a while and I was hoping to catch up.  
Corey Brown left me a message that you had called to ask us to work on a 
couple of divestitures in Illinois, and I wanted to thank you for keeping us 
involved.  As I have said before, we really like working with you all and 
want to be as much help as possible.  I have expanded our group so that we 
can provide more flexiblity and have greater availability to you.

Would you have time over the next week or so to grab lunch and catch up?  
Nancy Wodka will be in town on Tuesday and Wednesday, and I was wondering if 
one of those would work for you?  There is an outside chance that I might 
have to go to NC on Wednesday, but Tuesday should be fine either way.  Let me 
know if one of these works for you or if another time would be better.

Look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

cgt
