How's Annie doing?  Has she seen her regular (sigh) orthopod yet? 

Do the girls (and I guess you grown ups can probably go, too) want to go to 
SU? Are the young ladies interested in spending the night?  

I'm home with Michael (the 102 fever drill), working at home.

Hi to all!

Love,

Kay

PS  Thanks for the traffic tip.  Do the games last about 4 hours?  I can't 
remember.

Hi! Just a quick note to say that we are looking forward to seeing you on 
Saturday. I am guessing that we'll see you sometime after your function
Satudray afternoon.

The UT game is in the morning, 11:30. Just a bit of a warning, I35 will back
up before and just past game time. I know you will be driving from SA.

Give us a holler and we will be looking forward to talking with you. Now,
it's time for me to be off to the land of playdough, crayons and snotty
faces!

Love,

Lisa
