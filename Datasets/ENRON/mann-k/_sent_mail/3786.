Will you be in Friday?  If so, could you help me remember to pick up my 
parking card.  I FINALLY got a slot at the Met.

Thanks,

Kay

We now have parking spaces available at the Metropolitan Garage, which is 
right next to the Allen Center garage, for $69.00 per month, payroll 
deduction. If you are interested, please reply via e-mail by 5:00 p.m., 
Thursday, August 17.

Your access card will be ready for pick-up on Friday, August 18.

If you are currently parking in a garage subsidized by Enron, you will need 
to turn in that access card before you get a Metropolitan access card. You 
will be able to get out of your current garage.
