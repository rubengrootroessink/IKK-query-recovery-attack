 Allyson called Friday afternoon to tell me they would be sending this out 
Friday, and it needed to be reviewed quickly.  It never came.  I left a 
message Friday afternoon, asking where it was.  They sent it to me on 
Saturday. I left out the really bad part.  I had to leave early on Friday 
because Michael's sitter (who picks him up from school everyday) had a heart 
attack.  She's still in St. Luke's.

I'll take a look at it.
