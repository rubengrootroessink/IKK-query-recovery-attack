Ben:

We plan to e-mail Kay and you a redline of the LLC Agreement first
thing tomorrow morning.  We do not have many changes to the LLC
Agreement, however, we think it is more efficient to give you the
suggested language rather than general comments.

A telephone conference at 1:00 pm tomorrow is ok with Coral.  We plan
to have Don Whaley, Tom Seigler, Ann Reynaud and me on the telephone
conference.

George:

Thanks. I've attached drafts of the Facility Agreements for your
review,
and will be providing the acknowledgement letter to GE today. We will
have
comments on your changes below plus the Unit 2 letter early tomorrow.
We
would appreciate receiving comments on the LLC agreement as soon as
possible. I would also like to schedule a conference call with you and
your
client for tomorrow 1 PM to discuss the transaction so that we can be
in a
position to resolve all issues shortly. Please suggest an alternate
time if
this does not work.

Thanks again and regards,

Ben Jacoby
