Karen,

Both Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf are out of town this week, which means we 
don't have all the players from Global Finance available.  Humberto (can't 
remember how to spell his last name) from Global Finance/ENA may be 
available, and he has participated in similar discussions on two other 
projects.  At some point he will need to be involved.  

The time is fine with me.

Kay
