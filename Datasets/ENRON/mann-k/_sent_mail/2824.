Yes, such as the side letter, assignments, etc.  That may be about it, but I 
don't trust my memory.  Since there is so much to do in such a short time, 
lists help!

Thanks,

Kay

Yes.  I will get these out to you either late tonight or early tomorrow.
With regard to your earlier request for a closing list for moving the
Turbines out of the West LB Agreement, what are you referring to that
was not included in Chris Cobb's memo yesterday?

Paul/Peter,

Me again.  I have a meeting with ABB for Thursday.  Could you make me a
list of issues like you did with the GE contract (removing the comments
from the text), and blackline the new clean "commentless" version
against
the original master contract.

Thank you,

Kay
