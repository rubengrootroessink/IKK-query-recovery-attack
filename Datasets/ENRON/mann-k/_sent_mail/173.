You'll also be even more proud to know the outcome of the following text that 
I sent to one of my Mexico clients -- "Matthew, with all due respect, clients 
will be doing business with Enron as it is indentified in the introductory 
paragraph and the signature block.  Indeed, as a side note, most of  the 
documents that I have drafted or reviewed always use some form of acronym for 
subsequent references to Enron.  I am indifferent, but I know that the reason 
our accounting brethen made that comment, as well as the other comments they 
often make that seem counter-intuitive, is that it facilitates their efforts 
in ensuring that documents reflect off-balance sheet, soft costs related 
rather than on-balance sheet, hard costs.  As such, I would defer to them on 
this issue"  which was in response to "Carlos, with all due respect to our 
Accounting brethren, from a commercial point of view, potential clients don't 
want to do business with EDM, they want to do business with Enron.  So, 
please switch the EDM thing back to Enron and everything will be fine."  
Anyway, I think Herman must have forwarded  copy of those emails to Lisa who 
shared it with Joe Deffner and I happened to run into them outside just now 
and they were both congratulating me for my "toughness".  

By separate email, I'll forward you a redlined form of interconnect agreement 
that we can subsequently discuss.

Could you email me the list of issues you have encountered thus far.  Ben 
really wants me to check with you. (I'm so proud!!)

Fred / Kay:

I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with 
us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to 
utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing 
considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be 
difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
project.

I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
schedules on Friday?

I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
on the status of the tolling agreement.

Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
related to this agreement on Friday. 

Hope you both had good weekends. 

Regards,

Ben
