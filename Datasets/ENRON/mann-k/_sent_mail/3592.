Hi Bob,

Does this have anything to do with the Wisconsin site you mentioned in the 
staff meeting?

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: WEPCO term sheet - Plano

Attached is the draft term sheet for the WEPCO term sheet on the Plano site.  
I have used the 9/01 clean version of the ComEd Plano term sheet as the 
template for this document.

I have made some changes to reflect our discussions with WEPCO including the 
following:

 1. Term (3 and 5 year)
 2. Contract Base Capacity Charge ($ amount may be subject to further change)
 3. Scheduling (day-ahead only)
 4. Project Updates (term modification dates changed to reflect 3 or 5 year 
term)
 5. Commercial Operation Date Guarantee (dates change to reflect '02 start 
date/termination right triggered off of 6/1/01 notice by Seller)
 6. Delay/Early Completion Penalties/Bonus (changed to reflect different 
Capacity Charge)
 7. Availability LD's (changed to reflect different Capacity Charge)

Please review and send me your comments.  I am planning to send this document 
to WEPCO tomorrow afternoon. 

Thanks,
Fred
