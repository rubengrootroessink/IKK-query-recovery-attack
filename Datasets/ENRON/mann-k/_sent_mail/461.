In conversations with GE, it is their understanding that their guaranty
will not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow.  The
opinion letter will be faxed as soon as the GC is available, or Kent can
sign for Dan Rowley if that is acceptable.  DRowley can sign originals on
Thursday.

The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in
escrow until the LOC is delivered.

There will be three original opinions.  There is one original guaranty, and
I'm not certain of GE's willingness to give more than that.  Obviously,
there will be only one LOC.
