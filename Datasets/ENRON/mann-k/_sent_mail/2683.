Hi guys,

This is the "break out" contract for the LM's.  This particular draft was 
prepared for the City of Austin project, but we also need a TurboPark 
version. Please advise of any comments you might have.

Thanks,

Kay

Lisa/Rose,

Attached is the most recent draft of the facility agreement for the 
LM6000's.  This version was prepared for the Austin project and therefore 
lacks any DevCo specific references or requirements. Your input as to any 
lender requirements, as well as the rights and responsibilities of the agent, 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay
