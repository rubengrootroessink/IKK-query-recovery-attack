Paige wrote me at 430 this am, and said that since she was still up at 430, 
she probably won't be home in time for Michael's parties.  Should I just 
leave him after gymnastics?  I don't really want to come back the office, but 
I do want to go to Anne's.  Hmmm.  If Paige is home by 500, everything might 
work.
