Subject: Enron / Salmon  Resolutions



Gentlemen:

We have enclosed revised resolutions of Salmon Energy LLC, marked to reflect
revisions from the draft previously circulated on April 17, 2001.  Per my
prior e-mail, based on the new timing structure, ENA, as sole member, will
no longer be approving the loan from PPL, the security agreement in favor of
PPL, or the GE Consent and Agreement, all of which will now be approved and
executed by the newly elected Pegasus slate of directors and officers,
effective on the closing date.  We will leave preparation of the authorizing
resolutions for those items up to you.  Thanks.

Carolyn M. Campbell
