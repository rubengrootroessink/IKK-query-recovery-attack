Here's a rough cut.  Let me know what you think.

The fuel cells will be subjected to testing after installation to ensure that 
each fuel cell meets the performance criteria prior to CRRA accepting the 
units.  These tests will measure heat rate, electrical output, air emissions, 
noise levels and water consumption, and will last at least one hour each.  In 
addition, a seventy-two hour test will be run to ascertain that each unit is 
capable of producing the required output without outages. The final test 
protocol will establish the number of tests to be performed.

Heather:  There was a proposed ASME standard relating to the testing of fuel 
cells, but I don't know if it has been adopted yet.  If it has been, we could 
make reference to that fact that the tests will be conducted in conformance 
with ASME PT-50, or whatever it is.  I'm sure Ric knows.
