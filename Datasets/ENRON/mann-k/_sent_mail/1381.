Hi Jeff,

I need more in-depth information than what I could get from King & Spalding,  
so I asked around for a Mississippi firm.  Sheila suggested this firm, and 
Stuart said he thought they were an ok group.  As you can guess, it is a 
short list in Mississippi to chose from.  Please let me know what you think.

Kay
