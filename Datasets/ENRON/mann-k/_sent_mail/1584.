I think it can be accomplished so long as we have no obligation to agree to 
any particular terms in the definitive docs.  I don't see why we would need 
to DASH exclusivity.

See you soon,

Kay

Isn't that accomplished by having the agreement be simply an exclusivity 
agreement wherein the consideration for the duration of exclusivity is the 
$300k? Fred's checking with credit to see if we need to DASH exclusivity 
(although I find it hard to believe that we would).

Gentlemen,

I think we also need to be certain that we have a decent amount of discretion 
in whether we close, otherwise we have to consider the DASH process at this 
time.

From a commercial perspective, I don't have a problem leaving out the 
exercise price during the 30 day option period, so long as our obligation to 
sell is contingent upon the negotiation of a purchase agreement and the 
agreement on purchase price. $300k seems fair for a 30 day exclusivity.

Regards,

Ben
