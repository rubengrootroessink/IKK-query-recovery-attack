Will do...I will ask tonight.
Our phones went out about an hour ago. That's good and bad...
What did you have for lunch? I need to know because I have a plan...

I don't know.  I hate to spring it on her.  Maybe suggest it for next week
at the Houstonian.

I don't remember where this one is being held. If it's near StF I could
probably drop him off and pick him up. Do you know the hours?
Or, what do you think about me asking Charlotte to switch days? NM

This is the rock gym party.  I bought presents for this and the Houstonian
party, which is next Wednesday.

Is this the one at the Houstonian? What are the hours? Maybe I could drop
him off and come back to pick him up? NM

Yikes!  I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party.  I know
Michael would love to go.  Both my husband and I work, but I will attempt
to take off and bring him.  Thanks for the invitation.
