When I travel for more than one day, I usually take my computer and use it on

Hope you are enjoying this perfect weather!

Kay

Hi,Kay Kay. Dad  and I just want you to know how proud we are of you. Looks
like you may have snow in New York. Stay warm. Is it O. K. for me to email
you there? We are going for a walk. Love you,Mother
