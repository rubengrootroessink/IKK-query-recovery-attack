Hi Steve,

I wanted to send this to you before I send it out to others, since I feel 
like there were changes we had discussed that somehow didn't make in the last 
draft.   Guess you can say this is a sanity check!  If it looks good to you, 
then I will send it out, unless you prefer to make distribution.

Kay
