This stuff is so much better than it was 20 years ago.  It is amazing how 
things have changed.  

Did you know that they now tell you to have  babies sleep on their backs?  
That is totally different from when Paige was a baby.  It was hard to get 
used to.

That would be wonderful!  I was looking at those online this weekend.  I used 
play pens all of the time for my children.

Thanks very much.

I have a pretty cool portable play pen you can have if you want.
