I believe the payment schedule on the spread sheet previously given to AK is 
correct.  If there is a conflict, change order 4 takes precedence as to the 
timing of the payments.  At least 10% has been paid on these turbines, so I 
don't understand the 5% question.

Rebecca Walker is preparing an updated payment schedule for all the break out 
contracts.

Subject: Payment schedule for Las Vegas Turbines

Pete Thompson called with a question about what payments have been made on 
the Las Vegas turbines.  He made specific reference to Change Order #4 and 
the effect it may have on the payment schedule for Las Vegas.

Do you know whether a 5% payment was made on these 4 turbines, or will the 
full payment amount be due on May 15, Julsy 30 and August 30?
