Isabel,

Please confirm before 830 central this morning (when GE's rep will be in my 
office to sign docs) that these documents have final approval of GE's 
counsel, as I believe Kent is not available to review documents today. 
Obviously, I cannot present revised documents to a commercial representative 
of GE without knowing that his lawyer has signed off on the documents, except 
to the extent that the changes are obviously minor.


Kay
