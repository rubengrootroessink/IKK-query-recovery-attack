I hope to go, at least Friday/Saturday, assuming we have a sitter for 
Michael, of course.

I met Mrs. Kerekgarto yesterday.  

Chris Duerr (duerrc@spring-branch.isd.tenet.edu/).  Maybe you should ask to 
visit which ever classroom Chris thinks Michael would  be in assuming he 
started at VO on September 5.  Just a suggestion.  Or maybe you can visit 
more than one class.  You might want to ask to visit a class during an 
academic time (as opposed to when the kids are in centers).

I know a lot can happen in 60 days but what do you think the chances are you
will go today? I will not send anything to Rose Mary yet. NM
