Love,

Kay

Good afternoon. Hope you day is going well. One week from today, you will be
at the spa!! I know you are excited. I'm excited for you!
You are out this evening, right? I was going to suggest something for the
grill but we can do that tomorrow. Maybe fish?  I will leave here about 4:15
for our New Area Mgr Happy Hour at 4:30 and will pick up Michael before six.
Check to see if you have an Express Scripts Rx card. It's paper not plastic.
That's why Paige had problems yesterday. I know I gave her one but I can't
remember if I gave you one or not
I will try you on your cell phone on my way. Love, NM
