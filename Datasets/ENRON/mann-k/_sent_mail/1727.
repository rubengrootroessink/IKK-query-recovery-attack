Just use a regular CA (yes, I changed my mind), describe as a power 
generation transaction (no equipment reference).

Thanks,

kay

Subject: Three New CA's

Kay,

I have been asked to do three or more additional CA's for equipment:

Chris Booth is dealing with a broker for the potential sale of three 
different kinds of turbines (end buyer unknown at this time).  I guess we 
would need a CA for the broker, then CA's with potential buyers.

Fred Mitro needs a CA for Ryan Company and another for Panda Energy.  (Fred, 
do you know what kind of turbines these companies are looking at?).

We did the attached CA for NRG ("...in connection with discussions concerning 
a proposed [power generation project using a single General Electric 8EA.") 
and might be a good form for these new CA's.

Please advise.



Kathleen
