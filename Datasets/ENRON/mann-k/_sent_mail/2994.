I forgot about the fence.  

I'm still planning on leaving early - maybe 430 or earlier. Can you leave 
early, too?  Michael wanted to do something with the spider web.  I would 
offer to pick Michael up, but I'm not sure that I would beat you if I left at 
430 and you left at 500.

Love,

ckm

Well, we will not have a fence today.  The installer was very nice and
apologized for the inconvenience. He said there was a lack of communication
between he and the sales person. Bottom line he didn't have the equipment to
do either job. We discussed the driveway which will have two lines running
across it. The second one will be the divider at the gate. We also discussed
the front yard and how to get Jack in and out of the zone without having to
take off his collar each time. He got there before me and watched Jack a
little bit. He said he appeared to be the type of dog that would respond
well to the barrier.  A fast learner as he put it. Anyway, I am waiting for
them to call me and will let you know what I hear.

I will write Choc and let her know to be at the house at 6pm. I may try to
leave a little early so Michael and I will not be walking in the house about
the time she gets there. John has told the department heads to get the
parents out a little early today. I know he is leaving early himself.

Write if you can. Love, Neil
