Herd cats.  That's what we do.

I've just tightened up FM a little.  I'm trying to make it easy to=20
understand. By the way, we don't suspend O & M, so I guess they still have =
to=20
pay it.


10.1 Force Majeure.  If either Party is rendered unable by Force Majeure to=
=20
carry out, in whole or part, its obligations under this Agreement and such=
=20
Party gives notice and full details of the event to the other Party as soon=
=20
as practicable after the occurrence of the event, then during the period of=
=20
such Force Majeure but for no longer period, the obligations of the Party=
=20
affected by the event (other than the obligation to make payments, other th=
an=20
the Demand Charges under the circumstances described in Section 10.2) shall=
=20
be suspended to the extent required.  Without limiting the foregoing, any=
=20
hours during which Seller is unable to deliver the Scheduled Energy by Buye=
r=20
due to an event of Force Majeure shall not be included as hours during whic=
h=20
Seller has failed to deliver Energy for the purpose of determining the Forc=
ed=20
Outage Rate under Section 4.6. The Party affected by the Force Majeure shal=
l=20
remedy the Force Majeure with all reasonable dispatch; provided, however,=
=20
that this provision shall not require Seller or Buyer to (i) settle any=20
strikes or other labor disputes or (ii) deliver or receive Energy at points=
=20
other than the Delivery Points.
10.2 Effect of Force Majeure.  In the event of a Force Majeure event=20
affecting Seller=01,s ability to Deliver Scheduled Energy from the Facility=
, the=20
following shall occur: =20
(a) Seller shall as soon as reasonably practicable use commercially=20
reasonable efforts to fulfill its obligations to deliver Scheduled Energy=
=20
from Market Sources until notice is provided pursuant to Section 10.2(b)=20
below.
(b) Not later than ten (10) Days following the onset of the Force Majeure=
=20
event, Seller shall issue a notice to Buyer (i) stating that Seller will=20
continue to fulfill its obligations to Buyer hereunder from Market Sources=
=20
until the Force Majeure event is terminated or overcome, or (ii) declaring=
=20
Force Majeure, and stating its intention to not serve from Market Sources. =
=20
(c) If the Seller declares Force Majeure under Section 10.2 (b) (ii), Buyer=
=01,s=20
responsibility for paying the Demand Charge shall be suspended until Seller=
=20
has notified Buyer that Seller is ready to resume the delivery of Energy, a=
t=20
which time Buyer shall incur liablility for Demand Charges from that date=
=20
forward.  The date that Buyer=01,s obligation to pay Demand Charges will be=
=20
suspended shall be determined in accordance with Section 10.2. (d).  The=20
Demand Charge will be prorated on a daily basis during the period that Buye=
r=01,
s obligation is suspended in accordance with this Article.
(d) If Buyer does not Schedule Energy during the ten (10) day evaluation=20
period and Seller declares Force Majuere under Section 10.2 (b) (ii), then=
=20
Buyer=01,s relief of the obligation to pay the Demand Charge shall commence=
 as=20
of the date of the Force Majeure event. If, during the ten (10) day=20
evaluation period referenced above, Buyer Schedules Energy and Seller=20
continues to Deliver Energy, but then declares Force Majeure, Buyer=01,s re=
lief=20
from the obligation to pay the Demand Charge shall commence on the date of=
=20
the declaration of Force Majeure and not on the date of onset of the Force=
=20
Majeure event.  If, during the ten (10) day evaluation period Buyer Schedul=
es=20
Energy and Seller initially Delivers Energy but subsequently fails to=20
Deliver, Buyer shall be relieved of the obligation to pay the Demand Charge=
=20
from the date Seller fails to Deliver Energy, and not on the date of onset =
of=20
the Force Majeure event.  Such relief from the Demand Charge shall be=20
computed on a daily basis. =20
In the event of a Force Majeure affecting Buyer=01,s ability to receive Ene=
rgy=20
from Seller, payment of the Demand Charge shall continue.

I'm working as fast as I can.  Things connect together, so it takes a littl=
