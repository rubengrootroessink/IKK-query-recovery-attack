Thanks for your help.  I'm thinking maybe I can write a country and western 
song about all this.  Something like:  "Slow train out of Texas, tons of 
steel a rollin'. Headed up to Colorado,  CTs for natural gas a tollin'."   
Then of course, I'll need to get into beers and tears, and all the other 
necessary components of a good C&W ditty.  Thanks again.
 Al

Kay may be right about cargo like turbines, but I know in the coal business 
we heavily negotiated bulk commodity transportation agreements that governed 
our shipments, and it was not necessarily the railroad's way. However, for a 
one shot shipment, I think Kay is probably right, although we should have 
some leverage to get reasonable provisions re risk of loss, etc.

Since you both asked the same question, I thought I would send an email.

The little I know about rail is that the railroads control the contracts.  
You do it their way.

There is a lot of language in the LM contract concerning shipment, risk of 
loss, insurance, delivery.  I haven't thought through it all, but these 
issues probably need to be considered.   It may be best to work through GE on 
a change order basis to have them handle the shipment and storage elsewhere.  
Otherwise, we run the risk of having a dispute with them later about any 
problems or damage.  

I will be talking to GE this afternoon if you want the topic to be discussed 
then.

Good luck!

Kay
