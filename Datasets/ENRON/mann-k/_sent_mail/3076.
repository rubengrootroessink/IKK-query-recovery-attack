Here's a redline against our previous draft.  There are lots of holes, in 
large part due to the significant commercial issues still open and some of 
FCE's input due on the language to be used.  I'm also not finished with the 
project management/scheduling stuff, but I wanted you to get a chance to look 
at it forthwith.

Scott, I've printed off your emails and will incorporate your input.

I don't know when we want to give FuelCells a draft, but I'm going to keep 
working on this one.

Kay
