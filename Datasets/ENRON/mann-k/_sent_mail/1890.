I'm sorry, I thought that you would remember that this is one of the 
Chicago/People things, since we recently discussed Jones, Day,, etc. My bad.

Subject: Enovate, LLC Invoice

Kay, is this Enovate invoice one of Sheila's deals (it's not on her list)?  I 
need to know who to charge it to.  If you will please note on the invoice 
what it needs to be charged to and who should approve it, I'll get it coded.  
If it's Barbara's deal, then I'll give it to her assistant to take care of 
it.  It's always something isn't it????
