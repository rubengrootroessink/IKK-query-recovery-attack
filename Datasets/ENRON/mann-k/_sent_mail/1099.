AC arrived around 200am today, weighing in at 7 1/4 lbs, 19 inches.  All are 
fine, with the exception of Papa, who suffered a slightly bruised ego when he 
fainted around 205.  As Carlos mentioned in his voice mail "the women were 
quite amused".  The syncope episode was attributed to a hot delivery room.  

Right.

Anyway, I don't intend to communicate with Carlos about the Delta deal.  He 
has his hands full.

Talk to you later today,

Kay
