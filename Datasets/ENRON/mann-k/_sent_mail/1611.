Subject: GE Form Agreement

   
I will have the Form Agreement ready to send to you by the close of
business.  However, Sheila Tweed just called to request a copy of what I
have available now (even before my final edits are made).  I told her I
would send her a copy of what I have after my next round of changes are
made, which will be in the next 2-3 hours.  Just wanted you to have a
heads up.
