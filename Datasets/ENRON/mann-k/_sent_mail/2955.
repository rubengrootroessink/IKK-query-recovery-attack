The word Suzanne heard is that they are moving everyone to the Enron Corp 
book in the somewhat near future.  They moved me there from EI when I 
transferred last March.

Kay, could you please have your assistant get your name and E-Mail address 
moved into the "ECT Adress Book" rather than the ENRON Corp Address book.  If 
there is a specific need for you to remain in the Enron Corp address 
directory, please let me know.     Thanks bng
