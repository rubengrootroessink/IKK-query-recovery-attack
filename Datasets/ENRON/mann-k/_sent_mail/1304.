Paul, thanks for putting the word out on this, since excluding collateral=

damage from warranty problems from BI will surely impact the risk profile o=
f=20
any project if the vendors will not step up to the collateral damage in the=
ir=20
vendor contracts.=20

Jim and Paul, do you know if the underwriters will offer coverage to the=20
vendors or turnkey contractors for this issue under their respective=20
contracts? GE (who are likely to want to continue to self-insure) can be=20
expected to put up a real struggle before choking liability for collateral=
=20
damage down, as  they will likely see it as a material risk issue. I think =
it=20
ought to be added to the form contract discussions with GE as a test case.

I think this is an important enough change in the market that we need to=20
develop a common approach or at  least a common understanding accross Enron=
=20
and NEPCO on the issues.=20

I will be back in the office next week and chase it up with you guys then.

LATEST MARKET DEVELOPMENT


To Distribution:

Recently, the insurance market has become much more restrictive with its=20
terms and conditions and is looking for substantial rate increases,=20
especially on property, machinery breakdown and business interruption=20
coverages.  For example, because of market conditions and adverse loss=20
experience, Enron=01,s deductible for certain asset classes will be increas=
ed=20
from $500,000 to $5,000,000 combined per incident of property damage and=20
business interruption along with a  (quantify percentage) premium increase.=
 =20
In the context of construction risks and the associated operation of new=20
facilities, one of the major areas of underwriters=01, concerns are the nat=
ure=20
and scope warranties offered by the OEM.

Underwriters are requiring their insureds [Enron] to secure warranties from=
=20
major equipment suppliers, especially where technology risks are involved.=
=20
With the increase in insurance pricing and deductibles across the board, =
=20
underwriters are particularly sensitive to  certain types of technology, an=
d=20
capacity will be severely limited or unavailable at any price if no=20
warranties are provided.

To ensure that superior, cost-effective insurance programs can be obtained=
=20
for our projects, it is imperative that Enron projects secure manufacturers=
=01,=20
warranties in the contracts negotiated with equipment suppliers and vendors=
..=20
Underwriters will require genuine guarantees, not just =01&token gestures=
=018. They=20
will require rights of subrogation against the OEM, which means that we=20
cannot agree to a waiver of subrogation for the benefit of  the=20
manufacturers. It is the underwriter=01,s position that the manufacturer is=
 to=20
