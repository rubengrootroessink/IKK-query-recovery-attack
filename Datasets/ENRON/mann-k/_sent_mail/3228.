I may just ask him if anyone else  has had problems with the quality of their 
work,  and leave out the billing stuff.  If I say anything I won't mention 
you,although I think you did what you could to control these cowboys.

I haven't said anything to Mark and don't plan to.  I don't want Piper 
Rudnick's inadequacies to be seen as a reflection of poor management (by 
me).  I just plan to make sure that they don't work with me ever again.
