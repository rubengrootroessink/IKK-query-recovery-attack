I'm ready for another trip to Chicago, to work on the details, the transfer 
pricing, the Manlove monetization, etc.  Would a day next week be good?  It 
would probably be helpful if Laura had some availability as well. Tuesday is 
bad for me, but Wednesday or Thursday looks good.

I'll look over the list and give you a call after lunch.

Kay

Subject: Business Setup

Here is the latest business setup list.  I went through the list with Dave 
Delainey yesterday in our offices.  He then presented the list to Tom 
Patrick, President of Peoples Energy, at dinner last night.  Dave has also 
asked me to forward my weekly updates to both him and Tom so they can see 
where progress is being made and what, if any, pressures need to be applied 
within their respective organizations.  Let's discuss this to figure out the 
best gameplan for crossing some of these off the list.  A good portion of the 
next steps are in Peoples' court, but I am sure there are some things we can 
drive the ship on.

Thanks,

Gregg
