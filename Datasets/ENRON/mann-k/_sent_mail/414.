Refresh my recollection.  Did we (Enron and Northwestern) agree to the form 
of the escrow agreement?  If so, then we will need to see if the escrow agent 
has any comments.  Chris is on vacation, ciaoing down in Italy (sorry, 
couldn't resist).  He should be the point man, though.

On the Delta deal we ran into some complications in moving money because 
Citibank had the money invested in a money market account.  Does the current 
draft allow for that?  I guess the easiest thing to do is to send it to me 
and let me see what's up.  

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

I thought I would check in to determine the status of the escrow account
since it needs to be set up 30 days following the execution of the Letter
Agreement.  Let me know if I should follow up with Chris regarding the
details.

Regards,

Marisa
