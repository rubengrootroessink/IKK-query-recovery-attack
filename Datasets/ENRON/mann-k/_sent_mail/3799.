Are you kidding, free food and booze?  We usually have a good turnout.

I got my hair cut - it feels so good to get it cut.

I'm planning on going as scheduled.  Do lots of people go to this?

Oh, I found them. My point was that you don't have to go to the trouble of 
attaching them.   You can just tell me where they are and I can go from 
there.  No sense making it more difficult than it is.  Then again, this might 
not be difficult for you.  

Did you get your locks cut?  Going to the happy hour promptly at 5:30?  I'm 
there.  Ready for a margarita!

Both are in VEPCO, names under the Word icon on the email.  I'll try to 
remember next time.

It's easier if you just tell me the names because I have to know 
directories.  I assume these are in your VEPCO files.  I'm going to try and 
see if Comparerite works. If not, I'll do it the old fashion way, the Word 
way.
