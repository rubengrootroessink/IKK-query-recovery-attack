Yes, STILL here, definitely the strangest of all!
We need to file a current and final franchise tax report, public info
report, and obtain certificate of good standing.  Also certificates of
dissolution.  I seem to remember some of this being done???
CT will charge $172 per entity if they prepare the certificate of
dissolution and file it and $134  per if they file only.  As I remember
there is a TX Corporation and two TX limited partnerships that need to be
dissolved.  Price is the same whether it is a corp or partnership.
I talk to Jennifer Miller at CT fairly often and one of her team members
told me that they could do it on a Technip order and just bill Anglers, so
let me know what if anything you want them to do.
Hope all is well with everyone.
Talk to you soon.
Honey
