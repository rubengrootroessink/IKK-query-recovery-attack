Hi there. This came in while I was on the road.

Mac mentioned his girlfriend, but he didn't mention the Rice thing.  Hmmm.  
We would love to have him at UH, since he won't aim any higher, and we thing 
it beats SWTS.  He and his friend were wonderful house guests.  

I hope no one got worse on your b day.  Many happy returns!

Love,

Kay

Hi Kay! How are you guys doing? We had hoped that maybe we would be coming
over to Houston Saturday to see UT play baseball and then maybe try to see
yall Sunday before we drove back. BUT! As luck would have it, Annie, Katie
and Bobby are all various degrees of sick.

So, unless there is miraculous improvement in the next 24 hours, it looks
like we will be staying in Austin. Oh well. We hope to make another trip
down there before too long.

Well, I'm due at school, but I wanted to say hi and tell you that we won't
be coming down. I hear that Mac is coming down? That's great. I hope that he
likes what he sees at UH. You know his girlfriend has been offered a
scholarship to Rice, I think.

Anyway, Have a great Ground Hogs Day. It doesn't feel too different to be
40, rather than 39 and 364 days, so I guess I'll make it through the day.

Take care and tell everyone hello!

Love you!

Lisa
