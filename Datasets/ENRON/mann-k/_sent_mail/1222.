Here's a general description of the steps:

Letter agreement signed
Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC)
$ deposited in escrow
TurboPark notice given

Closing date:

TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption)
LLC signs breakout contract
Amended LLC, other closing docs executed
Money released from escrow to Enron
Enron pays off TurboPark

This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.  I was unsure from your email if 
you see a problem with this process.

Sounds like a plan, but do not sign a breakout contract in an Enron entity 
until you hear further.
