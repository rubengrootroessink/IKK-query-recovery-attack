Sorry to miss your birthday. Did you have one in my honor?  You know I really 
did have one for you on vacation.

Points well taken - some we have already addressed, others probably need to 
be tied up better.

See you soon.

By the way, it hailed in DC today. Looked good from the bar at the Willard.
