Subject: Alive and Well

Kay,  I made it through the MS150 alive and kicking. I even rode with Jeff 
for a few miles.

How are the comments flowing in?  I have not seen anything form anyone.  
Christi N. said she would be done this morning.  I'll be calling everyone 
else to find out how they are doing.

Reagan
