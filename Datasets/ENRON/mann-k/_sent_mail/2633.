Mom,

I would really not mind taking care of Michael at all. The only glitch is
that I have that wedding to go to on the 28th. If you could find someone
(Lena or Charlotte) to take care of him then, it would all be fine. Also,
you were getting me tickets for the GalleryFurniture.com bowl, but you can
give them to someone else if you want. As long as I'm free for New Year's
Eve, then that's totally cool. If you can't find anyone, I can ask one of
my friends that isn't going to the wedding. I have got to start studying--I
have a test on Thursday, and I am booked solid with DDD stuff until then.
Oh. I just got back from business law. That's the one with the professor
who thinks I'm his best friend. He brought up this situation so we could
talk about liability of the company. A man who works at Love's (the gas
station) was doing a security check because he could tell something was
fishy outside. He went out, and the car was running off without paying for
their gas. Company policy is not to chase them, but to get their license
plate. He was a few steps outside the door, and the car swerved to hit him
and severely injured him. His skull is fractured, and 1/3 of his brain is
bleeding. He has four kids (7,6,2, and 1). So we were talking about the
liability of Love's. The family had next do nothing, and insurance won't
cover it. We discussed it for about fifteen minutes, and several of us said
Love's should be liable. Then he picked up his things and said, "I guess
I'll tell you. That man was my son-in-law, and those kids are my
grandkids." Yikes. The room was silent. I think I'm going to get him a card
or something. He looked awful. Anyway, that's the class I just got back
from. Let me know the details of your vacation so I can be jealous!:) 

Love,

Paige
