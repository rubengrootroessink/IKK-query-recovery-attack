FYI.  The VEPCO attorney said that currently VEPCO is taking about 60 days 
each for the System Impact Study and the Facilities Study.  Because of the 
increase in study requests, VEPCO is filing for 90 days for Fac. Studies, 
below.

Subject: VEPCO files Interconnection Proc. at FERC

On 10/27/00, VEPCO filed interconnection procedures at FERC (Docket No. 
ER01-247)(Protests due 11/17/00).  These largely mirror CP&L's 
interconnection procedures that were recently approved by FERC.  Therefore, I 
do not think that Enron should protest or intervene.

Customer is required to pay for the cost of a new system impact/facilities 
study if the study information/interconnection/upgrade costs change due to a 
customer higher in the queue losing its queue spot.
System impact studies should take 60 days or less.  Facilities studies should 
take 90 days or less.
