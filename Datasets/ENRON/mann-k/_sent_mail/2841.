As discussed, attached is a clean and blacklined version of the FuelCell /
Enron Agreement reflecting the parties' agreements over the past two days.
The marked up comments list will follow shortly by PDF file.  Please note
that some of the members of my client's team will be seeing this at the same
time as you and therefore may have additional comments.
