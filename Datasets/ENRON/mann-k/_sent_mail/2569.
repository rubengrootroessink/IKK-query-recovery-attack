I'm not that wild about the pan sausage.  Hamburger/italian/smoked are good.

Do you want alot of any one item, say hamburger? Maybe we can take two deer
and sell some of what we don't want. I have asked and some folks in my
office would like some. They would pay for processing. Are we going to split
a pig with John this year? NM

You have my proxy.  Please let Anthony know what you think.

Anthony,

Venison would be tough to swallow without teeth.

Since I bought Bobbi a spot on the deer lease we have a total of 6 deer to
kill this year. If you want more than one deer your welcome to it. 6 is way
more than we can eat. Unless we skip breast feeding and start the baby on
deer meat.

How do you want it processed?  1 or 2 deer?

Italian Sausage
Smoked Sausage - Mild-Medium-Hot
Pan Sausage - Mild-Medium-Hot
Hamburger
