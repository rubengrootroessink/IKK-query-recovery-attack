This is a slam dunk. Don't screw it up.

Ok, seriously.  Carlos, you missed a wonderful evening on Friday.  John, it 
is hard to believe that  you could have acutually have married UP.  Good for 
you.  Please thank  Debbie for a perfect night.  

John, more details on the platimum AMEX with President's Club membership.  
For real?

I'll process the assignment to John on Monday.  I don't expect a problem, and 
am ready for it if it surfaces.  No big deal.

Kay

Suzanne is out today, so would you mind finding this document and having 
someone fax it to me?  I'll email my fax number to you.

Much Grass,

Kay

Hi.

There's a document in my O drive directory called kendallsale, or something 
close.  I can't remember where I put it - probably under General LOI.  Could 
you email it to me?

Thanks,

Kay
