I just noticed a glitch, which I'll fix.  Do you have any comments?

Rusty is in Florida today through Friday.  I received the hard copy you sent 
down (thanks) and will review it.   From your perspective, is this document 
ready to be sent out?  I would like to get it in PSEG's hands ASAP.  Let me 
know.

Fred

Have you asked Rusty?  I believe Kathleen gave him a hard copy yesterday.  I 
made the changes myself.

Kay:

What is the status of the draft Securities Purchase Agreement for the sale of 
ENA's Illinois project entities?

Please let me know.  Rusty and I need to review it before sending it out to 
PSEG.

Thanks,
Fred
