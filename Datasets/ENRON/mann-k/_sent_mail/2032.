Hi Pete,

Please send a copy of the FV break out contracts to Sheila Tweed (Al works 
for her).  She needs the info this am, and doesn't want to wait until Al gets 
in.  She would also appreciate a list of the outstanding issues.

I'll talk to you in a bit on the ABB override letter.  I don't think there 
will be much to it.

Kay
