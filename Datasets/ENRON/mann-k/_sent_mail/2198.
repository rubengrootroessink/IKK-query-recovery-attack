I prefer the weekend.  It gives us a reason to get in and get out.

No reason other than I don't really care to go.

I really would like to do the FtW Show. Would weekends work best for you? I
checked TicketMaster and all the weekend shows are available, even the "sold
out" shows. I didn't check the price. They do have some weekday shows also
if you would rather do that.

You know me.  I don't care one way or the other.  Is there a reason why you
want to skip it?

We don't have to go to FW for the rodeo.  I just thought that would be fun
to do, and my mom wants Michael to come so badly.  We can always just go
for a visit.  In fact, Michael and I can go alone some time.

Like I said last night, you would make a great guide.  You'll be Michael's
guide one of these days.
