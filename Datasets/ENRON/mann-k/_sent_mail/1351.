Hi John,

I asked to have ONE guaranty prepared and ONE escrow agreement for Carlos and 
I to review the forms.  Now I've got two sets of docs sent by two K & S 
attorneys. 

Additionally, we are drafting against ourselves.  The letter agreement and 
the LLC have been given to the counterparty.  Seems to make more sense to 
wait for comments.

HELP!!!

Kay
