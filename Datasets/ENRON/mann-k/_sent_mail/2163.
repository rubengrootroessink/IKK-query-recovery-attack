Subject: RE: Escrow agreements

Kay:

As far as I am concerned, the Escrow Agreements and the Fee Schedule are
ready for execution.  I would recommend at least 3 originals of each.  (At
one point, Lari Paradee and I discussed 5 originals of each - to correspond
with the 4 originals of the letter agreements plus one original for the
bank. Either 3 or 5 originals of each is fine with me.)  Thanks.

Are we ready to sign these today?  How many originals do we need?

Thanks,
