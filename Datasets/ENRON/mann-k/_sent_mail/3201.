Hi there!

Sounds like things are going really well.

Neil is working tomorrow (his turn), then we have a wedding to go to Saturday 
night. Paige isn't coming in until Sunday, leaving Tuesday or Wednesday.  
She's visiting friends in Waco.  You know how it goes with juniors. So, it 
doesn't look good for us to  make it to Palacios this weekend.  How long are 
you going to be there?

Gotta get on the phone.

Love,

Kay

Hi Kay Kay. Hope you have had a good week. The weather is wonderful,big
black drums,26 inch red fish,keeper flounder and one keeper trout.Ham
sandwiches and not a very clean house but would love for you to come down
this week-end if you have any free time. Daddy did not call Neil with the
fishing report because his hooks did catch fish. He was to call if he
didn't catch fish. Does Paige go back to school Sunday? Love to see all of
you,Mother
