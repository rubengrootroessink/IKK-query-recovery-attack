I agree it is Matt, and  I believe he has reviewed this tax stuff (or at 
least other turbine K's) before.  His concern will be us getting some amount 
of advance notice before title transfer (ie, delivery).  Obviously, he might 
have some other comments as well.  I'm happy to send him the latest, or maybe 
he can access the site?

Given that the present form of GE world hunger seems to be more domestic than 
international it would appear that Matt Gockerman would be a good choice for 
the Enron- GE tax discussion.  Do you want to contact him or do you want me 
to.   I would be interested in listening in on the conversation for 
continuity.
