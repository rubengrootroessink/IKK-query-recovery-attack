Hi Kent,

I can get a redline done for you if you want to tell me what it should be 
redlined against.

I don't know about getting rid of the requirement for the inhouse counsel 
opinion.  Maybe after you look at things we can discuss it.

Thanks,

Kay

 Attached please find the latest Salmon Energy Turbine Agreement
(second document below), as well as a blackline (first document below)
showing changes made to the version circulated last Friday.  Pursuant to
your instructions, the performance values in Article 10 are per the 24
Unit master agreement.  In addition no changes have been made to the
Maximum or Unit Liability Amounts or payment schedule. To complete the
agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.
