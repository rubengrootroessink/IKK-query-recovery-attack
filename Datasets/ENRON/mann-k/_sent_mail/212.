Hi Kara,

I haven't written because I haven't figured out what we learned at the 
meeting.  We can discuss next week at our conference.  We are arranging to 
have Michael re-tested.  I think it is more of an issue of a difference 
between potential and performance.  Michael has been tested in the past, and 
tests as extraordinarily bright, but he has had some performance issues which 
don't match up.  At least that's how I understand it. He just has some 
disconnects which we are working to overcome, but I must admit to not 
understanding it all.

I left you a note about Michael possibly missing next week.  After I dropped 
him off this am, I had a thought that next week might be when they visit in 
1st grade, in which case we probably wouldn't want him to miss that 
opportunity.  I think he is excited about 1st grade, so you must be doing a 
great job of getting the kids prepared.

Thanks for everything, and see you next week!

Kay

Kay,
I'm interested to hear how things went at the meeting.
Michael was the star of the show.  He did a great job!  Glad you both made
it.
