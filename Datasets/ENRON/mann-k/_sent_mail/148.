It should be signed and on its way.

I've heard that they are trying to schedule a meeting for Monday, so I'm 
trying to get a draft of the agreement out.  Do you think you will have a 
chance to send me the preamble stuff?  I know it doesn't seem like a big 
deal, but I will feel better if I understand who's on first, so to speak/

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:  I have O.K.ed the extension letter and advised Marvin of my approval.
He will get it authorized by the Commission.

I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the
ILA until June 15.

I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I
thought I would give you a heads up.

David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.  If you have your
preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.

Thanks,

Kay

PS  The salutation is to "Gentlemen".  Are the members of the commission
and MDEA all men?  I don't want to commit a blunder.
