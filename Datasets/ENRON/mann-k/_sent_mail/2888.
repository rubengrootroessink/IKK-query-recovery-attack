Due to the sensitivity of the information, we'll be specific.  Also, should 
this be addressed to Bill or Curtis, or someone else?

One quick question - the LLC agreement provides for audit rights in relation 
to all of enovate's business.  Do you think that this CA also covers the 
provision of information for audit purposes?  If not, can we include that in 
this CA or should we have a separate CA for audit?

Thanks - Gregg

Gregg,

Attached are the drafts of CA's for enovate for your review.  I am going to 
go ahead and have Kay approve these unless you have some major changes.

Please advise.

Kathleen
