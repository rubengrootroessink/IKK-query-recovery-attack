I've redlined the document against the previous version, but I don't think I 
picked up all the changes.  In addition to the marked changes, there are 
these changes:

D.  third line, added "Original" before LM6000.  This change is made 
throughout the document.
D. pentultimate line, replaced EECC with ENA.
Dated everything December 15; added "with respect to the Subject LM6000 
Turbines after "Original Turbine Contract" throughout
E.  Added "and" between rights obligations in (iii)
2 (c) Added the Pastoria One-Train Turbine Contract in (ii) and (iii).
