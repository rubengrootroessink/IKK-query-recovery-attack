I looked anyway on this floor.  I just sent out an email regarding the 
location.  I better call Defner and Miller and let them know the location.

There isn't one up here, I looked yesterday. I'll look elsewhere.  Please 
tell me when you ask me to set up the meeting if you will need a conference 
room.

Please see if you can get a conference room for the 300 call.  If there isn't 
one here, try 28 or 29.  Thanks, Kay
