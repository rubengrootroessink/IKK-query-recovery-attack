Boyd,

I would think that at the least we would want you to attend the hearing.  I 
also don't see any harm in you reviewing the data responses.

The attached gives notice of what I believe would be a scheduling (status)
conference for the Master Sales approval proceedings. This is the first
information I've received about these matters since receiving the data
requests a couple of weeks ago. Let me know how active you would like me to
be in these matters. Shoud I request that Jerry Fox circulate drafts of the
data responses? are you being kept up to date by Peoples on communications
with staff? Should I plan to attend the hearing?
