John,

I suggest eliminating the statement in III that we are proposing to perform 
the the market price servises in accordance with the terms of the market 
price service agreement.  I realized that we have a disclaimer at the end of 
the letter, but the statement in III seems to directly contradict the 
disclaimer.

I am not confident that the statement that the Enron structure is proprietary 
is sufficient to protect the information.  I will need to check the 
confidentiality agreement when I get to the office if this is a real 
concern.  

I thought we weren't submitting a conforming bid.  Is there anything in the 
RFP which indicates that any proposal will be considered a firm offer, or 
anything to that effect?

Talk to you soon,

Kay
