All:

Below are Lisa Bills' and my comments on the Capacity and Energy Agreement 
Revised Draft 9/6/00.  Please call me if you would like me to clarify or 
expand upon any of our points.  There may be points that Lisa Bills can 
address more thoroughly than I can.  I will seek her input on any question or 
concern you may voice.

Article 1.1 Consistent use of quotation marks: Commercial Operation Date; 
Deliver; Delivered; Dispatch Order.

Article 1.1 "Facility Substation": Do rights to access this meter by Seller 
need to be stated, or does Article 8.3 give the Seller rights to the data 
generated by the meter?

Article 2.2/3 Commencement Date and Commercial Operation Date are different.

Article 2.3 (b) (i)  Seller commencing construction of the Facility on or 
before December 31, 2000 will render the off-balance sheet treatment of the 
turbines provided by Turbo Park void.

Article 3.4 (c) Third sentence: misspelling of schedule.

Article 3.4 (c) (i)  Close parenthesis needed after "... with Section 8.3."

Article 4.2 Monthly is capitalized, but is not defined in Articles 1.1 and 
8.1.

Article 5.1 (b) Reference should be to Buyer not Virginia Power. 

Article 12 Does this article allow to disclose the terms of the Agreement 
and/or relevant facts about the Facility to prospective purchases of either 
the Agreement or Facility?

General  Use of day versus Day versus Business Day.  See Articles 2.1, 2.3 
(b), 3.4 (d), 3.4 (g), 4.7, 7.1 (a), etc., for examples.

General   Use of convention to spell numbers immediately followed by the 
numerals.  See Articles 1.1, 2.1, 3.4 (e), 4.6, 14.2, etc., for examples.
