If this letter has not yet gone out, we should include the kitchen sink of 
perceived problems. I agree that the letter should be short, but lets 
eliminate their argument that we did not give complete notice.

Mitch,

Here's a first draft.  Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls 
which we need to raise.  It is better to be all inclusive than leave 
something out.



Richard, any ideas or comments?

Kay
