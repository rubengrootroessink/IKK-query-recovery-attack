I would think the policy would still be in place, but I don't remember what 
it is.

Rumor mill is working but you were the leak.  

On another point, on the PSEG deal, we're going to agree to a non-compete 
provision that limits the activities of ENA and it's affiliates with respect 
to the power project in Kendall county.  I recall that there was a policy 
requiring Mark Metts approval for such expanded non-competes.  Is that policy 
still in place?  I'll call after I get done with my PSEG call.
