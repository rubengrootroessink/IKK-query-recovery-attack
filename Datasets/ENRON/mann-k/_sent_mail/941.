They've asked for much the same from GE.  Kent is reviewing the docs.  

I'm at home with a sinus headache, but I'm working.

I've reviewed and I have several comments but I have a zillion meetings this 
morning.  OK if I call you after about 11am?  Are these guys going to expect 
he same from GE?

I had to leave early Friday to pick Michael up, so obviously, today (Monday) 
is fine.  I appreciate your advice, especially on the opinion.

Thanks,

Kay
