Do not take this too seriously until we talk tomorrow.

Look forward to meeting you,

Kay

PS.  Hope it isn't too inconvenient for you to come.  Sheila really wanted

Subject: Secure Website for Enron/GE Turbine Contract Negotiation

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This afternoon you will receive a Logon ID and Password to a secure website 
known as LegalNetEx ("LNX").   LNX will provide the Enron/GE Turbine Contract 

Team with a centralized location for the efficient and organized exchange of 
contract drafts and revision proposals.  It works like this:

1.  When you log on to LNX, a set of instructions will lead you to the most 
recent version of the contract.   To review and revise the contract you will 

download the document onto your PC or LAN.     

2. Consistent with normal drafting, you will need to save your revised 
version of the contract on your system, under a new name.  

3. When you are ready to provide your revised version of the contract to the 
rest of the team, you will upload the your document onto LNX.  Peter Thompson 
will 
receive an automatic email from LNX each time a team member uploads a revised 
document.  

4.  When Peter  has incorporated the various revisions proposed by the team, 
he will upload the resulting revision cycle on LNX.    Each team member will 

receive an automatic email notification when Peter uploads the latest and 
greatest version of the contract. 
   

Additionally, you will not have to redline your document for the group, LNX 
will handle redlining for us, it's automatic, too.


If you have questions or difficulties with LNX, please contact Matt 
Troncelliti of LegalNetEx using either matt@internetex.com or 610/617-1753.

For nontechnical questions or comments, please feel free to contact me, Ed 
Hearn, using either ed.b.hearn.iii@enron.com or 713/853-1592.

Thank you,
Ed
