Kay mentioned to me (I think it was on Friday) that she may be talking to GE 
about this - don't know if she did or what the outcome was, so stay tuned.

Thanks,

Rose

Winston & Strawn has asked that the following be added to the Consents
to Assignment (e.g., in the "Successors and Assigns" paragraph):

"WestLB is an express third-party beneficiary of this Consent."

Please forward the revised draft of the GE Consent to Winston & Strawn
(toxley@winston.com).
