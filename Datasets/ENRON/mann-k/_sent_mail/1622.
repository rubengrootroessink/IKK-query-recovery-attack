Hi Mark,

I don't know  what these folks are up to.  In fact, I didn't know that Scott 
Laidlaw was involved.  When I spoke with EECC I told them that they needed to 
get direction from you, someone from Mike Coleman's group, or an ENA 
developer.  

Any word from the Co Op/PB team?

I have jury duty in just a little while, so I'll be out of touch for a short 
while.

Kay
