Hi Bobby,

Ok, here's another detail:  what's your web address?

Maybe Annie and Katie can come for a visit when things settle down.  I know 
Michael would be delighted. We could take them to the Pink House, if they 
preferred. Neil and I have talked about wanting them to visit for awhile.

I realize there are lots of detail to attend to in the next several weeks.  
If there's anything I can do, please let me know.

You and your family stay in our thoughts and prayers. I can't imagine what 
you, your dad and sister must be going through. I can relate to Katie and 
Annie, though, as the loss of each of my grandparents caused me a lot of 
sadness. I know they were close to your mom, and spent a lot of time with 
her.  What a wonderful gift of memories they must have, and what joy they 
must have brought to her life.

Love to all,

Kay

Hey Kay - 

    Lisa will chat more later. The service is Saturday at 1PM at Hope
Presbyterian. I'll have a map up on our web site later this evening.

    I think Annie needs to stay with us for a few days. As good as that
sounds for Lisa and me, she's pretty upset at times (last night was the
first night she was able to sleep by herself).

    Thank you for your thoughts and concerns, and your cards, and for
talking with Lisa. It was tough for her being away from everything, and she
really needed you and your mom and dad. And I don't think I've ever been so
glad to be home as I was yesterday.

Thanks again, and please give my love to your family (including your your
executive in training) -

Bobby
