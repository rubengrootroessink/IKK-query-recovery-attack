Subject: RE: Land Option

The Option looks fine to me with two minor exceptions.  In Paragraph 16,
change the references in the last line to Paragraphs 16 and 17, as opposed
to 19 and 20; and in Paragraph 22, sixth line change "its" to "their
respective" modifying agents etc.  Either finalize, execute and forward to
Ken for signature or forward an execution copy to Ken and he wil return for
your eecution.

Mike,

I'll try to figure out the conversion.  In the meanwhile, if you can email
me your fax number I'll send it that way.
