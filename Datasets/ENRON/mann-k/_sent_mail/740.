Hi Ed,

Here's a certificate of incumbancy we need to Jake's Delta deal.  Can you 
handle signature?  We can work with a fax today, but will need a fully 
executed original for the bank.

Jake, we put a couple of Houston guys just in case something comes up.  We 
have assumed that you will be executing the docs.  If there's any problem 
with the list, please let me know.

We need this document to set up the escrow account today.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

We may want to go ahead and circulate the ENA Incumbency Certificate for the
escrow.  I was holding it until the Salmon Incumbency Certificate revisions
were completed by Paul Hastings so that the two documents could be
circulated simultaneously, but I'm not sure they will get that document to
us in time to do both together.  Thanks.
