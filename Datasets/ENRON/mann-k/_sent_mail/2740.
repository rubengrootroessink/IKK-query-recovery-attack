Hi there,

In resolving some issues with Westinghouse there was an agreement reached 
concerning the disposition of the Blue Girl turbines, as well as certain 
issues relating to the Gleason and Wheatland facilities.  In connection with 
this agreement I am forwarding to you a draft letter agreement concerning 
resolution of these matters.  As you can see, Westinghouse has requested that 
NEPCO, EEPC and LJM2-Turbine, LLC sign the agreement.

Your comments would be appreciated.

Kay

Mitch
Attached are SWPC revisions to your proposed letter. Our contracts group
advised to add signatures for all affected parties to the agreement, in
addition to know parties for contracts on Gleason and Wheatland sites, we
have added parties identified in draft Blue Girl contract, Enron input as to
appropriate Enron signatures for the Blue Girl would be appreciated.  Please
call with any concerns.
