I wasn't blaming you.  I was just disagreeing with the statement that that 
changes have caused the problem.

You don't have to investigate your options if you'll tell me what you need.  
I can't help it if we have a new travel agent.  I'll get the flight changed.

I disagree. NONE of the problems I've had in the last 2 weeks can be 
attributed to changes.  There was no explanation given as to why they booked 
me to return a day early on the first trip to DC. What was up with that? Last 
week, I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans.  In 
fact, I've spent more time investigating my options by myself than I ever had 
before.  

A travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.  That is what 
business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years I've been flying 
around North America, South America and Europe.  I've had good agents and bad 
ones.  The good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat.

Please have my flight changed as follows:

Wednesday, August 2nd, change to Continental flight no. 1882, departing IAH 
at 122pm and arriving RDU at 510pm.

The remainder of the travel plans stay the same.

Thanks,

Kay

All this changing is where the problems come in!!!!!!!  Why can't they just 
make up their mind about what time they want to leave.  You are already 
upgraded and ticketed.  Let me know ASAP if you want to change so they won't 
charge your card, etc.

I moved Ozzie and my flight to Raleigh up to the 1:22 pm Continental flight.  
Please have your assistants change your reservations also if you would like 
to get in earlier.
