I'm just getting out of a training class.
My bet is it will be cancelled.
I would love to take my bride out to dinner. If you do yoga Thursday we
could do dinner Friday. How does that sound? Let me know what you think and
I will write Charlotte. NM

I wonder if the Peckers game tonight will be a rain out.

Did you read Charlotte's email?  Are you interested?

I hope the freeway wasn't too bad.
Maybe we can make some of Brain's ball games. I think Michael would enjoy
going.
Love, Neil
