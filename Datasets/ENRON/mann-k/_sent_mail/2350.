Michael is sick with some nasty virus.  I'm a bit afraid to commit until he 
starts looking better.  Poor kid had strep last week.

Maybe he'll perk up by Thursday, but the doctor says it is a 10 day ordeal.   
I bet you would just as soon not be exposed to it.

Subject: Thursday Night

How is Thursday night for a family dinner as we discussed.  Lastly, no news 
from anyone today on my front.  I'll call Michelle on Wednesday if I don't 
hear anything tomorrow.
