Ok.  When are you available to discuss how to deal with the various issues we 
need to address to get this wrapped up?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract; 
namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and 
30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be 
handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing 
matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked 
out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this time 
and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes arising 
from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.  Regards, 
Paul

Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be
appreciated.

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay

Paul,

When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting
urgent.

Thanks,

Kay
