I'm not betting the farm on the escrow funding tomorrow.  I'll manage=20

Kay:

We need agreement on the escrow disbursement letter (which Delta still need=
s
to comment on).  Per the letter agreement, we already have agreement on the
form of Amended and Restated LLC Agreement; however, the outstanding issue
with respect to requiring unanimous member consent for sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the LLC is still on the table. =20

Isabel Parker called and reminded me that the ENA Consent and Agreement is
to be signed tomorrow, Friday 4/20, contemporaneously with the funding of
the escrow account, rather than upon closing.  She is happy with the letter
if we drop its references to the ENA Consent and Agreement.

I am now worried about the ability to have an escrow funded by tomorrow,
given that we still haven't let the escrow agent in on this structure.  Gre=
g
called about an hour ago and said he was working on comments to the escrow
agreement.

Is there anything we need to get them to consent to?
