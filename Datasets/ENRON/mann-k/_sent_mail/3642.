Kay, I talked with Mark Shaffer in our Atlanta office;  he has no
information on options in the Hart County area.  Sorry we couldn't help.

I'm looking at the Skelton option (Hart County, GA), and can't figure out
when it was executed. (must confess I didn't read EVERY word) Can anyone
help me with this?

Thanks,

Kay
