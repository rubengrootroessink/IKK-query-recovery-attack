Hi Kent,

I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are 
working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and selling 
some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the turbines are 
turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are buying new LM's 
to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta Power is 
financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on the 
attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response to the 
attached.  

I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy 
anyway.

Thanks,

Kay
