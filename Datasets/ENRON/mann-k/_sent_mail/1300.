I give up. What's the RB career path?

Did you want to get together to call Jake/Steve, or do you want to call them 
alone?  Up to you.

I called and left Steve a brief message.  I'll patch you in when he calls 
back.


When you talk to them, find out if they have talked to Lee Johnson, since we 
need to make sure he is on board before we sign the letter agreement.

Thanks,

Kay


Also, two fyi's -- I left Jeff a msg on the 2/5 year confidentiality spilt 
and he left back saying that approach was fine, but anything over 5 we should 
go to Mark with.

Left a msg with Mark and he approved A&K (although late afternoon, when BG 
asked about whether I'd hired my outside counsel, I had to tell her that I 
was waiting to hear from MH.)  I think I'm off to the RB career path.
