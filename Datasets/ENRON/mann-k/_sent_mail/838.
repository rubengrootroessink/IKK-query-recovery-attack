Just in time for the weekend.

I hope to take tomorrow off, by the way.  Paige is coming in tonight, and 
Michael has the day off from school.

Sounds good.  Evn though we have not had our meeting next week, you are my 
leader, I serve at your pleasure and will do as you command (after three cups 
of coffee, I'm finally starting to feel like I'm getting my edge back!)
