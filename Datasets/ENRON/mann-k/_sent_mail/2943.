Subject: 

I received a letter today from Ron Fellheimer, attorney for the Ledfords, in
connection with the Livingston Energy Center.  He would like to know what,
if any, portion of the Green parcel would be available for farming for the
2001 farming year.  Please call me to discuss so we can him with response.
Thank you!
