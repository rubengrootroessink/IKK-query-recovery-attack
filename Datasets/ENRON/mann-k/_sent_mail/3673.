Matt - Thanks for the explanation.  That makes life much simpler, at least 
for now.  Illinois is currently the only state where we have employees or 
inventory.  We are merely purchasing and selling natural gas in the other 
locations.  If that changes in the future, I will let you know.

As always - thanks for your thorough review,

Gregg

Gregg:

We should register Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C. ("Midwest") for Sales & Use Tax 
in those states in which Midwest has nexus.  Nexus requires a physical 
presence (employees or inventory).  If Midwest, in foreign states (outside of 
Illinois), is merely purchasing and selling natural gas, for delivery by 
common carrier; Midwest does not have nexus.  Rather, Midwest is acting much 
like a mail order seller.  

In light of the above, could you please advise regarding Midwest's physical 
presence in Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and 
Wisconsin.  Thanks.

Matt - Per our conversation today, the following e-mail was sent by Russell 
Murrell regarding the impending name change of Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C.  My 
understanding is that we have already bought/sold natural gas in Oklahoma, 
Texas, and Louisianna.  The remaining states in his e-mail are potential 
future places of business.  I will leave it up to your discretion as to how 
you want to pursue registering for taxes in these locales.  I am guessing we 
may want to register in those states we have already transacted in.  Please 
let me know what you think we should do.

Thanks,

Gregg
