Hi.  Happy Mother's Day.

I was kinda hoping for a post-graduation family  event on that Saturday, as 
hopes were raised when the ticket issue came up.  Doesn't sound like that's 
happening.   I don't know when we will be up that way, but it wouldn't 
surprise me if we headed up Sat am.  That's Memorial Day weekend, so traffic 
out of Houston on Friday will be horrific.  Neil and I haven't discussed any 
details yet, though.

Paige is supposed to intern with the Houston Aeros this summer.  No pay, 
which is a bad thing.  She is currently on the way to Colorado with some 
friends, and will be back a week from Sunday.  I haven't even mentioned Mac's 
graduation yet.  

I just finished a really busy time, and I'm optimistic that things will 
resume a more normal pace.  I hope to catch up on yard work this weekend, 
maybe clean out a closet.  I have the urge to purge.  

I would say the Katie got the Clarke math gene, but Paige is a math whiz.  It 
must be a recessive characteristic.  It is great that the girls have 
different arenas in which to excel.  

I sent Mom a table top cactus garden.  Hope it gets there.  

No clue on what to get Mac.  I guess I should ask Paige for ideas.  If I get 
some good ones from her or Mikey I'll let you know.

Love,

Kay

Hi! How are you guys doing?  I understand that it is getting to be time for
Paige to come back for the summer. Does she have any big plans? Is she going
to work for Enterprise again? I can't believe that it is just about summer.

The girls have a couple more weeks. Katie had her end of course Algebra test
this week and made a 100 on it. Things are looking up for her academically.
She was so pleased and proud. This will give her some high school credit for
math. Now she has a test like it for French. Tonight she is in Arlington
with her band. They are going to play in a competition tomorrow and then
spend Saturday at Six Flags.  Big times!

Annie is still pitching like a wild woman. Her league is having the end of
season tourney over the next couple of weeks and then All Stars will start
at the end of June and last for a couple of weeks.

As for Bobby and me, we just try to keep up with it all.

Mama told me that yall will be coming up for Mac's graduation. I think we
will be up there too. It looks like we are going to go up on Friday night
and spend the night on Glenmont. Then probably stay for Saturday night too.
Mama has offered to pay to put we grown-ups in a Holiday Inn on Saturday,
and the grandkids can stay with her and Daddy. I think we will take her up
on it. I know she would be happy to get you a room at the Holiday Inn or
whatever also.

I don't know what we are going to get him for graduation. We got Paige a
James Avery charm, but I just don't think that Mac would be that excited
about something like that. I think I'll get him something useful.

I guess I need to decide what to get Mother for Mothers Day.

Well, have a great weekend and a wonderful mother's day. I hope that they
spoil you rotten. Oh speaking of spoiled rotten, I hear you enjoyed your
visit to the spa. Good for you!  I know you were looking forward to going.

Take care and give my love to your family.

Lisa
