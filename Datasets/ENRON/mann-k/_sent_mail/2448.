Subject: Re: E-Next Generation Assignment Documents and Schedule V  

why does LM6000 contract still have brackets around the number of turbines to 
be assigned to WestLB?  Why does it still ignore the change orders rose asked 
you to include?

why does schedule v to PA still ignore the change orders to the various 
documents?

Please correct or advise why requests for changes are NOT being made.

As you know,  these documents are deliverables on Wednesday.  Blue Dog had 
comments from the other side today.  Why haven't I seen a revision or been 
asked if I agree with their comments?  

Please do not operate in a vacuum without consulting me or Roseon 
questionable issues.

Regards,  Lisa
