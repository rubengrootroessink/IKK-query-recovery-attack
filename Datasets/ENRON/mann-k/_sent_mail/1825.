Here we go with a renewal that puts us to 7.6%, but the purchase price is not 
so much.

Kay,

The payment that is due on Saturday will put us at 7.631%.    I really would 
like to Federal Express out tonight because the November payment got lost in 
the mail and I had to order another check to send to them.  Please advise.
