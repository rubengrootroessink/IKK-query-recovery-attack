PS Of course I came in to the office.  I've got a conference call with Bob 
Wright in the next 5 minutes.  What are the odds that we file?

As I mentioned (or you've heard), a group of us are planning a trip to the 
Lake Austin Spa, beginning May 4.  I think I will probably stay 3 nights, but 
the Spa will give us these rates for 2 night stays.  The rates are group 
rates, but a group only takes 6 people.  I'm going even if we don't get 6.

I will try to block some rooms next week so we hold spaces.  Please let me 
know if you are interested.

Kay
