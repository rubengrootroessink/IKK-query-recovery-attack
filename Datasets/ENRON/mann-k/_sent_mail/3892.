Hi.

I'm kinda tired this morning.  I guess I just need a bit more sleep.

Michael tried to push the envelope this am.  He wanted to eat some more after 
he had brushed his teeth (I told him breakfast was over, so no more food) and 
wanted to go back in to get a toy to take (nope).  He handled the frustration 
ok.

Do we have anything planned this weekend?  

Ta ta for now,

ckm
