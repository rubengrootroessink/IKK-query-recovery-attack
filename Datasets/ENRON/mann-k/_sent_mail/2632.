Well I say book all three nights if the cancellation policy is ok, and let's 
go for it.  Jack to the doggie spa, Michael with Paige.

Not at all!
I forgot to ask you about The Box this morning when we talked on the phone.
I will make sure it's put together tonight, but not sealed if there are any
last minute items that come to mind, and take it to the post office
tomorrow
morning. I will call and make reservations after checking the cancellation
policy. What days do you want, or should we wait to hear back from Paige?

Am I begging too much?

Can you mail her package tomorrow?  I meant to ask today, but I got home so
late I didn't get things together.  I put one of Michael's airplane
pictures in there.

If all else fails we can take Michael to Fort Worth.  My mom would love to
watch him as she wants him to be exposed to Fort Worth culture.  (a better
grade of  bean dip).

I'm very excited!!!!

Love,

Kay

Hi,

You must be busy these days.  I remember this time of year - and I don't
really miss it.  Cleaning and exercising were my favorite procrastination
activities.

Neil and I would like to schedule a brief Neil and Kay vacation over the
holidays.  We are looking at December 27-30, so we would be back before New
Year's Eve.  We will pay you handsomely (in cash!!!) for keeping Michael
for those days/nights.  What do you think?  We have found a room at the Inn
Above Onion Creek.  I know Michael would be so excited to spend the time
with you. We can give you guys a generous allowance to make things easier,
and you can drive the Lexus.

Do I sound like I'm begging yet?  I'm working really hard these days, and a
few days of no responsibilities sounds GREAT.

You should start watching your box at the end of the week.  Hope it gets
there before Saturday, since I know the SU post office is closed.

Love,

Mom
