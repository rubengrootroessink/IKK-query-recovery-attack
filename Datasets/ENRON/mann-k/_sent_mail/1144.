There certainly was quite a turn-out at last night's meeting in Florida.

=09=09More than 500 people packed the Pompano Beach Civic Center on Monday =
night in=20
a formidable display of opposition to Enron Corp.'s plans for a power plant=
=20
next to Florida's Turnpike.

Opponents arrived in buses chartered by condominiums. They came from=20
virtually all the cities of north Broward County, some holding signs, other=
s=20
clutching notes for statements they wanted to make. They included a member =
of=20
Congress, two county commissioners and a parade of city officials.

Enron officials insisted they weren't jarred by the display of opposition.=
=20
But spokesman Eric Thode acknowledged he hadn't seen anything like it in=20
other parts of the United States where the company has built plants.

The hearing was called by the state Department of Environmental Protection =
to=20
take comments on the agency's preliminary decision to issue the company a=
=20
permit. The agency had found that the 510-megawatt plant would not harm the=
=20
region's air quality.

But few people in the crowd were buying that. They expressed suspicion abou=
t=20
Enron's promise to run the plant only as a part-time, backup facility. They=
=20
said the region didn't need the power and that the company would simply sel=
l=20
it elsewhere. And they doubted whether state officials sitting onstage coul=
d=20
know everything about the possible harm the plant could cause.

"Don't let them tell us these chemicals are perfectly safe for us," said=20
Claire Hornstein, of Pompano Beach. "They do not know, and we're not na=12z=
?=20
enough to believe it."

Speakers expressed concern about their health and their children's health.

Craig Wolf, of Coconut Creek, said he had been in the hospital 47 times for=
=20
lung problems. He moved from Miami to escape the pollution, and now he fear=
s=20
it will follow him to his current home.

"This could cause me to end up in the hospital," he said. "Please don't do=
=20
this project.

Dan Mackey, of Coconut Creek, arrived with a hand-drawn sign that read,=20
"Think of Our Kids. Stuff the Stacks." Aware of the company's political=20
influence, such as its close ties to President Bush, Mackey said he wondere=
d=20
how much of a chance opponents had.

"We're afraid of Enron," said Mackey, who has a 10-year-old daughter. "We=
=20
don't feel we're in very good shape against them."

U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., spoke against the project, asking the DEP=
=20
officials seated in front to consider public health first.

"I think the people in this room and every resident of Broward County is ow=
ed=20
a presumption that the state will give every benefit of the doubt to health=
,"=20
he said.

Also speaking against the plant were County Commissioners Kristin Jacobs an=
d=20
Ilene Lieberman. A procession of mayors and commissioners from the cities=
=20
around Pompano Beach took turns at the microphone.

"I worry about the young kids with asthma and the seniors with emphysema,"=
=20
said Coconut Creek Commissioner Becky Tooley. "Are you going to take away=
=20
somebody's last breath just to make some money? I don't think so."

Thode, the Enron spokesman, expressed irritation at the statements from the=
=20
politicians.

"The thing that gets me is that we've met with these people, given them the=
=20
facts, and they continue to say things that are not true," he said. "Sellin=
g=20
outside the state of Florida -- not going to happen. The only way we operat=
e=20
is when a utility needs the electricity."

The DEP is scheduled to work on its final permit. But four cities have file=
d=20
a request to delay the permit so they can petition for an administrative=20
hearing.

The real decision on whether the plant gets built could belong to the Pompa=
no=20
Beach City Commission. The commission is scheduled to vote April 10 on=20
whether to rezone 28 acres for the plant from industrial to utility. At thi=
s=20
point, it appears the vote will be close.

"It's not what we need in our neighborhood," said Jim Story, of Deerfield=
=20
Beach. "It's not what we need for our families, for our health, our propert=
y=20
values. We don't like the traffic that the fuel trucks will cause. I've liv=
ed=20
here 30 years. I remember when they built the landfill, the incinerator.=20
Perhaps they'd like to put in a smelting plant."
