I forgot about the happy hour.  Where is it?

I think that carpool could be pretty hectic, and since you and I haven't 
picked him up we don't know the drill.  Picking him up an  hour later might 
be a lot easier, and it doesn't bother him.

Are you going to any of tomorrow's activities?

Kay

Probably. I guess we need to tell Norris he will be picked up later. Do you
want me to send her an e-mail or wait until we talk to Paige?
Also, what about the baseball tickets? Remember this is the Vehicle Repair
Loss Control Happy Hour today at 3:30pm. I will go late and leave early as
I've told everyone I need to pick up Michael.   NM

It would probably be easier if Paige picked him up at the CC, don't you
think?

Michael's class party is tomorrow at 2:15 followed at 3:15 by the gym class
party.

Next Wednesday school is out at 11:30 and he should be picked up in the car
pool line. The Children's Center is open until 6pm that day if needed.

Thanks for taking care of me last night and this morning.

Love, Neil

I forgot to write a check for the Astros tickets last night. Do you want to
write it and get it over to John?  Twenty games would be $2,377.20.
