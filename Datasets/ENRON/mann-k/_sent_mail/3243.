		 Subject: Hartwell

Debbie Chance forwarded me a memo from Sutherland Asbill about environmental 
and other permits and approvals for peakers to be sited in Georgia. I assume 
one of you retained Sutherland for your department's account and that it is 
not a project- specific local or other counsel per se. I came in late to the 
Georgia projects and we have retained another firm ( Kilpatrick & Stockton) 
for Athens ( being worked on by Raimund Grube)  and for some other Georgia 
site acquistions ( being worked on by Debbie Chance ). I had intended, to the 
extent called upon to work on Hartwell, to utilize the Kilpatrick Stockton 
firm and not Sutherland Asbill. Please let me know about  the scope of 
Sutherland's engagement.
