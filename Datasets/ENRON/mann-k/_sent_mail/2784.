Thanks for the current draft contract.  I have gone through it and plugged
in the relevant information I have from the Summary Sheet that GE approved
earlier.

What I don't have, and am most interested in obtaining from whatever source
has them, are the following:

     1.   Purchase price information (based on the current outstanding
balance)
     2.   Payment schedule (based on current outstanding balance) for
Section 6.1.2.
     3.   The massive volume of specifications and GE boilerplate that is
to be attached to the contract as Exhibits and Schedules.
     4.   A form for Exhibit U, setting out the correct site-adjusted
information for these 4 turbines.
     5.   Unit number identifications and guaranteed delivery dates for
each of the turbines.

We are prepared to fill in the unit-specific information beyond that which
we have already incorporated in the body of the document, and can fill in
specific numbers in Exhibit U, but need to have the remaining information.

Please note that there appears to be a couple of residual references in the
contract that may not or are not relevant to all contracts.

First, Section 10.10.6 (regarding maximum aggregate liquidated damages)
references 30% of the Purchase Amount.  It should be 30% of the Maximum
Liability Amount (according to the summary GE approved earlier).

Second, the contract provides for "Optional Electrical Output Guaranty" and
associated liquidated damages in 10.7.3.  This guaranty by its terms
applies only to installations utilizing 6 or more turbines.  I have deleted
it from the LV contract.

In addition, Bill Williams has told me that the site-adjusted performance
levels that GE provided for the summary information sheet are different
(and less favorable to the project ) than those GE provided him in other
documents.  We will need to confirm those numbers with GE.

Is there a contact point at GE whom we should talk with about getting the
information/Exhibits we need, or do we have the information already?

Please let me know.  We are in serious need of providing a document to our
prospective purchaser.
