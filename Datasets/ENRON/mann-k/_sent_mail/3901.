Hi again,

I just called Mom and told her our plans.  She says Dad has no clue.  She 
vacuumed on Monday or Tuesday, and he asked her who she was expecting to 
visit the next day. HA HA HA.

I told her that we are all very proud of ourselves for not blowing it.  

Dad doesn't know I called today, so I can call him tomorrow when we are on 
the way, talk to Mom and let her know when we will be there.  It won't be 
that weird for me to call on a Saturday morning.  She say Larry and Beverly 
left today, so we can park in their driveway and be sneaky.  

I'm so excited!!!  

Kay
