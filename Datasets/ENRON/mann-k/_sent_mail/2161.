Lisa,

Thanks.  I forwarded Roger the docs separately, but thanks for the reminder. 
I am capable of forgetting!

Kay,
1.  Finance will have comments to you this afternoon.
2.  I noticed just now that Roger Ondreko, as accounting signoff, was not 
copied.  Please insure he receives a set of agreements and comments timely so 
we can get the package out to the bank on the time line you require.

Thanks, Lisa
