I think you'll find there isn't that much to a site sale.  Witness 
Plano/Pontiac as compared to the Peakers.

Folks:

Please note in my e-mail below that we need to go live with this by April 2. 
This means that we all need to work together to make this happen. I would 
like to see a comprehensive index of all documents we intend to include ASAP. 
This list should include site plans and other drawings that we've spent a lot 
of money on. 

I look forward to reviewing this list.

Regards,

Ben
