Subject: Edgecombe




Attached is a draft blackline and clean copy of the Edgecombe PPA.  We did not
address the issue of security in this draft, but still regard it as an open 
item
subject to further discussion.

We look forward to receiving the information on the fuel arrangements, 
equipment
specifications and construction cost estimates so we can better evaluate the
proposal you presented last Thursday.
