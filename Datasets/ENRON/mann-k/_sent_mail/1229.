Reagan,

I don't suggest it, especially since this is not an "off the shelf" deal. 
There are so many moving parts to this deal it could slow it down in the long 
run to get someone else involved for a few days. It is like getting a new 
commercial guy involved for 4 days. I'll defer to the great and powerful Oz.  

I should be available most of the day, so let's see how things go.

Kay

Kay,  

Marvin is out of pocket right now.  If we do not hear from David Hunt this 
morning, is there someone running backup for you?

Federal jurisdiction and limit of liability verbage.  That's what comes to 
mind at this point.

Could you email me the most current version (I think it was March 3)?  

Thanks,

Kay

You were reading my mind.  What is the list of things he owes us?  David F. 
and I will call Marvin to report on the status.

Thank you,

Reagan

Reagan,

I haven't received an email from David Hunt yet.  I will make the changes you 
and I discussed last week, and perhaps we will get David's changes sometime 
today.

Kay
