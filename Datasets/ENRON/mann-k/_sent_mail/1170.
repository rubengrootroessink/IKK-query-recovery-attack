Ben/Chris,

Unless something new comes up, I think we finished the letter agreement.  I'm 
awaiting a revised draft now, and if it is acceptable to NW, they will sign 
it and fax it to me tomorrow morning.  

Maybe on Ben's layover we can have a discussion about where we go from here 
from a schedule standpoint.  

Talk to you tomorrow,

Kay
