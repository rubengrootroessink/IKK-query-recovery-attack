Hi Heather, Jeff and Ozzie,

The only issue I have with the testimony is the statement that the units are 
"extremely quiet".  At this point FCE will only guaranty 60dba, which some 
folks might not consider to be extremely quiet depending on how close a 
facility is to their house.  You may have determined that the noise level 
will be some number less than 60 dba so that the guaranty level does not 
reflect the expected noise level.   

Kay
