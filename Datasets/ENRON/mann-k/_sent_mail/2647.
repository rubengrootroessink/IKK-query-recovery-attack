Coral wants some comfort from GE.  This is their proposal.

Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  Today has been beyond frenetic.

I agree with your comment #1.  I expect they will ask us for a rep like the 
one in #2, but they still want to hear it from GE.

Kay:

My comments as follows:

1. In item 1, we should reference Coral's purchase of 80% of the member 
interests, and potential purchase of the remaining 20% after the COD.

2. Shouldn't we be able to handle item 2 with an ENA rep?

I think the acknowledgement letter needs to be very narrow with respect to 
the sale of the 80% member interest to Coral, and potential purchase of the 
remaining 20%.. An acknowledgement from GE that the sale of the 80% and 
subsequent sale of the remining 20% comply with the assignment provisions 
should be sufficient.

Regards,

Ben

Subject to review of the final form of Facility Agreement, attached is a
proposed form of acknowledgement letter which would be required to be
obtained from GE with respect to each LLC, with the name of each LLC
changed accordingly.
