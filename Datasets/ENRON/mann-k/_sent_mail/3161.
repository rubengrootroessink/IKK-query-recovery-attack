I think the effective dates have been relating to when the deal was cut.  
That's as much a guess as anything.

Ben left me a voice mail that said he had gotten something from ESA on #3, 
but I haven't made it through all my emails to see if I have it. I will send 
it to you if I do, of course.

I would think #4 is ready as soon as I get confirmation that the dates are 
correct.  Again, I have to check my emails.

I heard a rumor about 5 (but am now drawing a blank), and haven't heard of 
any others.

Kay, from a general financing perspective the below looks fine.  For all 
these change orders, why do we keep having to make them effective long before 
they are actually executed?  I am concerned because for both WestLB and 
TurboPark, we need to provide the executed change orders to them on a timely 
basis.  Doesn't look so timely when we keep back dating documents.

I am very confused with Change Order Numbers also.  I received the executed 
Change Order 1.  Any idea where we are on 3, 4 and 5?  Any others on the 
horizon that you know of?

Regards, Lisa
