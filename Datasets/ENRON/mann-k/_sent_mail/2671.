Michelle,

Carlos would be a great addition at ENA in any transactional capacity.  I 
worked with him extensively (actually, I hired him), and he is terrific.  

Thanks,

Kay

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and
joint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)
where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex
on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements
and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and
IPP projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work,
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).
