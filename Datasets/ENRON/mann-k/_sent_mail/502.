Hi Ed,

Here's the language they offered:

M. Each of the Cities has obligated itself to be responsible for and to pay=
=20
to, or on behalf of, MDEA, if required, that proportion of the minimum=20
monthly fee which that City=01,s hourly demand was coincident with Entergy=
=01,s=20
peak hour demand in the year 2000 bears to the sum of both Cities=01, hourl=
y=20
demand during such hour; provided however, that each City has further=20
obligated itself to be responsible for and to pay that portion of EMPI=01,s=
=20
monthly fee which the economic benefit to that City from transactions bears=
=20
to the total economic benefit to both Cities from such transactions during=
=20
the month.


It is a bit cumbersome, but I think I like it.  What do you think?

I'll forward the entire doc soon.
