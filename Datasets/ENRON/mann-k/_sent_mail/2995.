We want to have an internal conference call at 330 (instato discuss the 
enovate intercompany loans, and address any issues raised by the Enron 
commercial/financial team.  I don't know the substance of the comments.

Early morning is full, but I'm free at 10:00 and several hours thereafter.  
Would this be in addition to or in lieu of the 3:30 call?  Also, do you have 
any heads-up re:  what the comments will be?

Thanks.  Heather

What about Wednesday morning to discuss Bracewell's draft of the
intercompany loan agreement?  Kay could you check Heather's availability?
Anyone else that should be included?

Thanks,

Gregg
