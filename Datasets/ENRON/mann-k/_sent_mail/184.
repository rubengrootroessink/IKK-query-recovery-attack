the MDEA rep needs to reveiw it.

Kay -- Do you know if David H. is going to give you comments?  If you haven't 
heard for sure, one of us will call Marvin and find out/coordinate.  Just 
don't want to call if this has already been discussed with them.

Is there anything else at this stage that we can do to help your efforts on 
the Extension or the main agreement?

Thanks  -- David

Sounds good if you would like to forward to counter parties.  

I've sent a draft to their counsel all ready (D Hunt and Hemleben).
