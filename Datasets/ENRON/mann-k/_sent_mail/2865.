Here's how it is shaping up:

We have a fence appointment for noon, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  
That is the first opening, but there is always a chance of a cancellation. 
Just in case there is an earlier opening, the utility people will be out 
tomorrow. Therefore, we need to have BOTH dogs put up tomorrow, and the gate 
open.

We have a noon appointment with John Foster THIS Wednesday.  There is a $20 
consulting fee.  This is the same day Michael's class sings in chapel at 115, 
so this isn't too bad.  I have a 130 staff meeting, but maybe I can miss it.  
The work will NOT be done that day, as far as I know.

If we have  a hope of leaving town the week of Thanksgiving, we need a 
reservation at the kennel.  Do we have one yet?  I would say we might want 
one Fri and Sat night. Also, we might want to consider boarding Jack this 
week for a couple of days, so we don't have to do the crate trip.  We should 
be ok Saturday-Wednesday, since I'm planning on being home, and Paige will be 
home on Tuesday.
