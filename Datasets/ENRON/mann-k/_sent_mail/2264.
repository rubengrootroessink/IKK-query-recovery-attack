Kay:

I talked with NRG (San Diego) regarding the CA for the 7EA purchase.

The NRG entity that will be executing the CA is:

 NRG Development Co., Inc.
 750 B Street
 San Diego, CA  92101
 Attention:  Mr. Scott Magie

If asked, I will relay to Scott that the form of the Agreement was based on 
Enron's form utilized in all turbine transaction CA's.

hohohow's the egg flowing today on 38?

Fred
