Kay:

I have been speaking with Barbara Cole at Dominion Resources regarding 
Article 11 (Taxes) of the Capacity and Energy Agreement By and Between 
Edgecombe Development Co., LLC and Virginia Electric and Power Company.  
Below please find a revised Article 11.2.  

We recommend the deletion of the language in red.  Additionally, we recommend 
the insertion of the language in blue.

Thanks.
