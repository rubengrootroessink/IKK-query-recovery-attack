Kathy,

Could you please accommodate Karen's request?  If you would like, you can 
just send it to me and I will get it to her.  If you have delivered my 
original to me I can make make her a copy.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I was wondering if it might be possible to obtain a copy of the Transformer 
contract executed with ABB as well as any change order contracts which were 
submitted to GE?  If you're not the person from whom I should request this 
information, could you please point me in the right direction?  Thanks.

Karen
