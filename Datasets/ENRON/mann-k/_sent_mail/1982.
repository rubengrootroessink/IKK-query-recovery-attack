Pete,

I'm sending you a fax regarding some changes requested by NEPCO/EECC (our 
affiliate).  From what he has sent me, it does not seem that the Fountain 
Valley contract contains the optional guarantee that is in effect for plants 
comprised of 6 or more units.  It would seem to be applicable in this case.  
Was it deleted intentionally?

Thanks,

Kay
