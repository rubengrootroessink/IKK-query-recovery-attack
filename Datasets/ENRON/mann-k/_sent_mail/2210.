I've been told by Global Finance that this is how TurboPark stuff gets 
invoiced.  I'm thinking it might help if copies are sent to project people.  
What do you think?

Kay,

Please confirm that this will be the invoicing address for the 6 units bound
for Fountain Valley Project and 4 units pegged to LV Cogen Expansion.  Also,
we've still got a change order needed for Fountain Valley for the 6 Power
System Stabilizers and 2 Exhaust Stacks.  LV is also saying they will need 4
Power System Stabilizers, but haven't confirmed their order.

Thanks,

Lee
