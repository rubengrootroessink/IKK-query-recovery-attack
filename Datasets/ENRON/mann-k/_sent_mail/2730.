Hi Guys,

I can't recall if you have made any revisions to the exhibits.  Please advise 
(and resend) if you have.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I have a conflict Wed afternoon.  But can catch up on Thurs with you and
Kent.

Meanwhile, please send me an e-copy of the LM Exhibits.  I can do a quick
redline of those that change.  I've already marked up w/ red pen, the ESA
Electrobolt + the Summary of terms sheet (ala Dale's on LV II).

Thanks,

Lee

Dear Turbine Torture Club Members:

The purpose of this email is to confirm that we will have a conference call
this Wednesday, November 29 at 130 CT.  The following items have been
suggested for the agenda:

Form of consent to assignment agreement (draft circulated) - to be used for
LM's and Frames, if possible.
Assignment language - new language being tortured within the Enron ranks,
to GE soon.
Limit of liability, indemnity, etc. - Enron owes GE a position on this.

In addition, it seems to me that the following equipment will be "moving"
soon:

City of Austin LM's (to be assigned to ENA, then NEPCO)
LM's for the ESA project
PSCO, LV CoGen, the remaining LM's, Pastoria, Blue Dog (all to DevCo,
right?)

I suggest that we address any commercial, financial or legal issues
outstanding concerning the assignment of these turbines.

There may be others who need to be involved in the call, and there may be
additional issues.  Please advise.

Thanks,

Kay
