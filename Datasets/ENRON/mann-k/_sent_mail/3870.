Hi Kay,

I trying to find out if we have confidentiality agreements with the following:

Virginia Power  I have an agreement with Virginia Electric & Power Co. in 
Richmond  re possible power purchase agreement for possible  purchase of 
electricity from various sources including, but not limited to, ENA's 
proposed electric generation facility to be located in Edgecombe County, 
North Carolina - April 2000 to April 2002

Dominion Resources (or something close)  There is a Dominion Resources, Inc. 
in Richmond - we do not have any agreements with or pertaining to them - 
There is a Dominion energy Canada Ltd.  with who we have an agreement 
regarding their potential acquisition of Blue Range Resource Corporation

Electricities (don't know the remainder of the name)  There is a recently 
expired (6/2/97 to 6/2/00) Electricities of north Carolina, Inc. agreement re 
Electricities on behalf of North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency and 
North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number 1is exploring the feasibility 
and desirability of certain arrangement \s between Electricities, Eastern 
and/or Agency 1 and Enron

North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency - Nothing with or pertaining to 
North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power to the best of my knowledge.

Thanks,

Kay


Hope this helps.
