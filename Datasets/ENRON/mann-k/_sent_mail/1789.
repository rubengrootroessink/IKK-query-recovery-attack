How's about we talk about it?  I think that's more efficient.  As long as we 
talk before the next call, we should be in good shape.

Subject: GE - End World Hunger

Could I please get your feedback on the comments I sent to you re the 
Indemnity, LOL and Nondisclosure provisions so that I can consolidate and 
send our comments to GE on Monday (unless of course you took these up with GE 
in the last call that I missed).

Thanks,

Scott
