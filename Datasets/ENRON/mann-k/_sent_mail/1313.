Well, I know Jack probably won't know where to pee since won't have Rosco to 
aim at.  I guess Kaley will have to growl at Jack just to stay in practice.

I should add that Kendall is due at the end of next week, and if something 
urgent comes up, I could have to cover for Carlos.  Not likely but you know 
how the baby stuff goes.

I think Rosco is going to be at least 70 pounds, although I don't have any 
information to go on.  You mentioned that his pop is a big dog, so I guess we 
should expect him to be big.  Maybe one of those tall Labs.  I just hope his 
personality stays the same.

I agree about skipping Sharon. It is his Spring break after all. I will tell
her.
Hey, don't worry, Michael can teach you about artificials! Just ask him!
I don't know about you taking Rosco. I mean it doesn't matter to me you
understand. But what will Kalie and Jack do without him? They will be so
lonely! Who will chase Jack around when he's trying to pee or bite him on
the ears? And who will be lazy with Kalie during the day? I'm just thinking
about them don't you know...NM

ps...
Have you noticed how tall Rosco is getting? It hit me today as I was
watching him with Jack. He's almost as tall as Jack! He's going to be really
big!!

I cleared not going to Atlanta with Elizabeth, so I should be able to take
Michael to Palacios as soon as Monday.  Supposed to rain this weekend
anyway, so Monday is soon enough. I would just as soon not have a Sharon
appointment so we have that flexibility.  Plus, there is the possibility
that I might need to go to FW for my dad.  Michael can go to FW with me if
I need to go - he would be great company for me. I've thought about taking
him to Moody Gardens, or do some other fun stuff as an alternative.   The
long term weather forecast for Houston and Palacios is glorious for that
week, but you never know.  I don't mind taking him by myself.  I can do
most of the fishing stuff, although I don't know squat about artificials.
If I do go I would like to take Rosco.  Since my folks have an internet
connection I can keep up with a little work and write you, too.

What do you think?
