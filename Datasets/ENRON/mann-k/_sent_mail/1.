At the very least, the cancellation charges are theirs.

Exactly what I told Lorie (send her a gift certificate for a manicure and 
pedicure), but she kind of balked.  I'm not sure of her taste.  It'll be 
interesting to see what they send you.  Let me know.

Works for me.  We are leaving to check in to the hotel, then back.  I had to 
cancel manicure/pedicure ( and charged for it)  A hint that a gift 
certificate for same would work might be appropriate.

Jacoby's assistant just called and wanted your home address.  Apparently Ben 
is going to send you something or someone (manicurist/pedicurist) to your 
home.  I told her you liked champagne too if he wanted to get you a beverage 
and also that you would be leaving to go celebrate your daughter's birthday a 
little later this afternoon.  I didn't want them sending out someone and you 
not be there.  I can see you now with the phone in one hand and a manicurist 
on the other or better yet, a glass of bubbly!
