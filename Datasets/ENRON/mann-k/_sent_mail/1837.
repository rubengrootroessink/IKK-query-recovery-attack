You're right, it sounds better spoken than it looks written.  I get the 
point, though.

4ish my time looks good.

Subject: Can I pick your brains . . .

(ooh, that looks bad in print) for a few minutes sometime on Tuesday?  I'm 
working my way through (what else) TurboPark docs, and want to educate myself 
a bit further on how we'll move the GE turbine contracts for Pastoria from 
E-Next to Calpine's entity before I put the questions to Lisa B.  My schedule 
is fairly open for tomorrow at this point --  you?

Thanks, Kay.  I promise I'll pass along what I learn to Dale and Al!!  --  kj
