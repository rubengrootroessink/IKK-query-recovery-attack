Hi Gregg,

I've sent John an email (didn't have his number).  If you have it I will 
follow up  with a phone call.

I was out yesterday (jury duty called) and Janet was out-of-pocket this 
afternoon.  I'll try to track her down tomorrow.

I will forward the finance agreement to a finance lawyer and tax, and will 
send you a copy so you'll know who is in the loop.

Kay

Kay - just to be my usual pain-in-the-neck self, can you let me know about 
the following:

1-Status of the CA. Did you have a chance to speak with John Nassos?
2-Management appointment.  If Janet signed it, can I get a copy to give to 
Peoples?
3-Intercompany loan document.  I am expecting our balance to increase again 
this month (the 25th to be specific) and I would like to get something put in 
place ASAP to earn a higher return.  If you have a name of a finance 
attorney, I can try to explain what we are trying to accomplish and perhaps 
there is a quicker way to get it done.   I know you were also looking at this 
from a tax perspective.

As always - thanks.

Gregg
