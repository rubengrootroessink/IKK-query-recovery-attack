Well, Ben's POA is executed, it is just a matter of getting some of the poa's 
for the subs worked out.  Come see me whenever you want.

Just wanted you to know that Ann Elizabeth is freaking out about Ben's POA 
not being executed yet and I think she is going to talk to you about it.  I 
told her that you and I were working on it but that it just kind of got 
pushed down in the priority.  I personally do not think it is a big deal (but 
she sure does).

Also, since Matt is taking Deb Korkmas' place I am going to give him a list 
of companies and people we want to be listed as officers.  I'll send you, 
Carlos and Ann Elizabeth a draft list soon so we can decide who we want (may 
be like the officers listed on Merchant Ventures)
