Thanks.  I'll keep it to myself.  

I think having a list is a sign of progress.  

830 am is a bit early to work it into a happy hour.  However, there are lunch 
possibilities...

The other commercial issue I saw was confirming the invoicing procedures, 
how/who will calculate cumulative net revenue, and flow of money in general.  
Fits in with the refund stuff.
