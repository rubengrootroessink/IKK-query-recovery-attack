Sounds like a good approach to me.

Subject: PSEG questions & comments

I talked with PSEG this afternoon.  They plan to forward us their comments on 
the draft SPA sometime tomorrow.  I have reviewed their due diligence 
questions and plan to address most of them in a phone call with PSEG tomorrow.

I instructed PSEG to forward me a copy of their proposed side letter 
addressing a $300K non-refundable deposit and 30 day exclusivity period.  I 
told them that we would look at it and let them know if we viewed it as a 
viable option.  They plan to forward it to us tomorrow along with their legal 
comments on the draft SPA.

I will keep you informed.

Fred
