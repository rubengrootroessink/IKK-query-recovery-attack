I had the call anyway with Mike and Steve.  We actually made progress in 
outlining the issues.  Mike should be generating an email.  We voted to take 
next week off. Hope that's ok.

Sorry I missed the call.  I was up to eyeballs in PSCO and caught in a very 
COLD and NASTY blizzard in Toronto in my little suit and heels!  I'm trying 
to get home.  Maybe tomorrow.
