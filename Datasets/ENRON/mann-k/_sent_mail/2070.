So long as the equipment is held by E-Next, Jody Pierce needs to get the 
invoices, although copies can be sent elsewhere.

Attached is an edited file for the ABB/Fountain Valley agreement. I have 
removed and made revisions to several sections to make it specific to the 3 
units for Fountain Valley. Specific revisions include:

Exhibit B1
- Page 23, revise quantity from 6 to 3
- Pages 43 through 86, delete pages specific to other designs

As noted in the forwarded e-mail, the contact information in Sections 25.1 
and 25.3 needs to be revised to replace Purchaser -

Question in Section 6.7.2 on Address for invoices - Is NEPCO the intended 
location for invoices?
