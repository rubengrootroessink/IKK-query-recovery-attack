Subject: Delta assignment and assumption

Hi there,

Here's the assignment and assumption agreement with the GE consent included.  
Please let me know if you have any comments.

Thanks,

Kay




PS.  In discussing the mechanism to move the turbines, it seemed that it 
would work ok to assign the turbines out of the AIP.  I can't find a flaw 
with that approach.
