Attached is a clean and red lined version of the loi.  I'm expecting a call 
from David Hunt,  so I haven't dealt with the limit of liability stuff yet.  
The Beck comments are good comments which we need to discuss internally, but 
since we haven't, I'm happy to take the position that the comments seem to 
fit better in the drafting of the definitive ageements.
