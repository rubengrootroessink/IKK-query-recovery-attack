I'm glad you mentioned that fact.  I'll keep you advised of anything I come 
across that relates to a peaker. 

Speaking of which, are you generally aware of a warranty claim against 
Westinghouse for the Gleason project? I've been helping Mitch out here and 
there on it.

Kay

Would the party that claims responsibility please advise me on the 
anticipated improvements in Caledonia?  Because of the potential disposition 
of our 99 and 2000 peakers, I need to have a working knowledge of all related 
matters.  Many thanks.

Stuart
