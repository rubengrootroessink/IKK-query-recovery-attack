Kay,

I don't know if you opened the attached document, but George has done 
everything for us.  All we need to do is get the letters signed.

Could you let me know how many there are, so I'll know how we want to handle 
this.

Kay,

Please have the appropriate managing directors and officers of CAED I
and CAED II execute the attached resignations and return the executed
resignations to Doug Pedigo.  If any other persons were manging
directors or officers of CAED I or CAED II prior to closing, please have
them execute similar resignations and furnish them to Doug.  Thanks.

George
