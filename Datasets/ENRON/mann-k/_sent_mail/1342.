Jake mentioned Delta but not Panda.  I'm with you - go Delta.  Who wants to 
mess with the broker issue?

Ciao,

Kay

Steve Thome just called with an update:

- Panda will be providing comments next week 

- Sunlaw dropped out because California rescinded its fast track permit 
approval process and thus Sunlaw will not have permits for the facilities it 
wants

- Delta will provide comments on Monday

Have a good weekend.  Go Delta they're the remaining high bidder.
