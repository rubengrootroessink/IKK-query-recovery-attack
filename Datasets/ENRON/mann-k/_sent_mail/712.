We are pleased to announce the creation of a new group - Asset Marketing -

the asset divestment function within Enron Americas and work with Generation 
Investments on selected portfolio acquisitions as well as managing power 
origination funding requirements with Treasury.   

Don Miller will head the Asset Marketing group and will report directly to 
the Office of the Chair, Enron Americas. Joining Don's group will be Stuart 
Zisman.  Stuart was formerly in ENA Legal, having most recently worked on the 
sale of ENA's peaker plants with Don.

Please join us in congratulating Don and Stuart in their new roles.
