This is the VEPCO contact list, as far as I know.  Do we have another one? 
(opps!) This is the one Gloria did while you were on holiday in the West.  
(Doesn't that sound good?)

Is this to be added to the VEPCO contact list?  New list?

Here's a draft.  More names are being added, so feel free to suggest more 
that we forgot/overlooked, including those external to Enron.  

Please send the info directly to Suzanne Adams.

Lisa, Mitch and Chris, you will be on the next draft.  Sorry for the 
oversight this time around.

Thank you,

Kay
