Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think we've done that on the other two deals.  
Kathleen would know.

For the escrow.  Unfortunately, Citibank's form contained the following
language in the signature block: "In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my
hand and affixed the corporate seal of the Company this ______ day of May,
2001."

Is this for the escrow or other docs?  I know Citibank does not require a
corporate seal.  What BS!

Kathleen is out sick, so it will be a day or two.

Kathleen:

Paul Hastings would like ENA to resign the Incumbency Certificate, since
the
original Certificate did not affix the corporate seal.  Could you
coordinate
this and make sure the seal is affixed to the new Certificate?  Thanks.

Call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Marisa
