Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may 
favorite locations. It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I 
can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I 
might remember the names.
