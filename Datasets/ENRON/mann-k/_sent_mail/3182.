Does that take into account that more money may be going into the spending 
account?  I think we have a total of $2500 allocated for the year.  My 
records indicate that I've put in $1900 as of my last paycheck.

Love,

Kay

I just received the EOBs back on Sharon Seals. They will not pay. If the
reimbusement account pays it will leave about $900.00 in the account. I will
try to get the form completed tonight and in the mail tomorrow.
