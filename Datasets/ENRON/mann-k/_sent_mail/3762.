HELP!  What's my R/C number?    Is it 00406373?  Does that look like an RC?

We need to get an invoice from the travel agency Heather and Ozzie used for 
my flights last week.  I know the travel agent's name is Julie, but I don't 
know the details.  The agency is something like Vitol.  I suspect Claudette 
can give you the telephone number, etc.  I would have gotten a receipt from 
Continental, but the E ticket machine wasn't working.

I have the rest of the receipts.
