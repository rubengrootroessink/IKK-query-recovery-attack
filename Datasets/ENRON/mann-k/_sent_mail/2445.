Suzanne,

On my desk (on the window side) you will find a bound volume of a contract 
for 24 turbine generator sets (between GE and a bank with a long name).  
Could you please fed ex it to Peter Thompson at A&K in DC.  Peter, could you 
please give Suzanne the information of where to send it.

Pete, this will give you a full set of exhibits, since you don't have 
everything.

Suz, you don't have to make a copy, as I believe that copy to be an extra.  
If we need a copy Pete can send us a copy later.

Thanks,

Kay
