Subject: Re: Rodeo Tickets 

I am soooo sorry I made a mistake.  My daughter's schedule will allow her to 
attend Clay Walker - not Def Leppard.

If you still have 2 tickets for February 13 (Clay Walker) I would like to 
purchase those.

If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack) I 
would like to purchase those.

Sorry for the confusion.

Thank you!!








Kay,

If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack) I 
would like to purchase those.

Do you mind checking to see if you have 2 tickets for March 1 (Def Leppard), 
if you do I would like to purchase those also.

Just let me know.

Thanks so much!
