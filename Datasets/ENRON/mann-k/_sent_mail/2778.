Kay,

our contact with GE tends to be indirect through turnkey contractors on power 
plants: the turnkey contractor usually contracts with GE instead of Enron as 
owner. So this would probably not be high on our list of priorities, although 
we would be interested to see what you come up with. 

You might want input to your process from our engineering team, lead by John 
Chappell, so I have copied this to John.



       Mark

Subject: GE "Standard" Contract/off balance sheet

Greetings,

I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more 
standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.  The goal is to 
develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the 
same  points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.  Sheila 
has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might 
find interesting and/or helpful.

You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.  Please 
let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.

Thank you,

Kay
