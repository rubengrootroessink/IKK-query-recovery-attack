We need to verify this is a 36 mos lease because the term value says 48 mos.
I had said we wanted to see a rate at 36 mos with 10K down. I assume she
used the 10K as total out of pocket expenses at time of delivery and that's
why the cost reduction is 7500. The mo payment is about the same as the
Lexus. As for the two additions, the aftermarket folks do good work so that
should not be a concern. Shoot, some dealerships may even use the same folks
to do the work for them and then mark it up. Bottom line, it's your call. If
you choose to walk away, I'm ok with it. If you do, what do you want to do
going forward. Look at something else? Go back to McGinnis? NM

Kay,
The dealership will not come down on the price
for the gold and wood trim.  I have an aftermarket
company that can do both for $550.00.  Here is
a 36 month quote for the Cadillac including the
gold and wood.  Please review and let me know if you
have any questions.

EQUITY LEASE FOR TERM OF 36 MONTHS

$  39976.38          Cost of vehicle
    2498.52*Sales tax
     161.00*Registration
    7500.00*Cost reduction
------------
$  39976.38          Delivered price
------------
$    568.33          monthly depreciation
     187.81          Monthly lease charge
------------
$    756.14          Monthly rental

$  12016.15          Termination value @ 48 months

*to be billed on delivery

Let me know what you think.

Leatha

Hi Leatha,

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it,
however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the
extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we
asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the
wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount
the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get
reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to
"work on it".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my
Lexus.

Thanks,

Kay
