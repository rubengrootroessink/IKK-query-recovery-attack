Gentlemen,

These docs are ready to go, and your signatures would be appreciated.  I will

Hi Catherine,

I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.



I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
form for that one yet.

Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?

Thanks,

Kay
