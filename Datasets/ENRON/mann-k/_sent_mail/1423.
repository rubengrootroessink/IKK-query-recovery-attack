Cindy,

How long would we have until we need to release the rooms to avoid the 
charge?  I  think your suggestion will work.

Kay

Hi Kay,

I'm so happy that you guys are coming to visit us.  May 4 - 7, 2001 are
great dates for your group to come, however I can not block rooms due to our
availability at this time.  .  The only way I can guarantee the rooms is to
get a $3000 pre-payment to hold the rooms.  If you would like to hold that
on your credit card until they call with their own, I can do that.  I  will
keep an eye on it for you and if you just want to have everyone call me as
soon as they can or I can call them.

Just let me know how I can make this easiest for you.  Do you know if your
group wants signature or premier rooms?

See you soon.

Hi Cindy,

Would it be possible to block some rooms for a couple of weeks while people
make their reservations?  I'm thinking maybe ten rooms for May 4, 5, and 6,
out on the 7th?  I would like it best if the individuals could call you
directly to make the reservation.  How does that work for you?

Thanks,

Kay
