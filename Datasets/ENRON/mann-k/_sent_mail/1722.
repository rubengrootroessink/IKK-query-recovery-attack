Please call Lee Johnson and tell him that one of our development lawyers, 
Roger Balog, would like 2 tickets for Friday.  I hear Ben wants a ticket for 
Thursday, but I assume he communicated that to Lee.  Thank him for me, but I 
have my closing dinner tomorrow, and no sitter Friday.

Thanks,

Kay
