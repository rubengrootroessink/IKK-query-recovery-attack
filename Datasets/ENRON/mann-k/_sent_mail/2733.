You guys must be exhausted with all that activity.  Congratulations on the 
grandbaby.  That's a BIG deal.  My oldest "baby" is 20, a junior in college, 
and my Michael is 6.  Every age is special.

Thanks for the periodic updates about Michael.  He's in my thoughts, so I 
appreciate the info.  

Kay

Thanks, Kay.  Really appreciate your efforts.  

Despite Michael's problems, we did have a pretty good year as our oldest
Son was married on September 30 and the first Joyce Grandchild was born
to our Daughter on October 24.

Bob

   Hi Bob,
   
   I believe I gave on October 24, so I'll go again around Christmas.
   I'm
   glad that you've gotten some good news, and here's hoping for a much
   better
   2001!
