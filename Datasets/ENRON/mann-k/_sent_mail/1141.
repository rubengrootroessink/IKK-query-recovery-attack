These are both pending, but just so you know they exist, I'm sending this 
along.  Once these are signed I'll send you copies.

Hi there,

Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of 
both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets? I 
want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.

Thanks,

Kay
