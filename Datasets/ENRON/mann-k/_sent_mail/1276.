Executed.  Should have let you know.  Yes, please process.  Kay, if you have 
a signed version of the agreement, you may want to forward a copy to Theresa.

Thanks,

Mitch

Any news on when the Westinghouse Settlement Agreement will be executed?  I 
am responsible for processing the $1,567,099 payment from the peakers once it 
is signed.
