Friends and Colleagues,

I want to apologize in advance for the impersonal nature of this request; 
but, I believe that the potential results may justify the means.  I am 
requesting that each of you strongly consider making a contribution to the 
American Diabetes Association.  My sister, Valerie, who is a school teacher 
at the Rice School has organized a "School Walk" to benefit the ADA.  
Although I am always reluctant to solicit contributions from my friends and 
co-workers, I feel emotionally compelled to do so this time.  In addition to 
my sister's involvement in this fund raiser, my brother Steven was diagnosed 
several years ago with Adult On-Set Juvenile Diabetes and I have seen first 
hand what a terrible disease this can be to manage.  There is good news, as 
many of you know.  The research in this area has made great strides in recent 
years and I am encouraged that someday soon there will be a cure.

In this regard, I would truly appreciate any contribution that each of you 
might be able to make.  Something as small as $5.00 would be great. (although 
if your pockets are full and you want to give more that is ok too)  I would 
be forever grateful if, through the donations that I am able to collect, I am 
able to make a difference.  Please feel free to send your checks via 
inter-office mail or stop by if you wish.  Thank you for your consideration.

With much appreciation,

Stuart
