I say hard bind the originals and get one set of GBC bound (easier to 
photocopy) if we need to.  Do you think we will need more than 2 sets?

and one set with partial originals.  Please let me know whether you want
these originals sets in redwells or bound in some manner.  Also, please
advise whether you wish to have additional copies velobound,  GBC bound

number of each.  Thanks.
