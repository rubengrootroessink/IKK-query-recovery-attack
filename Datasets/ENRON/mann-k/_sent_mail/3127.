Heather, 

Could we handle the CRRA LOI at the same time?  It would help me get finished 
with the FCE doc. 

I'm sure you saw that GE and Honeywell are merging.  I wonder if that makes 
ONSI a part of GE?  Does GE have a fuel cell product yet? It would explain 
the statement in the Journal that headquarters would not be in NJ or 
Connecticut.

Kay

Team,

 Scott should be in the office at 1:00 pm today and would like to have a 
meeting with everyone to review where we are and what the punch list is for 
this week and next week.  If you are available at 1:00 today, please let me 
know so that I can get a conference room.  Thanks.

Stephen
