It would probably be easier if Paige picked him up at the CC, don't you think?

Subject: michael's schedule

Michael's class party is tomorrow at 2:15 followed at 3:15 by the gym class
party.

Next Wednesday school is out at 11:30 and he should be picked up in the car
pool line. The Children's Center is open until 6pm that day if needed.

Thanks for taking care of me last night and this morning.

Love, Neil

I forgot to write a check for the Astros tickets last night. Do you want to
write it and get it over to John?  Twenty games would be $2,377.20.
