Roger Ondreko left the company (or is leaving soon).  Herman brought Billy 
Flemmin (sp?) yesterday, and Billy seems to be involved in a bunch of stuff.

Your tax guys are Matt Gockerman (state) and Rhett Jackson (federal).

Lorie:

It's high time we had some fun around here! 

Please set up a dinner for Wednesday, April 18 or Thursday April 19 at Papa's 
steak house. The invitee list should include our whole group (including you 
and Glenn), as well as:

Dave Duran
Kay Mann
Carlos Sole
Ann Elizabeth White
Jeff Hodge
Barbara Gray
Sheila Tweed
Stuart Zisman
Lisa Bills
Joe Deffner
Catherine Clark
Roseann Engeldorf
Herman Manis
Roger Ondreko

Please discuss the invitee list with Fred to determine if anybody should be 
added.

Please get a preliminary head count, and contact Papa's to determine if and 
when they can accommodate us. We can talk tomorrow about this.

Thanks,

Ben
