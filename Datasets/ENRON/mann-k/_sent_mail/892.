Subject: Good Friday

Good Morning Margaret,

I wanted to get your permission to come in by 9a.m. this Friday, April 13, 
2001.  I have been asked to preach that morning for my church's Passion 
Service.  Passion Service begins at 6a.m.  I should be up preaching by 6:45.  
It is very possible that I could be finished around 8a.m.  However, just in 
case things move slow, I may need the 9a.m time.  Passion Service reflects 
the crucifixion, death, and burial of Jesus Christ.

Please advise me.

Thanks in advance, Warren.
