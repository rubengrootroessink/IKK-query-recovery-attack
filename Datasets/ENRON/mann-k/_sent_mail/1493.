I haven't heard back from Dale.  Sheila and I have swapped voice mails.

Kay:

Relative to the Panda deal,

1.  What feedback have you received on the Portland legal question?

2.  What is the status of the GE breakout contract for the LV units?  Panda 
has asked (twice) for this and I would like to give them a timeline for its 
delivery.  We will need a day or two to redact the sensitive commercial data 
before delivery to Panda.

3.  I will call Panda this morning and float the $250K exclusivity fee 
concept.

4. Will the draft Letter Agreement be available today?  I have told Panda 
that this document would come first with the Facility Agreement and LLC 
Agreement to follow.

5. Stephen Thome is scheduled to be in Houston this afternoon.  I will bring 
him up to speed.

Let me know on 1,2, and 4 above.

Thanks,
Fred
