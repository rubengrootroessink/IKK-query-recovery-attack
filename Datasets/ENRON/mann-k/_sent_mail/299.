Doug,

Here's the revised CA.  I highlighted the changed terms.  In addition, I 
deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a 
prior CA.

I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same,  but 
obviously I left that for you to determine.  I expect that the Enron entity 
which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity.  



I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the complexity 
of the issues, and I added 6 months to  the term since things won't get 
cranked up for a while.

I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.  Have a good weekend.

Kay
