Kay,

Here is the Cover Sheet and Attachments for the above C/P.  I wasn't sure 
about the due diligence on the "agency relationship" so was unsure as to 
whether to put those riders in.  I have attached those riders so you can 
advise me.  The Agreement is housed in your directory minus the General Terms 
and Conditions.  When you are ready to send the Agreement then I can attach 
the GTC.

Thanks,
Genia
