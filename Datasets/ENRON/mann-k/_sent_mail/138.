Subject: Cingular Bill

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>
