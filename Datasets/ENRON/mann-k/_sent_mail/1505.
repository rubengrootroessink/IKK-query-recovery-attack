Maybe this is more like rugby.  I passing the ball to Carlos, who will get 
with you and Kathleen to figure out what's what.

That sounds great to me.  I love a good punt. When our team is kicking, well, 
it's a bonus.  I'll keep the ball rolling on the formation just to keep up 
momentum, 

but after that I'll stay on hold until otherwise directed.  I'll send the 
paperwork to Kathleen when it becomes available.
