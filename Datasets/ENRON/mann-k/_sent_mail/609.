Jerry,

Would you mind re-sending?  I can't find it on my system anywhere.  I did 
find the signature page sent 4/20.

Many thanks,

Kay

Yes, the draft that was forwarded to you on and dated April 23, 2001 is the
draft to be executed.  Note however, that the date of the letter will be

Hi Jerry,

Do we have a final, execution version of the letter agreement?

I understand that Enron's tax folks are ok with the suggested changes to
the LLC agreement.

We are working with GE to get the change orders executed.

Thanks,

Kay
