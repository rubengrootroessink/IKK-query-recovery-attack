Sure. 

The fix we want to make on the drug/alcohol policy is as follows:  instead of 
a reference to a specific numbered policy, the purchaser will provide ABB 
with a copy of their policy, and ABB will comply with it.

Peter--I saw the breakout contract for the CA project that you sent out.
Could you send me the current draft, in whatever shape it's in, for the
Fountain Valley ABB contract?  I need whatever you have first thing
tomorrow ( for dealing with NEPCo, our EPC contractor to arrive at a
final
EPC contract price, not for dealing with GE or E-Next Generation LLC).
Thanks.

Al Larsen
