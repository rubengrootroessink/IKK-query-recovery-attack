Lee  - I agree with your statement that LV needs the PSS.  But not with 
regards to Delta.  I do not know what Delta needs for siting their 
generation.  It is my understanding that generators in the WSCC need PSS's.  
I am trying to locate chapter and verse on that requirement.  It may be a 
size issue (ie - greater than "x" MWs of generator size). Don Hammond will 
help me locate the requirement in the morning, and I will get back to you.  
My concern was your e mails seemed to imply I said Delta doesn't need PSS. I 
want to stay silent on that issue.

In any regard, Nevada Power Co requires PSS, that is the reason we are 
obtaining them for all the generators at LVCII.

Steve,
I know that we specifically included the stabilizer in the Salmon deal.  
Please confirm that it belongs there so that we can finish up the break out 
contract.

Thanks,

Kay

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).
