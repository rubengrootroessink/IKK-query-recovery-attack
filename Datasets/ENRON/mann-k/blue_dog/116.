Kay:

Further to our call, attached please find a mark-up of the Escrow Agreement.
As I mentioned, Marguerite believes that the parties should sign the Escrow
Agreement without filling in the amount left blank in Section 1.  Let me
know what you think.

Regards,

Marisa

Given the fact that Section 4(a) of the Letter Agreement requires NorSub to
pay all fees associated with the Escrow Account and Section 4(b) requires
NorSub to fund the Escrow Account, Kathleen Carnahan of ENA suggested
revising Sections 1 and 6 of the Escrow Agreement, which make ENA and NorSub
jointly responsible for the payment of these monies.  Accordingly, I have
marked up the Escrow Agreement, but Chris Booth wanted me to confirm with
you whether you thought the changes were worth making.  If so, I will
forward the revised document to Chris so that he can get Citibank to signoff
on the new draft.

Also, do you have a moment to discuss the dollar amount that needs to be
included in Section 1?  Let me know, and I'll come up.

MIR
