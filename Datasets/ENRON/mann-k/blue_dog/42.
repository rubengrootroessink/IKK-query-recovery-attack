Chris, Tony, Jeff:

Here is the first, cut.  You can see that the Attachments need information.  
I will insert the GEI liquid fuel specification since it is a PDF file.  
Chris, Jeff gave you till Friday to provide the liquid fuel composition 
without impact to production.  Please provide soonest.

Tony: I already sent you the contract so you can see what Basis Conditions 
need to be added and what testing guidelines too.

Jeff:  What do you see is missing?
