Please advise how to respond to GE.  Kay has the change order for final

		 Subject: Blue Dog Max storage


Attached is a copy of the invoice that we issued for the storage of Unit #1.
This invoice has not been paid.  I believe you are waiting for the signing
of the contract change order.  Neither of us expected this process to take
this long.

As we have an agreement that the equipment will be stored, and we agree on
the price of the storage, I am requesting that this invoice be paid
immediately.
