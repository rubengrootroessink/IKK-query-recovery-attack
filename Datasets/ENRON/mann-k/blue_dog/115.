Marguerite:

Section 4(a) of the April 26th Letter Agreement provides that "NorSub will
pay directly to the Escrow Agrent all acceptance, setup, administration and
other fees associated with the Escrow Account and Escrow Agreement. "
Accordingly, I have revised the signature block to Citibank's original Fee
Letter to substitute NorthWestern Generation I, LLC for Enron North America
Corp.  A copy of the revised document is attached.  Please deliver an
executed copy of the Fee Letter along with the incumbency certificate and
the Form W-9.  Thanks.

Regards,

Marisa Reuter
