Please follow up with Kay on this once the dust settles on the Intergen 
LM6000 deal. Please also make sure these numbers are incorporated into 
Rebecca's transfer price model.

Thanks,

Mr. Jacoby,

I understand that you are the appropriate individual at ENA to review the GE 
Change Order and have it executed by ENA.  I believed that Ace was going to 
contact you regarding the Change Order, but I cannot confirm this.

Please review the Change Order #1 attached below.  You may then print it out 
and have it executed by ENA prior to my sending it to GE or I can bring you 
two (2) originals for signature.

Thanks

Renee, 

ENA is scheduled to buy the turbines from LJM this week.  LJM would like to 
wait and have ENA sign the change order on Friday after they own the 
turbines.  Let me know if this is a problem.

Ace,

That would be a big help.  I have two (2) originals already printed out that 
I could bring to you or if you just want to print two (2) originals out and 
have them signed that would be fine.  Please let me know what you prefer.

Renee

Renee and Cheryl,


LJM does need to sign approvals for modification over $500,000.  If this is 
the final document for the approval I can get it signed today and forward to 
Renee.  Let me know if that is what you would like me to do.

Ace, my things are packed up but I seem to remember Agent needs LJM approval 
for Change Orders over a certain dollar amount.  Can you confirm?

Please find a copy of the Change Order attached.  It has legal's approval, 
but I'm trying to figure out who can sign the Change Order.  Unforunately, 
due to the move, I cannot determine who executed the original Agreement.  By 
copy to Cheryl Costa, I'm requesting that she, if possible, check her copy of 
the Blue Dog contract and let me know who signed it and verify the ENA can 
sign for LJM2.

Thanks
Renee
