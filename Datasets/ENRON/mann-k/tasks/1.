Kay,

Since Carlos is out of pocket, could you please take a look out the attached CA for Constellation Power.  They are interested in the Calvert City, KY site.  (I am willing to pay you a bribe of a diet Coke!)

Thanks,

Chris

Carlos,

Attached is a draft of the CA for Constellation Power in connection with discussions on Calvert City.

Please review and advise if Chris can send an electronic copy to Constellation.
