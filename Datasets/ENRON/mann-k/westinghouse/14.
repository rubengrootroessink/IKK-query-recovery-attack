David, can you come up with the requested documentation, and if there is 
none, can you write an explanatory memo as to how this came down?

Jim:

Thanks for the reply. Sharron has focused on the comment that the unit has 
not actually been "delivered" to  Enron and that title, ownership, and 
custody are still with SWPC.   She is therefore questioning Enron's insurable 
interest.

I have commented to her that Enron can insure goods titled to another party 
as long as Enron has instructions to insure the goods.  Sharron does not 
dispute this, but has asked if there is any documentary evidence that would 
show that Enron had instructions to insure this cargo. I think we can 
interpret "instructions" liberally.  If there is a purchase order or similar 
agreement that states that Enron is to insure the turbine, that should be 
sufficient.  Would you please ask for this?

Thanks and regards,





Ted Rosen

No one has bothered to respond!  The questions below need to be answered BY
SOMEONE!  Underwriters are growing impatient, and if no response is
forthcoming, they will assume we have withdrawn the claim and close their
file.  Can SOMEONE please respond?

Gentlemen, if I've left out who this should be directed to, please forward
to whomever can provide the answers.

Is Enron Equipment Procurement Co. still pursuing a claim against Enron
cargo insurers?
comment - we probably need to discuss this with ena's ben jacoby so that
you can receive specific guidance.  as i understand it, since enron's
insurance (e.g., marine cargo) is primary, enron will pursue a claim
against the enron cargo insurer.
further comment - the answer remains "yes."  again, must discuss with ena's
ben jacoby because of his commercial involvement/expectations.

If so, I must provide proof of ownership of the damaged generator (other
than an e-mail message).  Please provide ASAP.
comment - what do you need?  while enron has made approx. 95% of the
payments for the gas turbine generator unit, it is likely that ownership
still resides with westinghouse - i.e., it was never delivered per the
equipment purchase contract with enron.  again, what type of documentation
do you need?  does it matter if westinghouse is still in the loop?
further comment - at this time, title, ownership, care, custody and control
remain with westinghouse.  further, westinghouse must continue to be in the
loop because the monies for the damaged might ultimately be paid to them -
i.e., westinghouse provides enron with a new replacement generator; then,
westinghouse receives the insurance money to cover their loss/damaged
generator.

Is the generator to be repaired?
comment - no, the generator is not to be repaired.  instead, a replacement
generator is being manufactured in austria for westinghouse and is to be
delivered to the port of houston in the mid-april01 timeframe.

If so, when and where.
comment - n/a.

Underwriters surveyor needs to examine it when it is taken apart.
comment - n/a.

The surveyor was told when he made an inspection at the Port that a
detailed repair estimate would be provided to him on the other unit that
was damaged, and this would provide a guide as to the type of damage on our
unit.
comment - only the generator was damaged.  the gas turbine is complete and
resides in houston.  i do not understand your comment about damage to
another unit
further comment - the "other unit" does not belong to enron - i.e., it
belongs to another westinghouse client.  plz understand that the "other
unit" was immersed deeper in salt water than our unit.  as a result, its
damage was greater.  in that we are getting a replacement generator, we
have to assume that the "other unit" that was also damaged is also being
replaced.  therefore, it can be inferred that the damage estimate for both
generators are approximately the same.

To date, nothing has been sent to our surveyor.
comment - none.
further comment - we are not sure about your statement.  our understanding
is that you previously both communicated with and sent the accident survey
of westinghouse's underwriter to our surveyor.

As it has been over three months since the unit arrived in Houston in its
damaged condition, if Enron expects to collect from Enron cargo insurers,
we must move forward in providing the information previously requested, or
prejudice Enron's claim to recovery due to lack of cooperation with the
adjuster/surveyor.
comment - noted.
