The person to contact, I believe, is Michael Hinds.  His number is 55869.  
However, Ace Roman, who sits on our floor and is a manager with the group, 
should help you coordinate, particularly with the LJM lawyers.  His number is 
39587.  Kirkland and Ellis out of DC does their legal work.  Amy Harvey, who 
I believe is an associate there, worked with us on the "E-Next Generation" 
deal.  Her number is 202-879-5053.

Thanks,

Rose

I'm trying to clean up after Blue Girl.  Can you tell me again who signs for 
LJM so that I can get signature?  Who does their legal work?  

Thanks,

Kay

With high hopes that this is the FINAL final version, I'm attaching what I 
believe to be the execution copy.  Some things have been cleaned up, and 
Brownsville has been added to paragraph 5.  I'm going to start collecting 
signatures.

Thanks,

Kay
