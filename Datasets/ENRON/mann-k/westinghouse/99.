If you have Bill's number handy I'll give him a call and visit about the extension.

I would prefer to extend the LOC to keep things on good terms but if they are unwilling, we should provide notice.

Stuart,

Do you want to extend the LOC or give notice under it?  Or give notice, then discuss extension?

Monahan has a call into me.  I am going to call him first thing tomorrow but I would suggest that you take the necessary steps to extend the LC.  I don't think that we could get anything finalized in the next day or so.

I am waiting to hear from Bill Monahan at Westinghouse regarding our ongoing issues relating to the Gleason stacks.  He has told me that he will call me either today or tomorrow with a possible settlement.  If you don't hear anything from me before the end of business on Friday (7/13) please call Westinghouse to extend the LC otherwise we need to send a notice of intention to draw on Monday.

Stuart
