Here's  the document sent to Milbank a few minutes ago.
?
I  looked you up in Martindale to get your email address -- all my friends at 
Enron  have so many different email addresses these days that I don't hazard 
a  guess!? Saw that you are also an ex-Sonat attorney -- I thought your name  
was familiar!
?
Hope  this helps.? We had to push back a bit on pre-approval of future  
assignments, but hopefully it's a workable compromise.? Thanks for your  
efforts -- they registered big/helped.
?
?
Let us  know if we can do anything further to get this closed for you.? I'll 
be in  the office in Houston the rest of the week.

Thanks, Laura -- this document was much easier to fast track. Here are  our 
edits -- the one area where we have to retain some control is future  
assignments.? It's GE's policy to look at assignments on a case by case  
basis, but the language provided should allow you some leniency in getting 
quick  approval for permitted assignments.
?
?
Lee  and Laura, I don't have the email addresses for Sheila and her team at 
Enron --  could one of you please forward this document to them?? Laura, let 
Lee and  I know if we can do anything else to help you close your  deal.
