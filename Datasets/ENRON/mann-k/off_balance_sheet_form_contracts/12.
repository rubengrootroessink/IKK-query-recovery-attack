Attached for your review and comment is Rev 2 of the Electrobolt EPC 
Contract, dated 11/28/00, revised pursuant to the discussions of Construction 
Agent and Contractor on Sunday 11/19 and Tuesday 11/21.  I have attached both 
a clean version (our document # 39444_6) and a redlined version (our document 
# 41227_1), marked to show all revisions since Rev 1, dated 11/20/00.

Please note that in the interest of time, this revision is being distributed 
simultaneously to Construction Agent and Contractor, and thus remains subject 
to all comments of Construction Agent.

Please forward your comments to me not later than noon on Friday, 12/1/00.  I 
will be bringing all comments to Sao Paulo for final negotiations with 
Contractor commencing Sunday, 12/3/00.

Regards,
Dave Gohlke
