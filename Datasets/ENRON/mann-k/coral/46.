Mike:

The retainage will be an obligation of the LLC. I can't imagine that this 
would be an issue from a credit perspective. Keep in mind that the LLC will 
have a put back to ABB for the transformers at the 30% level as per the 
master agreement.

Regards,

Ben

Ben,
At first pass I think that this will probably work as long as some one 
promises
to pay the retainage (10%).  I will have to of course have to get the 
agreement
of Frank and Dave.  I have sent this to both of them and should hear back form
them tomorrow, as should you.
I'll have my computer with me and will be in communication via e-mail.  If you
need me more urgently than that contact either Karla at the office or Kathryn 
at
the house.  You haave all the numbers.
MIKE

Mike:

After you review the Coral Acknowledgement Letter I sent earlier, it would
be really helpful if you would write me a letter on your letterhead saying
that your prepared to sign the letter when you sign the Facility Agreement.
Attached is some suggested language.

Thanks much,

Ben
