Subject: Re: Stack replacement Test  

Terri, Gentlemen:

The following is the paragraph I propose we use for the "Mature Testing" 
requirements (in blue).  It would fall under exhibit D, together with the 
other two categories of performance testing already discussed and agreed to 
with FCE (Acceptance Performance Testing and Warrantee Compliance Performance 
Testing).  As a third category of performance testing, the replacement stack 
testing will be subject to all of the requirements that have been set forth 
for the other performance testing...mainly the need for an agreed to 
procedure.

Please let me know if you have nay comments, or if we need to have more or 
less details in the paragraph.

Replacement Stack Testing:

Replacement Stack Performance Testing will be done following the replacement 
of one or both stacks on each unit.  The replacement stack performance 
testing shall be performed to asses the new stack performance level and to 
determine its contribution to the overall plant.  Replacement stack testing 
must include provisions to accurately determine stack performance and its 
contribution to the overall plant performance.  It includes detail evaluation 
of the DC to AC conversion performance in order to be able to express the new 
stack performance level in terms of plant net output and efficiency.


Regards,

Tony Butler
