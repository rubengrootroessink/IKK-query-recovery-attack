Here are FCE's proposed exhibits for Pricing and the Preliminary 
specifications:

1.  Should we ask FCE's attorney to conform the Exhibits to P.O. document.  
For example, the "Final Design" term at the bottom of each page should be 
"Final Specifications."  Defined terms should be the same (Purchaser, 
Seller...etc.).

2.  We should both read the revised P.O. in the context of these exhibits.

Terri,

 Another item that I need your sign off on (besides the LHV heat rate 
calculation at 48% efficiency) is the PrelimSpecExhibit B1 attached below.  
Please look over this file, paying special attention to the spec exhibits 
(towards the back) as ENA would like to include these as attachments to the 
Purchase Order that we plan on executing with FCE. Scott and I want to make 
sure that we aren't giving FCE any wiggle room with their numbers and that we 
get engineering sign off on the reasonableness of the data.  You can ignore 
the other file as it is not applicable to engineering.  Thanks and call if 
this is not clear.
