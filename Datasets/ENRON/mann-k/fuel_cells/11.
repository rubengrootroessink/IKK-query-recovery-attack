According to Heather, this legislation streamlines the approval process under 
the Connecticut Siting Act. I will give you a file with the full text of the 
Act and amendments. Mark Oland at Bingham is looking at this issue and is not 
sure that Heather's reading is correct.

> Council for new electric power plants will not apply to fuel cell power
