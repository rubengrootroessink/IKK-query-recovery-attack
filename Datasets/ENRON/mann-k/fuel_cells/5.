Because ENA is getting a full prepayment of the turn-key construction amount, 
I don't think that there will be a material balance sheet issue.  Worst case, 
it is easy to do off-balance sheet financing when you have cash equal to the 
total obligation.  Obviously, this will have to be vetted before the 
transaction is executed.
