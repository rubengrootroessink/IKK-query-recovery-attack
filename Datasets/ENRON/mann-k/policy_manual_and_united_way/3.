Kay, looks great to me.  I would prefer to leave the benchmark open and be able to talk the counterparty through how it will be established (due diligence on plants, higher target means greater sharing % for ENE).  As far as cancellation is concerned, I think that it would be a good idea to include a right of cancellation for NRG based on a percentage of the benchmark established.  Something to the effect that NRG will have the annual right to terminate the agreement if we cannot achieve __% of the annual gross margin target.

Thanks-
Bill

I've made some revisions the Bill's document to make sure we are on the same page before I prepare the LOI.  

 << File: NRG Term Sheet.doc >> 

Do we want to give any sort of description of how the benchmark will be set?
Do we want to mention the cancellation provisions?

Thanks,

Kay
