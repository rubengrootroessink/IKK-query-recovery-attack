Craig, as promised, attached is the draft LOI that we discussed yesterday.  We will send some hard copies via overnight mail as well.  I have been talking to Elaine to schedule June 13th, or your soonest available date, for a follow up meeting in Houston.  

We have recently implemented several similar services deals with municipals and industrials in other regions of the country.  This experience combined with Enron's strong trading presence in the Northeast will allow us to develop a proposal for NRG's sizeable Northeast generation portfolio that is mutually beneficial.

We'll look forward to meeting soon and moving things forward.  Thanks.

- Bill
