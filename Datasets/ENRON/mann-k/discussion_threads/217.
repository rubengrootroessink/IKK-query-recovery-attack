The legal person responsible for the ComEd LOI's is:

Carter Culver
Senior Counsel
Commonwealth Edison Company
phone: (312) 394-2754

e-mail: carter.c.culver@ucm.com

I will fax you my comments on the LOI's (Kendall New Century and Titan Land) 
this evening from my hotel (10 pm).  Please review the documents and 
incorporate our desired legal and commercial changes.  Call me on my cell 
tomorrow to discuss (713-412-4612).  If you wish to talk to Carter directly, 
give him a call or email him (see above).  We should be in a position to have 
these LOI's initialed by Wednesday at noon.

Thanks,
Fred
