Yes, we will be in one conference room, but if ENA will be calling in from 
several locations it would probably make sense.

Thanks, Becky

Becky:

We will plan to be available. Would you like us to arrange for a call in
number (the Enron folks participating will be in several locations)? Please
let me know.

Thanks,

Ben
