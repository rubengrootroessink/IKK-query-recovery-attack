Can you tell me the attorney's initials on it and I will look in their 
directory.  We can't really use it as a word file from Livelink.

Yes, however, I could use an electronic version if one is readily available 
(I have the PDF).

Thanks,

I have a tolling arrangement to work on. I'm trying to get my hands on the 
Black Hills tolling agreement.  Can someone point me in the right direction 
to find it?


Thanks,

Kay
