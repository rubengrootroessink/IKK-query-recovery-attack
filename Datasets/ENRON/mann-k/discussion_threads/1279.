Kay -

We are selling both the Wheatland and Gleason facilities, so along with the 
agreement below, I've attached a letter that we could show potential 
purchasers.  Thoughts?

Time is critical, since we are right now in negotiations with purchasers, so 
please let me know if I need to forward on to someone else.


Thanks,

Mitch

I've reached a verbal agreement with Westinghouse on the LD issues.  I've 
attached a letter outlining the agreement.  Could you review from a legal 
standpoint?  Call me with questions.

Thanks,

Mitch
