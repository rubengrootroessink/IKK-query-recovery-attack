Attached is the latest draft of the MEH Risk Management Policy.  It has been 
prepared in conjunction with and reviewed by Peoples' Risk Management 
department.  Judy Pokorny will be presenting the salient points of the Policy 
to Peoples' Risk Management Committee this week for their consideration and 
approval.  Subject to any feedback from the Peoples' Risk Management 
Committee, the Policy is near final approval.  Therefore, if there are any 
comments or questions, please direct them to either me or Judy, as 
appropriate.  

Thanks,

Gregg
