plz see attached file (plan forward rev1.doc).  

plz consider this file and its contents to be a "work in progress."  this 
will be our working tool for meeting this thurs at 9 a.m.

it includes:
 - action item list (referred to as plan forward).
 - per my notes, what enron is prepared to do in this deal.  note - mark 
bernstein to provide more detailed listing.
 - per my notes, what enron is not prepared to do.  (same note as above).
 - listing of "scope" taken from my notes and file reading.  plz consider as 
draft.  we have to agree on "baseline" before we can price.

looking forward to seeing you there.

(for ray danner - let's discuss your note re: benchmark vs. detailed estimate 
and info requirements during planned meeting.  i agree with your concerns).

regards.  scott.
