You are very welcome.  Don't forget about your statement for your phone bill 
so we can get that submitted too.  I don't like you paying these bills with 
your own money.  I don't know why it bothers me, but it does (per Daphne on 
Frasier).

I've got your bar dues in the mail and have tracking numbers.  You are set.
