See the attached.  The original  contract called for net electrical
output
so we have to live with net.  The attached table outlines the net output
for gurantees and specific gurantees.  We now have to measure their aux
consumption to insure we are not cheated.

Ed Dannhaus asked me to recall a conversation held with Lee Johnson a
few
days ago in which Lee relayed calculations that he had prepared for Ed.
I
had not acted on the information, assuming it would be relayed to me
through Ed.  Evidently, Lee did not get back to Ed, so I have attached a
summary of my notes.  In preparing this note, I have reviewed the
content
and the Procurement Agreement terms and provide comments to Lee's info.
with required adjustments.  The values and adjustments to be  used in
the
agreement are in bold font.    See attached.

I must also note that the Basis Conditions included in the last draft
included a note that new and clean conditions exist for up to 200 fired
hours.  Section 10.12.4 orf the agreement states 300 hours.  The Basis
Conditions should reference 300 hours.
