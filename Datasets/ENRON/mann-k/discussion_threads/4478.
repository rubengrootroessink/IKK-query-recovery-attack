Kay -- No problem.  I'm with you totally on this.  Reagan did send the letter 
to Marvin.  David and Marvin are meeting at 4:30 to discuss it.  Marvin has 
not heard from Bob Priest yet, but he and Reagan are both trying to follow up 
with Bob this afternoon.  We should hear from Marvin first thing in the 
morning if not late this afternoon.  Thanks -- David

I'm thinking my last email was unclear.  

I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the 
extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their 
review.  I assume that the  commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale 
will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think 
it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two 
lawyers I know about.
