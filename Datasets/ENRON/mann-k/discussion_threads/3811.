 <<Blackline of Article XXI of the LV Cogen Agreement for Override
Letter.DOC>>
 Pursuant to our earlier conversation, I have made all of the
changes we discussed to the Lv Cogen Turbine Agreement and  override
letter.  You had asked that I revise Article XXI in the override letter
so that the confidentiality and proprietary provisions would apply to
ENA as agent.  To do so I have had to make revisions throughout the
Article and, as a result, intend to include it as an annex to the
override letter.  What I have done is to make any reference to "party"
or "parties" (other than references to "third party") be deemed to
include a reference to "Agent".  You will be able to see my other
changes to Article XXI in the attached blackline.  They are just
conforming changes.  Let me know what you think.
