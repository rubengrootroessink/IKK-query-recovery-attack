Dave Gorte had asked me to assist you with the approval on the proposed $50MM 
revolver to MEH.  Attached is a slightly resived DASH, based on the 
information provided by you this morning.

As you can see, the DASH has some bracketted portion that needs 
clarification.  Please review and revise to the extent you can, and call me 
at 3-5302 with any questions or concerns. 

Thanks.
