Subject: Site Bank Report for Louise Kitchen

FYI, Ben Jacoby is going to begin submitting a periodic site status report to 
Louise Kitchen.  Attached is the original summary that was sent to Louise on 
April 23rd.  This is the template that she would like us to use for all 
subsequent reports.

I will work with accounting to update the cost basis for each site.  Will 
each of you please read through the "status" column for the sites for which 
you are responsible and let me know what updates need to be made?



Thanks,
Rebecca
