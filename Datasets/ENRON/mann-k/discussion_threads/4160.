Ann Elizabeth,

Lisa Bills has requested some additional changes to the "form" of Option 
Agreement I sent you yesterday.  If you will e-mail the form of Option 
Agreement for the new Florida Option to Kay Mann, she will make the necessary 
changes.  Also Ben Jacoby has indicated that  wants to see all new Option 
Agreements prior to them being sent out to anyone so he can be in the loop.

Sorry you missed our meeting.

Kathleen

Ann Elizabeth,

This may not be the absolute latest Form of Option, but it should be pretty 
darn close to being totally blessed (by Herman Manis).  I am also attaching a 
form of Memorandum of Option just in case you need it.

Kathleen
