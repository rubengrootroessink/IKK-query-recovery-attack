For Salmon Energy, GE and Enron, please send the documents to me and I'll get 
them to the correct legal counsel.  For Wilmington Trust, please send to the 
address below for notarization (I guess you can also send him executed 
documents and he can forward to his counsel):

Jose Mercado
Wilmington Trust Company
Rodney Square North
1100 North Market Street
Wilmington, DE 19890
Phone: 302-651-8631

Thanks,

Catherine, 
I am helping Karl put together execution documents for the various parties.  
My question to you is who should the Assignment and Assumtion Agreement and 
the Bill of Sale go to at Salmon Energy LLC, GE Packaged Power and Wilmington 
Trust Company?  I will send you the originals for Enron and E-Next.  
In addition, the signature for E-Next by WTC was not notarized on the Bill of 
Sale.  I will send it back to them for notarization, but will need to know 
who to send it to.  Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.
Best regards,
