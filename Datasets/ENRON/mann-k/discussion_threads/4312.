Marguerite:

I have reviewed Citibank's mark-up and have only one comment.  Section 6(a)
changes the per annum escrow fee from $3,000 to $83,000, which is a
typographical error since the fee schedule sets the per annum fee at $8,000.
All other changes relate to form not substance.  Do you agree?  Please
confirm.  I will rely on you to address Citibank's question on page 11
regarding the organizational structure of NorthWestern Generation I, LLC.

As you know, NorthWestern will need to deliver a Form W-9 and a completed
incumbency certificate.  At your earliest convenience, please update me on
the status of these documents.  Pursuant to the terms of the Letter
Agreement, the escrow account needs to be set up before this weekend, so we
will need to coordinate efforts as quickly as possible.

Regards,

Marisa
