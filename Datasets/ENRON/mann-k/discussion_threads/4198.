Subject: Form of Memorandum of Option

Attached is a copy of our proposed Memorandum of Option that we would like to 
use for our land options.  The Memorandum of Option will be recorded in the 
real property records in the county and state where the property is situated, 
and may need to be modified (as to form only) to comply with each state's 
particular recording requirements.

Please let us know of your comments.

Thank you.

Kathleen
