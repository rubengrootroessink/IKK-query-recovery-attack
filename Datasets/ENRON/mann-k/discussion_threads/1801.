Rebecca,

John Ayres and I met today.  He wishes to add the interconnect piping
between the chiller and cooling tower options in Exhibit N-2 for the ESA
Electrobolt Project.  This adds a total of $ 266,400 to the Jan 15, 2001
payment (equal to $ 33,280 per unit).  There will be no effect on the
12/27/00 payment amount.  I've edited your spread sheet to show this.

John Ayres asked if he could have a stripped down version of the Spread
sheet showing only the ESA amounts.

Kay, You'll notice that the Cooling Tower Option is Exhibit N-2 was changed
to add this interconnect piping to the scope.

I hope this helps.

Regards,

Lee
