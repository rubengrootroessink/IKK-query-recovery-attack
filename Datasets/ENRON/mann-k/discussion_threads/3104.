Attached is a VERY PRELIMINARY draft of the EPC Term Sheet for review and 
comment.  It has a lot of hole's, and needs to be read in that light.  I will 
give it more time and attention after input from the project team.

If the Term Sheet is intended to go to third party EPC contractors, I would 
strongly suggest that we do no use it.  We would be much better off using the 
draft of the Turbo Park EPC Contract as modified for Fountain Valley.
