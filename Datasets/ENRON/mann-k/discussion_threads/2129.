Kay:

As you know, I just love to pile on. I took what I think are the latest form 
docs and made some changes to incorporate additional commercial terms I want 
to go out with. Please review the attached clean and redline drafts. In the 
interest of time, would it be OK for Caroline to review (I've really got 
people chomping at the bit).

Thanks,

Ben
