Thanks.

Many of the changes to Brian's CO don't apply to CO 1.  I've made the 
relevant changes to revision 5 attached below for your review.  If it's 
acceptable, please let me know who will sign the CO for ENA so that I may 
bring hard copies to that person for signature.  I believe it is Ben Jacoby, 
but this Change Order has been floating around different people in ENA since 
November, so I want to make sure I get it to the right person.

Thanks

Hi there,

I've made some suggested changes on the CO you sent.  In the interest of time 
I'm sending this to David Marshall, since this largely deals with ROL and 
insurance, and I couldn't tell if he has read this previously.

Thanks,

Kay
