Kay:

I do not have originals of these documents and in fact was able to obtain
copies of these documents only from Freshfields.  I recall that that
Freshfields coordinated directly with GE to obtain these documents.   Do you
happen to have the originals?  If not, how do you feel about asking GE for
the originals?

Also, per my earlier voice mail, we still need copies of the following
documents to complete our closing volume for ENA:

Confidentiality Agreement
Notice of Intent to Purchase Specified Option Property
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
Bill of Sale

If you prefer, we could prepare the closing volume omitting these documents
altogether, or alternatively, listing (but not including copies) of these
documents.  Please advise of your preference.

Finally, can you please furnish the Notice of Intent to Purchase, Assignment
and Assumption Agreement and Bill of Sale for the CA Energy Development
transactions in order that I can forward these to George Kutzschback per his
request.  Thanks.

We are close to completing our closing sets but do not have originals of the
GE Guarantee, legal opinion or acknowledgement of receipt of funds.  We
appreciate that it is logistically difficult to have GE re-execute
documentation, but as the legal opinion and the receipt of funds are both
addressed to the lenders, we ought really to have originals of these two
documents.
Could you please let me know where the originals of these documents were
sent and whether it would be possible to have them re-directed to us or to
have the documents re-executed?
Thank you in advance
Isabel
