Costs (xi) Add "SPP or" Serc-imposed..
  I don't think there are SERC protocols or a SERC ISO
"Confidential Information" is in Section 23, not 25.  I was looking at this 
because both MDEA andEPMI stated in the FERC filing re: the Entergy/MDEA int. 
agree, that there was an Energy Management agreement between us.

Ex. 3   Make sure that there are "SPP Protocols" and that there is something 
called a "Scheduling Entity" (If so, then may want to add a definition of 
"SPP Protocols" in the definitions.)

Please review and comment.  These were sent to MDEA wqith the understanding 
that Enron is still working on them.

Thanks,
