25 years ago for me (Shayne is 25 today).  Time files.  She was babysitting 
yesterday and had to take the little girl (3 years old) to the emergency room 
because she stepped on some glass.  Apparently is was not a real big deal, 
but I think it was her first ordeal of the kind.

Re: sleeping on backs, I still don't understand that one.  I always thought 
they were to sleep on their stomachs to avoid choaking if they threw up.

Did you do anything fun this weekend?  We just puttered around the house and 
I worked on PRC's yesterday. Next weekend the kayaks are coming out come hell 
or high water!

This stuff is so much better than it was 20 years ago.  It is amazing how 
things have changed.  

Did you know that they now tell you to have  babies sleep on their backs?  
That is totally different from when Paige was a baby.  It was hard to get 
used to.

That would be wonderful!  I was looking at those online this weekend.  I used 
play pens all of the time for my children.

Thanks very much.

I have a pretty cool portable play pen you can have if you want.
