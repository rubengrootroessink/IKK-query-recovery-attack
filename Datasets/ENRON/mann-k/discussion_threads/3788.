Ben and Stuart,

Attached is Amendment #2 to the SPA reflecting the business terms Ben and I 
discussed this afternoon.  As you will see this structure (with the 
promissory note) is different from the structure described by Steve Hase in 
the attached email.  Please let me know if the deal has evolved since our 
latest discussions.  Please note that this is being sent to ENA only.  Please 
call me with your comments at your earliest convenience.  Best regards.

Audrey,

Ben and I have reached an agreement which will be documented as follows:

1)  Extension of Dates -- May  11 becomes May 9 (Wed)

2)  Ben will edit the latest version of the Amendment #2 so that

a) on Aug 1, we pay the greater of the $1.5MM ($2.5 less $1 paid at
exercise) and the Additional Compensation (less the $1 MM)

b)  a separate agreement whereby Corp guarantees the payment on Aug 1.

The intention is to sign the Amendment #3 before 5/9.

Thanks everyone for making this happen.

Steve Hase
