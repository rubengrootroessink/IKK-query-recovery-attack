Avoid confusion?? What in the world does that mean? 

And along those lines, as I was archiving files last night in preparation for 
the move to the Enron building, I can across the resumes that you two sent to 
me when you applied for a job here.  After giving the matter due 
consideration, I have decided not to hire either of you.

Hi there.

I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing 
the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to 
Tax and Insurance. 

I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.  We are getting so 
close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.  

I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the 
current list of issues under consideration.  I suggest we work through this 
list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's 
comments.  We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to 
review it at that time.


Kay
