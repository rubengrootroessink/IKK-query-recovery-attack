I attach for your review a Word copy of the Agency Agreement, revised in 
light of the comments we discussed last week.  The changes from the version 
emailed to you a while back can be viewed and printed by turning on the Track 
Changes feature in your Tools menu.

I look forward to discussing this with you at your convenience.  DT
