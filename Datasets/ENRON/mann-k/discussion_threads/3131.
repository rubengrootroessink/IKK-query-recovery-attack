Kay,

I have an outline attached.....a bit of a road map with a few thoughts.  I am 
also sending up the markup I have completed so far.  See what you think.  
Fairley and Ozzie are out of pocket today so we won't get any comments from 
them today.

I need to give Marvin and company an idea of when we will be able to get them 
something.  Wehn do you think we will be ready to give them our first draft??

Thank you--


Reagan

I don't really like the organization of it much.  I think things need to be 
moved around and re-organized.

Kay,

I have gone through the first 37 pgs and landed on the Energy Mgmt Svcs Agmt 
when it occured to me that I really could use an education on the contract 
structure.  So I am backing up to outline the doc(s) to see how everything 
fits.  Call me when you get a few minutes...I need a lesson.

Thanks,

Reagan

Well, don't get too excited until you read it.  There's lots of stuff I just 
had to put place holders on, but we'll get it all filled in.

Kay

Here's a starting point.  I've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like 
this [ ], but I'm sure there are more questions than [ ]s.  I'm really 
unclear on the financial aspect of the deal.  

 << File: MDEA ESMA (Mann4-3 Draft).doc >> 

Reagan, I didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in, as I thought it was 
better to get the doc in your hands (and Mr. Fairley's) for a detailed review.

Kay
