GE has graciously  extended our option period and is attempting to 
accellerate our back-fill delivery.  The game is still on.... Panda 
included.  Their red-lines are attached below.  I haven't read the 
"documentation", but I suspect Panda/AEP has been busy all this time 
recrafting a completely new structure.

Lori:  Attached you will find a Draft Purchase & Sale Agreement under which
a synthetic financing entity would acquire from E-Next an LLC which has as
its sole asset the right to a GE Turbine.  This structure is desirable to
us since it makes a cleaner break and we believe it is permitted by the PO.
We have also confirmed with our financing entity that it is a structure
which is acceptable to them in concept.  We would like to confirm with GE
that this would be acceptable to them and you will also find a form of
letter attached which would serve as GE's confirmation of that fact.  By a
separate e-mail, in the very near future, I am intending to provide a
diagram which shows all steps of the deal structure (in word processing
now.

Please call with any comments or questions.(See attached file: Turbine
Acquisition Documentation.DOC)(See attached file: GE Letter.doc)
