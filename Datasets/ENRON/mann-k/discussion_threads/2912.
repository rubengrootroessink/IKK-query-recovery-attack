Federal jurisdiction and limit of liability verbage.  That's what comes to 
mind at this point.

Could you email me the most current version (I think it was March 3)?  

Thanks,

Kay

You were reading my mind.  What is the list of things he owes us?  David F.

Thank you,

Reagan,

I haven't received an email from David Hunt yet.  I will make the changes you 
and I discussed last week, and perhaps we will get David's changes sometime

Kay
