This is the most recent draft of the exhibits.

The following items need to be added to complete the exhibits:

1. Exhibits B-1 and H-2 need to be added.

2. If one is warranted, a Seller Parent Guarantee should be
included as Exhibit C-1.

3. Does Exhibit F need to be updated and revised before signing?

4. In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5. For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all
