Subject: Revision No.1 for ENA Fuelcell Estimate dated 10/26/2000

Mike, 

Attached are the revised (Revision 1) BOP Estimates for the Wallingford Fuel 
Cells Power Project (10 cells - 21.2 MW) and the Midcon (Hartford) Fuel Cells 
Power Project (12 cells - 28.8 MW) in the amount of $9.5MM and $9.6 MM 
respectively. These estimates reflect our discussions today with the 
following comments provided:

 1. I have lowered the Contingency to 10% from 15% per the direction from 
Mike Coleman. Estimating does not agree with this reduced contingency and I  
feel it is inadequate for the level of detail provided.  

 2. Because of this reduction in contingency, I have re-evaluated the 
concrete account and moved the Slab on Grade from the FCE Scope to the EE&CC  
Scope of Work. I have also revised the foundations for FCE based on the 
quantities they provided. 

 3. We are using $10,000 per cell for Grounding Grid based on reviewing 
additional estimating data. (The earlier number of $75,000 for the first two 
(2) cells  and $25,000 for each additional cell was provided as an estimate 
from FCE.  We agree it is too high.

 4. Based on our discussions, we are using $450,000 per project for 
Engineering Services.

A Basis of Estimate is also provided.  

Please call if you have questions or if you want to have additional meetings.

Ray Danner
