Mary,

I've attached the latest draft, which has not yet been sent to the other 
side, and which includes a provision not yet agreed by ESA or negotiated with 
EECC (Clause 1(c)).  The schedule 1, which you care about, should reflect the 
changes you and I discussed with Jeff last week.  SInce this draft is not an 
agreed one, will you delete it after you review it, and if you are not ok 
with all the changes, let me know so I can include them when we finalize this 
tomorrow (Wed).  I will include you on the final negotiated draft tomorrow 
when I (or Glauco) send it out for final approval.

Dave

Dave -

Do we have the latest draft with the changes I submitted for Appendix 1?
Can you please send it to me.  Thanks.

Mary

ESA and EECC teams,

This email is in response to John Rigby's fax of 28 Sep with comments to
the Preliminary Engineering Release Agreement.

I am OK with all of John and Scott's proposed changes except the rider to
replace paragraph 1(c), which deals with who has the risk/gatekeeper role
on deciding whether an activity is "hard cost" or not.  While I would
prefer to keep a "Contractor shall not perform any "hard cost" activity"
-type prohibition in the contract, I understand that since financing is
really an Owner issue, and Owner wants off-balance sheet financing, making
sure no "hard cost" activity is performed is really an Owner issue.  Thus,
I have taken their basic language/concept and modified it somewhat.

I have marked up EECC's proposed rider and attached the marked copy for
your review.  If acceptable to the owner team, I will forward it to EECC
for their review/approval.  Once we have agreement on this language, the
Preliminary Eng Release Agmt should be done and ready for John Novak's
review and approval and subsequent execution by ESA and EECC.
