Per our discussion yesterday, attached is a copy of the Indemnity and LOL 
contract language redlined to reflect those GE comments which we could 
probably accept.  Kay please review and see if I missed anything or whether 
we need to discuss further.  Otherwise, please forward this markup to Rob 
Taylor for inclusion in the next draft of the Purchase Agreement.

Regards,

Scott
