OK, I see your point.  Incremental may be misleading. How about this??

=01&Market Price=018 is the price agreed to in any transaction inclusive of=
 all=20
costs specific to the same transaction.



 Incremental to me means an increased cost.  I'm not sure what the cost is=
=20
"incremental" of.  I'm just trying to figure out if "incremental" is=20
descriptive, or just an extra word the engineers (sorry) threw in.

Incremental costs, for example, would be transmission and losses associated=

Market Price is $44.50.

What is an incremental cost?  I'm not sure I get it.

Kay-

Discussions with RW Beck have resulted in the following changes:

From the EMSA:
=01&Market Price=018 is the price agreed to in any transaction inclusive of=
=20
incremental costs specific to the same transaction.

From the Profit Calculation Exhibit:
"Profit per hour is calculated as the product of MWh sold and the differenc=
e=20
between Market Price and the Target Production Cost as follows:...."  (dele=
te=20
the reference limiting Profit to Back-to-back Transactions)
