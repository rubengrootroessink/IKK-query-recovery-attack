Kay:

Attached are my changes to the Pompano Agreement. I reviewed the last version 
dated 4-19 which was approved internally (copy also attached), and made 
changes back to that draft where I felt appropriate.

The only section I did not add back in was the termination section. From a 
commercial perspective, I think we're better off leaving it out as we then 
have in effect a free option on the site (as a developers agreement is 
required to obtain building permits). 

Please let me know what you think.

Regards,

Ben
