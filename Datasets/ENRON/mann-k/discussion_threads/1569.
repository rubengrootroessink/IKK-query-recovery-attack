I have made changes for "97-10" compliance to the last draft I have of 
Karen's redline.   The gist of the changes is that the Owner is a beneficiary 
under the contract, but has minimal obligations thereunder.   The 
Construction Manager has most of the obligations, but cannot provide the 
indemnification EECC is used to seeing from their counterparty.  

Lisa - there may be spots where you do or do not want the Owner mentioned - I 
tried to limit it to when the Owner was a beneficiary, but that may strain 
some of the legal relationships - we may need to change a few of the 
references.   Accounting may have some objections to the way some things are 
phrased also.

I think we can get there with EECC, but it will take some work.  John is 
getting back to me as to his availability for a meeting Tues. or Wed.

Rose
