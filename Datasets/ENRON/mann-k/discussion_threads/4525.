Hi Kay! Happy Thursday! Have yall managed to go see a movie yet?? I don't
even know what movies are out that would be good to see. I've heard mixed
reviews on Pearl Harbor.

Well, I think that Katie and I will stick around Austin this weekend. We
really appreciate the ticket offer and PLEASE if you ever need to pass them
off again, let us know. Since I wrote you last I found out that there is a
meeting Sunday morning for the parents and kids who are going to the church
camp that Katie is going to in a couple of weeks. It's one of those days
where Bobby needs to take Annie to her camp and I need to go to this meeting
with Katie. It's with a friend's youth group, so I feel like I should go.

I think Bobby will be okay on Sunday, his sister is okay and (thankfully)
his dad has gone out of town. I'm hoping the day will pass sort of
unnoticed.

Thanks again for the ticket offer. I'm really sorry we can't take you up on
it.

Tell your family hello.

Love you!

Lisa
