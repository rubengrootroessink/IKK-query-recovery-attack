Election was $2400. Paid to date is $784 and I have an additional $712 to
submit. Hopefully they will pay even though the insurance declined to cover
it. So, that leaves a balance of $904 and we will owe Sharon $200 or so by
the end of this month. Depending on what happens after that we might have
another $250 or so from Sharon by the last of December. Best guess, $500 or
so we need to cover somewhere.

Does that take into account that more money may be going into the spending
account?  I think we have a total of $2500 allocated for the year.  My
records indicate that I've put in $1900 as of my last paycheck.

Love,

Kay

I just received the EOBs back on Sharon Seals. They will not pay. If the
reimbusement account pays it will leave about $900.00 in the account. I
will
try to get the form completed tonight and in the mail tomorrow.
