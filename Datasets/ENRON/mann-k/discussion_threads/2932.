Kay,

Item 4 - of the Beck comments

The "must run" condition is when Entergy calls up and declares an emergency=
,=20
Clarksdale has to generate or they have no power.

In a previous version of the LOI David and I had the following language:

Profit from external sales of The Cities=01, power and gas resources and sa=
vings=20
realized by purchase of on-peak market power would be split 60% to The Citi=
es=20
and 40% to EPMI except under first contingency 32 MW =01&must run=018 condi=
tions.=20
If not already running, =01&must run=018 periods will be excluded from the =
profit=20
loss calculation. =20

Something like this could go und the Structure section as item D following=
=20
the "EPMI would be compensated..." sentence which should be item C.
