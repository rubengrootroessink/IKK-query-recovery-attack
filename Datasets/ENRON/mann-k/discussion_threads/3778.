Ben and Kay

Project is Eletrobolt.   ESA has had GE send the stacks for the Electrobolt 
LM6000 back to Braden for modifications necessary for Eletrobolt and there 
are a couple other changes.

I need to prepare an amendment cover those changes as well a capture the in 
and out costs related to the Eletrobolt units.  Matt T told me that Ben 
signed out a letter prepared by Kay addressing an agreement related to 
storage of the units that was different from the 24 pack base contract.  Matt 
says he does not have the letter.   

I would be very helpful if I could have a copy of the letter so I understand 
the changes so I do not upset the prior deal. Once I have the amendment 
prepared in addition to the Eletrobolt team review, I would like to bounce 
off Ben and Kay to ensure I have not harm to other aspects of the 24 pack 
purchase.


Thanks
