I have reviewed the Transformer and Turbine Letter Agreements I received 
today.

Transformer Letter

2(a) & 3(e):  why is there usage of "ABB et al." when ABB is defined?  Also, 
the "certain agreement" referred to in both sections is NOT between ENA and 
ABB.  It's now between E-Next Generation LLC as purchaser, ENA as agent for 
purchaser, and ABB, as amended.

3(a):  have two sets of "(i), (ii)" in para.  It's also unclear what this 
para actually says.

4:  definition of "Term" should go after (b) no?


Turbine Letter

3(a):  Para is clearer than in Transformer but still difficult to understand.

3(f):  Don't understand this para. and what happens with the final payment 
due to GE.

3(g):  the "certain agreement" is not between GE and ENA.  See first comment 
under Transformer Letter.  There is also the usage of "et al." after GE.

4:  same comment as in Transformer Letter.

I haven't had a chance to review the LLC Agreement yet.
