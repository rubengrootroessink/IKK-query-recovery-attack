There are no riders.  Elizabeth or Janice may be able to help you with muni 
language.  I will ask Sharen on Monday (confirm queen) if she is aware of any 
muni language that she has used in the past.

Many thanks.  Pardon my ignorance, but is there a list of riders to select 
from? The transaction that we are contemplating is with a municipality, so we 
need some muny language if such thing exists.

Thanks,

Kay
