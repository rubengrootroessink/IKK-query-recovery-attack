Mr. Priest's office had notified me this morning that the second and third 
attachments below were diffcult to open.  I am resending them as the 
attachments immediately below.  If anyone has further problems, please be 
aware that the second and third attachments are the standardized  text 
portions of the EEI Master Agreement, without any modifications by Enron, and 
are available at the following  website: http://www.eei.org/   You must go to 
"Energy Issues/News" to get to the menu with the "Standard Contract".
