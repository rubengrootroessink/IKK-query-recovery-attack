Both Herman and Lisa are out of the office - Herman will be gone for at least 
a week, Lisa will be back in on Monday.  I can do a prelim  review tomorrow, 
but am traveling next week also. When do you need comments from the group?

Hello.

The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for 
review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have 
attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any 
desired changes.

Thank you,

Kay
