Kay:

Here is the information required for the Bill of Sale exhibit.   Let me know 
if any additional information is needed and I will coordinate with Chris 
Booth and Rebecca Walker.  I will draft an exhibit with this information in a 
Word document as the formal attachment.  

Does the Bill of Sale document require 2 separate exhibits (similar to the 
notice of option exhibits) or can all the information be shown on one 
exhibit?  Let me know.

Fred
