Not sure this has been resolved, but I never heard back from Marty Pasqualini 
( of course, he was leaving Bingham Friday for good so not likely he made 
this a priority).

bart - now i know why i'm not familiar with these guys.  eosc hasn't done 
anything for offshore facilities for many years.  my lads take care of all 
eosc business currently and for the last several years but this involves 
prior (ancient) regimes.   it makes sense for me to talk to Marty but i'm 
also trying to run down the best person to speak for the offshore plants....i 
still don't see this as a problem...

We have received a request from Marty Pasqualini at Bingham Dana on behalf of 
one of his partners to waive a conflict involving the Enron Operations 
Services Corp. and the partner's client, TUV Management Services, relating to 
Bingham's proposed review on behalf of TUV of a form contract between Enron 
Operations and TUV. TUV provides monitoring , audit and other services 
related to certifications required to be made to governmental authorities. 
The subject contract relates to an ISO 9000 certification for a variety of 
Enron offshore power plants. Who is the Enron lawyer who would be familiar 
with Enron Operations Services Corp. and to whom I could direct Marty ?
