Kay,

What do you think?  Are we prohibited from doing this?

		 Subject: Austin - LM6000 Scope of supply

This past Wednesday during our weekly site visit, I explained to Austin 
Energy that I could not give them the whole LM6000 contract for 
confidentiality reasons, especially with respect to the commercial 
sections.   They were okay with that, but did make one last (and polite) 
request for a list of the scope items that they would be getting.  What I 
would propose to send is Exhibit B and B-1 from the contract (see attached).  
Exhibit B is a simple bulleted scope of supply list.  Exhibit B-1 is a simple 
spec that we wrote for the turbine which is itself a glorified scope document.

Let me know if this is something that I can forward to Austin Energy.  If the 
attached document still gives someone heartburn, I'll end it here and 
politely decline with Austin Energy.

Thanks,
Eric
