Let me know if there is anything else I need to do to the breakout
agreements.

Subject: GE and ABB B/O contract: Assignment and Assumption Agreement


I heard back from ABB this morning.  Karla Hesketh (ABB) is checking to
see
if any comments came in on the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.  We
should have the GE ready to go if , according to Dale, Rose and Lisa's
Global Finance comments are in.  Lee Johnson has said he is ready to go
to
the office and sign for GE.

In the realm of a checklist that I am tracking for Jim Gilbert on the
EPC
contract owner required information being ready to go, these 2 documents
(E-Next B/O Contracts for LVCII on both ABB and GE; same for the
Assignment
and Assumption Agreements) are the keys to meeting our obligations.  All
other requirements are in place and on hold pending the trigger being
pulled on the tolling agreement and subsequent dash approval.

I am trying to coordinate for Dale as he is still in Denver, under sleep
deprivation.  Let me know how  I can help.

Regards

Bill W.
