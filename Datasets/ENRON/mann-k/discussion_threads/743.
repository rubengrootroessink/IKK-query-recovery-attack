Scott,

I have attached a document that encompasses items that power systems included 
in there estimate, items that are not in their estimate and some parts that 
need to be clarified.



Below is my itravel arrangements for next week.

We fly into LaGuardia then  drive to Torrington that evening.

Hope all this helps.

Terri
