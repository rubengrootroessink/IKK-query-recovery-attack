I spoke to Don Shindler about your comments.  We will hold the contract and
any discussions with the Seller's attorney pending your approval following
discussions with your Accounting Department.  As per Rusty's email, we will
provide for a 12 month post-expiration/termination extended triggering
period.  As to the specific performance issue, we have agreed to this in the
past after the exercise of the option in the event the ENA entity was in
default of its obligation to acquire the property.  The alternative seems to
be to provide for some additional payment as liquidated damages for a
failure to close over and above the option consideration.  Re:  the zoning
issue.  Fred:  if there is any thought to using the Fehr property as a
laydown construction site or other use, we will need to address this issue.
Let's discuss.  Please let us know how you would like us to handle this.  To
discuss, please call me or Don.  Thanks.
