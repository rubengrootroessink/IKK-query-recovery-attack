> Attached please find a preliminary draft of the Incumbency Certificate
> that Citibank requires.  You will need to include the appropriate names,
> titles and contact information on the Certificate.  According to Carolyn
> Campbell, Andrea Mahar is the contact person at Citibank.  Andrea's number
> is 212-657-1007, and she will likely ask regarding the
> nature/timing/amounts of the disbursements.  In past deals, Citibank has
> provided us with a fee schedule and a list of money market investment
> options.  You might ask Andrea if she will forward that information to
> you.  According to Carolyn, Andrea might refer you to a woman named
> Estelle Lawrence at 212-657-2076, but the initial contact needs to be with
> Andrea.
>
Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.
