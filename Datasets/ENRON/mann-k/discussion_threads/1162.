FYI - Attached is a memo I prepared for Dave Wear.  Dave was going to edit 
the memo and send it to Simon Halfin as a summary of our discussions on the 
Hub Agency Agreement.  I am not sure what the final form was, but I expect 
that it was very close to the one attached.  Please do not acknowledge 
receipt of this memo as Simon does not know that I prepared it.  Dave spoke 
with Simon on Friday and is planning to meet with him this week.  They will 
be available to talk with us after their meeting.  I will keep you posted on 
when this happens.

Thanks - 

Gregg
