Ron, attached is a revised version of the term sheet you prepared.  I delet=
ed=20
the reference to the confidentiality obligations on the theory that=20
everything in that document is non-binding.  In presenting the document for=
=20
NMC, I would indicate something to them like "attached for disucssion=20
purposes is a proposed term sheet, please note that all the information=20
contained therein and all subsequent negotiations in connection with it are=
=20
to be regarded as confidential in accordance with that certain=20
confidentiality agreement entered into on April 12, 2001."  Also, please no=
te=20
that the term sheet does not reflect Terri's comments below but does have=
=20
edits that Doug made.

Lastly, since your potential transaction involves a trading play, I have=20
asked Kay Mann.  If you meet with Doug and Terri et al, I would involve Kay=
=20
in the meetings.  Thanks.

Carlos,

I have reviewed the term sheet and have the following comments:

 1.  Under the Variable Charge section, the charge reflects a "sum".  I am=
=20
not sure if this is appropriate since only the "product" of the $/mwh   and=
=20
the number of MWs is listed to be summed.

 2.  The term sheet gives the buyer intraday flexibility.  I  am not sure i=
f=20
Ron has had a chance to speak with anyone on the desk about   managing an=
=20
hourly call/change schedule, but I think these discussions need to take pla=
ce=20
prior to discussions with the customer.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Doug,

see attached term sheet for NMC (Arpin, WI site).  Please provide comments=
=20
and changes as appropriate (plus add language for your insurance product in=
=20
the place holder).

Carlos,

Doug and I will provide you background.  I am not sure if you are the=20
appropriate Legal Support (please direct us to the appropriate person if yo=
u=20
are not).

This is a starting point and is fairly general (to facilitate discussions=
=20
with NMC).

Thanks, Ron.
