Kay-

Go ahead and issue the breakout contract as is for the LM6000's at Austin.  I 
will give you some wording for a change order to increase the number of TD of 
I hours and days of per diem.  The way the contract is written, it will save 
us money to issue a change order as opposed to changing the base number of 
hours in the contract.

Sections 2.0 and 8.0 of Exhibit H-1 states that over time hours within the 
original 240 hour total are deduducted at time and a half.  Total TD of I 
hours worked in excess of the 240 hour total are only marked up by 22%.  
(Straight time = $135/hr, overtime = $165/hr)  

I will give you some wording as soon as I get an estimate from the field on 
how many days of per diem will be used.

Thanks,
Eric Booth
