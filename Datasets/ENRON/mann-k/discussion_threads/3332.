Kay:

The enclosed documents provided by Isabel Parker appear to be consistent
with the discussions in our conference call yesterday and are fine with me.
Per Isabel's request, you may wish to quickly review these documents to
ensure that they are in accord with Enron's discussions with GE.  Isabel
advises that she has not yet forwarded these documents to GE.

As discussed, we attach for your comments a clean and blacklined copy of the
GE consent, showing the changes from the version last circulated, and a
draft of the letter agreement to be signed by GE, to which the agreed forms
of the GE documents will be annexed.
We have not yet sent these documents to GE.  We would be grateful if you
could confirm that the timing contemplated in the GE letter agreement is in
line with Enron's agreement with GE.

With respect to the ENA Consent, I would be very grateful if, to save time,
you could send me a mark-up of the language Enron proposes relating to
submission to jurisdiction.

Please call me with any questions (212 277 4025)

Kind regards
Isabel
