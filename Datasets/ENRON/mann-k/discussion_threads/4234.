Please provide an update as to the status of the execution of the PSA with 
Northwestern for the forward purchase of two turbines.  It has been some time 
since I saw any documents or was involved in any meetings on this 
transaction.  If executed, please insure that we have a copy for our files 
and a tickler of what the action plan is with respect to having the documents 
for purchase from E-next prepared and timing of execution/purchase.

Lisa
