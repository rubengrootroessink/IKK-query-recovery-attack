Kay:
Per my conversation with Rusty, attached hereto is the electronic version of
the Titan-Green Option Agreement for execution by Titan.  This version is
the same document we discussed last Thurday and incorporates those
substitution pages sent to you by fax at 2:50 on June 9, 2000.  Per my fax
to you earlier today, the Optionor has executed the Option and forwarded the
signature page to me.  Therefore:

1.  Please execute FOUR (4) original copies of the Option.
2.  Please fax me the signature page 312-630-6347
3.  Please send to my attention by federal express all FOUR (4) original
executed documents.

Upon receipt I will forward two originals to the Seller, who will then send
me two original documents.  Please call with any questions 312-368-2152.
Thanks!
