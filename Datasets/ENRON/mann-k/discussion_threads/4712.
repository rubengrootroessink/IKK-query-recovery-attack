Hi Kay Kay. Just wanted to say hello and wishing you a great week. Thanks
for letting Michael come see us. We really enjoyed his visit. We enjoyed
Neil being here. Just sorry he had to meet up with a hardhead. I bet he has
a sore foot? Norm is catching crabs for us today. I forgot to tell Neil
about the crabs.We love you. Mother
