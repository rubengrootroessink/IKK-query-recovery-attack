Revised test protocol, which is now referred to as Exhibit D in the
contract.  While I am not showing the redlines, I had change-tracking on
during my edit so you can see them by clicking the other two checkboxes in
the Track Changes menu.  Note also that I am proposing that another
definition be added to the test - "Performance Test Procedures."  The
definition would read something like "Performance Test Procedures shall mean
detailed test procedures developed based on the Acceptance and Performance
Evaluation Testing Protocol (Exhibit D) which have been mutually agreed upon
by Purchaser and Seller,"
