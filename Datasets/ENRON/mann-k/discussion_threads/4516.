Steve:

I have forwarded my comments on the Pompano agreement to Kay, and plan to 
follow up with her tomorrow. A commercial point that no one has raised with 
me is the escalation on the $650k payment. I am not in favor of this. Where 
did this come from? Please advise.

Thanks,

Ben

Attached is the draft Developers Agreement for Pompano and Deerfield along
with a draft letter to Larry Deetjen.  I am in the process of redlining the
Zisman draft against the newest version which I will forward momentarily.
