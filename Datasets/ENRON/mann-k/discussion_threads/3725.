In speaking to Marvin, he indicated that Clarksdale's authority and the 
protocals for increasing rates (electric, water & sewer) were detailed in the 
statute.  He indicated that it may be in Section 21, but perhaps Miss legal 
would know better.  Under the statute, he indicated that rate approval is 
subject to Board Approval.  I just want to confirm this info as well as 
review the same information for Yazoo.  I don't need or want a copy of the 
entire statute, but only the 5-10 pages which might be applicible to the 
subject above.  The same is needed for Yazoo.  If this is not specific enough 
please let me know.  thks

Don't have it, but we can ask local counsel.  If you can email me the 
question you would like asked, I will pass it along to our Miss lawyer.

In speaking with Marvin regarding Clarksdale's authority to raise rates, he 
pointed to me their statutes.  Is this something that you have a copy of 
since this is a public filing.  Also, the same for Yazoo.
