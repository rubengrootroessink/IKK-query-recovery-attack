Kay:

FYI, I was contacted by this guy who claims to have a client that is 
interested in selling three GE7FAs that were delivered into storage last 
month. I told him that we are interested, and asked about the process. He 
told me that "bids" are due this Friday. Based on input from Duran and 
Calger, we plan to provide a non-binding expression of interest at $44 
million per unit.

Do we have any boilerplate forms we can use for this? If not, I can draft a 
letter and send it to you.

I asked about how the client intends to deal with GE, and was told that after 
a winning bidder is selected, they intend to seek GE's consent. The only 
other tid bit I have is that I called Schroeder to ask if any units were 
coming available, and he swore up and down that he did not know of any.

By the way, on Blue Dog / Northwestern, we deducted about $500k from our 
recent invoices. Attached is the letter we sent to Darst. I'll let you know 
if I hear any complaints.

Regards,

Ben
