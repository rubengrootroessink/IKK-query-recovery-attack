Kay,

Please find attached for your review a Closing Documents list and a very 
preliminary draft of the Enovate Credit Agreement.  Once you have had a 
chance to review the attached with your business people, let's set up a call 
to discuss structure/changes/etc.  In addition to confirming the basics 
(lending entity, interest rate, term), we will need to discuss financial 
covenants

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.

Regards,

Heather
