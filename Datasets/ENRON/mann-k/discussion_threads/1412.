actually, I told Bill that I thought only these two invoices were involved.
Is that correct?

Boyd just explained to me that the special interest rate provisions will
apply only to these two invoices.  As a "one time" event, it probably is
not necessary to make the change into a formal amendment to the basic
agreement.  A letter outlining the changes (and reference that it is for
just these two invoices an amendment) should be sufficient.
