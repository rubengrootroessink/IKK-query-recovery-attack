ok, I will ask Jerry to copy me on the data responses, and plan to attend
the hearing, In general, I will ask that Jerry keep me posted on
developments with copies of filings etc.  I will copy you and Gregg on
materials I receive (since I assume you aren't otherwise receiving them).
Let me know if this is the type of monitoring which you would want.
