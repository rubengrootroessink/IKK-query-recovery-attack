Jude:
Attached below are my comments to the Co op City Term Sheet I sent out
Sunday night.  Unfortunately, it may not have been delivered off my laptop
due to a failed connection on the intranet.  Here it is.  I didn't correct
several spelling errors in the draft from the Squires' lawyer.

I saw Kay Mann's comments (which corrected the spelling errors) and her
comments by-in-large look to be OK. I am copying Kay on this message in
order to speed up the review.

Jude,  One last little item: my correct email address is either
David.Lund@nepco.com <mailto:David.Lund@nepco.com>  or davidlu@nepco.com
<mailto:davidlu@nepco.com> .  There are two other "David L's" in the NEPCO
organization and if the email address isn't correct the message sits in the
message inbox for these other individuals until they figure out the message
is for me.  Once the Houston office converts to Microsoft Outlook, this
problem will go away.  Thanks.

Gene,  I marked up the attached term sheet for the ENA Coop City project.  I
highlighted some commercial terms that need your attention.  Let's discuss
and call Paul Myford after you complete your review.  I only focused on the
EPC scope and not the O&M scope.

I had earlier sent this to Gene and Dave asking how they want to proceed
with the work on this term sheet. I am delinquent copying this to Peter as I
had discussed Monday.
I suggest that teh commercial terms be vetted by Gene, and that he and Dave
work it overall. If Dave cannot work it, the Carlos Sole should be able to
provide the legal input for NEPCO. This is not a Randy Pais or Scott
Dieball assignment.

Please let Peter Nassab know if you need the Houston Contracts gropu
support.

I am out Thursday and Friday, and will be back monday and can look at it
then if the team still needs help. I cannot get e-mail after today until
Monday.
