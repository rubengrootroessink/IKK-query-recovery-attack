The Clarksdale/YazooCity race is on.  Thanks to everyone for joining in!

From a schedule standpoint--

The cities will notify Entergy today that they will be free from MEAM on May 
1, 2001 and that they are negotiating with Enron to provide control area 
services
The cities will request network transmission from Entergy
Lloyd and Rick are going to Clarksdale/Yazoo City Friday March 2, 2001 to get 
system details
Ozzie, David, Kay and Reagan are going to Clarksdale/Yazoo City on Monday to 
begin contract negotiations
Jim and Reagan will contactl Bob Priest next week to get details on Yazoo 
City's gas supply.
As soon as Lloyd gets the "green light" from Ozzie, CA hardware/software/etc. 
needs to ordered/purchased.  Expect to spend $300,000.  We need a provision 
to recover this in the event contract negotiations fail?

Considering the expected schedule with SPP and possible 6 months for 
establishing a new control area, we will need to have a contingency plan in 
place for May 1 if SPP control area is not complete.  What does this 
contingency plan look like and where is the critical path and associated 
possible pitfalls?

This week and next, we will have the following activities moving along at a 
quick pace:

Negotiate Enron contract with control area services, marketing services, etc.
Get LOI in place if contract negotiations are expected to extend beyond 
Monday/Tuesday of next week
Interconnect agreement (Clarksdale lead with Enron assistance as needed)
Control Area establishment
Control Area hardware, software, etc (Lloyd Will to lead the charge)
Gas and power scheduling

Let me know if I have missed anything.

Thanks,

Reagan
