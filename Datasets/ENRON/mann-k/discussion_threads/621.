It currently appears that I will be on the road Wednesday and Thursday.  
Figures!

I am going to send you a copy of the marked up interconnection agreement, 
which has comments from various Enron people. I thought it might help you 
think about which way to head.  

I would appreciate receiving an electronic file of the IC you prepared.   

Talk to you soon,

Kay
