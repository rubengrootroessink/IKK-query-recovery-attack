As you recall SW sent a letter on 15 Feb advising that they had replacement 
generator and wanted a $3.4 MM PO.   At your request I had drafted a 
response.  Has an answer been sent to SW.  From a contract admin point of 
view, Enron should respond to the SW Feb 15 letter soon.  Please advise as to 
your desired course of action.
