Attached is a copy of GE's proposed warranty language on which I have 
highlighted my comments.  If you can review and provide me with feedback 
sometime on Monday, I'll consolidate our thoughts and launch back to GE on 
Monday so that we can discuss with them on Tuesday.

Re Tuesday's conference call, I spoke to Steve late today about setting the 
call for 11:00 am CST which works fine for his schedule but he had not heard 
back from Mike.  I'll keep you posted if we are a go for Tuesday.
