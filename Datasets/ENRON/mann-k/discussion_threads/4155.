Kay and Ben,

I would like to send the following to Jeff Darst at GE via e-mail.

Dear Jeff,

Pursuant to you letter dated May 9, 2001 we are prepared to pay the deduct 
for liquidated damages ($536,000) and retention deduct ($965,885) withheld 
from the April 25, 2001 invoice.  Payment of the deduct for the liquidated 
damages claim does not constitute a withdrawal of the claim, hence, we are 
not waiving our rights afforded under the contract.  As stated in our letter 
dated May 3, 2001, we are prepared to pay the final 5% payment for Unit 1 
upon receipt of the Letter of Credit for $965,855 (5% of the price for Unit 
1) and a lien release. 

Regards,

Chris
