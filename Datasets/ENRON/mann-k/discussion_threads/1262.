Boyd:

           The testimony of Dave Wear has been revised to reflect a high
level
regulatory decision to be a little broader, especially in the area of how
customers receive benefits.  A final version of Mr. Wear's testimony is
attached, redlined to show changes.  Also attached is a final version of
Peoples' petition reflecting, in summary fashion, the substance of Mr.
Wear's testimony.  Corresponding documents will be prepared for North
Shore.
Please make any final comments at your earliest convenience.

                                          Jerry Fox
