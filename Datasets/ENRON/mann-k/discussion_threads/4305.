I have called and left a message to see if this division's name changed.  The 
contract is still active.

We have a purchase agreement with Exxon Company USA under which we can 
purchase power from them.  I don't know if this entity's name changed when 
they merged.  The contract is dated 1997.

Rhonda-

Would you have a look in the contracts database to see what we have with 
Exxon/Mobil.  I am hopeful that we have a Master Agreement to do power deals 
in the east.

I appreciate you help.  Thanks,
