Kay,

We had a good conversation with Marvin and Bob today regarding the ancilliary 
services.  They liked the strategy of going with Entergy (although they were 
nervous about some of the people we might have to deal with) and looking at 
other alternatives.  Initially our empahsis is to get them up and running 
without delay.  Any other plan would not be prudent. 

They would like to have the LOI reference our plan to provide the ancilliary 
services.  Not play attorney again but....can we add some language like the 
following:

Ancilliary Services:  EPMI would arrange for The cities to contract for 
ancilliary services with Entergy in accordance
with the Entergy tariff for an interim period beginning May 1, 2001.  During 
that interim period, EPMI would solicit ancilliary proposals from other 
control areas, as feasible.  If an alternate to Entergy is identified, EPMI 
may recommend that The Cities contract with the alternate for the balance of 
the EPMI term.

Christi has reservations about this maybe not having enough wiggle room for 
us, and I agree. There are a few other places in the LOI we will need to 
reference the ancilliary management responsibility EPMI is contemplating.

Also, I think this creates a need to have a definition of ancilliary services 
in the LOI.

We have a meeting scheduled with Entergy for Tuesday morning to discuss Enron 
buying ancilliary services.  Further I have called several of the other 
control areas (CLECO, Alabama Electric Co-op, NRG, SMEPA, and LEPA) to assess 
their interest in providing ancilliaries and wait for return calls.

Marvin promised to light a fire under David Hunt ASAP.  You should already 
have heard from him.

I will call you tommorrow.  Thank you very much,

Reagan
