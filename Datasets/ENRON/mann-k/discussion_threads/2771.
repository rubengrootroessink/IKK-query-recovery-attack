Patty,

Attached is Westinghouse's proposed draft of the letter contemplated in 
Sections 3/4 of the Settlement Letter.  Please review at your earliest 
possible convenience and let me know if it is in acceptable form.  In order 
to expedite your review, I am sending this without first having the 
opportunity to review it myself.

All the best.

Stuart
