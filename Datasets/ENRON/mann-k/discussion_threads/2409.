Catherine:  Lisa phoned me and said she would give you a heads up that this 
second change order needed review and quick turn around.  Coincidentally, Kay 
Mann is reviewing change order # 1 and will be looking into the change from 
LJM to E-Next Generation language implications.  Hopefully the comments on 
one will apply to the other.  Suggest you call Kay straight away to save time.

I am attaching both for your convenience.  I look forward to you comments.  
By the way Kay; GE is looking it over right now too, and Scott Dieball has 
been asked to review.  I Scott's review is not necessary please let me know.
