Attached is my cut at a closing checklist with timetables for distributing 
documents.  Please review and edit it appropriately.  In particular, please 
ensure that everything is addressed, including any additional items required 
under the Letter Agreement.  In general, there are two deadlines -- Friday 
for the form of Escrow Agreement (base it on the prior version, form of 
Guaranty (although the Buyer may want their own unique terms, we can at least 
present them with a form to expedite this process and ensure that our issues 
are properly addressed), and forms of promissory note (although the Buyer 
will want their own unique terms, we can at least present them with a form to 
expedite this process) so that once one Buyer is indentified then we can 
distribute those documents to them on Monday morning.  Then the other 
documents necessary for the transaction such as the transmittal letters and 
forms of membership certificates so that we can distribute those on Tuesday.  
The targeted execution dates that I have are Friday for the Letter Agreement 
and next Monday for the Closing.  Thanks and please call me with any 
questions.
