Charlotte,
I forgot to call you this past weekend regarding Michael. He has an
appointment with Sharon Tuesday and Paige is taking him for me. I'm taking
my mom to the doctor Tuesday morning so I will be out of the office in the
am. If you are open Saturday I may try to take Kay out Saturday night. NM
