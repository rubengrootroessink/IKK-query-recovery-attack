Kay:

I'd like to talk to you about this. Essentially what we need to do is to sign 
an agreement with FPL that does not constitute "hard costs", which allows 
them to conduct preliminary design work for our Midway project, using the 
$150k left over from the money we paid them for feasibility and facility 
studies. I'll call you Monday to discuss.

Thanks and have a good weekend.

Regards,

Ben

Please find attached a draft letter agreement from FPL.  I've taken the 
liberty of making changes that I beleive may meet with the accounting 
requirements de jour.  Basically we need to throw this letter away and start 
over.  The balance of funds left over from the feasibility studies and 
facility study for the Midway project is $122,000.  According to Dan Meyers 
of FPL, this is about 2 months worth of work.  

We can start negotiations on the interconnection agreement any time.  I'd 
suggest we start now unless our prospective partner would want to be involved.
