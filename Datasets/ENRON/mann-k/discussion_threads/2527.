Attached please find a clean copy of the most recent version of the City
of Austin Agreement (the first document below), as well as a blackline
showing changes from the February 8 version circulated earlier today.
The Agreement reinstates the prior specific performance guarantees in
Section 10.  To complete the agreement, we need to include the date of
execution, the addresses and contacts for Sections 25.1 and 25.3, and
Exhibit H-2.
