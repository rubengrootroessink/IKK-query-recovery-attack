Hi Kay.  Is the rumor really true (that you are working on a "form" EPC 
contract with NEPCo)?  Would it be appropriate, then, for me to tell the 
EE&CC guys to hold up on massaging their Sand Hills form for our PSCo deal?  
Please let me know.  Thanks!

Karen,

EE & CC is trying to get a contract together that we would sign with NEPCO. I 
know "legal" was trying to do the same with some type of std contract. What 
should I do or tell them so no duplication of effort?

Thanks

Jeff

Jeff

Attached is the latest copy of my EPC on Sandhill - 

I need to find the latest copy of the exhibits - there have been some changes 
from the signed EPC deal.
