Gentlemen:

We have enclosed what we hope is the final draft of the letter agreement
between ENA and PPL, marked to reflect revisions from the prior draft dated
April 3, 2001.  In the event these revisions are acceptable, we have also
enclosed a clean copy for execution.  We would recommend execution in
duplicate in order that each party may retain an original. Thank you.
