Kay -- Could you forward me e-versions of (1) the completed one month 
Clarksdale transaction, (2) the draft transaction document you feel is the 
best template from the point of view of the seller of the marketing services 
and (3) the finalized term sheet, if there was one, before the parties 
started to work on the definitive agreement relating to Clarksdale?  My 
'Virginia garbage burners' transaction has awakened, with negotiations 
occurring tomorrow.  Thanks, David
