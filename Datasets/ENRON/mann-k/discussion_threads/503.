Kay: At Gregg's request, I forwarded the comments to Jerry Fox, who is
handling this for Peoples. I spoke briefly with Jerry. He said he had
reviewed the comments and was in general agreement. He also indicated that
he needed more information to finalize the Petition. Although he hasn't yet
gotten back to me, I believe he is reviewing this. I plan to put in another
call to him later today.
