There was no attachment to my e-mail.  I would be happy to review the
override letter.  I have not drafted one of these before, but I have in
in my possession a draft of the override letter for the Master Agreeemnt
and an ABB override letter.  They look very similar.

Peter - I understand that you will be working on the latest LM6000
contract.  I have attached a copy of the override letter - one we
executed in January.   I am not sure how much is applicable to this
particular contract; I have not proofed the letter against it.  Would
you take a look at it and check it against the latest version of the
LM6000 contract you are working on?  Maybe we can talk later this
afternoon about any changes you think need to be made.  At the least, we
will need to conform the letter for this contract's details.

Thanks again for your help.

Rose
