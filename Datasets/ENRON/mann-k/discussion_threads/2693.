Ruthie is getting big too!  I guess she must have been underweight when we 
got her, and then she's also a big pig.  Rex (our new dog) is smaller, about 
30 pounds.  You should see Ruthie bossing him around.  He's easy going 
though.  

Rosco is going to be a big boy!

That is very cool.

Rosco has gone from 14 pounds to 27 pounds in one month.  That's a half a 
pound a day.
