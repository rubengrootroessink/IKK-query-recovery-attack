> Subject: Draft Coop City Term Sheet
>
> Further to our discussions last week, attached is a preliminary draft of
> the term sheets for the development of the Coop City project, including
> indicative terms for EPC, O&M, and Asset Management.  Since we haven't yet
> discussed the terms in any significant detail, the attached remains
> somewhat general with respect to some items and includes significant
> assumptions with respect to other.  Nonetheless, it is a starting point
> for our discussions next week.
>
> As discussed last week, for the sake of expediency, this draft is being
> distributed simultaneously to all parties and has not been separately
> reviewed by my clients.  It therefore remains subject to internal review
> and comment.
>
> Next week's meeting has been scheduled at our offices in New York,
> beginning on Wednesday, January 17 at 1:30 p.m. until Thursday afternoon.
> Our offices are located at:

> Squire, Sanders & Dempsey L.L.P.
> 350 Park Avenue, 15th floor
> New York, NY
> Tel:  212-872-9800
> Fax: 212-872-9815

> We look forward to seeing you then.  In the meantime, should you have any
> questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Best regards.
