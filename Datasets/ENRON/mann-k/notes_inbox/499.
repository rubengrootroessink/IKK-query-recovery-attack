The message below is related to Fort Pierce.  I have only reviewed the 
Participation Agreement for a Confidentiality provision (Section 18.1).  I 
think Bart also told me that there is a confidentiality provision in either 
the Option Agreement or the Lease.  I will look around.

Attached below are the latest docs. on Fort Pierce.  Please note that we are 
still awaiting some final comments from FPUA's attorney and Turbopark, but 
these should be very close to final form.  We should have all comments back 
and be in final form in a week to ten days if you want to wait to put the 
docs. into Deal bench.

Bart sent this e-mail out in response to Lisa Bill's request for a 
comprehensive list of all documents.  I think the only document missing is 
the FMPA steam agreement where we can use their units on an interruptible 
basis when they are not using them.  Please note that some of the documents 
are not for parties outside of Enron are confidential legal opinions.

As requested today, attached are the latest drafts of the FPUA/FPRP 
Development Agreements to be executed by FPUA and FPRP and the Tax and 
Aesthetics Agreements to be executed by the City of Fort Pierce and FPRP  ( 
to be delivered to FPRP at the execution of the other Development Agreements 
by FPUA). It may be helpful to open the Execution Date Deliveries document 
first to give you a checklist of the documents, and a rundown on permits. If 
you need an update on permitting, I will have to ask Scott and Jeffrey to 
help with that discussion. Note that the Equipment Lease for the chillers, 
the Equipment Lease for the cooling towers, and the Option to Lease for the 
cooling tower site ( and the Ground Lease, which will be appended to the 
Option to Lease) are in the process of being drafted now, and I will 
distribute them as soon as they are ready. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS MEMO OR THE 
ATTACHED MEMO FROM A & k TO FPUA OR ANYONE OUTSIDE ENRON, AS THE CERTIFICATES 
TO BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINIONS ARE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL TO 
FPRP/ENRON.

In connection with our meeting Friday, a couple of other points worth noting 
are (1) Section 9.2 (c) of the Participation Agreement, added as a 
placeholder when the thought was to have a dump condenser and when its 
location was unknown,will be deleted, (2) references in Exhibits D and E to 
the dump condenser/system will be removed, references in Exhibit  D 
describing the FPRP Improvements will add references to the cooling tower and 
chillers, and references in Exhibit E to the demin system will remain. 

There are additional comments received from FPUA and its insurance 
consultants after preparation of the attached draft of the Participation 
Agreement , all of which have been blessed by David Marshall, that will be 
addressed in the next draft. 

We also know that the legal description and plot plan of the leased parcel in 
the Ground Lease will change to reflect the extension of the parcel 30' to 
the east, certain easements in favor of FPUA and FPRP described in the Ground 
Lease and the Easement Agreement will be affected by the extension,and we 
should have those descriptions and plans for the lease parcel description and 
affected easements tomorrow. 

We also have internal input from David Fairley ( Interconnection & 
Transmission), Mike Coleman ( Section 3.12, O & M, Annual Heat Rate Test ), 
Jeffrey Keenan ( Tolling and Interconnection & Transmission Agreement), and 
Rusty/Ron Tapscott ( Section 9.3, Participation Agreement, Transmission 
Upgrades Responsibilities) that needs to be reflected. 

Finally, note that the proposed FPRP and ENA legal opinion, and related FPRP 
Certificate, is being discussed by Rose with E-Next counsel, and we 
understand those documents will change based on those discussions.

As noted today, FPUA will give us its comments on the documents delivered to 
them on 5/9 this Friday, but we don't expect those comments to be material. 
We also don't expect there to be much discussion about the items noted above 
to be added to the last drafts seen by FPUA, except possible with respect to 
the Equipment Leases and Option to Lease, which will be new documents they 
have to review.
