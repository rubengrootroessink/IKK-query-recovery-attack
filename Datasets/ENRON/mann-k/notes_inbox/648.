Kay

Can I come up to your office some time today to pick up fax copies of the 
executed version of c/o #2?  I need to give copies to Global Finance and 
Accounting in order to get the invoice paid.  If it's easier, you can also 
fax them to me at x63037.

Thanks,
Rebecca

Kay already has executed fax copies. Does GF need originals? Usually fax 
copies suffice...

Please let me know when you get the copies of the change order.  I need to 
give executed copies to Global Finance and accounting in order to pay the c/o 
# 2 invoice.

Thanks,

Ben,

Please let me know how you would like to complete this process.  Would you
like me to send you two original signed copies, and then you could return
one with your signature?

Please advise,

Jeff:

Attached is the most recent version (I think version 8) of CO #1 which we
understood had been approved both by GE and ENA. I hope this clears up our
misunderstanding.

With respect to CO#2, we have incorporated your final changes. Please find
attached a marked and clean (i.e. executable) copy. At your earliest
convenience, please sign the clean copy where indicated, and scan and
e-mail me the signed copy.

I will call you first thing in the morning.

Regards,

Ben
