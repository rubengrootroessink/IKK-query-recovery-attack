Hey!  Since Jerry would like to assemble six original sets of the Letter
Agreement and Guaranty, I think it would be worthwhile to get 5 additional
signature pages for the Guaranty.  Let me know if you think otherwise.

Talk to you soon,

Marisa

Hello.

I have one original Enron signature which I can have delivered today.  If
we need more, then I'll have to get more signed (duh).

Thanks,

Kay
