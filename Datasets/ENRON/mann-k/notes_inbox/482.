Was Michael's performance outstanding as usual?  It's been very quiet here 
this afternoon.  Your little man is so cute!  You need to take a good picture 
so I can put it on canvas and frame it for you.  It looks so professional and 
expensive.  Or, I could take a picture of your family and do it for you.  I 
wish someone would take a photograph of all of us!
