Rose,

JOhn is in Brazil, but he promised he would do a reality check calculation 
for the LM6000 price if we could send him the equipment list for the third 
party sale.  

John will need the equipment list, and a copy of the section which describes 
the sales price.     Any possibility of getting that before you guys head out 
to San Antonio for the legal conference?    Thanks.

Mary
