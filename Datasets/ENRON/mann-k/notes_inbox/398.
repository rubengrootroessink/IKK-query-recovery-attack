Pushing our TECO call back is fine with me.  I am good until 4 pm.  I have to 
leave by 4:45 today for a meeting outside the office.

OK. We can push back on the TECO term sheet call. Let Fred and me know what 
works.

Who at GE are you talking to?

I'm on the phone with GE.  Their initial response to the assignment stuff is 
positive.  They want a letter which sets out the ownership of the LLC and 
what we are doing on payment.

I've been working on TECO term sheet, but I'm not sure I'll be done by 300, 
depending on this call.
