Attached is a revised draft of the lease agreement both as a clean copy and 
red line comparison to the draft that you sent.  I would be glad to explain 
the reasons behind the changes included.  The changes in the insurance 
section are taken from the input of our insurance department.
To answer your other question Andrew Balog at Greenberg is not a relative but 
we are both Hungarian.  I don't run across many with that name especially 
outside of the northeast and midwest.
