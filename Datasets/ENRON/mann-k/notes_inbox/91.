Kay -- Before the agreement and your risk letter are finished, I want to ask 
again that we focus on those particular items remaing in the agreement that 
may create incremental risk, and would lead to a worse risk rating in your 
risk letter.  If you would pinpoint those items, then we can discuss them to 
be sure that we get language in the agreement to mitigate those risks.  With 
your knowledge of the law and ability to craft language into the agreement, 
and my knowledge of the utility business and power trading, I think that we 
can improve most or all of these risk issues.  In addition, the MDEA deal is 
becoming a template for all similar deals, so anything that we can take care 
of in this agreement will flow through to other deals.  Thanks -- David
