Kay:

George Kutzschbach of Fulbright called this afternoon to request copies of
the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreements and Bills of Sale for the
turbine/transformer transaction between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP.  George
has unsigned copies of these documents.  Our closing volumes also contain
only unsigned copies of these documents.

George is asking for the documents with respect to both the turbines and
the
transformer, but is needing them specifically for the transformer.
Apparently, CA-II is planning to sell the transformer, and he is gathering
up the documents that would show title to the transformer in CA-II.

I have reviewed the documents, and do not see any reason why we should not
deliver them.  Can you provide signed copies of these documents?   Thanks.
