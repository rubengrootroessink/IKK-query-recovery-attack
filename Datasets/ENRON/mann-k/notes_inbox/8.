Kay:

I spoke to Dave, and he's on board with us signing the agreement. We will 
need to have an i-DASH signed prior to the guarantee being issued. He wants 
us to make sure that the termination section is adequate such that if we want 
to terminate the agreement prior to the payment becoming due, that we will be 
relieved of our obligation to make the payment. I think the agreement does 
that (although it's not the best language), and Debbie is adding some 
language to make it a bit better without sticking their nose in it too deep 
(I asked her to take the language from the Pompano draft). In any case, Duran 
wants a voice-mail from you that from a legal perspective, the termination 
section is sufficient to relieve us from obligations under the agreement to 
the extent we terminate prior to the date upon which those obligations arise.

We can talk about this tomorrow. Debbie would like to have a conference call 
at 10 AM central if you're available.

Regards,

Ben
