Kay

I do have those sig pages.  Sorry about that -- I thought I had already given 
them to you.  I will bring them up to you this morning.

Regards,
Rebecca

Subject: Search for sigs

Hi Rebecca,

I'm trying to locate the sig pages for the NW guaranty.  These were the docs 
that I approved after I had approved the letter agreement.  These signed 
pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me.  
To you remember if you brought them to me before?  I haven't really searched 
- I thought I would ask first.

Thanks,

Kay
