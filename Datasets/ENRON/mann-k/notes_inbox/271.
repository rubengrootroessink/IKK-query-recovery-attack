Ad valorems do not necessarily decrease as a result of depreciation, because 
millage rates and a current years reassessment also are part of the

We wanted to maintain a recurring 1.5mm and since ad advalorems will
decrease as a function of depreciation we thought the way to maintain the
constant we to increase the 650k at the same rate as the depreciation.
