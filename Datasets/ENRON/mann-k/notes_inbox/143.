ate?that?it is logistically difficult to have GE re-execute  documentation, 
but as the legal opinion and the receipt of funds are both  addressed to?the 
lenders, we ought really to have originals of these two  documents. 
Could you please let me know where the originals of  these documents were 
sent and whether it would be possible to have them  re-directed to us or to 
have the documents re-executed?
Thank you in advance
