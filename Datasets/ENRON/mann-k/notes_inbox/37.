Because it didn't matter...you are agreeing to pay a minimum amount
regardless of the actual tax valuation, to the extent that applying tax
creditable amounts like for use of pollution control devices gets you below
the Base Amount you would still pay the base amount.

Why didn't we have the following language in the tax payment section:

.  "In no event shall Payments in Lieu of Taxes include, apply to, or be
required to be made for Real Property Assets and/or Tangible Personal
Property exempt under Florida Statutes in existence as of the Effective
Date or any date prior to commencement of operations of the proposed
Facility, as such statutes may be amended from time to time."

Somehow this was missed because we didn't follow the Pompano form
closely enough...

This is the City's red-line against our draft.

I will call to discuss.
