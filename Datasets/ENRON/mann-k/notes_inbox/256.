Just ran into Nick Cocovasis in the elevator.  Today is his last day at 
Enron, he accepted a position with AEP just yesterday (or very recently).  Of 
course I had to ask if Ann Elizabeth was also going.  He said, "She will 
probably go too", although I do not know what he was basing that comment on.  
We will see.
