Isabel:

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking
with ENA on the GE documents.  Thanks.
