Attached please find the most recent version of the LV Cogen/ABB
Agreement (second document below) that incorporates the contractor's
comments in Exhibit B-1, as well as a blackline (first document below)
showing changes from the version I circulated on January 8, 2001.
Please call me and let me know if my changes are correct.  Once I
receive your comments, I will circulate the revised draft this evening.
