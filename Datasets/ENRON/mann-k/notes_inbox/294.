Hi Kay,

Good to hear from you!  The restaurant to which you refer is Bern's and it's 
still a great meal experience.  Maybe this transaction will take a turn 
through one of its dining rooms.

Hi Doug,

I hear you are working on the Midway deal.  Me, too.   I want to go back to
the restaurant  you suggested with the remarkable decor and wine list (was
it Burns, something like that?).

I look forward to working with you on this one.

Kay
