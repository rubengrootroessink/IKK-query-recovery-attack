Michael is to receive the bone marrow transplant sometime today.  Some or
you have thought it's a surgical procedure.  It's not.  Rather, it's done
through an IV.

He will be in need of quite a few platelet transfusions over the next while.
One can donate platelets more frequently than one can donate blood, but I
don't know much more than that about the frequency.  If you or your
friends/co-workers can donate platelets, please first contact my wife
(Beverly) to find out the exact schedule for Michael's need for them. As
they do not have a shelf life of more than 24-26 hours, they must be donated
one day for transfusion the next.  Bev is more or less staying with Michael
in the hospital.  You can reach her at (713) 792-6840 (that's the number for
Michael's room, but she has a 2nd line in the little visitor room to the
side of it).

Thanks so much for your help.  "Thanks" is a poor substitute for the
gratitude we have for your support, but . . .

Bob
