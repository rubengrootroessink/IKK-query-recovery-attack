Whether I can attend or not, I think an internal gathering tomorrow to review 
outstanding World Hunger issues would be appropriate followed by the 
regularly scheduled call on Wednesday.  If you all would push this along in 
my absence, I will ask Suzanne Adams to send out the reminder memo to the 
distribution list.  Be sure to include Bill Williams so that his input can be 
applied to the Longview turbine purchase.  Thanks!

John and Scott: Please attend this call. It will start bumping into the GE 
world hunger and Arcos turbines.
