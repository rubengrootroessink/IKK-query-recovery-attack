Subject: Escrow Agreement

Chris, per our conversation this afternoon, this e-mail will document the
fact that, due to travel schedules, NorthWestern is unable to obtain the
necessary officer signatures for the incumbency documents requested by
Citibank as part of establishing the escrow arrangement called for under the
Letter Agreement.  You agreed that NorthWestern could complete the necessary
paperwork with Citibank on Tuesday of next week.  Thanks again for your
flexibility.
