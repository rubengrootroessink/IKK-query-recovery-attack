Polite BUT it says we are expencting our money.  Let's see if she responds.  
If not, I'll expense it, but I wanted to give her a chance to redeem her boo 
boo.  I thought you'd get a kick out of the email, I did while writing it.

Tricia, thank you for Kay Mann's  refund in the amount of $500 for the 
above-referenced seminar.  The cost of the seminar, however,  was $595.  I 
cancelled this seminar two days before the cancellation deadline of March13, 
2001 (cancellation number X197033661), but Kay was still charged the $95 
cancellation administrative fee.  Please advise when she can expect this $95 
to be credited to her American Express card.  

Thanks, Suzanne Adams
