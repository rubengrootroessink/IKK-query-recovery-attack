Kay:

Paul Hastings called today regarding the status of Enron's original
signature pages.  Have these been forwarded to their office?  The reason I
ask is that Paul Hastings would like to send out original sets to each
party.  Let me know.

Regards,

Marisa

Dear Kay,

As of this afternoon, we have not received Enron's original signature pages
for the Letter Agreement and Guaranty.  Have these been forwarded to our
office?  If so, please advise as to how they were sent and the expected date
of delivery; if not, please let me know when you will be able to send them.


Thanks,
Tremaine Wright
