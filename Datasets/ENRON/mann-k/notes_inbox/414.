I know a couple of their lawyers from a prior transaction (Doug Turner and
their GC, whose name I've now forgotten).  Don't know who they will have on
this one.

I'm off to the Astros, but would like to visit with you tomorrow, if you
will be around.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay

I'm looking forward to working with you on this.  I wonder who opposing
inhouse counsel is at TECO?
