FYI, there is nothing in the permit that provides an allowable lower limit on 
the turbine load factor.  In the permit application, we provided emission 
estimates for 50 to 100 percent load and termed this as the "expected range 
of operating conditions".  We can operate below 50 percent load, but would 
likely need to do initial stack compliance tests at the lowest load we would 
operate the plant.

Since the emission guarantees from GE will likely be for a range of 50 to 100 
percent load factors, I suggest that we adopt 50 percent load (approximately 
85 MW per turbine) as the mimimum turbine load.

Ben/Kay:

Attached are my comments on the Midway Tolling term sheet and LOI.  

I will be out on Monday but will have my cell phone on.  My conversations 
will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes, but I will do my best to be 
available.

Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss.  I have asked Dave 
Kellermeyer to call either one of you on Monday with an answer to the minimum 
block size for the tolling term sheet.  I am taking the air permit home to 
review and will leave you a message if I determine the answer.

Fred
