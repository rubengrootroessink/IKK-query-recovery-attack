Kay, please note the following responses to Stuart Zisman's e-mail of 10/8
to you:

1.	Correct.

2.	The Option states that Optionee is permitted to disclose the terms
of the agreement to "Optionee's accountants, attorneys, prospective lenders,
investment bankers, underwriters, rating agencies, partners, consultants and
other advisors in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Option (collectively, "Representatives"), to the extent that such
Representatives reasonably need to know such information and data to assist,
and perform services on behalf of Optionee."  It may be a stretch, but I
might argue that potential bidders may be considered "prospective" lenders
or partners in connection with the option and that they reasonably need to
know such information.  Perhaps Enron should seek a waiver of this
obligation from Optionors.

Furthermore, it is correct that the option was not exercised based on the
materials.  A "Notice of Option to Purchase Real Estate" dated May 19, 2000
was submitted as part of re-zoning application; but upon further review it
appears that it was not intended as an exercise of the option. 

3.	The comment noted in the "Assignment of Option to Purchase Real
Estate," dated November 9, 2000 was also submitted as part of the re-zoning
application, and similarly not intended as an exercise of the option.
Please disregard the comment.  

4.	Correct.

5.	Correct.

6.	Correct.

Finally, my review was limited to the documents that were sent over by you
guys some months ago, and I haven't looked at DealBench recently.
Therefore, as Stuart mentioned, I need to confirm that I have reviewed
everything.  I spoke to Stuart about this issue yesterday, and he is aware
that I have not had time to focus on Midway as much since we've been
finalizing Doyle.  I told him that I still needed to go through Dealbench
and that I would like to consolidate the two charts that I prepared into one
chart.  Additionally, I mentioned that I was revising the Midway PSA to
include comments from the Enron team in connection with Doyle.  He told me
to focus on Doyle for now and turn to Midway as soon as I had time.  I just
sent out execution copies for Doyle and will turn to Midway right away.  I
will redistribute the revised PSA and chart as soon as possible.

		Kay,

		I quickly reviewed the summaries of documents done by K&S
and have the
		following questions/concerns:

		1) Items #1 and #2 - I assume that you concluded that the
prohibition
		doesn't prevent disclosure of the agreement itself;
		2) Item #3 - It sounds like this is a confidentiality
problem.  Also,
		did we really exercise the option or did we just extend it?;
		3) Item #4 - What is meant by the Comment section?;
		4) Item #5 - I assume that you concluded that the
confidentiality
		provision did not restrict us from disclosing the agreement;
		5) Item #6 - I assume that you concluded that the
confidentiality
		provision did not restrict us from disclosing the agreement;
and
		6) Item #10 - I assume that the change of control provision
does not
		extend to a sale of equity.

		What about the other documents relating to Midway?  Are
these the only
		significant ones.  DealBench has numerous docs relating to
Midway and I
		need to be certain that all have been considered/reviewed.

		Thanks for your help.

		P.S.	Kay, have we spoken with the folks at Westinghouse
on the
		Gleason settlement issue.  I was hoping that you would call
the author
		of the last email from Westinghouse to try to articulate the
reason for
		revising the language and follow that with a conference call
if need be.
		Please advise.

		Stuart

		Here's the chart on the Midway docs.  John Keffer (713 751
3255) and
		Bill Parish at King & Spalding have been involved.

		I'll have them send you the most recent purchase/sale
agreement on
		Midway.

				Hi John and Bill,

				I know I've been out of the loop on this
one, but I
		wanted
		to check to
				make sure that you were still involved. You
may have
		given
		Sheila or
				Bart the info, but just in case you didn't,
did the
		document
		review on
				Midway get completed?

				Thanks,

				Kay
