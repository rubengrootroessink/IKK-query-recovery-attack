Kay / Fred:

I did my best to get through it but my eyes are growing weary. Kay - please 
let me and Fred know when we can review this. I think at this point it would 
be helpful for you to review the attached document, and then for you Fred and 
I to discuss your comments.

Please let me know when you want to get together.

Thanks,

Ben
