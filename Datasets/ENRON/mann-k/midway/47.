Here's the chart on the Midway docs.  John Keffer (713 751 3255) and Bill Parish at King & Spalding have been involved.

I'll have them send you the most recent purchase/sale agreement on Midway.

Kay, attached is a chart summary of our review of the Midway documents that
addresses the issues raised by Stuart Zisman in his e-mail of 10/4/01 to you
and Bart Clark.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
I hope you are doing well.

		Hi John and Bill,

		I know I've been out of the loop on this one, but I wanted
to check to
		make sure that you were still involved. You may have given
Sheila or
		Bart the info, but just in case you didn't, did the document
review on
		Midway get completed?

		Thanks,

		Kay
