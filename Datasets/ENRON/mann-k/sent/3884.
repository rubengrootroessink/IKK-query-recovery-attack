John,  

Just wanted you to be aware.  No action required - water under the bridge.

 I thought that I was very clear about the deadline of 10AM Eastern time.  
Tell Carolyn to wake up.  Carolyn has set an expectation that is totally 
unexceptable and unfortunately to late to change.  I do not think that anyone 
external to Enron takes this timeing issue seriously.  This delay has cost 
Enron $15,000.  Every day that goes by and this deal does not close costs 
Enron $15,000 - 

 PS - voice mail in portland is down today - it would appear that PGE 
contracts to fix this stuff during working hours - no wonder we can't sell 
this company.

Subject: ENA/PPL Escrow Agreement


Estelle and Barbara:

PPL's lenders have requested two items relating to the escrow prior to
funding:

1.  Fax copy of the Escrow Agreement signed by Citibank; and
2.  E-mail confirmation that the escrow account has been opened.

Can you please furnish these items as early as possible on Thursday morning.
The parties intend to fund the escrow before 10:00 central time.  The money
needs to make one stop before it gets to you, so the earlier it can get
started the better.  Please furnish these items to the following
individuals:

1.  Carolyn M. Campbell (fax 713-751-3280) (ccampbell@kslaw.com)
2.  Greg Lang (fax 203-674-7646) (gregorylang@paulhastings.com)
3.  Isabel Parker (fax 212-277-4001) (iparker@freshfields.com)

Thank you.
