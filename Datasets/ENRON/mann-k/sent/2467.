This needs to be "TurboParked" (parties changed, GFinance advised).  Is there 
any special deal on payment for the change order?

I'll figure out how to change the signature lines, etc.

Chris:
 
Are we already paying GE for the change order? Is GE pushing to have this 
resolved? Pending input from Kay, I would like to hold off documenting it 
until we deal with the contract assignment and ultimate disposition of the 
unit.

Please follow up with Kay.

Thanks,

Ben

Chris,

On behalf of Matt Tezyk, please find attached below the Blue Dog Change Order 
for ENA's signature.  This had fallen through the cracks and Matt said that 
you would be handling it for me.  Thank you very much.

Once ENA has signed off on two (2) originals of the Change Order, you may 
return them to me at 3AC 712A.  I will then forward them to Jeffrey Darst for 
his signature.  Copies of the fully executed change order will be distributed 
upon return from GE.
