I took her in a while back for the cough, plus she goes in every 6 months for 
kennel cough and hearworm test.  They haven't said much and I haven't asked.  
Afraid to, I guess.  I got Kaley when I was with my former boyfriend, and 
she's been through it all with Paige and me.

Have you taken Kaley to the doctor or are you afraid to.  We lost our 
childhood dog when he was 12.  I cried for weeks!  Rosco sounds like a cool 
dog.  

Oh, I miss Ruthie when we go on trips.  I swear they are like children.  You 
certainly do get attached.

Sounds like a good match with Ruthie and Murphy.

My old dog, Kaley, is really sounding bad.  She has a cough that just won't 
quit, which has gotten worse over the last couple of years.  I think it is 
her heart.  She's 11 years old, and moves slowly.  

Rosco owns the familiy now.  He is so quiet, but friendly.  Just likes to 
hang around close to everyone.  I'll miss him when I'm in FW.

Are you having fun yet!!!!!!

The vet said Murphy has an ear infection so that's probably why he's been 
scratching.  Otherwise, he's in great shape.  31.5 pounds and he also thinks 
Murphy is less than one year old.  He said Murphy is a wire terrier cross.  I 
looked that up, and it's an ugly dog!  He definitely doesn't have that face, 
it looks more like a Jack Russell.  You should have seen him running behind 
Ruthie this morning.  All four legs were off the ground - he definitely has 
kangaroo in him!  He must have had a rough day though because Ruthie was 
wanting to mess with him, and he snapped at her.  He's like Ric, you can only 
push him so far!  I'll try and take some pictures this weekend.  Just thought 
I'd update you on the kids!

Do you need something for lunch?

We are scheduled to have a call with Delta at 2:30 Houston time.  They will 
have their in-house counsel present to go over the letter agreement.  Delta 
will call Carlos's number.
