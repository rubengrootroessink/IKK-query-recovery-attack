I attach the new draft of the Agency Agreement I received from Peoples a few 
moments ago.

Simon Helfrich called to comment on the credit provisions.  The essence of 
their proposal is that the LLC acts as a guarantor of all accounts receivable 
from parties for whom the LLC has performed the credit check.

I look forward to discussing this draft with you.

Thanks!  DT
