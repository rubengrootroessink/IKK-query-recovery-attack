OK... I told y'all that I was going to leave ASAP for Waco. I am out
Thursday night at 9:00 PM. I would be happy to move all my stuff home on
Friday, but neither one of you can come up that early. Last time we moved
out, Neil had everything pretty much out of the car by the time you and I
got home. So, I didn't think it would be that different, except I wouldn't
be there to organize my stuff. I guess I can come home Friday with as much
stuff as I can fit in my car and then back up Saturday with y'all to put
the big stuff in one of our big cars. I thought you knew exactly what I was
planning. Basically, Tim and Abbey are waiting on me to be done to leave,
so I am trying to get moved out quickly. Mikey gets out Wednesday night as
well, I think, so he has to move all of his stuff back on Thursday. I
wasn't going to ask him to go from College Station to Houston to here to
Houston to Waco for me. Plus his car is pretty small anyway. He will be
more than willing to help put big stuff in the car on Saturday, I'm sure.
Anyway, so do you want me to come home with all I can on Friday, and then
all of us come up on Saturday? I can just pack all my crap that will fit in
the car on Thursday night after I finish finals. That would mean y'all
moving my big stuff without me when you get back to Houston on Saturday.
But I don't usually help with that stuff anyway (i.e. my couch, trunk,
patio furniture)
