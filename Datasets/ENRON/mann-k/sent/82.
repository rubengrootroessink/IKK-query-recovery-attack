Hi Sheila,

I'm happy to take care of this, I just want to make sure I'm not stepping on 
anyone's toes. Is anyone else working on this?

Kay

Kay:  Braden supplied the exhaust stacks for the eight GE 7EA machines in 
Illinois.  They are preparing to submit their letter of credit so they can 
get paid the final 5%.  It is to be valid through the end of the warranty 
period.  I will make sure that the dates work.  Please tell me if you approve 
of this form of LOC.  The purchase order requires Braden to:  "provide an 
irrevocable, on demand, letter of credit ... issued by a U.S. bank acceptble 
to Buyer, with a credit rating of A or better and with a validity period 
through the completion of the 12 month warranty  period.

I am also sending this form to Robin Veariel.

Robin, (i) is it ok that an affiliate of Braden is issuing the LOC?;
              (ii) is the bank issuing this LOC worth a flip?; and
              (iii) any comments on the form?

Gavin:  Are they done delivering everything, and what LD's are they into?  
They  have submitted all of their invoices and we are holding the last 5% 
pending completion of work, receipt of lien waiver and LOC.  LD's paid are 
not a condition to releasing the retention, so you should try to close them 
out before they get all their cash in hand. Drawing LDs against the LOC would 
deplete the funds available for warranty work if you ever needed them for 
that.

Brian,

Attached please review and advise acceptance for the revised draft LOC. We
have eliminated the effective date being subject to receipt of final
payment. Hopefully this draft LOC is acceptable. If so, Braden could issue
the formal LOC early next week.

Regards, Curt
