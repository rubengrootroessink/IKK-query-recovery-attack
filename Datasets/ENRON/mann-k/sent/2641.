I'm a little concerned about the neighborhood (no offense), but I thought you 
could drive by at lunch.  They also have a facility at the St. Regis school.  
Lastly, if you watch as you drive home (I know you are looking around anyway) 
you might see a church with a sign up, etc.  Maybe Grace Presby might have 
something.  I'm concerned about bringing Michael downtown because of my 
travel schedule.

Can you print this please? I can't seem to get it to print here. 
It sounds great and wow, it couldn't be closer to the office! 
More importantly, I bet Michael would love it!!
