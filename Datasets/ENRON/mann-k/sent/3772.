In speaking with Lee Johnson this am, he mentioned that he is still missing 
final contracts for PSCO and CA Development.  I seem to recall that Sheila 
had asked someone to pull this together, and that I had given Kathleen the CA 
Development stuff.   I could be off track, but that's how I remember it.  
There's probably someone with a better memory.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Kay
