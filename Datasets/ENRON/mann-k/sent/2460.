We hope that in the coming weeks we will be able to find a time that would
be convenient for the PMRW attorneys on the "Enron Team" to come to Houston
to meet with the Enron attorneys and development leaders.  Please let us
know if there are dates or times that would be more convenient for you.

> Thank you.
