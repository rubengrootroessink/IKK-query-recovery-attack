yes, I think this is part of it. Also, for that reason, Ron Jolle, attorney
for the City of Chicago attended the hearing today and indicated that the
City would intervene. One likely reason for the concern over potential
abuse is that, after a lengthy delay, I understand that the ICC has again
turned its attention to rules of conduct for gas utility affiliated
interests. They had started a proceeding to work rules, but there had been
no activity for many months. The ICC Staff has apparently been reviewing
rules of conduct in connection with resumed activity regarding the rules.
                                         At the hearing today, Jerry Fox
and Mary Klyshaff represented Peoples and North Shore. ICC was represented
by John Feeley and John RIeichart. Ron Jolle represented the City of
Chicago. David Gilbert is the Hearing Examiner. (He's a good examiner.)
There was no substantive discussion re issues. The schedule is: Feb.
28-Staff and Intervenor direct; March 28-Company rebuttal; Apr. 5-11:00am
status hearing (this was included in the schedule primarily to permit early
conclusion in the event that there are no issues raised or that the issues
are resolved);April 27- Staff/Intervenor  Rebuttal; May 11 Company
Surrebuttal; May 23 10:00am hearing.   If there are disputed issues, the
hearing would be followed by briefing, issuance of an Examiner's proposed
order and biriefs/replies on exceptions.
