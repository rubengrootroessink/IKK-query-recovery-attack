I am scheduled to be out of the office Tues-Thurs of this week.  I will be in 
New York with Mark Bernstein negotiating a term sheet for the Co Op City 
deal.  This is one of the asset management deals I'm working on for the NE 
Power Team.  

I haven't confirmed with Mark that the trip is still on, so there is still 
the possibility that it might cancel.
