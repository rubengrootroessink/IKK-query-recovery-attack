Thanks.  Suzanne just gave me the documents.  I like having the electronic 
versions as well.

I can't believe it feels so good to be back.  I must be crazy.

  Hi Carolyn,

  Please email me the execution version of the documents
signed last week, as
  well as the current version of the other documents.  Were
the originals put
  in the mail?  My assistant isn't here, so I can't tell what
I have yet.

  Thanks,

  Kay
