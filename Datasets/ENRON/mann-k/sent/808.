Nancy,

I knew you were thinking about it, so I didn't worry. 

I'm monkeying around the PPA, only because I had a meeting with Ozzie and 
Heather late last night.  Will you be picking up emails in the next day or 
so?  I can forward you what I've done for your review.

We need to get a Enron/BP dialogue going concerning the lease with the City 
of Rocky Mount.  When do you want to discuss this (or have us discuss it with 
the right B & P person)?

Thanks,

Kay

I forgot to reply to this.  Just let me know when you want to discuss it.  
I'll jot down some thoughts on risk issues in the meantime.

Here at Enron the lawyers generate risk memos in connection with
transactions, summarizing the more important legal risks in a deal.  I've
been taking notes along the way, but I will be asking you for your thoughts
here shortly.  A discussion will be all I'm looking for at this time.

Thanks,

Kay
