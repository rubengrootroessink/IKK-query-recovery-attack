I worked out for the first time in a bizillion years.  Oh my gosh.  At least 
I know how to work out, and I know not to take it to the limit the first time 
out, but it is still hard to move.  I didn't exercise my legs or my back 
much, figuring that's what I'll need most this weekend for yard work.  I 
think I saw our neighbor Kim playing basketball.  I took an abs class, since 
I need to get my abs (and back) in shape to protect myself from injury.  I 
could really mess myself up after such a long hiatus!

The Met was plenty convenient.  They have a  spa there now, with all the spa 
stuff.
