BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Group
The East Power Group is off to another strong start in 2001.  The realignme=
nt=20
of the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=
,=20
and origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20
producing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20
transactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=
ne=20
deal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.

Executed in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=
=20
facilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=
o=20
the industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20
merchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20
territory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=
 =20
These plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =
=20
This deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=
om=20
the East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=
is=20
deal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=
=20
the coal supply and emissions issues.

Prospects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=
ns=20
are in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=
80=20
MW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=
s=20
scheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=
=20
Texas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=
=20
trading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20
real-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.

Additionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =
of=20
Enron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20
existing power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=
ed=20
to produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=
t=20
less cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20
reduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.  The=20
planned in-service date is summer of 2002.

Industrial Markets
EIM Fundamental Analysis Group grows again!  The Fundamental Analysis Group=
=20
continues to expand its staff and capabilities.  They will be introducing y=
ou=20
to specific activities in the weeks to come, but would like to introduce yo=

On the paper/pulp/lumber side, Bin Wang is responsible for supporting the=
=20
lumber group; Adnan Patel will be assisting with newsprint and structured=
=20
transactions. =20

For the steel group, Doug Parsons and Yana Kristal are providing market=20
analysis and econometric/price forecasting support.  Our latest recruit,=20
David Maxwell, is assisting with the evaluation of a customer management=20
system and developing analytical databases for all product lines. A visible=
=20
enhancement to the group=01,s operations has been the Intranet web site, wh=
ich=20
has been in development for the past three months.  The site will be=20
transferred to a production server by the end of February.  The site contai=
ns=20
all types of industry, market, regulatory, analytical, and financial=20
information for deal analysis. =20

Another major development is the adoption of a customer information=20
management system.  EIM is currently evaluating Siebel Systems, a software=
=20
provider that has developed this type of information tool for EES.
