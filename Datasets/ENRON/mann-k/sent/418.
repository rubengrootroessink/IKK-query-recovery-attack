I can understand how that can be a problem.  Certainly, every effort can be 
made to expedite the process, and I do think the first time will take the 
longest for obvious reasons. 

For the purposes of scheduling going forward, I think it would help to keep 
that type of time frame in mind, with the thought that maybe it can happen 
more quickly.

Kay:

Thanks for the email.  However I am a bit concern that the 2 - 4 processing 
of the forms may not support the Austin Energy construction schedule.  I am 
working on that and will let you know if it does or does not.

Thanks,

Jeffrey
