Suzanne is out today, so would you mind finding this document and having 
someone fax it to me?  I'll email my fax number to you.

Much Grass,

Kay

Hi.

There's a document in my O drive directory called kendallsale, or something 
close.  I can't remember where I put it - probably under General LOI.  Could 
you email it to me?

Thanks,

Kay
