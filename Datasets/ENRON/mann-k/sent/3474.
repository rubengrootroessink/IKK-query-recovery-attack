I'm sure Friday will work well.  It should be quiet at work since it will be 
Good Friday.

I know your pictures will be spectacular.

Kay, I just talked to Dan and told him we were both 
puny.  We have tentatively rescheduled for Friday.  How 
does that look for you?  He said to PLEASE hurry and get 
well. I feel so needed!

Oh, we went to Brenham and shot some bluebonnet pics 
yesterday.  I hope they come out good.  Linda Simmons 
has been requesting them for a while now.  Did you see 
the Masters golf tournament. Tiger won and it was 
exciting.  I never thought I would actually like 
watching golf.  

Get to feeling better!
