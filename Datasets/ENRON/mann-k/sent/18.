Kay,
Here is a version of a "letter agreement" we came up with (2 pages).
Perhaps we can use the same company ID's that we are using in the contracts
themselves.  I will double check with our legal/tax/finance folks [Bill, can
you comment on this?]
Regards,
Jeff Smith

Kay,
I'm still in the office.  I assume you need the addresses of the parties
involved with the MOU to include in the "letter agreement".  (So the GE
entity named therein can send the money back to the Enron entity named
therein.)
I do not have access to that document at this time.  I can get access on
Monday.  If you have other names and addresses in mind, let me know.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

Hi Jeff,

I'm preparing the letter agreement regarding payment.  Can you help me with
the name and address to use?

Thanks,

Kay
