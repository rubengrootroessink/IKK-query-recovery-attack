Sounds good.  I'm home with strep (mine and my son's), so I'll catch up

Subject: GE Change Orders

Kay:

I spoke to Chris earlier today and he told me there is a meeting today 
regarding GE change orders for the LM6Ks.  He agreed to send me a summary of 
what decisions were made so I can get change orders 3, 4 and possibly others 
done.
