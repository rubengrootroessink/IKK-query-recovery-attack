Sounds good to me.  I don't see why the buyer would need the redacted 
information, other than curiosity.

Presumably this will work?  Additionally, we should be able to apply this 
same model to Brownsville, though they didn't mention it.

Thoughts?

Mitch:

This E-mail is a follow-up to our telephone discussion today. With regard to
providing copies of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts to Allegheny,
Siemens Westinghouse proposes the following:

1.  Siemens Westinghouse will prepare and forward to Enron electronically
our standard confidentiality agreement addressed to Allegheny.

2.  Once the confidentiality agreement has been executed, Siemens
Westinghouse will forward the PDP files (we believe that these agreements
are executed) to Enron.  We will redact the pricing information and the
liquidated damages provisions. If the agreements are not signed, we will
provide the signature pages under separate cover.

If this is not satisfactory, please let me know.
