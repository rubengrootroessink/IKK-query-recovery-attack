This is Ben's invitation to you and Roger.  I'm going to tell Ben that 
because Carlos is starting Monday, that he said he could attend from 9:00 - 
10:30.

Good suggestion. I think we should invite Roger and Kay. Is Stuart still 
involved in our area?

Ben,  do you think you would want Kay, Stuart and/or Roger to attend any of 
the meeting on Friday?
