Hi there,

I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.

Here are some questions/comments:

I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =
=20
I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what=
=20
rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role o=
f=20
the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that=20
familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll wo=
rk=20
on it.=20

I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of "substantially=20
similiar" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.

Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.

I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
=20
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.

I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=
he=20
assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=
d=20
financials, but I didn't comment there.

I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20
own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added=20
"construct", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.

Enough explanation, here it is (with Word file attached below):



Except for as described in Section ___ [ next paragraph], neither Party sha=
ll=20
assign any or all of their duties or rights under this Contract without pri=
or=20
written consent from the other Party; such consent not to be unreasonably=
