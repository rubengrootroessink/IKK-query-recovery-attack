It is just too far out of your way.  I'll try to see if I can catch a ride 
somewhere.

Wow! If it's a limo don't tell Michael... So, I guess you would like a ride
to work on Thursday? I'm sure we can do that. NM

By the way, I was talking to my friend and colleague Rose, and she tells me
that the company has hired a car to take Rose, another person and me home
on Thursday after the big party.  Nice touch, huh?  We all live close to
each other.
