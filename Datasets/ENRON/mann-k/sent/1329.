He sound stressed as usual.  I told him you've been on a conference call and 
it looked like it was going to last a while.  He went into your voice mail.  
Do you want me to call him back and soothe his feathers.

I see Ben keeps calling me.  Any idea what's up?  I probably have another 30 
minutes on this call.
