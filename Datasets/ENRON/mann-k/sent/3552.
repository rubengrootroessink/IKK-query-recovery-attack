Thanks for writing - I deleted your message and then hopped on another 
conference call.  How about 330?

Subject: Conference Call


Kay:

Per my voice mail, Greg Lang wanted to schedule a call for 3:00 central time
today to raise something that the lenders brought up.  Please advise if you
are available, or if not, what time would be convenient later today.  Greg
says it should be a 15 minute call.  Thanks.
