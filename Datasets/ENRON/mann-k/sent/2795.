Carlos tells me that he has had difficulty forwarding emails, so I'm sending 
this along.

Ben:

Attached below are PSEG's comments on the Kendall [Plano] draft Purchase 
Agreement and their proposed 1 page Option Letter.

I have asked Carlos Sole (ENA legal) to review these documents and let me 
know if the form of the Letter is acceptable to ENA legal.  PSEG indicated to 
me this afternoon that they are prepared to deposit the $300K in an account 
designated by Enron.

I have scheduled a call with PSEG at 1:30 (Houston time) tomorrow to discuss 
the letter and their due diligence/legal comments.  My first priority is to 
execute the Letter if we are comfortable with the form.  I did notice on my 
first pass that the Letter did not include language on the $3 MM Purchase 
Price.

I have set a meeting with Carlos at 9:00 am (Houston time) to go over the 
Letter and PSEG's comments.  Let me know if you would like to tie in by phone 
for that meeting (this applies to all parties on the above distribution).

Fred
