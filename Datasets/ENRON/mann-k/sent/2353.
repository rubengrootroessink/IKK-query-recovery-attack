Sheila,

Here's the latest I have, but there may be another turn in the works.  I've 
asked Pete to send it to you, along with the GE.  I need to do an override 
letter to pick up the agency stuff as well.  I spoke with Lisa about that 
yesterday.

Peter--I'm attempting to get you a revised Exhibit A.  I'll confirm with Kay 
whether we need Jody Pierce as designated recipient of invoices, or whether 
we can have them sent to NEPCo so long as they go to Jody for payment.  There 
is no comma before the LLC after E-Next Generation. Is there any other info 
you need on the ABB breakout? We want to be able to execute it as soon as we 
get you this info.  Thanks.
 Al Larsen

These changes have been made.  To complete this agreement, we need (a) a
revised Exhibit A, (b)the response to the Don Hamond's question re.
Section 6.7.2 and (c) confirmation of whether it is "E-Next Generation,
L.L.C." or "E-Next Generation LLC".

Attached is an edited file for the ABB/Fountain Valley agreement. I have
removed and made revisions to several sections to make it specific to
the 3
units for Fountain Valley. Specific revisions include:

Exhibit B1
- Page 23, revise quantity from 6 to 3
- Pages 43 through 86, delete pages specific to other designs

As noted in the forwarded e-mail, the contact information in Sections
25.1
and 25.3 needs to be revised to replace Purchaser -

Question in Section 6.7.2 on Address for invoices - Is NEPCO the
intended
location for invoices?
