Here at Enron the lawyers generate risk memos in connection with 
transactions, summarizing the more important legal risks in a deal.  I've 
been taking notes along the way, but I will be asking you for your thoughts 
here shortly.  A discussion will be all I'm looking for at this time.

Thanks,

Kay
