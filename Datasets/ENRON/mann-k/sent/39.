Chris and Mike,

We are trying to do some sales tax planning, and need to know when the first 
LM 6000's will be ready to ship (or store, as the case may be).  I know there 
are projected dates in the purchase agreement, but those were more targets 
than commitment on the first few units.  Can you give the current status?

Thanks,

Kay
