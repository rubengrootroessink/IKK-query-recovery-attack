I can be there. Please let me know what time the meeting will begin. I
would like to fly down early that morning, if possible.

Hi Pete,

Would it be possible for you to be in Houston this Friday morning for
the
GE meeting?  It would be great to meet you in person, and have you
participate.  What is your availability?

Kay
