Kay:

Lee Johnson and John Ayres are going to meet Monday morning at 8:30 to go 
through all the technical information in the contract to confirm everything.  
They should get back to you very quickly with any changes.  I think the 
primary thing they are discussing is using a combined guarantee rather than 
single unit.

Thanks,
Brett
