Bill/Dale-

Lee Moore pointed out what he thought was an inconsistency in the definition
of Heat Rate in 1.41, relative to the rest of the document for Peformance
Testing (Exhibit F) and the concept of guarantees based on Adjusted
Electrical Output and Adjusted Heat Rate.  As a result, we redlined the
definition of 1.41 to be sure all understood that Heat Rate calculations for
the purpose of the Performance test would based on Output measured at the
generator terminals net of Unit auxiliary loads as measured during the test.

Hope this helps your reach agreement on the EPC side of things.

Regards,

Lee

Bill/Dale/Kay-

I've made redline edits with regards to LVCII performance guarantee values
in Section 10.7 for output and heat rate based on the Feb 8, 2001 guarantee
sheet.

Dale, please send revised LVC II facility agreement to reflect Units 25-28
with appropriate schedules for price, delivery, payment and termination
schedules at your earliest convenience.

The units 19-20 and 23-24 that are currently reflected in this document will
be left in E-Next (Turbopark).  The schedules for price, delivery, payment
will remain the same for these units.

Thanks,

Lee

Bill Williams asked me to forward the attached execution form of the
LM-6000 purchase contract.

The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  I
understand that we received it from GE, and that it is available only in
pdf format.

Thanks.
