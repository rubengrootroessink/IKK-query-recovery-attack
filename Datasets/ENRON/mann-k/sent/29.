matter; otherwise, I'm open.

Subject: Vitro termination agreement

I've made some changes, which I thought I would circulate internally for 
comment before sending to GE.  

I left Jeff Smith a voice mail asking how the initial payment is supposed to 
be split between the on and offshore contracts since this document references 
payments to both.  

Comments?

Kay
