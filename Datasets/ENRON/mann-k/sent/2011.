This may sound like a silly question, but why?  Is this something Ben wants 
Matt doing? 

1-4 are all the CO's I know about.

I'm out today, but we can discuss it tomorrow, and I can explain my point of 
view.

Kay

Kay

Have you had a chance to collect the following information for Matt Tezyk:

The free storage letter from GE
Any correspondence between GE and you relating to all 24 turbines
Any change orders in addition to #1-4
Documentation on any other deals we have made with GE

Please let me know if I can help with this.  If possible, I'd like to get 
this information to Matt some time early this week.

Regards,
Rebecca
