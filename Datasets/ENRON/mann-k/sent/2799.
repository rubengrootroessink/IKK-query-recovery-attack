As you know, Enron and Peoples jointly own enovate. Our group in Chicago is 
looking to manage some funds which belong to enovate. We had initially 
envisioned having a cash management policy which would outline how Enron 
would invest the funds, etc.  The other owner of enovate, Peoples, has 
proposed that we use the attached document in connection with this 
arrrangement.  This is taking me a little far afield of my area of expertise, 
so I'm writing you guys for input, direction, etc.

Suggestions? Gregg do you want to correct any of what I wrote?

Kay
