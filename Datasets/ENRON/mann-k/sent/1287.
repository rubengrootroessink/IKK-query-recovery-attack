Well, once again I'm messed up on my calendar.  I thought you were going to 
be in FW a couple more days.  Michael tried callling yesterday (I think it 
was yesterday), but of course we missed.

I think I'm in town this week (cross fingers).  I was home with Michael three 
days last week - we both had strep, but he was worse.  His fever didn't break 
for a couple of days, so I had to cancel my trip to San Antonio to join Neil 
at his officer's meeting.  I did make it to Georgetown, and had a nice time 
with Paige.  
We are hoping for cooler weather soon.  It is muggy!  

Tell Dad hi, and happy fishing.

Love,

Kay
