OK.  Friday was going to be really difficult for me anyway.

Fred:

I think it's premature to have legal on the line. If they have specific 
comments on the docs, they need to send them to us and we can quickly get 
back to them. If they want to have a commercial discussion, we can proceed 
without legal.

Thanks,

Ben

Subject: NRG Conference call - GE 7EA

Kay:

I spoke to NRG this morning.  They would like to arrange a conference call 
for Friday (most likely in the morning) to discuss the proposed transaction 
involving the GE 7EA.  Are you available to call in from New York?  If not, 
can Carolyn Campbell sit in for you on the call?

Let me know sometime today.  

Thanks,
Fred
