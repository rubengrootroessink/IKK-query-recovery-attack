We understand that the Letter Agreement is to be signed today, and attach
for your comments a form of ENA consent to collateral assignment of the
Letter Agreement and a form of legal opinion to be issued by in-house
counsel to ENA.  Both documents are conditions precedent to funding.

Kind regards
Isabel
