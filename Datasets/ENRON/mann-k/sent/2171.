You know me.  I don't care one way or the other.  Is there a reason why you 
want to skip it?

We don't have to go to FW for the rodeo.  I just thought that would be fun to 
do, and my mom wants Michael to come so badly.  We can always just go for a 
visit.  In fact, Michael and I can go alone some time.  

Like I said last night, you would make a great guide.  You'll be Michael's 
guide one of these days.
