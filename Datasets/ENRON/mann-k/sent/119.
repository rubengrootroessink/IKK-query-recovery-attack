Hi Kathy,

Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev. 6

Definitions.  I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and 
replace of business days for Business Days.

1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of 
performance test reports.  I think we need a definition that incorporates the 
tests listed on Exhibit E.

The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of 
the installation option when I did a search.

3.14.2.1  Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?  Does it matter?

4.3  Delete "Each".

5.1  The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option 
agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm 
interpretting it incorrectly.

5.3 (ii)  add "as provided in Section  5.5"

6.4  I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller 
would be charged interest if not timely paid.

10.7  Are the roman numerals correct?.

I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back 
option. You should have it today.

Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read 
before?  I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something.  

Thanks,

Kay
