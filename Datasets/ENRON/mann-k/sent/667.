I saw something on the intranet which says you can check all your benefits, 
etc , including vacation time.  It called for a password.  Did you receive a 
password for yours?  I wonder if it is the same as the password when you 
submit benefits.  Any ideas?

Becky, could you run a time off report so Kay can see how much vacation time 
she has left.  I don't believe I can do that for her.  You can just send it 
to me, or whatever is easier.  Thanks, Suz
