Hi Heather,

The confidentiality agreement signed by Enron/Vepco states as follows:

Except as required by law, neither party hereto nor their representatives 
will disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations 
are taking place between them not any terms, conditions or other fact with 
respect to any transaction that may be proposed or undertaken, including the 
status thereof.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------

We can loosen up the terms in the contract so that we can disclose certain 
terms to potential investors (I'll make that change), or we can discuss 
amending this agreement.  Additionally, it looks like we have the testimony 
and application filed with the Public Staff to work with.

Kay
