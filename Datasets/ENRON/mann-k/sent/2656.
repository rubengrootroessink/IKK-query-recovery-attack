Renee,

Question: Are the GE performance guarantees completely voided by the use of 
inlet chillers?  The first sentence in the first bullet point concerns me.

I'm not sure how the stuff included in the second series of bullet points 
fits in.  Are these changes in scope, suggestions, conditions?

I think we would be better off increasing the length of the change order to 
include the pertinent stuff, but not attaching the letter as a reference.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

Sorry about that.  I forgot I had the letter electronically, or I would have 
included it with the Change Order.  Please see the attachment below.

N-1 is the exhibit where the pricing is updated, so they would be different 
for CO1 and CO2.

Thanks

Opps.  I thought we were talking about the same CO.  Could you please send 
me  a copy (or electronic file) of the letter you are incorporating by 
reference?

This CO will need to be signed by Janet Dietrich, Managing Director.

Is the replacement N-1 the same as the replacement N-1 in CO #2?

I'll give this the final once over as soon as I get the letter.

Thanks (and sorry for the confusion),

Kay
