Nice try getting us to sign up for four more.  What a salesman!  I have made 
some changes to reflect the First Amended and Restated  Agreement in 
Principle.  Unless we hear back from you (call Steve) we will sign the 
attached. I am also corrected the dates in the first paragraph of Appendixs C 
to "April 4" . OK?

Sheila,

I had that same version, so I accepted changes and updated to reflect our
current agreement.

Thanks,

Lee
