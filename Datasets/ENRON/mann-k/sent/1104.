I leave tomorrow, and will be back on Thursday.

There's a bunch of food up here today.  You might want to make the trip up 
this way.

Well, that way the other three lawyers at Piper Rudnick can bill their time 
for reading the message and attachments.  By the way, Karen called me on 
Friday regarding the "missing items" on our Ledford and Fehr Option 
Agreements and says she will follow up on the acknowledgements and legal 
descriptions.  I have a feeling I will need to remind her every now and then.

When are you going out of town?

Kathleen

She makes me crazy the way she copies three lawyers in her firm eveytime she 
writes me. 

A pet peeve!
