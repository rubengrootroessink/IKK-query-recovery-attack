Folks,
We should not be making changes like this at this time.  This clause was
part of the document (terms & conditions) initialed a month ago.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

His issues need to be communicated directly to Jeffrey Smith at GE so
Jeffrey
Smith can tie in his tax advisors.  Please follow up with this as I am fully
occupied with Genpower for the next few days.   PS  I have asked Kay Mann to
lend a hand closing out the Consolidation Agreement too.

I tried to calling you on your phone, but it does not seem to bew working
right.
Jeff Blumenthal from tax has some final issues we need to discuss in section
5.2.4 of the contract and he will be sending an e-mail describing those
issues
later this morning.  That is the last remaining issue I am aware of before
we
can finalize and sign this contract, unless anything has poipped up the over
the
last couple days from GE. Can we meet this afternoon to arrange the signing
of
this contract with GE.
Please call me back at 3-9548 and let me know.

Thanks,

Steve
