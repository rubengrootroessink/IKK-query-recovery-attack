Is this the right account for Pegasus to send the money to?

Thanks,

Kay

Thanks.  It worked.  Carolyn let me know that y'all would like to fund by
this Wednesday.  I expect to have comments back to her by early Monday.  A
cursory glance through the blackline faxed to me shows that outside counsel
will most likely not be necessary.

Until later,
