I'm hearing rumblings about the need to perform various preliminary tasks 
(survey work, etc.).  I've given the admonition to avoid incurring hard costs 
until the financing/accounting treatment has come together.  That lead to the 
question of what is a hard cost.  I know construction/equipment obligations 
are problems, studies generally ok.  This leads me to the conclusion that a 
geotechnical survey would be ok.  Am I safe here?

Thanks,

Kay
