Please don't tell me that you've spent the last hour trying to think of that 
response because I certainly do like it.

Water is just as liquid as gas.  So to speak.

Doesn't say, other than go private.  So I guess that means, this first step 
is trying to ease whatever pain can be eased in the investment community that 
bought into Azurix since a drop from $19 to $7 is better than $19 to $4, and 
then Azurix will sell itself out of business (I told you about the calls from 
Argentine and Mexican counsel on wanting to represent potential buyers of 
Azurix assets in those countries).  I don't know about any other strategies, 
can you trade water?
