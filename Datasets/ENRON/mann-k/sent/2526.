FuelCell Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq: FCEL, news, msgs) and King County, Washingto=
n,=20
jointly announced the signing of an agreement to install a Direct FuelCell(=

(DFC(R)) power plant using municipal wastewater digester gas as the fuel.=
=20
FuelCell Energy was selected for the project through a competitive process=
=20
last July to install and operate a 1MW DFC power plant at the County's Sout=

al=20
Protection Agency (EPA). Total value of the contract is $18.8 million.=20
Operations are expected to commence during the third quarter of 2002.=20
"This megawatt-class commercial field trial of the DFC power plant represen=
ts=20
the first advanced wastewater digester project for FuelCell Energy", said=
=20
Jerry Leitman, president and CEO of FuelCell Energy. "This project will=20
demonstrate the versatility of fuel use with the Direct FuelCell, as well a=
s=20
its capability to produce more electricity than other technologies using th=
e=20
same quantity of fuel. With 500 municipal waste-water treatment systems in=
=20
the U.S., and a greater number of industrial wastewater treatment facilitie=
s=20
that produce sufficient gas to supply our fuel cell power plants, we=20
anticipate that generation of electricity at wastewater treatment plants wi=
ll=20
be a significant market for FuelCell Energy."=20
"This is cutting edge technology that will help King County turn a waste=20
byproduct into a valuable resource," said King County Executive Ron Sims.=

Department of Natural Resources for King County, said, "This is a very=20
exciting project for King County. We are able to use a renewable gas resour=
ce=20
product, in this case, a by-product of the wastewater treatment, to produce=

electricity to power our plant, and achieve a higher value in the process. =
We=20
acknowledge the vision of EPA in seeing that wastewater treatment plants ca=

contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas and air pollution=20
conventionally associated with electricity generation. We're pleased to pla=

benefits of producing power without combustion, thereby reducing air=20

Robert K. Bastian, senior environmental scientist for the EPA Office of=20
Wastewater Management, commented, "Once able to operate on a sustainable=20
basis, it appears that fuel cells have the potential to improve the=20
efficiency of energy recovery from digester gas, while greatly reducing air=

non-mechanical power generation process, has been proven to deliver cleaner=
,=20
more efficient power than that generated by conventional power plants.=20
About FuelCell Energy, Inc. (www.fuelcellenergy.com)=20
Danbury, Connecticut-based FuelCell Energy, Inc. is a world-recognized lead=
er=20
in the development and commercialization of high efficiency fuel cells for=
=20
electric power generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology=20
eliminates external fuel processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon=
=20
fuel. This results in a product whose cost, combined with high efficiency,=
=20
simplicity and reliability, offers significant product advantages for=20
stationary power generation. The Company has been developing DFC(R)=20
technology for stationary power plants with the U.S. Department of Energy=
=20
through the National Energy Technology Laboratory, whose advanced fuel cell=
=20
research program is focused on developing a new generation of high=20
performance fuel cells that can generate clean electricity at power station=
s=20
or in distributed locations near the customer, including hospitals, schools=
