Kay:

We have resent to your fax number.  Please let me know if you don't have them 
when you get in.  Please send my set of documents to G G Garcia.  She is 
located in 3AC2104 and she can forward them to me in Sao Paulo.

Thanks,
Brett

Hi Brett,

We haven't been able to locate it.  Could you resend?

Where should I send your set of docs?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

Were you able to find my faxed signatures?  Do you need originals?  Are you 
going to send out a complete set of the final documents?

Thanks,
Brett
