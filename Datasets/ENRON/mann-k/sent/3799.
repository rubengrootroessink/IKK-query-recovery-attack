Nope.

Christi Nicolay (a lawyer in the Reg Affairs) is the authority on 
interconnection as far as I'm concerned.

Carlos -

The documents attached to the ConEd message here are their draft Electric & 
Gas Cost Reimbursement Agreements.  They cover the costs of grid 
interconnection for any site we might develop in ConEd's territory.  
Apparently, Gary Keevil of East Coast Power has been handling discussions 
with ConEd to this point, but with East Coast Power out of the picture, I'm 
picking it up.

Kathleen has coached me on questions about these documents.  First, do we 
have a Confidentiality Agreement with ConEd that covers these power 
development project discussions?  She's going to ask Stephen Plauche of 
Origination about this, but I'm betting we don't have one.

Second, are these agreements "Turbo Park" compliant, and have we set up an 
LLC to deal with New York development projects yet?  I understand Herman 
Manus is the expert on this topic.

Finally, what are the legal sticking points in these documents?  ConEd has 
called an informational meeting for next Tuesday, May 1st, for these 
documents.  I'm planning to attend.  I'd like to know by then what we like 
and don't like about them, and how to approach possible changes.

I'll call you later this morning so we can discuss how to proceed.

Rick
