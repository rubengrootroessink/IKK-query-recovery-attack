Carolyn,

Your approach makes perfect sense to me, but I think Lee wants his turbine=

contract sooner.

I still haven't received the finance stuff yet.  I've asked again today.

Kay:

I have Lee Johnson's address information and will send the Turbine Contract
now.  (I had been holding this package waiting on signature pages from
Freshfields on all of the other GE documents that GE provided directly to
Freshfields, as I was going to include these documents in the GE package as
well).  =20

Carolyn,

GE is calling for the original turbine contract.  I believe I previously
provided Lee Johnson's address.  Could you send him an original?

Thanks,

Kay
