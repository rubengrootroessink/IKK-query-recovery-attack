Please print and put in the Fuel Cell binder you  made me last week.  It is 
on my desk, I think.

Kay, please read this memo...Because you will be working with the originators 
and will be the first lawyer to know when the condition of the orders is 
filled you are probably the right person to blow the whistle for the 13D 
filing...Let me know if you think otherwise
