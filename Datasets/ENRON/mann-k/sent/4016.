Hi John,

I left you a voice mail, but thought I'd try email as well.

The language that they added to paragraph 6 raises some issues since they 
want to restrict ENA and its affiliates from future potential transactions.  
Please call me at your convenience to discuss.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay/Kathleen

Please see Ameresco's attached markup of our 2-way CA.  If you would like a 
redline please let me know and I can see if they can send one.  We have a 
meeting next Tuesday and will need to begin to share info prior to that, so I 
would like to get this wrapped up as soon as possible.  Thanks so much for 
your help

Regards
John

John, 

Attached is a CA that Ameresco is prepared to sign.? Once Enron has reviewed, 
then I will send 2 signed CA's with one original returned to Ameresco.? The 
meeting is confirmed with Joe Murphy at Cabot.? I believe he will have one or 
more people attend the meeting and he has asked the names of persons that 
will be attending.? Please let me know who from Houston besides yourself will 
be at the meeting.? I also want to have a conference call with Gil or Dave 
plus yourself to discuss strategy prior to us getting together next week.
