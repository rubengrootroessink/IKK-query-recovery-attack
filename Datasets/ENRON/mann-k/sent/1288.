I may be able to back up Bart if he has a problem.  I have a conference call 
scheduled but it is likely to reschedule until later in the day.

I can attend the 9:00 am Pacific PSCo call. By copy hereof I'm requesting 
Karen let me know where I need to be/call in number. If I don't hear 
otherwise I'll be in my office at 11:00 am tomorrow Houston time.
