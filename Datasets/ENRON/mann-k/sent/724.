Hey there.

I don't think I've been fishing since July.  Geez, it is half way through 
September.

I'm in Chicago today (NYC yesterday).  A whirl wind tour.

I hear the Aquarium closed - killed by bike lanes.  Two weeks later the owner 
died.  We need to find a "new" dive.

Kay

Yeh-huh. I sent an e-mail. I will dredge up and resend. Been fishing lately?

I'm either losing my mind or my email.  Did you send me an email re GE?  I 
thought I saw one, but now I can't find it. Is that a trick, and if so, how 
do I do it?  

Could you resend it, please?

Thanks,

Kay
