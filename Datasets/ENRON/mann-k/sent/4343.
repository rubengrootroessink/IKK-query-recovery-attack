Thanks for your support.  We checked into the matching, but unfortunately 
since the group raising this money was not formed as a Charitable 
Organization under the tax reg's, the ability to get Enron to match is not 
availible.  The goal of each golfer is to raise at least $1000 towards the 
$150K goal, and your donation puts me over the $1K bar.

Thanks again.

Fred

I can't open the form, but I'm good for $50.  Is this something Enron can 
match?

Enron Golfers:

Hey guys, Sarah Edwards is a friend of a friend's daughter who desperately 
needs help to stay alive and all you duffers out there can help:

The 100 holes for golf for Sarah Edwards will be Monday June 4 at
Sweetwater CC. Sarah needs a lung transplant and
approximately $150,000 of the costs are not covered by insurance or
medicaid.  

For more info on Sarah, visit Sarahssoldiers.com 

Here is how the 100 holes for golf works:

*Free golf at Sweetwater
*You play as many holes as you can (100 is not mandatory)
* We provide your lunch, drinks and snacks
* You get pledges from your friends to play
*pledges may be flat amounts, per hole, per birdie or per eagle

Lets all keep Sarah alive! Can I get some other tentative commitments?

thanks!

Steve
