So what do you think the News will make out of this?

I guess you decided to skip the game...I'll call Paige and I will pick up
Michael since she's taking him to Sharon's tomorrow. NM

Subject:  Skeletal Remains Found on Nolan Ryan's Ranch

FYI - My daughter just called to tell me that their seismic company just
found a body (skeletal remains) on Nolan Ryan's bull ranch China Grove
(don't know if that is a town or the name of the ranch), off of County Road
521.  Ryan is just the tenant, the property belongs to Claude Hammel.
