Subject: Spring Break

Mom,

I don't remember if I told you I will be home for spring break. Danielle
wants us to go somewhere on our way home (she says Schlitterbahn, but I'm
thinking it'll be coooooold!). So I could be home as early as Friday.
Ashley has mentioned possibly going to her river house maybe on Thursday,
but no matter what, I'll be home for a good chunk of spring break. Just
thought I'd fill you in! Have a great rest of the trip.

Love,

Paige
