I believe it is the E-Next Generation LV Co Gen contract.  I believe the last 
draft was around the beginning of April.  I can check for more specifics.

Dear Kay and Dale,
 Peter Thompson is on vacation and has asked me to make the
attached changes (sent to Peter by Dale).  They are very
straight-forward and will only take a minute.  However, there are a
couple of contracts to which the changes could potentially apply, and
I'd like to make sure I've got the right one before I start making
changes.  Please let me know which contract needs to be changed, and
I'll take care of the rest.  Thank you, Chris

I'm not sure the status of these agreements and the ability or
appropriateness to incorporate changes. But, here's he input for
consideration.

Please consider the attached comments in your final
negotiations with GE and ABB. Hopefully this format
is more user friendly than the whole pile. These are
Lauren/DHEC understanding of requirements to conform
with EPC contract.  Bill Phillips

Bill,

In reviewing these documents we find that these changes were not
incorporated.  Could you please make certain they are included.

Thanks

Paul
