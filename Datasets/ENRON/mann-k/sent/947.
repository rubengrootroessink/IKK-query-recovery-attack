Folks:

I would like to have Chris Calger execute Change Order #2 since it pertains 
to one of his projects. Is he an authorized signatory under the agency 
agreement?

Regards,

Ben

Kay,

Please find attached Change Orders 2 and 3 in which I have removed the dual 
fuel option as discussed with Lee Johnson and Ben Jacoby in our meeting last 
Friday.  Please let me know if you need anything additional.

Chris
