I appreciate the heads up -  I'll try to chase down the fax (it hasn't been 
delivered yet).  Can you email me the blacklines just in case?  

Thanks,

Kay

Kay: 
Just to clarify.  The "blacklined changes" in the fax I sent to you come
directly from the document that you sent to us yesterday.  We will let you
know as soon as we hear anything further.  

Thanks, Karen
