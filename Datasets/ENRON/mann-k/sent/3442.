Hello there,

Here's the LV Co Gen break out contract with the assortment of turbines, 
including the 3 turbines from the new order.  I haven't quite figured out the 
route, but I think this is the correct destination.

Due to the Delta schedule, it would be very helpful to get closure on this 
form by April 10th.

Kay

 Attached please find the latest LV Cogen Turbine Agreement
(second document below), as well as a blackline (first document below)
showing changes made to the March 27 version. I have included Lee's
changes to the performance values in Sections 10.7 and 10.8  In addition
I have made changes to the Maximum Liability, Unit Liability and
Purchase Amounts and payment schedule. For the Guaranteed Delivery
dates, I have used the Ready to Ship Dates contained in the Agreement in
Principle.  To complete the agreement, we will need to insert the date
of execution and Exhibit H-2.
