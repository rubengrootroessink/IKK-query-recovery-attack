Will do!  I KNOW it's not a vacation day my dear!  Jacoby has called me I 
don't know how many times asking for your numbers.  I need a drink!  It's 
been one busy day for me too!

Could you PLEASE PLEASE call David Marshall and get his email?  I'm on 
endless conference calls and need to contact him about a matter.

Thanks,

Kay

PS, not a vacation day
