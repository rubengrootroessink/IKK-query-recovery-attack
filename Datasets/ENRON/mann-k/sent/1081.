We don't need her if we aren't going to discuss the loan.

Have you heard from Sara?  I was under the impression that she is out of town 
this week.  Guess I could walk over there and look.

I don't think we need Heather for this conversation.  The goal is to finish 
the necessary templates, namely ISDA and guarantees, and determine a process 
for negotiating with third parties going forward.  What do you think?

Is this something I should have Heather Brown participate in?
