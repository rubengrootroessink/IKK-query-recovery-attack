Jerry,

Would you mind re-sending?  I can't find it on my system anywhere.  I did 
find the signature page sent 4/20.

Many thanks,

Kay

Hi Jerry,

Do we have a final, execution version of the letter agreement?

I understand that Enron's tax folks are ok with the suggested changes to
the LLC agreement.

We are working with GE to get the change orders executed.

Thanks,

Kay
