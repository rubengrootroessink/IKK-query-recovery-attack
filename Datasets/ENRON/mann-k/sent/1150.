Hello Kay,

Steve Plauche asked me to send you a copy of the current agreement with ENA
cited in the work order request for the Connecticut project.  You will note
the agreement expires at the end of this month.  Please fax the signed work
order to my attention at 978 266-4098 today as Steve has directed us to
begin work immediately and attend a meeting tomorrow.  Also, it would be a
great help if you could provide a letter extending the term of the agreement
to October 2001.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Joe Curreri
