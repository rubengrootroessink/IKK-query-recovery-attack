Ok.  My hubby tells me the tickets you want are available, and he'll put your 
name on them, so to speak.

Kay,

If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack) I 
would like to purchase those.

Do you mind checking to see if you have 2 tickets for March 1 (Def Leppard), 
if you do I would like to purchase those also.

Just let me know.

Thanks so much!
