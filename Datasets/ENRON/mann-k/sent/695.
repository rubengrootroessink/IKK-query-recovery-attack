Hi there.

I changed our SF appointment to 900 on Friday.

We have not been successful in getting a hotel room anywhere close to where 
we are going.  There is some big fashion convention in NY, and the rooms are 
booked as far away as Danbury, Connecticut.  Wild, isn't it?  Heather says 
there is a chance that we will fly out tomorrow, spend tomorrow night in NY, 
then I can fly to Chicago Thursday am.  I still plan on flying back on 
Thursday pm so that I can make that 900 appointment.  That may mean taking 
the midnight flight, but what the heck.

I'll keep you posted. 

Kay
