Well, I told Michael that Bronco could ride in the wagon, so I guess he needs 
a wagon big enough for Bronco!

Hi there,

I'm thinking of working out after work - hopefully kind of early.  Ok with
you?  I should still be home before 730.

Michael took Bronco to school.  I'm sure he will have him at the CC.

Kay
