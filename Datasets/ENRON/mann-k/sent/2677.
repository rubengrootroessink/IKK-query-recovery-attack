Lee just called, and he is here, so if you haven't called him yet, please 
don't.

Please call Lee Johnson and tell him that one of our development lawyers, 
Roger Balog, would like 2 tickets for Friday.  I hear Ben wants a ticket for 
Thursday, but I assume he communicated that to Lee.  Thank him for me, but I 
have my closing dinner tomorrow, and no sitter Friday.

Thanks,
