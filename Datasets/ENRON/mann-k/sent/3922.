Kay, have these issues been incorporated into the ILA?

Instinctively it seems that the agent for concept would be stronger.  I'll 
check into it for the  longer term deal.  Obviously, it is a Mississippi law 
issue, so I'll have to get an opinion.

The following are my comments:

  - I assume that Settlements is fine with invoicing no later than the 7 th 
of each mth.
  - Section M:  Should we go this route (covenant of financial support) or 
would we be accomplishing the same if we structure this as MDEA, agent for 
..., similar to that in the Interconnection Agmt.  We should probably look 
into it further for the longer term deal.  I don't know which has the 
stronger fall back to the municipalities.

Have a good rest of the weekend.

Here's where I am on the ILA.  I think it should be distributed internally 
and to the Cities ASAP,  with an explanation that we are still pondering it.
