Kay--I did not get a copy of the interconnection agreement and will ask for 
it to be emailed to me, but if you have it electronically,please send it to 
me in the meantime.  Thanks.

Nancy,

Thanks for the wonderful turn around time!

I glanced through the interconnect.  It includes arbitration (poor Dutch)
and equipment outage as force majeure.  Gee, what's good for the goose
should be good for the gander.

Talk to you soon,

Kay
