Nope.  Carlos Sole (one of our lawyers) took the forms I gave him and fit it 
to this deal.  I do think the banks' lawyers weighed in.

Hi there,

Here's the assignment and assumption agreement with the GE consent
included.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

Thanks,

PS.  In discussing the mechanism to move the turbines, it seemed that it
would work ok to assign the turbines out of the AIP.  I can't find a flaw
with that approach.
