Please see if there is any way we can have it in the same elevator bank.  I 
will ask to have it on 29, so you won't need to check there.

Hope you've had a great weekend.  The weather was PERFECT!!!!

Kay

How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO interconnection 
agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19?

I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm.

Details to follow...

Thanks,

Kay
