It doesn't need to be a VP.  It was a function previously performed by EECC 
contracts people.  Ben initialled on the Intergen form, and John Ayers (I 
think a develop engineer) initialled for ESA.

I'm off on a day of vacation this am (the Enron kind), so I picked up email 
early.

If you need a VP , Jake Thomas.  Otherwise, Jeff Slaughter.  FYI, I'm getting 
the "disconnect" on the heat rate guarantee evaluated this morning.  You 
certainly are up early this morning..
