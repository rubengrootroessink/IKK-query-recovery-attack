Well, I believe I'll bring something cool, comfortable, and casual.  Or, 
maybe jeans.  I don't have a very large selection, since most of my clothes 
are either work clothes or beyond casual (yard stuff).  I have a couple of 
Hawaiian shirts, so I'll probaly pick one of  those.  Neil will wear shorts 
and probably a Hawaiian shirt, since that is what he almost always wears when 
he isn't working!

What do you want to do about lunch tomorrow?  I can bring something, or we 
can just tell Mom we ate on the way.  You know how she frets about such 
things.  Or, we could pick up Sonic if someone is hungry.  We'll have some 
type  of snacks for Michael, I guess, since he's at the age where he eats 
constantly.

HMMMM.  More to think about!

WOW!

Who would have thought that you could get food like this in Palacios??????
It sounds delicious. What are you guys bringing to wear to dinner? I was
thinking nice shorts or something like that?

Cake's in the oven. I think Bobby has a computer working for the Pink House.
I think we will be ready to go in the morning.

I'll call you when we leave.
