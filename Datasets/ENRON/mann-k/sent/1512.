I guess the ESA lawyers have decided that this is not the time to outsource 
project work!

We are to the point where we need Ben to help pull the technical and 
financial details together.  I'll see what I can do to get his attention.  

Dan is still in the midst of his health issues, so he is fasting in 
anticipation of a 230 physical.  Roger Balog brought a pumpkin cheesecake 
which was delicious, and one of clerks made the best collard greens I had 
ever had.  I am miserable - which means I ate a lot more than greens and a 
piece of cheese cake.

Lisa Alfaro has transferred all of her responsibility for Electrobolt to John 
Novak?  Bless you if you could get the breakout contract done.  I would 
really appreciate it since I'm spanning both coasts and multideals.  Sorry I 
had to miss lunch.  Did Dan bake his blueberry or cranberry bread?
