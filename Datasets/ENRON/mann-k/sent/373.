Subject: Land option New York

I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.  Do we have a 
company for New York yet?  If not, I seem to recall that we were going to 
start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of 
creating a new one every time.  Am I remembering that correctly?  

Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.  Any 
suggestions?

Thanks,

Kay
