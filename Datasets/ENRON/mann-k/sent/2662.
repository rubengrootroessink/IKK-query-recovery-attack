As a follow up to my previous e-mail, here is the second request, which was 
in my opinion adequately addressed by John Schwartzenburg.  
I am frustrated with beginning the process over again.

Subject: Cost plus contract for Co Op City

Gentlemen,

As Dave and John know, I'm working on a deal for ENA (and with Jude) which 
has as one aspect a cost plus EPC contract for the construction of a power 
plant.  We need to put together the T's and C's for a cost plus contract, and 
since it is possible that NEPCO might be the contractor, I wanted to use 
something that is acceptable to NEPCO.  I will then take the laboring oar in 
order to get a working draft prepared for this project.

As always, I'm on a short time frame, so your response would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay
