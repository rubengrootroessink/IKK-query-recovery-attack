Karen,

As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions.  I will add 
that I think that it is the City which  has preserved its option as to who 
repairs the road since they have approval authority.  However, this doesn't 
seem like a big issue to me.

So long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk 
profile, I'm happy.

Kay
