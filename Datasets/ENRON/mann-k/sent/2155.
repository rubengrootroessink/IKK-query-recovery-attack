Hi guys,

Here's a suggested revision to the invoicing language.

Lee, I've asked the question about the other invoices.  If we don't get an 
immediate answer, I think you can send the invoices to Ben, and we can 
process them here.  I'm always happy to volunteer Ben.  By the way, I haven't 
given Ben his signing party favor, as he hasn't been in Houston since we last 
met.
