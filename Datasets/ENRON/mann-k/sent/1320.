Let me tell, that is one 225 pound pitiful soul when he is sick.  He has a 
head cold, so he is going home to go to  bed.  He will sigh and  moan, and 
carry on like you wouldn't believe.  He will be incapable of discussing 
anything other than how he feels.

Kay, I told him the meeting was at 3:30 and that you would be calling him.  
He also wanted Sara Wesner on the call x35261.  I also told her you would 
call her.
