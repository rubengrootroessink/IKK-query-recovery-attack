Yes, the stabilizer definitely belongs in the contract.  It has been included 
in our price to Delta.

Steve,
I know that we specifically included the stabilizer in the Salmon deal.  
Please confirm that it belongs there so that we can finish up the break out 
contract.

Thanks,

Kay

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).
