A call works.  It will be the Enron commercial lead (Ben Jacoby), Stuart 
Zisman, the GE commercial lead and the GE lawyer.  It is about the contract 
he prepared (although now I wonder).  If he prefers to have whoever will be 
doing the drafting, that's fine, too.

Paul called me back and said he is available for about an hour at 3pm 
tomorrow.  He wanted to know who would be on the call and what it is about.  
He said he needed to prepare for the meeting.  He hasn't read the contract, 
so if it's regarding same, he needs to know.  Let me know and I'll call him.  
Do you prefer his presence or would a call work?
