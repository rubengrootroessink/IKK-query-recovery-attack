FuelCell Energy Signs First North American Distribution Agreement With PPL 
EnergyPlus

Strategic Distribution Alliance to Advance Sales of Fuel Cell Products for 
Distributed Generation Market

DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 21, 2000-- FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
(NASDAQ: FCEL - news) has selected PPL EnergyPlus, LLC, a subsidiary of PPL 
Corp. (NYSE: PPL - news), as the first North American distributor of its 
Direct FuelCell(TM)(DFCc) products for the distributed generation market. The 
agreement facilitates commercialization of FuelCell Energy's DFCc products, 
which will be available for submegawatt commercial orders in the second half 
of 2001, and megawatt commercial orders in 2002. In addition, PPL has made an 
equity investment of approximately $10 million, or about one per cent of 
FuelCell Energy's equity and will order 1.25 megawatts of commercial field 
trial units in the next six months. 

In announcing the strategic alliance between the two firms, Jerry Leitman, 
president and CEO of FuelCell Energy, said, ``We're delighted to have PPL, a 
leading supplier of competitively priced electricity and energy services in 
the mid-Atlantic region, as our first distribution partner in North America. 
PPL is a successful company, with a solid growth strategy, and is highly 
qualified to penetrate the market for distributed generation solutions, 
through their energy marketing and services arm, PPL EnergyPlus. This 
agreement is the latest milestone attained in bringing our products to the 
stationary power marketplace.'' 

The DFCc power plant is especially well suited for a variety of distributed 
generation applications, including high reliability and power quality, 
cogeneration, opportunity fuels, environmental compliance and grid 
congestion. PPL is targeting customers with these applications, including 
schools, hospitals, water treatment plants, office buildings and data 
centers. 

``We see enormous potential for this segment of our business,'' said William 
F. Hecht, PPL chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``As an 
innovative energy company, with a strong record of anticipating and meeting 
customer needs, this agreement is a natural step for PPL.'' 

For the initial order of 1.25 megawatts, FuelCell Energy will provide PPL 
with DFCc power plant engineering and operations experience. FuelCell Energy 
will manufacture the DFCc plants for the program and provide interface 
requirements. PPL will provide comprehensive power plant operations and 
maintenance (O&M) management services for the field trial power plants 
procured and/or sold by PPL. 

Using carbonate technology, FuelCell Energy Direct FuelCell(TM) power plants 
have nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW. The DFCc produces high 
efficiency energy through a chemical reaction, rather than through 
combustion, resulting in competitively priced electricity, with virtually no 
pollution. This revolutionary method of producing power gives energy users 
the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of 
environmental compliance, less noise and with shorter timeframes required for 
the permitting process.
