Subject: ComEd PPA - Plano

Attached is the latest version of the draft term sheet sent out last Friday.  
It incorporates the comments of Greg Penmann.  I have also filled in some of 
the blanks on the following issues:
 1.  Delay LD ($ amounts and caps)
 2.  Availability %'s, penalties & bonuses ($ amounts and caps)
 3.  ComEd schedule change limitations
 4.  Project Update section - removal of Event of Default language
 5.  Early completion bonus ($ amount and cap)

Please review this ComEd term sheet and forward me any additional comments.

I am forwarding a copy of this term sheet to Kay Mann for her review.  I left 
her a voicemail letting her know that this term sheet format was developed 
earlier this year with legal input from Stuart Zisman.

I would like to be a position to send this term sheet to ComEd sometime 
tomorrow (8/29).  

This document should also serve as a template for the term sheet which I will 
be preparing to send to the wholesale energy group at Wisconsin Electric 
regarding a PPA from the Plano site.  I would like to have that document 
ready by Wednesday-Thursday of this week.  I will send you the first version 
of this WEPCO document either later today or tomorrow morning.

Call/see me to discuss any of this information.

Fred
