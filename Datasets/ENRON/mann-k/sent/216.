Matt,

Please see if you can chase down the executed version of the first document.  
Lou Stoler may know something.  You can also check with David Tucker at 
Bracewell.

Thanks,

Kay

PS Did you ever figure out how original documents are handled around here?

Kay:  I don't have an executed Peoples Energy Resources.  I have a draft from 
12/21/99 - perhaps it's out there signed somewhere - relating to "possible 
joint energy generation projects".

I have an executed Peoples Energy Services Corporation agreement dated 
7/19/99 for two years re "Discussion re exploration of certain opportunities 
for assisting People's upstream load requirements for electric energy and, to 
the extent permitted by and consistent with PESC's existing contractual 
commitments with other parties, natural gas, that may result in transactions 
between ECT and PESC"

and an agreement with Peoples Energy Corporation that expired July 6, 2000 re 
"proposed asset alliance involving The Peoples Gas LIght and Coke Company and 
North Shore Gas Company".

Let me know if you would like to see any or all of these.

Kay

Good morning.

I'm looking for a confidentiality agreement between ENA and Peoples Energy 
Resources on or around Nov. 23, 1999.  Can either of you help me?

Thanks,

Kay
