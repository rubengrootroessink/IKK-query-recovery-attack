I suspect that it wasn't recorded.  My bad.

Kay,

I don't have a copy of the Memorandum (or even an executed copy of the 
Option).  The Memorandum of Option would have been the document that would 
have been recorded in Edgecombe County and it may be that we used outside 
counsel to record it.  I will root around Keenan's files to see if he has a 
copy.

K-

I'm not at the office today, but I probably have a copy of the Option.  I 
don't recognize the Memorandum of Option to Purchase.  Do you have a copy of 
it to see if it gets my memory working?

Subject: North Carolina - Edgecombe County

I am trying to find: (i) an executed copy of the Option to Purchase Real 
Estate; and (ii) recorded copy of the Memorandum of Option to Purchase Real 
Estate in connection with the Edgecombe County NC property (between North 
Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency and Tarheel Land Development Company, 
L.L.C.).  The option extension is due at the end of the month and I would 
like to get the extension documents ready.

Do either of you have copies of these documents?

Thanks - 
Kathleen
