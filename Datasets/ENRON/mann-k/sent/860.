Hi Gregg,

I was out of the office on Friday, so I just now heard your voice mail.  I 
haven't been through all my email, but I haven't seen anything from Stephanie 
on email.  I do have a hard copy version which is too long to fax with 
confidence.  I'll give the forms a look, and fax them your way with some type 
of disclaimer for Peoples benefit.

Kay

Kay - Can I get these documents from you to forward to Peoples or are there 
other concerns?  

Thanks,

Gregg

Gregg -

I have provided Kay Mann with forms for the Schedule to the ISDA Master 
Agreement and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex for both US 
corporations and municipalities.

Stephanie
