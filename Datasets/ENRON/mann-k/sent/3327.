I would guess "yes".  I don't know that I like the idea either.

Subject: Montana Power

Kay,

Montana Power has been talking to the Westinghouse sales rep in MT and has 
asked SW to let Lynn DeKrey participate in a telephone call with MT Power, 
Enron and SW.  I told him I don't want to go there now.  My question is has 
MT Power violated their CA with us by talking to the SW rep in MT?

Chris
