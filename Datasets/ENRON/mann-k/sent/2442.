I think I'm going to be in NYC tomorrow, otherwise I'd say  your place.  I'll 
find out what Neil thinks.

Thanks,

   Sounds fine.  It's on my book.  Tomorrow, do you want me to take him
home or to my apartment.  I promised him something fun.

Hi Charlotte,

We've been invited to someone's house for dinner on Feb 2.  Can you take
care of Michael?  The dinner is in River Oaks, so we could just drop him
off.

Michael  got a hair cut this weekend.  I think it makes him look taller.  I
wish it worked that way for me!  It is very short, and I think very cute.

Kay
