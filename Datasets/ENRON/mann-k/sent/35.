Subject: West LB affiliate registration in Texas for the LM6000 turbine deal

I have spoken to Matt Gockerman in Tax who's comfortable with West LB 
creating a presence in Texas through a partnership owned by Delaware LLCs in 
order to register with the Comptroller prior to receipt of the LM6000 
turbines (which is estimated to be 6/20). Matt will provide the necessary 
forms to West LB/Winston and will coordinate with them for timely completion. 

West LB will be putting together a closing check list for this to occur, 
including registration forms, ADA assignment agreement and West LB guaranty, 
etc. Kay and Rob, can I ask you to coordinate what if anything needs to be on 
the list from the commercial side beside the assignment under LM6000 turbine 
purchase agreement.  We'll schedule a call in the next few days to coordinate 
with Winston and West LB on this matter.

Thanks,
Matt
