Hi Elizabeth,

I've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset 
management type deals, optimizing third parties' power assets and/or 
purchase/sale of commodities.  A little birdie told me that you worked on 
something somewhat similiar to that a while back, but the deal didn't go.  
When you have a minute I would appreciate hearing about what you did.

Thanks,

Kay
