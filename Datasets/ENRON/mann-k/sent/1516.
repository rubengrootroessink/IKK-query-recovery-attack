It's time to renew the season tickets for the Astros.  There are 81 home
games next season and the cost for the four seats is $9,628, or $118.86 per
game.  The location of the seats is as last year.

Let me know how many games you're in for.  I'll need checks payable to the
Houston Astros by December 15.

Thanks!
