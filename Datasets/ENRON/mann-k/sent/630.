Subject: Conference Call this afternoon

Kay-- If I am stealing your thunder, I apologize.


I have scheduled the Conference Call for 1:30pm.  I expect that it will take 
about an hour.

We are primarily discussing issues regarding our amendments to the 
application.  Specifically, we want to confirm an amendment regarding the 
layout of the plant.  Second, we want to confirm the LLC, and its appropriate 
papers. Third, we want to talk generally about the Wednesday Conference Call 
with the public staff and establish a game plan for handling possible 
problems.

The Enron site will be the 48th floor at 48C2.  The Conference Call number 
is: 1-800-998-2462.  The Pincode is 4579474.

If you have any questions. Let me know.

Thank you.

Tom Chapman
