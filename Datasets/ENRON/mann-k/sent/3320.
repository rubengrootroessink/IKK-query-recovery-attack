Have I written you back yet?  It is such a zoo, I can't remember.  I've 
started this email 3 times.

I'm going to the Astros game on Thursday in the Diamond seats.  I'll watch 
for Ric.  Both Neil and I will be there.  I love those seats.  That's where 
I'm sitting on opening day, also.  I'm sure you will be at a game soon.  
Remember how nice it was this time last year for those first games?  It is no 
nice with the roof open. How many games do you have tickets to this year?

They have James Coney Island outside today.  I ate most of two hot dogs.  I 
bet I'll be sleepy soon.  I brought them back up here, so my office will 
probably still smell like chili when  you come back.  

Guess I'd better get back to work.  Rest up and get well.  

Kay

Things must be busy since I didn't hear from anyone 
yesterday.  Ric is going to the Rockets game on Tuesday 
with vendors and the Astros Diamond Seats with vendors 
on Thursday.  I was wondering if you could come over and 
visit after work next Thursday.  We could have drinks 
and visit.  That way I wouldn't be all alone!!!

Ruthie's surgery went well, but she isn't feeling very 
good.  She's throwing up from the pain meds I think.  We 
haven't given her any more, but you can see her cringing 
as she breathes.  Bless her heart, I know how she feels.

Well, you won't be moving until I get back, so it'll be 
interesting to see what happens.  I wonder if you'll get 
a promotion.  I bet women problems won't even phase Ben, 
but maybe, we can always hope!  Usually you say female 
problems, and the men run the opposite direction.

I just got finished paying bills!  Boy, do I have a lot 
of them!

I'm anxious to be able to go to the Astros game.  We 
have tickets for this coming weekend but I won't be able 
to go.  I can't remember when our next regular season 
tickets are since I don't have my calendar in front of 
me.

I'm going to venture out to get my nails done today 
(drive).  I feel pretty good, so it should be ok.  I'm 
sure I am going to be SO READY to come back to work.  
I'm so glad I have email so I can keep in touch every 
day so I won't miss you TOO much!

Tell Neil I miss his calls too!  Walking around downtown 
sounds like fun.  It'll be like in New Orleans.  We just 
go from bar to bar, restaurant to restaurant.  

Did Carlos' wife ever have her baby?  When is the 
seminar in Newport Beach.  Can I come with you to assist 
you?????????

Take care!  Miss you!
