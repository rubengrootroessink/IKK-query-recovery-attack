Sorry for the inconvenience.  Ozzie had to leave town, and he wanted to 
participate in the first meeting. I'm sure we will get something worked out.

Kay--as indicated in my voicemail, I will definitely be out of pocket on 
Wednesday.  The meeting is supposed to go into Thursday and I fly back Thurs 
eve, but it is possible that it would finish up early enough on Thursday that 
I could schedule a call for Thursday afternoon.  I'll call you later.

Due to a last minute conflict, we need to reschedule this meeting.  How
does everybody look for Wednesday?

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Kay
