I'm getting ready to take Michael to the pediatrician, so it depends on how 
long that takes.

I'll find the instructions and email them to you.

If I'm not on there but Kent is, could you let him know I really need to talk 
to hiim?

Thanks

Kay

Good Morning!  I would rather that we not change the time of the GE call 
since I have Lisa, Dean and Ben sort of primed for it.  Will Scott and Rose 
be joining you?  I don't think it will take more than 20 minutes.  Would you 
please email me the dial in instructions and let me know whether you will be 
on the call?
