Kay:

E-mail delivery sounds fine.  Per the letter agreement, we need to submit
the final form of the Turbine Contract and a blacklined version of same
reflecting changes from the form attached to the letter agreement.   I have
assumed that the version to be attached to the letter agreement is the
version #3 that you sent by e-mail on April 3 @12:45 to Greg Lang et al., a=
s
I believe this was the last draft circulated prior to execution of the
letter agreement.

Would you prefer to send these documents to Greg directly or would you like
for me to handle this?  It appears that the blackline attached to this
e-mail is the appropriate blackline (comparison of version 3 to version 4),
so please confirm and let me know if you would like me to send those
documents along to Greg.  Our transmittal will officially reference that
"pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Letter Agreement, we have enclosed...."

Please advise as to handling.  Thanks.

I've reviewed the agreement and we are back in "sync".  Unless Kent has
anything to add, we're good to go on this end.

Attached please find the latest Salmon Energy Turbine Agreement (second

changes made to the version circulated on April 2.  This version
contains Lee's changes to Exhibits A, A-1, B and B-1.  No changes were
made to the Maximum Liability Amount, Purchase Amount or Unit Liability
Amount. Power System Stabilizers are included in the scope.  To complete
