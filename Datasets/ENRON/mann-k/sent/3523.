I have a 300 meeting, so I'm sending this as is so that David can print a 
copy.  I have not yet integrated all of his changes, although I have dealt 
with the profit/savings and QSE.

Is the scope of scheduling services in the exhibit the same as the Scheduling 
(aka QSE) stuff?  

Later,

Kay

ps Reagan has the latest exhibits.
