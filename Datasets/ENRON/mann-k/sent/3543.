Hi Wilson,

I haven't forgotten you, I just got tied up.  

This is a very preliminary draft, but thought you should take a look at it.  
I don't need a detailed analysis, I just want you to have it so that we can 
discuss the impact of Mississippi law.

I am specifically interested in discussing the following:

waivers of consequential damages, limitations of liability

legal status of MDEA (I'll send you the info of what I have)

dispute resolution and jurisdiction

restrictions on confidentiality restrictions

any other aspects of the agreement impacted by Mississippi law

I don't need any memos, just a discussion.

Thanks,

Kay

that Enron is still working on them.

Thanks,
