Fred,

If we have the same purchaser for both, it would be a lot easier to agree to 
the form, then duplicate it.  Do you see any problem with this? I will have 
to have the electronic form emailed to me, then I can make the changes.  I 
brought the hard copy, but I don't have access to the electronic form. Have 
they indicated if they want to go forward with this, or are they still 
kicking tires?  I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's 
most important, especially since I'm on the road.  Do we want to continue 
marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination?  
I don't think 3 weeks would be a problem after signing.  No TurboPark!!!

On the issue of the conference call Friday, I have a meeting with the 
customer which starts in the am, then I'm on the road.  Monday would be 1000 
times better, if this is at all possible.  In that won't work, I will have 
more details about timing of my Friday meeting tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay
