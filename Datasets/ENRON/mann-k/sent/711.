Ben,

We have a draft of the VEPCO "standard" interconnect, which has been 
internally reviewed by Mitch Robinson and Christi Nicolay.  Would you like a 
copy? Nancy Wodka (Bracewell & Patterson, DC office) is outside counsel 
working on it as well.  We have had no substantive discussions with VEPCO 
about this agreement at all.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Thanks,

Kay

Ben,

I spoke with the VA Power contact today who is responsible for the 
interconnection agreement.  His name is Wayne Duman (804.257.4096, 
Wayne_Duman@dom.com).  

He suggested e-mailing him dates when Enron was available to go to Richmond 
to discuss the interconnect.  I don't know if you want to go or if you plan 
on sending one of the developers, but will you schedule this meeting (since I 
won't be negotiating this part of it).

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any problems.

Heather
