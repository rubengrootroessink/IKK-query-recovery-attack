GE is asking for invoicing instructions for equipment currently in TP.  I 
don't recall that being addressed in the documents they signed, and  I didn't 
see an obvious answer in the documents I reviewed.  Any problem with Ben 
receiving the invoices for now, then he can process through GF, etc?

Thanks,

Kay
