   I'll e-mail Neil about the SS number--no rush--I'm changing some
end-of-year things and need it.  Please take some shopping time, and I look
forward to keeping Michael for the parties.

I'll have to ask Neil for Michael's SS#.  I don't have it on me.

I know Neil's boss and his boss' boss will have parties.  I think one in on
the 16th and the other on the 30th (stupid day for a party).  Are those
good days for you? I just can't get interested in going to the Enron
parties - too many people.  We could really stand some shopping time (bah
humbug), also.

           When you have a chance, please send me Michael's Social Security
number.

           I'll be glad when you and Neil start going to some Christmas
parties.

           Thanks.
