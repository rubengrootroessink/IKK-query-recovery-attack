John,

Enron owns two GE 7EA turbines, which may be sold in a structure similiar to 
the CA Development structure.  We would like to update the letter agreements 
to address this possibility, and would appreciate K & S's assistance in that 
regard.  

The counterparties are not yet known, but I have heard Evista and Cayuga 
mentioned.

If this sounds good to you, I will initiate the approval process for your 
retention in this matter.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

As you know, I just love to pile on. I took what I think are the latest form 
docs and made some changes to incorporate additional commercial terms I want 
to go out with. Please review the attached clean and redline drafts. In the 
interest of time, would it be OK for Caroline to review (I've really got 
people chomping at the bit).

Thanks,

Ben
