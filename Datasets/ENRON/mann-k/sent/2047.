Subject: Intergen Deal - Meeting

Kay and I would like to get together tomorrow (Wednesday) morning to discuss 
the Intergen transaction.  Specifically, we would like to discuss: 1) the 
steps/timeline associated with assigning the equipment from TurboPark to 
Intergen, and 2) the accounting condition(s) required to be satisfied in 
order for the transaction value to be booked as 2000 earnings.

Intergen is holding a Board meeting this afternoon and the Enron/Intergen 
transaction is on the agenda for approval.   We expect to hear the results of 
that Board meeting sometime tomorrow morning.  If Intergen receives Board 
approval to proceed, our current goal is to have the transaction documents in 
a final form for signing on Thursday of this week.  This would allow us to 
notify TurboPark on Thursday or Friday of our intent to assign the equipment 
to Intergen.  It is unclear if this assignment can be accomplished by 12/29.

Kay has a meeting at 10 am.  Can we me at 8:30 or 9:00 a.m.?  Call/email me 
to confirm the time and location of this meeting.

Thanks,
Fred
