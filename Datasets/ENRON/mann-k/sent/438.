Kay--in response to your request,set forth below are the names and phone 
numbers for the attorneys I would propose be used for the various aspects of 
the Edgecombe matter.  However, in my absence this week,I would appreciate it 
if you would coordinate any requests for assistance through Clark.  He can 
cover or get appropriate help to cover either anything regarding the 
Interconnection Agreement (which is on my docket) or real estate issues (in 
which I had planned to involve Pat Dulany, who also is on vacation this 
week).  I'll look forward to catching up with you next Monday.  In the 
meantime, if any meetings with VEPCO get scheduled that you would like me to 
attend, please send me an email since I will check that later on this week. 
Thanks, and have a good week.
