Ben, 

I'll take a look at it today, you night owl.  Hope the kids cut you some 
slack after your late night.  

You're missing our last week of nice weather for the season.  It was 65 
degress this am.  I'm taking Herman to the game tonight, which will be 
wonderful in this weather.  Next comes 90 degrees.

Michael had his first soccer practice yesterday - actually a skills 
assessment to put them on teams.  He loved it. His big sister and her 
boyfriend took  him to buy soccer clothes afterwards.  He is wearing his shin 
guards and soccer shorts to school today.  Too cute.

Hope you are enjoying your little ones.

Kay
