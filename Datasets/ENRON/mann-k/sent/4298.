I've got the crib, a playpen, red and blue check bumpers for the crib, a 
never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees (our trees were too tall), 
perhaps a jogging stroller (don't think we gave it away), and I don't know 
what else.  All have "baby Carnahan" on it.  Will she give the baby her last 
name?  That would be cool.

I met someone (a guy)  named Kayne.  Yes, I know it looks like Kay, but I 
thought it sounded cool.  Kayne Carnahan.  Opps, sounds like a bull rider!

Remember not to throw away baby stuff!  My oldest daughter, Sara has already 
bought a complete wardrobe for the baby including girl and boy outfits.  I 
guess I had better get on the ball and at least buy a "I Love Granny" bib or 
something!  Ha.

Do you know Carlos' cell phone number?  His normal secretary is out.
