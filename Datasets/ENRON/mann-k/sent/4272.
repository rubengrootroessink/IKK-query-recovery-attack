Chris,

The docs you sent me that I asked about are titled: Declaration of Covenants, 
Conditions and Restrictions for Midway Grove, and Articles of Incorporation 
of Midway Grove Property Owners Association, Inc.  I'm a bit unclear as to 
how the attached relate to those docs, but I must confess to having not read 
all of the previously sent documents or the two docs on this email.  It would 
help if you could connect the dots for me.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached for your review please find one (1) copy of the title and
survey issues memo I have prepared, which sets forth certain title and
survey issues related to the St. Lucie County site, and also sets forth
what work, if any, we are undertaking to resolve the issues.  In
addition, attached for your review please find one (1) copy of the
initial draft of the title and survey objection letter for the St. Lucie
County site.  The issues set forth in the memo and letter are relatively
minor in nature, as our review of the title and survey documents did not
reveal any issues of which were particularly unusual.  With respect to
the financing issues as they relate to the attached documents, I am not
at all certain whether they have been evaluated from this perspective,
and I am also not certain if they have any impact at all on said issues.

Once you have had an opportunity to review the attachments, please call
me with any questions or comments you may have.  Once the objection
letter is in final form, I will forward same to the optionor.

Best regards,

Chris Boehler

Please email me a brief overview of what these documents are, how they
fit
into the overall picture, and the issues which need the most scrutiny.
Additionally, have these been evaluated in light of Enron's balance
sheet
and financing issues?

Thanks,

Kay
