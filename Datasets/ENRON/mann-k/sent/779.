It is mainly a tax issue (whether we have to pay franchise tax), and ENA Tax 
says we don't need to register.  At least that's how I understood it.  I'll 
double check.  

We can do the name change and register later.  That's no problem.

I don't really know what it means to be "registered" in a state.  I know that 
we intend to transact with customers located in all the states I mentioned.  
If we only register in Illinois and we transact with a customer in Iowa is 
that a problem?
