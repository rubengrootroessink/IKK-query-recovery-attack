Eric,
We are moving ahead to have legal turn a turbine purchase agreement.  As 
discussed on Tuesday morning, we must turn an offer to People's on Friday 
July 14.  I want to assure that all parties have provided enough time and 
attention to 1) review a document 2) provide comments and 3) provide a 
legally binding (conditioned on ABB requirements) offer to PEC.

Please contact me with questions or comments @ 312/541-1225.

Thanx,
Laura
