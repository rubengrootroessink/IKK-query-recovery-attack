John -

Have spoke with Mitch and he and I agree that he, Ross Newlin and myself 
should go along with Bill Fox if he's available (Bob Greene if he's not).  
Our preference is to go on Sept 11 and return same day if possible, return 
the 12th if not.  Let us know if this works for EECC and SWPC.

Subject: Westinghouse Meeting

I heard from Westinhouse today concerning the sound, missing megawatts, and 
heat rate issues, and the possibility of a meeting to discuss how we are 
going to work together on these issues.  Matt Coffman, S/WEC suggested that 
the meeting be held in Orlando and that it be held on Friday, 8 Sep 00, or 
early the following week (11, 12, or 13 Sep 00).  Please let me know your 
availability and I will set up the meeting.  I think that this meeting should 
be held without lawyers.

Thanks,   John
