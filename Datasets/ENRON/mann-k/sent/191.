Subject: Midwest Energy Cash Management Policy

Attached is a quick pass at a template for the Midwest Energy Hub Cash 
Management Policy based on conversations with both Peoples Energy and Enron 
personnel.  I have tried to get down on paper all the issues and have 
included several bracketed items and comments that need clarification.  
However, I have undoubtedly missed some things and welcome any input. If 
everyone could provide me with their comments by Thursday July 6th, I will 
incorporate them and work with Kay to translate this into an executable legal 
document.

Thanks for everyone's assistance,

Gregg
