I'll have to ask Neil for Michael's SS#.  I don't have it on me.

I know Neil's boss and his boss' boss will have parties.  I think one in on 
the 16th and the other on the 30th (stupid day for a party).  Are those good 
days for you? I just can't get interested in going to the Enron parties - too 
many people.  We could really stand some shopping time (bah humbug), also.

   When you have a chance, please send me Michael's Social Security
number.

   I'll be glad when you and Neil start going to some Christmas
parties.

   Thanks.
