This place is more difficult than it needs to be.

Well, that's something I hadn't heard before.  They should let that be known, 
don't you think?  At least now WE know it!

I talked to Vanessa Bob at x36781 regarding this matter.  She said she's 
forwarded this on to the JK Group which will pay the amount shortly.  The 
matching gifts are paid quarterly.

Hello.

I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled 
out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are 
sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.

Thank you,
