Attached is the first draft of the ESA facility agreement. which I believe is 
current through yesterday's discussion.  
I would appreciate it if you could forward this to the persons in Transaction 
Support and Tax who are working on this transaction.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached please find a clean draft of the Enron South America Turbine
Agreement, as well as a blackline showing changes made to the from
document agreed to by GE.

The only additional information that we need to insert into the
agreement is the Agreement Number in Section 6.7.1.

I will send the exhibits in a few moments.
