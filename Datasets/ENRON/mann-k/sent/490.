Subject: Conference call on Wednesday

I have scheduled the conference call for Wednesday afternoon at 3:00 CPT.  
The call-in information is as follows:

Number: 1.800.991.9019
Passcode: 6207851

I will reserve one of the big conference rooms on 29 so everyone in Houston 
can participate from the same room.  

Please forward this to anyone I've left off the list.

Regards,

Heather
