I suggest we give GE a time line for completing each of the break out 
contracts.  I'm unfamiliar with the individual project requirements, so I'm 
asking  your help.  I believe City of Austin is ready to go as soon as the 
form is complete, and it could be a great candidate for working on 
immediately.  I know the ESA project has some time sensitivity as well.

Please let me know what you think.
