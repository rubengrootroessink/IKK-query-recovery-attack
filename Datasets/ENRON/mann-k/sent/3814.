Hi Theresa,

I'm not sure if Steve Thome mentioned this to you, but Enron is opening an 
escrow account in connection with a transaction with Delta Power.  He 
suggested that I forward the wiring instructions for the payment of the 
escrow fee of $10,500.  Please let me know what other info you need to tee 
this up.

Thanks,

Kay
