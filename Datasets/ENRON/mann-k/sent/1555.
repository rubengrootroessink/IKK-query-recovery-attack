I am picking up Michael. I hope she can make it too. I thought she was
coming home on Tuesday not Wednesday? His last day is Wednesday, right?
Let's eat out of the frig. Love, NM

Allow yourself a day to pack!  I've had to stop and start, but I just now
finished, and I've only been in the office for a couple of months.

Michael says when Paige gets home he's going to grab her leg and hold on to
her.  She thought it was so cute.  He wants her to visit at the school, but
she hasn't told me whether she can make it.  I suspect getting here by 230
or so would be very difficult.

I've hot.  This packing is hard work!

I had lunch with Carlos - and ate too much.  I need to get focused on my
diet again.  At least I'm walking a lot.

You are picking Michael up, today (only), right?

Love,

Kay

Sounds good but I thought you wanted a pickup? Ask where it's located and
if
we can have it checked out if your interested. He doesn't say but I'm
guessing it's an automatic.

I did the walk through with John and Maria this morning. Our folks are
going
to be very please with the new office. NM

86 Jeep Cherokee Laredo 4X4, four door with rear lift gate, clean tan cloth
interior, buckets, tilt wheel, good dark blue paint, body has one minor
ding, fairly new M/S tires on aluminum wheels, 2.8L V-6, engine clean,
mechanically maintained. Looks good, runs OK, solid build.

Wife's car since new, she got a new one, I got a toy, driveway overloaded
so this one has to go (I wanted to keep it and let my 16 yr old son drive
it but.... management has determined that 4 vehicles is too many).  His
loss, your gain!

$2600/bo
