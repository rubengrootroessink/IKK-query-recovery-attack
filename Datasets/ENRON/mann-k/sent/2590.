Kay,

I don't have the "sent" e-mail, but here is my outline:

thank

ASSET MANAGEMENT
1. Every December 1 the benchmark is set for next year=01,s gas cost. The=
=20
benchmark is adjusted for basis and transport.
2. The benchmark for gas purchases will be adjusted for a gas load factor t=
o=20
account for the non-block nature of gas consumption.
3. Enron will serve full requirements power and steam at the benchmark cost=
.
4. If unit 1 is down, Enron will serve Co-op City based on prevailing gas=
=20
market price.
5. If Enron does nothing but serve power and steam from the project, actual=
=20
cost will equal benchmark cost and Enron earns nothing.
6. If Enron can shut down the generators and buy power cheaper from the=20
market than it could generate and sell the gas for a profit, the net reduce=
s=20
the average cost of gas.
7. Enron is only incentivized to buy gas and sell power or buy power and se=
ll=20
gas if there is a net benefit to Co-op City
8. A Co-op City book will be kept and audited to keep track of the gas and=
=20
power purchases and sales to calculate the asset management performance.
DEVELOPMENT RISK CAPITAL
1. Enron will commit development risk capital for:
Permit preparation and application
Preliminary engineering
Site due diligence
Securing turbines
1. Need to negotiate terms for development agreement
ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT AND CONSTRUCTION
1. Enron will perform EPC services at cost plus up to an estimate. The plus=
=20
however, is not at risk.
2. The EPC contract must be executed after the asset management agreement s=
o=20
that there is no appearance of consideration between the two agreements.
3. Commercial operations date will float relative to the issuance of permit=
s.
OPERATIONS
1. Enron will dispatch the plant and procure gas and power so as to maximiz=
e=20
plant efficiency and economics per the asset management agreement.
MAINTENANCE
1. Enron will act as agent on behalf of Co-op City to negotiate a long term=
=20
maintenance agreement, with a third party, subject to Co-op City=01,s appro=
val.
2. Enron will manage the maintenance contract and coordinate planned outage=
s=20
so as to maximize project value under the asset management agreement.
