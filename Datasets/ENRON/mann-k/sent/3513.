Team Salmon,

Carlos will be working the Enron consent/opinion docs.  I suspect he is 
looking for a seat at the closing dinner, but the help is appreciated 
regardless of motive.

Carolyn, the form of the escrow instruction letter looked fine.

I spoke with GE about the turbine contract, and I am optimistic that we will 
have the "final form" today.

Ciao,

Kay
