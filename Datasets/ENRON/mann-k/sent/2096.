I asked Fred to check into what it would take to have Enron set up a third 
party escrow arrangement.

Subject: Intergen - Escrow

I spoke with Mary Perkins in Treasury.  She indicated that we are currently 
working with Chase Bank and City Bank for our third party escrow Agreements.  
Mary will forward Kay and I electronic copies of both of their standard 
agreements.  The timeline for a standard agreement is at least 3 days and 
increases with the level of complexity of the Escrow Agreement's terms & 
conditions.  The cost for either bank to set-up and administer the escrow 
would be approximately $5-$10K, with additional cost if the Agreement was 
overly complex.

Kay:  Call me to discuss our proposed Escrow Agreement T&C's and how a draft 
form of this Agreement should be best incorporated into the transaction 
documents.  At a minimum, we should attach it as a sample form and have the 
Letter Agreement(s) contain "substantially in conformance with" language.

Fred
