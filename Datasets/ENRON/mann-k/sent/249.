Nancy,

I believe we are scheduled to start at 900am Thursday.  I had a voice mail 
from Heather that said she was planning to spend the night Thursday in case 
the meeting went long, or we wanted to continue on Friday.  I haven't heard 
where we will be staying. 

As for the interconnection agreement, it would be great to have a internal 
working draft this week.  That way we can discuss it with Heather and make 
good use of our time.  Also, we could  have some general, preliminary 
discussions with VEPCO about it, if we feel ready.  

I've been trying to get a form from someone around here, but haven't had any 
luck.  Perhaps someone BP's Houston office has an "Enron form".  Sheryl 
Gussett's name is next to "interconnection agreement" on our document team 
list.

Kay

Will you still be planning to come to DC to meet on Wed afternoon?  Also, is 
there a time for Thursday's meeting?  It's approx. a 2 hour drive from DC, so 
if the meeting is scheduled to start very early on Thursday, I may also need 
to come down on Wednesday eve.

One other question.  What is your timing on the interconnection agreement?  I 
have been assuming that it is not on the agenda for Thursday, although I do 
plan to work on it this week.  Thanks.
