Per my voicemail, attached is a list of business items that need to get put 
in place in order for Midwest Energy Hub LLC to be fully operational.  There 
are probably others that I have missed and would welcome any additions you 
may have.  One thing I did not include was any internal Enron approvals, 
(DASH, Legal risk memo) that may be necessary.  

Call me when you have a chance to talk through the list.

Thanks,

Gregg
