I spoke with Kent Shoemaker, and he has a conflict at 930 Houston time 
today.  I suggested to him that Enron go forward with the call as an internal 
call, and we can conference him in after 1000 (when he's available), if we 
have anything noteworthy to report. 

If that is acceptable, I will go to Sheila's office at 930, and we can call 
Scott and Rose.

How does that sound?

Kay
