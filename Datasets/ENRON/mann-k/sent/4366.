I was in Clarksdale yesterday, and have a dr's appt this am, but will be glad 
to give you what I have.  In fact, I could use some help with the EEI if the 
offer is still good.  Maybe you could just talk me through it.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay -- Could you forward me e-versions of (1) the completed one month 
Clarksdale transaction, (2) the draft transaction document you feel is the 
best template from the point of view of the seller of the marketing services 
and (3) the finalized term sheet, if there was one, before the parties 
started to work on the definitive agreement relating to Clarksdale?  My 
'Virginia garbage burners' transaction has awakened, with negotiations 
occurring tomorrow.  Thanks, David
