I don't know numerical addresses, just cross streets.  This week I stayed at 
52nd and Madison, time before I stayed at either 72 or 77th and Madison. 
Madison is close to 5th.  I'm going to guess that he is living above 50th, as 
I had the impression that he was living in a pretty swanky area.

The weather is beautiful here.  Hope it lasts a couple of days.

Neil loves his pig.  I don't think he has picked a place for it yet, though.

Have a great day!

Love,

Kay

Hi,Kay Kay. Just a note to say have a nice week end. Hope you didn't mind
the pig. If you don't like it you can hide it behind a tree in the yard.
Dad and I were delighted to donate a book to Michael's school. Uncle Bob
and Sharon will be down this weeK end. Joyce and Kenneth Builta are going
to wait until the weather is better. Joyce wants to fish. They are leaving
for New York next Wednesday. Daron lives at 1016 5th Ave. Have you stayed
near there? Must go clean house. We love you, Mother
