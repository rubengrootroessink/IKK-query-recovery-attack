Ben,

This email has the prices in Exhibit N of the current draft agreement.  Are 
these the correct numbers?

Kathy and I discussed your comments, and she is making changes to the 
contract consistent with those comments.  She is not available this 
afternoon, but is free tomorrow am to discuss the contract. Please let me 
know if tomorrow am works for you.

Kay
