David,

Please change the date on the draft so that we won't confuse it with the 
prior drafts.

I would delete "specifically" from 2.10 (c), and add "or later ratify such 
transaction" (or something to that effect), just in case they later learn and 
accept the transaction.  

In 2.10 (x), add to "due to an inability to pay, or other credit reason".  In 
(y), add "or a contractual defense to payment" [could be force majeure, etc]

Again in 2.10, third sentence from the end "any interest, penalties, 
attorneys fees and court costspayable by the Hub Shipper...;

3.3  Delete "prior" before "approval", and add "or ratification" in the 
redlined section on refunds.


Thanks,

Kay
