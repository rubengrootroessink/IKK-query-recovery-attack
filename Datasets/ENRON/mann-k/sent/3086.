I cleared not going to Atlanta with Elizabeth, so I should be able to take 
Michael to Palacios as soon as Monday.  Supposed to rain this weekend anyway, 
so Monday is soon enough. I would just as soon not have a Sharon appointment 
so we have that flexibility.  Plus, there is the possibility that I might 
need to go to FW for my dad.  Michael can go to FW with me if I need to go - 
he would be great company for me. I've thought about taking  him to Moody 
Gardens, or do some other fun stuff as an alternative.   The long term 
weather forecast for Houston and Palacios is glorious for that week, but you 
never know.  I don't mind taking him by myself.  I can do most of the fishing 
stuff, although I don't know squat about artificials.  If I do go I would 
like to take Rosco.  Since my folks have an internet connection I can keep up 
with a little work and write you, too.  

What do you think?
