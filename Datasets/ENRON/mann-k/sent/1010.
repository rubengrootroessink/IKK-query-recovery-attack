I didn't know there were 5 things to get clogged.  What a blessing that he 
had the surgery before he had a heart attack.  Somehow I'm not surprised that 
your dad is a quick  healer. Still, going home today is amazing.

My dad is doing absolutely wonderful!!  I got to Amarillo at midnight on 
Thursday, he had surgery on Friday (5 bypasses and veins taken from both 
legs), and on Saturday was sitting up and going for short walks and will 
probably go home today.  The nurses said he was the 2nd fastest recovery they 
have ever had!  What a champ huh?  His heart muscles were in great shape, the 
arteries were just clogged as hell.

How's you dad?  I hope everything went well.  Did you make it in time to see 
him before the surgery?
