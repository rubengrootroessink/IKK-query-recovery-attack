Hi there,

I suggest that we have an Enron only call at 230 central on Sunday, in 
advance of the  300 call with Delta.  I believe the call in number is 877 232 
0064, pass code 25581#.

Kay

Gentlemen:

We have enclosed the following documents for your review:

1.  Letter Agreement between ENA and PPL marked to reflect revisions from
the prior draft dated March 30, 2001; and
2.  Proposed form of acknowledgement letter from GE.

Greg, I think I included all of your comments, though perhaps not in the
exact places you described.  For example, the substance of your Rider 5(g)
appears in our revised Section 4(b); and the substance of your Rider 5(h)
appears in our Section 2 preamble and our new Section 2(g).

Please review and advise of any comments to same.  Thank you.
