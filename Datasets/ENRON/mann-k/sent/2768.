Hi Tana,

A little birdie tells me that you  have a supply of the Energy & Power Risk 
Management Glossary booklets.  Am I getting close? I've found it to be very 
helpful, and I think it would help one of our new lawyers, Carlos Sole.  
Could I get a copy for him?  Any other good power references?

Thanks,

Kay
