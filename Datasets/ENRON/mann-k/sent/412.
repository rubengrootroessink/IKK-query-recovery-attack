Hi Ben,

Just wanted you to know that I received your email, and will follow through 
on the change order.  I should be in the office on Thursday am, if not 
sooner. As you can see, I'm picking up email, and can also be reached on my 
cell phone.

I reviewed your email re: VEPCO. We do have a project entity to use, and 
Accounting (and Global Finace) have been involved on the MTM and off  balance 
sheet issues.  I suspect we will find out about the need for a guarantee 
soon.   

It was good to get your input on VEPCO. There's lots to do on that one.

Kay

Kay and Kathy:

Please make the effective date of the change order the date of execution. I 
have separately followed up on Lisa's DASH question, and we should be in a 
position to execute the change order after this is clarified.

Thanks,

Ben

Here are my comments after reviewing the below change order: (i) the cover 
page refers to an enron 2-99 deal which does not correspond to the cover page 
of the executed turbine purchase contract with GE.  To what does this refer 
if a different deal and if the same deal, please conform.  (ii) the effective 
date is stated as March 6, 2000.  Given that the agreement between Enron and 
WestLB and the purchase agreement between WestLB and GE weren't signed until 
May 12, 2000, if any backdating is needed (I'd like to understand why it is 
for new equipment orders), it can't be before May 12th.  With respect to the 
effective date and the overall placement of the order, has this $4.65MM 
acquisition been dashed?  The current effective dash only contemplated the 
turbines, not any ancillary equipment.  I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC 
contact for this transaction.

Regards, Lisa

Please review the attached change order. We would like to have your comments

Thanks,
