Evidently Ben told Chris to call.  This is an on going problem.

No.  The primary focus of the call today is to get the exclusivity agreement 
executed.  I think NorthWestern is getting more comfortable with the 
structure of the deal.  If all goes well with the exclusivity agreement, we 
might go over a few contract points with NorthWestern.

Chris.

P.S.  I apologize for talking to outside counsel without your permission.  I 
do not mean to step on any toes, I was simply responding to Ben's 
request....you know how demanding he can be.  I hope you dad is doing well!

Will there be a "pre-call" for the Enron team?
