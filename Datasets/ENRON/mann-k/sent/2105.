The original contract covered 24 LM6000 turbines.  The "break-out contracts" 
cover the turbines going to specific projects.  There is a provision in the 
original LM6000 contract which contemplates "facility agreements" covering 
one or more of the LM6000 turbines.  We call them "break out contracts" as a 
short-hand reference.

Thanks for the documents.   I understand that these are final.  Why is there 
a South America Facility and a ESAT Break out Contract?  Aren't they the same?
