WOW!  We need to start having old fashioned closings with lunch and the 
exchange of signed documents.  By copy of this, I'm asking Ed to track down 
as many docs as he can and Kay, can you come up with the CA Development I and 
II docs for Lee?

Sheila,

I hate to do this to you at this late date, but I finally figured out that
the execution copy that we received via this e-mail of 2-12-01 was not the
final executed version (WAS:83641.7).  The final executed version (file
WAS:83641.8) is attached.  The changes were made by Alan Larsen on January
19, 2001 to paragraphs 6.1.2 Payment Schedule (from $ 10,892,000.00 to $
11,572,250.00)and 6.1.3 Retention Letter(s) of Credit (amount changed to $
720,535).  This was due to the agreed upon scope and storage changes we
determined were necessary at time of execution to avoid a change order.

Please distribute accordingly on your side.  Also, I never received my
original signature pages, plus other consent documents.

Also, I'm trying to get our copy of the executed CA Development I and CA
Development II contract documents.  Plus the E-Next Generation contract,
too.  (Who says we're going paperless.)

Thanks,

Lee
