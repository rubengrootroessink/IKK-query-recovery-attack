You did better than I did.  I was telling people I was 41 when I was 42.  I 
felt terrible when I realized I was older than I thought!  Oh well, it just 
goes to show you that it is all a state of mind.

I'm not sure how you don't focus on development, when it is all a part of the 
same group and process. Neat trick, though.  I wish Carlos was here to do a 
lot of this, though.

Thanks.  All last year I thought I was the age I am turning tomorrow, so I 
feel like I really did gain a year.

Stuart just told me he will not be focusing as much on development.  Is that 
the same for you too?
I just met Roger Balog (I think he was a little overwhelmed).
