Hello John.  We are turning a new draft at the moment, and expect to have it 
to you and David by the end of the week.  Let me know if you have questions 
in the meantime.  Thanks.  --  Karen

Hi John,

Hi, gang. Sheila called last Friday and let me know you were working on this 
off-balance sheet EPC form, and that it was expected to be out on Friday, 
maybe Monday for review and commment, which was needed PDQ becuase of a 
looming project.  I have not seen any copy of the form or had any update on 
the status of the project.

Kay/Dave, could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big 
picture status?
