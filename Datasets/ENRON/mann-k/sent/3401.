Not that this is a big deal, but I heard a voice mail from Mark stating that 
Lance is the DASH guy while Mark is in DC.  Maybe that was deal specific.

Maybe we can grab something quick and eat upstairs.  I am underwater.

Subject: PSEG Risk Memo

I'm going in today, can we meet for lunch?

Also, please review attached form of risk memo in which I outline the risks 
that I see in the PSEG transaction.  I have not elaborated the details yet 
because I wnated to first confirm the outline with you.  I only expect to use 
bullets below the issues I've identified.   Also, how much if any of this 
should be added to the DASH which is also attached.  Lastly, since Mark is 
out this week, I've addressed the memo to Julia since she will sign the DASH 
(I gave her a heads up yesterday).  Thanks.  I've got a 10:30 call, but will 
stop by may be before or more likely after.
