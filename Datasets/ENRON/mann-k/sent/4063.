Hi Ben,

I've been working on the letter, but I've got to fill in a bunch of blanks 
before it is finished (proper names, etc.)  Depends on how complete you want 
it to be.

I've got to check to see if this is the final version we agreed to.  It is 
very close.

Kay:

I'd like to call Jeff Darst today to discuss the letter he sent on LDs, etc. 
Prior to calling him, though, I wanted to e-mail the acknowledgement letter 
and the acknowledgement and consent. I was wondering if you could provide me 
an electronic copy of the acknowledgement and consent, and a draft letter. 
Let me know when you think you can get to this, and I'll schedule the call 
with Darst accordingly.

Thanks,

Ben
