Applied Finance - January 25 & 26, 2001 in EB552     Cost:  $700.00

If a better understanding of Enron's transactions (a deal) that involves 
Enron's financial as well as commercial participation with another business 
entity would help you do your job better - this course was designed for you. 

This course will give you a firm grasp of basic finance but in the context of 
Enron's commercial and financial transactions.
The objective of this class is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, 
to help you understand how basic financial principals contribute to the 
structure of a deal and provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that 
you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.
