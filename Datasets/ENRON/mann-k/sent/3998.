Subject: Haywood Transaction

I have reviewed the latest revisions to the two amendments that are being 
contemplated for this deal.  They should be signed either today or tomorrow.

I assume that you would prefer that I remain responsible for these for the 
next day or so (and get them signed).  If this is not the case, please advise.

Stuart
