1)The cybergoblins ate the attachment.
2) OK
3) Which Peoples is it?  Also, I think enovate should sign at CA.
4)  I sent Heather an email re her availability.  There's a bunch of 
construction near downtown, so I would hesitate to commit to an early call, 
but I know I'm free after 300 tomorrow.

Subject: enovate stuff

Kay - 

1) Attached is my quick attempt at writing something to make the management 
changes at enovate that we discussed.  Could you please review this and add 
the appropriate legal language.  I don't think that we need any Board 
approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient?

2)  I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than 
Laura at the same time.  My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be 
granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the 
template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if 
there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.

3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.  
We can discuss this any time you want.

4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss 
the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

I will be leaving around 2:00 for suburban trick or treating.

Thanks,

Gregg
