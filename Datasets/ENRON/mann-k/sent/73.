I thought I recalled you suggesting that changes we used on the LM 6000 deal 
be incorporated into a "master".  Maybe I misunderstood (not the first 
time!!!)

I don't know for sure but Kathy may be the better person to respond.

I haven't seen it.

Is there a master contract that Kathy (or someone) has been collecting

I was under the impression that GE was to put together a written list of

Have you had any further discussions with John Schroeder about dates and 
agendas?  If not should we call him together?  I have most recently been 
blindsided by BlueDog and I think we need to get this show on the road.
