Warren helped a little yesterday, and Theresa has offered to do my expense

I wasn't up that early, but I was up about 7am.  Girl, 
you are putting in the hours.  Is Warren helping you at 
all or is there anything he can do.  

We are on for lunch on Monday aren't we?  Still miss you 
too!  I wish I was there to help you!!!!
