Chris,

Your invoice for December reflects final revisions to the documents through 
December 20th, so I'm assuming the draft the Schaeffer's signed was done 
subsequent to anything transmitted on December 13th.   However, emailing 
documents directly to me and calling me on the phone will be a big help.

Thanks for your response,

Kay

Kay -- 

I understand that we have received your revisions to the Schaffer Option
Agreement and are in the process of incorporating them into the document.
We will then contact the Schaffers' attorneys and get the changes
incorporated.

We apologize for the confusion regarding the last set of revisions.  Those
revisions arose following our teleconference with the Schaffers' attorneys.
Apparently, Don was acting under the assumption that you were tied up on
other matters and had coordinated with Stuart, Fred and Rusty.
Nevertheless, you should be able to find a copy in your electronic file
attached to a December 13, 2000 email from Fred.  Although Don had
subsequent conversations with Rusty and Stuart, we should have circled back
with you.

In the future, we will ensure that you receive email copies of all of the
documents, with the changes highlighted as you requested.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this matter
further. 

Thank you.

Karen,

It appears to  me that revisions were made to this agreement, and the
agreement was presented to the counterparty for signature without me
being
consulted.  Perhaps you did email this to me and I can't locate the
electonic file.  In any event, in the future, please call me on the
telephone  BEFORE revisions are made to documents and presented to the
counterparty.  If you can't reach me by phone, send me an explanatory
email. Also, please email me redlines against prior drafts.  This will
faciliate my review.  Faxing drafts does not work for me.

I will send you the required changes tomorrow.

Thank you,

Kay
