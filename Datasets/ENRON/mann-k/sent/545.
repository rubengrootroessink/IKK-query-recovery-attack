Yikes.  Would you have just 30 minutes sometime during the afternoon 
tomorrow?  I really struck out with everyone else for Friday.  Otherwise, 
I'll be glad to schedule a meeting on Friday (in addition to this one 
tomorrow) to review the structure with the various players.  You pick a time 
(the earlier being better for me).

Thanks,

Kay

I am already booked solid tomorrow afternoon on another deal.  Friday is much 
better.

Looks like Thursday at 300pm is working out for most people to meet to 
discuss the VEPCO PPA. The meeting will be held in EB38C1.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Kay
