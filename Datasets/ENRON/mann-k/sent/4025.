Hi Ben,

IMHO, your team needs a basic understanding of the finance and accounting 
issues.  Legal should have a bit more of a developed (and probably current) 
understanding of how to address the issues.  Between Development and Legal, 
we should be able to get docs about 90% there.  We then take the almost 
compliant docs to Accting/Finance for fine tuning.  

A key action item is getting a presentation set up where there is a good 
download of information from Acct/Finance to the Development group.  We had 
one yesterday for Legal, and it was helpful.  I want to sit in when your 
troops get the presentation, if at all possible, because I can help translate 
on both sides, I believe.  I also want to make sure that Development and 
Legal are on the same page.  Fire drill avoidance is a key objective.

Look forward to discussing in detail.

Kay

Kay:

As I mentioned, this e-mail was the product of a meeting this week with 
Duran, Deffner, Bills and me. I need your help to make this work with respect 
to the legal group, and would like your suggestions. I'll call you to discuss.

Regards,

Ben

Guys:

As you all know, our group is in the middle of a very significant amount of 
development and equipment book management activity, This hard work by all of 
you has allowed us to achieve very impressive income results thus far this 
year, and has set the stage for continued success. It has also placed 
significant demands on internal resources that are integral to our success, 
in particular those resources in Global Finance, Accounting, and Legal. 

In order to ensure a proper prioritization of work flow, and that project 
specific objectives and time lines are communicated, I need each of you to 
come to me with all new agreements prior to seeking input from Accounting and 
Global Finance. I will interface with these two groups and establish 
priorities for their review.

We will continue to refine how we interface with these groups, and as such, 
I'd appreciate any suggestions you would have. I plan to have a staff meeting 
next week, and we can discuss it at that time.

Thanks,

Ben
