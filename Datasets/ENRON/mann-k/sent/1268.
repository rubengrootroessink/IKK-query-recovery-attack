Neil left town yesterday.  I can't really complain since he rarely travels.  
However, he is welcome to pamper upon his return!

I understand that you and Michael are sick with strep throat.  I hope you get 
well over the weekend and that Neill appropriately pampers you and Michael in 
the interim.
