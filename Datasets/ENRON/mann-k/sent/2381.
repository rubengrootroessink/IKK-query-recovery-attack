Please do what you can to find out what is going on. I know you forwarded 
these to Carolyn, but I would still appreciate it if you could investigate, 
or ask Carolyn to do so.

Subject: invoices

Kay: We recently received payment of our June, 2000 invoice. Previously, we
had received payment of the September, 2000 invoice. This leaves
outstanding the invoices for July, 2000 (30492348; $9,810.19); August, 2000
(30502885; $3273.75); October, 2000 (30526950; $1819.73), November, 2000
(30539817; $1510.45); and December, 2000 ($1675.29). At the request of your
assistant, I forward the information re the invoices through November to
the Enron accounts payable help desk, but I did not hear back. Anything you
can do to expedite payment of theses invoices would be appreciated.
