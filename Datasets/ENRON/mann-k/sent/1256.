Michael is still running 102 fever.  I spoke to the doctor again today, and 
he said that Michael had a pretty good bit of strep.  I'm feeling better, 
though, and have gotten a decent amount of work done.  In fact, Christy 
Chapman may give you some original documents I initialled and faxed to her.  
I'll explain later.  If I had your fax number I think I would have faxed them 
to you.

Have a great day tomorrow.

Kay

Not yet.  Karen called me after I sent her my e-mail regarding the several 
missing items and she assured me she would take care of the acknowledgments.  
I did not want to mention it in my e-mail to her yesterday (thought I would 
save that until I had a chance to see if she sent anything to Fred and he is 
out of town).  I have not forgotten about it though.

How are you and handsome doing?  Feeling any better?  I talked to your other 
son "Carlos" today and he was thinking about leaving early to go home 
(something he ate yesterday at Massa's).

K-

By the way, did they ever get the acknowledgments taken care of?
