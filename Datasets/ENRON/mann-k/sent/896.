Hi Dan,

One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality 
agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The 
agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company 
from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we 
are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the 
exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  

FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on 
Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the 
general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.  
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.

Kay
