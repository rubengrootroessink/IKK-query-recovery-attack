You know ES doesn't work Fridays, so that takes away one day of opportunity 
to approve them, plus she hasn't had an assistant.  Maybe things will 
improve.  She is very excited about her new assistant.

I see that.  She's not real fast on approving things either.  I've submitted 
your expense report and Carol's to her.  She hasn't gotten to Carol's yet, 
and I did it a few days ago.  Haedicke isn't that fast either.  I don't think 
they like all this automation, but it really makes it so much quicker.  I'm 
going to be the queen at invoices and expense reports because I do so many of 
them.  I like both systems, but then I'm very adaptable.  

Did you give me an ok review?

Yes, I'm officially in Elizabeth's group.  I need to ask her for a flat 
screen monitor.

Ok, sending it in now.  Have you officially been changed to Elizabeth's cost 
center?  You aren't in Jeff's time site any more.  I want to make sure I send 
it to the correct person.

Subject: Cingular Bill

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>
