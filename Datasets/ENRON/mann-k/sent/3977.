John, 

I humbly beg your forgiveness for not calling you.  Now I owe you.

I will check my directory to see what I have.  As I recall it was part of 
some special scratch my back I'll scratch yours deal, although the details 
now escape me.  Seems like there were some minor defects which could be 
repaired while GE stored the stuff, so we let them put the stuff in storage 
based on their rep things would get fixed.   

Kay

Subject: LM6000 24 pack Storage Letter- copy please.


Ben and Kay

Project is Eletrobolt.   ESA has had GE send the stacks for the Electrobolt 
LM6000 back to Braden for modifications necessary for Eletrobolt and there 
are a couple other changes.

I need to prepare an amendment cover those changes as well a capture the in 
and out costs related to the Eletrobolt units.  Matt T told me that Ben 
signed out a letter prepared by Kay addressing an agreement related to 
storage of the units that was different from the 24 pack base contract.  Matt 
says he does not have the letter.   

I would be very helpful if I could have a copy of the letter so I understand 
the changes so I do not upset the prior deal. Once I have the amendment 
prepared in addition to the Eletrobolt team review, I would like to bounce 
off Ben and Kay to ensure I have not harm to other aspects of the 24 pack 
purchase.


Thanks
