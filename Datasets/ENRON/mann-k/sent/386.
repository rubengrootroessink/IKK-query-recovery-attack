I suspect that there are several options.

He is such a sweet, cute, smart thing.  You will like him. He is very very 
charming.

Are you just finding out?  I know there are things that can be done to help 
that situation.  Do you want me to block you out for Friday afternoon as 
well.  You need to get this taken care of quickly for Michael's sake.

Michael problems. He has ADD and some other lesser learning problems.  We are 
going to meet  with the specialist next week.

I'm going to try to take off Friday afternoon as well.  We are thinking of 
changing his school, and Neil and I need to go visit a new one.

HECTIC!
