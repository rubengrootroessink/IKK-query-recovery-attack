I figure longer life expectancy is just to make up for all the crummy female 
days we have.  We probably have the same number of quality days as men.  If 
that!

I don't know what's wrong with me!  The last three weeks I've been gaining 
weight steadily even though I've been working out and watching what I eat.  
Something is going on.  Today, I had to go to the gastro for my hernia and 
the fact that colon cancer runs in my family.   He took blood to check my 
organs, etc.  He also gave me my prescription for Prilosec and Vioxx (for 
arthritis).  I'm coughing and it feels like bronchitis so I'm going to the 
allergist tomorrow.  Thursday is the big day, fight with Dr. Hamilton over 
whether it's hormones, do I need a hysterectomy. get this weight off of me, 
stuff like that.  I'm miserable and I know it's not fat because it's come on 
way too soon.  Johnson said it could be a reaction to getting off the Prozac 
and I might need to get back on it.  I did lose a lot of weight when I got on 
it but the hormones had put it on me in the first place.  Being a woman is so 
hard!!!!!!!!!  Let me rephrase that, an aging woman.  The doctor even said so 
today.  He's a cutie too so if you ever have an ulcer or hiatal hernia, I 
highly recommend him.  He's really a great doctor, very thorough and you 
odn't have to take your clothes off all the time.  I love that!!!!
