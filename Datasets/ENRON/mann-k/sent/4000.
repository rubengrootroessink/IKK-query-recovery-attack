1400 Smith.

Morning would probably be better for me.

Subject: Visit to Houston

Looks like I will be in Houston tomorrow ( Wed.) and would like to come by to 
meet you and to discuss the Clarksdale contract. I'm tied up in the middle of 
the day, but will probably have time early (9 or 10 am) or in the afternoon. 

Please let me know your availability and we'll set something up. I assume 
you're on Smith St. downtown.
