Kay:

This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
(312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.
