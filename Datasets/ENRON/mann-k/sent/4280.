200 is late enough for anyone to be out.  I'm all for the limo taking people 
home at that time.

I am concerned about Michael AND about imposing on Donnie and Lynn.  Are you 
taking Friday off?

I called Mikey and asked what was the latest he thought the limo would be
needed. He said 3:30. I asked if 2am worked and he said absolutely. He also
said he didn't think it mattered to Paige if it was an SUV or a standard
limo. So what do you think, SUV or standard limo?

I'm not sure what you mean about how to balance Michael. I know I'm
concerned about him getting up early and wanting to go home. That would not
be a good thing. This party is for and about Paige, and you too. I want the
two of you to be able to share this time with out you being concern about
Michael. I will be in charge of Michael Friday morning. I don't mind sitting
second chair so to speak. What do you think?

SUV for 14.  It is ok with me if we have it until 2.  We need to talk how
to balance Michael, etc.

working on it now...
Thurs 6/7 6pm to midnight it's looking like...
For an SUV 14 passenger it's going to be about $750.00
For a std 12 passenger limo it's going to be about $590.00
Any thoughts...
