Please call Paul Pipitone (Houston) and Peter Thompson (he's in DC) and ask 
them to call in at 130. I'm not sure Paul will be joining us, but Peter has 
confirmed.  If we are delayed we'll let them know.

How long did you reserved the line?  I can see the call going until 330.

Kay

Kay, Sheila asked me to set up the above-referenced call (you have an email) 
and said you may want some A&K people joining in later in the call.  I don't 
have their names, so I figured you'd call them when you were ready for them.  
Let me know if you want me to give them a time to call and the dial-in 
information.  Thanks, Suz
