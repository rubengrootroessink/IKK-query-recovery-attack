Subject: Meet with Brett Wiggs

Brett is meeting with me in my office at 1:30 p.m. Houston time to discuss 
the closing.   Please let me know if you can be there; Melba is trying to 
find a conf. room if the response is good.   If you cannot attend, but can be 
available by phone, please let me know that also; I can get a conf. call set 
up.    

Luiz - are you in SP or Rio today?

Thanks,

Rose
