Hi Jeff,

I guess this answers the question of whether the policy has been adopted.

I'm at home this am, as I'm on my way to MD Anderson to donate blood for a 
friend's son who has leukemia.  I don't think it will take too long, but they 
don't open until 930.

Kay - Can you please review this additional language to the risk management 
policy ( or circulate to Jeff Hodge)?  In light of the CA regarding curves, I 
am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples 
unlimited access to information. I know that we address audit rights in the 
LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already 
have.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Gregg

Attached please find the latest enovate risk policy.  Our attorneys and
internal audit area have made one language revision concerning Section XIII
Audit Rights.
