Good afternoon,

Our son Michael will be in your class beginning next Monday, October 2, so I 
wanted to introduce myself.  I hope we will get to meet in person soon. 

Is there anything you would like to suggest that we do to make the transition 
easier?

I picked up the package of information today, and will read it tonight. l 
won't ask any questions until I do my homework.

I look forward to seeing you soon!

Kay
