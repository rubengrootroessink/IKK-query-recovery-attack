I had the definite impression he was going to call you.  I also know he is 
working on a different deal on an impossible schedule. You know the drill.

Bart is a Washington & Lee guy.  He is older than Ned, so he didn't go to 
school with him.  Just a little trivia...

I've worked with Kilpatrick Stockton's North Carolina office quite a bit,
mostly regulatory- they are so so.  It is my understanding that the Atlanta
office messed up a simple thing for Lisa, and that's all I know about them.
I've worked extensively with King & Spalding, both their Houston office
(multiple matters) and Atlanta (two matters), and have had good results.
I've always worked through John Keffer in Houston, who then hooked me up
with the right folks in Atlanta.

Subject:  Georgia sites

The Georgia sites have slid down hill and reached the bottom. I have to
consult with local counsel re groundwater issues. I understand the options
are King & Spaulding and Kilpatrick & Stockton. I've worked with neither.
Can you evaluate/recommend either?
