John,

The fax is coming in as we speak.  Guess it takes a while to fax it to all 
those addresses.

Would you mind call Jerry Jerry BoBerry and see what he will tell you is the 
substance of their issues, and share with him our issues.  I don't see a 
reason to kirk the whole clan for that experience.

Thanks,

Kay
