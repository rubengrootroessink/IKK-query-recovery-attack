Hi Brian,

What a great surprise!  

Life is pretty good.  To see a summary, you might want to check out Paige's 
website: http://www.southwestern.edu/~recordp/  (I tried to copy that as a 
link, but I think I messed up.)

I guess Peggy told you (or you figured out from my email address) that I'm 
working at Enron. I like it.  I enjoy being back downtown after being a 
suburban lawyer.  Home life is relatively calm, which has always been a goal 
of mine.  I'm dealing with my folks getting older, with the health problems 
which come with that process.  Overall, I'm very blessed and happy.

How about you?  If you are spending time at HM, you must still be doing the 
law thing. I might have lost a bet on that one.  So how's your life?  

Paige completed her minor in German.  Consider it a Wunder legacy!  Her 
brother, Michael is a real charmer.  You would get a huge kick out of him.

Thanks so much for writing.  I can't wait to hear what is going on with you.

Kay

Kay,

I've been spending some time at Hays McConn in the past few weeks --
depositions.  I saw Peggy and we spoke about you.  I just wanted to know how
you and Paige were doing.

Brian
