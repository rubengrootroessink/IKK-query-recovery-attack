Ok.  So basically all bets are off if we don't give NTP by September 
whatever.  Sounds good.

The Notice to Proceed Effective Date is not a set date but rather the day 
that the notice to proceed is given so long as certain other conditions are 
also in effect on such date (such as either financial close or the Enron 
Guaranty]

Stan,

I have one minor question.

Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days
following y event?

I would expect to see language along the lines of "If notice to proceed is
not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then...".  I see the
deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of
this EPC different terminology is used.
