Jonathan,

Please resend the draft confidentiality agreement for the Public Staff, 
preferably by email.  I cannot locate the document here.

The LOI with Rocky Mount is still under discussion.  In a recent discussion 
with one of Enron's folks the City (or their lawyer) raised the issue that 
Kilpatrick Stockton had represented them in the past, and that there might be 
a potential conflict.  I don't anticipate a problem, but we should discuss it 
soon.

Thank you for your assistance,

Kay

Kay:

   Just a brief note to check on the status of the confidentiality
agreement with the Public Staff.  What did you think of the draft Allyson
and I forwarded by fax last week?  Once that is signed, we can go ahead and
submit Jeffrey Keenan's cost estimates.

   Also, curious as to the status of the LOI and confidentiality
agreement (draft attached to our last e-mail message) with the City of Rocky
Mount.

   Once these documents are finalized, Allyson and I can continue to
move your project forward.  In the meantime, as you know, Allyson has been
drafting resolutions for adoption by local government officials.
