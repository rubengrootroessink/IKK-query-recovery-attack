Subject: Skeletal Remains Found on Nolan Ryan's Ranch

FYI - My daughter just called to tell me that their seismic company just 
found a body (skeletal remains) on Nolan Ryan's bull ranch China Grove (don't 
know if that is a town or the name of the ranch), off of County Road 521.  
Ryan is just the tenant, the property belongs to Claude Hammel.
