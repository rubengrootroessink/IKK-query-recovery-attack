Barbara and Peggy,

I understand that we may be looking for someone to provide some assistance on 
the Mexico transactions, and that Carlos Sole may be interviewing for the 
position.  Carlos and I worked together on multiple transactions in Mexico 
while I was with EECC.  In fact, I hired Carlos to work with me because 90% 
of what I was doing was in  Mexico, and Carlos has a good background in 
transactional work in Mexico. He assumed "first chair" responsibility for all 
the Mexico work when I left EECC. Carlos is bilingual in Spanish, and he 
conducts business in Spanish quite comfortably.  He is a very bright, a hard 
worker, and a lot of fun to work with.  I personally think he would be an 
excellent addition to our group.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information about Carlos.  

Kay
