I've roughed out a document for you to discuss.  It isn't in good enough 
shape to go to Peoples yet, but hopefully it gives you something to discuss 
internally so we can decide what we want to do. In the meanwhile, I'm going 
to continue to think through the issues.

Please let me know what I can do to help.

Kay
