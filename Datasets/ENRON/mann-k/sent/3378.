This will be yours when you get back - same counterparty as Tex Mex, I 
think.  I'll finish this and forward you some other docs.

Kay,

1.) We are entering into a CA with BPUB, can we reference it in Article II, 
Paragraph 3?  It's term is "two years from the date of this letter", 
presumably  21 March 2003. 

2.) Under the "PRELIMINARY TERM SHEET"  where we define "Structure" do you 
think we need to elaborate on the phrase "appropriate project  structure"?  
Maybe we should say "appropriate project equity participation and finance 
structure".

Otherwise, I like the document.  I called John Davidson, outside counsel for 
BPUB, this morning and he's approved the CA.  I expect that we'll get a 
partially executed CA within the next day or so.

JMoore
