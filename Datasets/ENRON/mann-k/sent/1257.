Hi Charlotte,

Poor thing woke up with 101.6.  He isn't getting any worse, which means the 
medicine is doing something, but it  just hasn't done the trick yet.  I'll 
give him his sixth dose of medicine in a minute.  I just can't take him to 
school until he is better. I would like to hold the option open to bring him 
in the am.  Once the medicine kicks in, he will bounce back quickly.  

Kay
