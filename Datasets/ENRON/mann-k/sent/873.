This is an internal draft, which has not been sent to CRRA, as far as I know.

Subject: Draft LOI for CRRA

Here's a first ckm draft based on what we had before.  From a substantive 
standpoint I used fuel cell energy technology as a generic, and not 
specifically relating it to FCE.  I based this on a very brief discussion I 
had with Heather, so I hope I didn't misunderstand.

I've incorporated the confidentiality agreement by reference, and included a 
brief statement that this transaction falls within its purview.  

Please let me know your comments.
