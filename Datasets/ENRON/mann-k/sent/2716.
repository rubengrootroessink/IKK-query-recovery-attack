My only advice is to be very specific in their scope.  These guys run up 
bills worse than anyone.

I briefly glanced at the PMRW update on the Illinois projects and what jumped 
out at me was their indication that they'd be working with Andrews & Kurth on 
the due diligence for Livingston and Kendall projects.  I presume this is a 
mistake on their part as the reference should be to King & Spalding.  Before 
they get started on their due diligence for us, they are waiting to get a fax 
from me which I going to send this morningIand I will point that correction 
them (presuming that my understanding is correct.)
