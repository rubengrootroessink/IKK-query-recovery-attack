As far as I know the commissioning period we have in the current LM contrac=

still works for the LMs.  I haven't heard any differently.  You just plug=

those things in, right Scott?

From the owner/power seller standpoint, the predictability is more importan=

than the time period (within reason, of course).  No matte what we have on=

As for standard of conduct, do we have language in the warranty section abo=

Good point on the LM's-  I will make that point, at this time I think the=

I do not think that EECC has corporate history on the 7FA's commissioning=

One thing for me - this contract will not just be for 7FA's.  The LMs have=

much shorter fire and ready to go times (days to weeks at most), and to all=

a generic move to 45 days could put aeroderivative gas turbine projects in=

I suspect this may be a TDI issue as well.  GE may be having fewer qualifie=

Note, if we go to 45 days for the Seller, the EPC contractor will want the=
