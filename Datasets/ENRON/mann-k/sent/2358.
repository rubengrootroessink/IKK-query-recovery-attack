Hi there,

I'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for 
GE's acknowledgement.  It is pretty close to what you saw last week.  It 
would be a big help if we could have these executed  by GE today or 
tomorrow.  A faxed signature would work, then we could have the originals 
picked up from Lee's office.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kay
