Mercury's Mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the 
best-selling Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle. The problem was, Ford's 
Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases, 
was even more expensive. For 2002, Mercury has attempted to further 
distinguish their sport-ute from the popular Explorer. The result is a fine 
SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content. 
This near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210 
horsepower or a 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies. Both engines come mated 
to a five-speed automatic transmission. The new V8 offers copious and refined 
power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers. 
Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out, and the results are pleasing. 
Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A-pillars forward, its 
"New Edge" theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps. 
Meanwhile, the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents, lending a 
distinctive, high-tech flavor to this former Explorer clone. 
Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic, however. An 
all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame 
design debuts this year. This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches - 
thereby making room for a third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance 
to 9.2 inches. At the same time, ride and handling have been dramatically 
improved. The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits 
flatter cornering characteristics. A 2.5-inch wider stance improves handling 
even more, while increasing interior room. 
Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have also been improved in the 2002 
Mountaineer. A 50-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and 
a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment, 
although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does 
intrude through the floor. 
New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six-way power 
adjustable driver's seat, along with optional adjustable pedals, heated front 
seats and heated exterior mirrors. Among the Mountaineer's new safety 
features are optional side curtain airbags, a stiffer body shell and a lower 
front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles. Later in 
the model year, rollover protection sensors, and a new AdvanceTrac 
traction/stability control system will also be available. 
The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content, powerful engine 
choices and improved rear suspension. There are plenty of SUVs on the market, 
but if you want an Explorer, yet can't stomach the thought of owning the 
golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles, the Mountaineer just might float 
your boat.
