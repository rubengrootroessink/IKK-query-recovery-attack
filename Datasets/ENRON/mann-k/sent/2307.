The stuff is being delivered in accordance with the notice provision of the 
letter agreements, which means the  original goes to "President".  A copy is 
also being delivered to George, so he would be a good one to make 
distribution at Intergen.

Kay:

Per your request, enclosed is a proposed letter to SEL enclosing the final
facility agreements.  I have included a "receipt acknowledged" signature in
the proposed letter, although I believe this is optional as long as our
courier, upon delivery, obtains a signature acknowledging receipt.  Please
advise of any comments.  Thank you.
