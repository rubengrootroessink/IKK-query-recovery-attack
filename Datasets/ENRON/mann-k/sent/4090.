FYI.  Maybe I should take this project if we want to keep AE.

Wanna trade power projects?  I think Rose, Lisa and Herman are right that, 
after Pompano, every other project I work on will be a piece of cake.

I suspect that I am not going to receive a birthday present or Christmas card 
from this fellow.  What do you think?  This is the type of e-mail that we 
usually receive from our friends in California.  Looks like the disease is 
spreading to other areas.

Eric

Enron, do you want war in Florida?

You're going to get it! Take your fat, lawsuit-happy-pig Eric Thode and get 
the fuck out of South Florida!

Take your greedy peaker plants and build them in India where you already 
have a track record of beating and helping to kill locals who protested you 
there.

The nerve of you pricks trying to build plants in family communities and on 
the edge of our National Park.

We will stop you!
