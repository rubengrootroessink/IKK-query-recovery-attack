Nothing from Ben yet.  If I don't hear from him in the next couple of hours, 
then I think we should be ready with an extension letter, giving them a 
couple of days extra for free.  Ben indicated to  me last week that he would 
give them some time once they asked.

MK called with questions on the assignment - nothing serious.
