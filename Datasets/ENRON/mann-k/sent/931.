Hi Paul,

I've been reviewing the draft facilities agreement, which is now getting to 
be a hot topic.  One thing to keep in mind is that we would really prefer 
that the facility agreements not refer to the May 12 agreement, if this is 
possible.  Could you please give this some thought and review the document 
with this in mind?

I look forward to discussing this with you soon.

Thanks,

Kay
