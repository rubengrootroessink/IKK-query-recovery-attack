I can call you when I get out of my meeting, but it might be awhile.  Or, it 
might be 600.  Dunno.

I just left a vm for Carrie explaining what I would like to do. I will leave
you a vm as to the outcome. Sushi sounds good to me. NM

Sounds fine to me.  I would suggest new sushi place if I knew when we would
be getting out.

I haven't heard from Carrie Burton.  I'm on the phone.  If you would like
to call her, St. Francis number is 713 782 0481.

Just let me know before 5 and I will pick it up.
My day? I feel like I lost control of Loss Control about 9am. Is it a full
moon?
Think you will feel like steak after your meeting with the big guys or
would
you prefer something else?

Carrie Burton (works for Sallie Ellis) left a message that it would be a
good idea for us to pick up a packet today.  I was hoping that it would be
ready so I could pick it up a lunch, but it wasn't.  If I hear from her I
will ask how late someone can pick it up, or maybe they can leave it at the
Children's Center since they don't close until 600.

How is your day?

I have a 500 meeting with the big boys.

Love,

Kay
