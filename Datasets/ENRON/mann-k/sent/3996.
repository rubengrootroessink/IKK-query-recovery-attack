Well, here's the nearly final draft of what was submitted.  Evidently, we 
decided to submit a bid on the original transaction structure, as well as two 
alternatives. (not what I was lead to believe before.)  I spoke with John 
about adding more disclaimer language to the letter to say that by submitting 
the bid we aren't agreeing to enter into a transaction or even negotiate for 
a transaction.  Also, I advised him that the confidentiality statements in 
the letter were not great protection.
