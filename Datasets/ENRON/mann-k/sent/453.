Sounds good.

I'm on a conference call that won't end.  I received your fax and will try to 
call you this afternoon.

Subject: Local Government Resolutions

I received today notarized copies of the Resolutions of Support from the
Edgecombe County Commissioners, the City Council and Mayor, and the local
economic development organization, Carolinas Gateway.

I will file them with the Commission when we file the cost data late this
week or early next week.  That would also be a good time to file any project
updates, such as information regarding the generators.
