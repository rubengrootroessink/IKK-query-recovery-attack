Hi.

How's it going?

Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a 
little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.

The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her know 
if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.

I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.  I 
figure you guys have lots of "guy only" stuff coming up, but there aren't a 
lot of "mom/son" opportunities.  (be realistic)  Maybe we should take a 
Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.

Love,

ckm
