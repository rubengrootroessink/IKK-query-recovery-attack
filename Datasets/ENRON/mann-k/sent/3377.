Subject: ENA/PPL Letter Agmt - Still Needs Work

Kay:
 
I just realized that I sent you the blackline of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement without adding the covenant on the part of PPL to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain their financing as we discussed.  I will add
this prior to circulating the letter agreement to the other side tomorrow.  
 
FYI - Greg Lang just called to check on timing.  I advised that Enron was
reviewing the commitment letter internally, and we would not be ready to
respond until Tuesday morning.
