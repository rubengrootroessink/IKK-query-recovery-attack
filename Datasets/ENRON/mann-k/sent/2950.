This is who Sheila suggested.

The deal I'm working on is an asset management/control area services 
transaction.  It will be an odd one, so I'm not expecting someone to have 
specific expertise.  I need help on the general contracting under Miss law 
stuff, especially since there are some quirks involved.  Your input would be 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay
