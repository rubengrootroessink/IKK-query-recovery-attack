Hi again,

I checked my maps of DC, and it looks like the Hotel Washington might be a 
good alternative.  Could you see what they have for Mon/Tues night?  Also, 
please check back with the Willard to see if they have had any cancellations.

Could you email me your telephone number and the afterhours number?

Due to the shortage of time, please call me with any information you might 
have.  I should be in my office from 830 until 930.  Ex 57566  If I'm not 
there, I'll be checking messages.

Thanks,

Kay
