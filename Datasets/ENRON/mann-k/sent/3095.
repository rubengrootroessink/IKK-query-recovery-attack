It seems that I remember seeing something about  this in the Titan claim 
file.  Maybe a copy of it?

I almost felt like saying -- Sorry, John but here's some more bad news.

Randy,

I have just spent an interesting 1/2 hour with Ron Vorhees.  Ron had an MOU 
with EPCC/CIGSA to bid a contract with Pemex to put the Titan II to work back 
in March of 1998.  We obviously lost the bid, but Vorhees claims that we have 
used his company's name and expertise to secure the two drilling rig 
contracts PM-4036 & PM-4037. 

Vorhees also claims that there is a signed agreement between Enron and his 
company to provide consulting services at $125 USD/hour, with a minimum of 80 
hours/month, or $10,000/month, for a duration of 985 days starting in March 
of 1998.  I read the unsigned copy that Ron Vorhees gave me and it is 
specific for the Titan II project that we lost.  I doubt that this agreement 
was actually signed, but in any case I would like you to verify your files  
to see if you could locate such agreement.

Based upon the above, Vorhees feels that Enron owes him $273,000 USD.  I told 
him that Enron will not pay him anything based upon the information that he 
showed me.  He may try to get us either through an alledged agreement or 
because he feels that he was misled when he dealt with EEPC back in 1998.  
His contacts were Bob MacMillan and JamieDunlap.

regards
vladi
