Gloria,

I need to have a redline generated by Comparwrite, as I don't have it loaded 
locally.  The original document is in my Fuel Cell/Equipment contract file, 
and has the same name as the one below, only it is dated October11 (I believe 
rev 2).  The new document is the one below.  Please save the redline verision 
in the same directory, and email the redlined document to me, Heather Kroll, 
Scott Healy, and Stephen Plauche ASAP.

Thanks,

Kay

Per my voice mail, here is the latest draft of the purchase order (we are 
preparing a redlined version which I will send you shortly).  We have not had 
the opportunity to incorporate all the business terms which were discussed 
and agreed to yesterday.  Also, we have not yet completed a full internal 
review of the document.  However, so that we can hold our conference call 
today, I am sending you the draft.  Please give me a call to arrange the 
conference call.
