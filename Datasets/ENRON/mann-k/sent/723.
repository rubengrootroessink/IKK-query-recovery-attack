Hello from Chicago.  I'm in Enron's offices, so I can pick up email.

Once I figure out what is going on with the ENA Legal reorganization, I 
should be able to figure out who to ask about hiring needs.  Then we should 
talk about how to get John into the program.

Maybe EECC has too many lawyers now.  How ironic, considering how busy we 
were this time last year. Things change!

Talk to you soon,

Kay
