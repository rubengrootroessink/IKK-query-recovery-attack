Lisa/Rose,

Attached is the most recent draft of the facility agreement for the 
LM6000's.  This version was prepared for the Austin project and therefore 
lacks any DevCo specific references or requirements. Your input as to any 
lender requirements, as well as the rights and responsibilities of the agent, 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay
