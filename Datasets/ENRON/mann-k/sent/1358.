It is so gross and rainy here!:( I'm supposed to have a tour today, but
Sarah is calling me if anyone shows up because I don't want to walk all the
way there if no one comes. It is SO WET! I'm not really sure about
Thanksgiving. Jennifer is trying to get me a ticket to the game. I feel
bad, but I might decide if I do go to the game to just come up to
Georgetown. I have a TON to do for those next two weeks, and that next
weekend is New Orleans, so I can't get much of anything done. But I might
not even end up going to the game. I really don't know because no one has
found me a ticket yet. And if I do go and we come back Friday, then I'll
come back to school Saturday or Sunday. I guess it's just really too early
for me to speculate because the game is so undecided. I will be home ASAP
on Tuesday, that's for sure. Oh, I'm attaching my resume...I can't decide
what to put in for Enterprise or what to take out to make it one page. Feel
free to play with it and send it off to the proper authorities at Enron.:)
Have a great day. I'll keep you posted with plans as I figure them out.

Love always,

Paige
