I don't have a lot of formal stuff that fits me now - I've gained weight in 
the past 18 months.  I may do a little shopping.

The last conference Ric went to in Vegas he didn't really bring dress 
clothes.  We'll see.  They would have said black tie if it was a formal 
affair (like your trip with Neil).  What are you going to wear?  Do you have 
lots of formal attire?

Tough time of day to dress for, but I think  you have it figured out.

I would think cocktail attire.  What time are the receptions?

This seminar that Ric is going to in Las Vegas is having cocktail receptions 
each evening and special shows by Dana Carvey and Penn and Teller.  There's 
no dress specified, so I'm assuming something nice but not overdone.  What 
would you think?
