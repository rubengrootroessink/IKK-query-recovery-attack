First order of business.  Again, we can discuss this on Monday.

I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a 
telephone call today.  I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos 
is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.  I really 
hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction.  

Talk to you Monday.

NorthWestern has agreed to our request to remove the Corp guarantee from the 
letter.  We will change the dash to reflect the change.
