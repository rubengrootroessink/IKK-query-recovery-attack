Kay  - is there a contract in place between Turbo Park and GE or has the West 
LB contract and all of the change orders been assigned to GE?  If it has been 
assigned then the change order sequential numbers must remain in Place.  If 
you have a new contract in Place then the Change order could be number 0ne.  
Who is maintaining the change order log.  What do you mean by site specific 
stuff?  Who has a copy of the new contract?

Gentlemen,

Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since 
we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process this 
as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we need 
the site specific stuff for this project.  

Kay
