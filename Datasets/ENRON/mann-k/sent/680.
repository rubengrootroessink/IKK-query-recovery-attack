Thanks.  I suspect I'll be in the loop on this one way or the other.  Do you 
want me to send you emails so you know what's up?

This needs to be handeled by Chris Calger's group. I think Bill Williams is 
his point person (Chris will sign it, though).

Regards,

Lee, Chris and Kay:

Attached is a draft of the Change Order #3 for the Las Vegas Cogen project.
Kay, I will be in Houston on Monday through Wednesday afternoon, but will be
busy most of Tuesday.  Lee had hoped that we could get together, or at least
talk, about this and the facility agreement and payment for Change Order #2.
How is your late Monday afternoon looking?

Kent
