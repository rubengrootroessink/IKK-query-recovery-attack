I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really 
help move the document along.  I'll ask again if i can get it from him. There 
are still internal questions in it, which I have annotated. I'm happy for you 
to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive 
commercial direction.

Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I 
haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the 
bogey calc doc is a bit rough.

Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff?

Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge 
problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway to 
combine the two at once, given the short timeframe?

Has Dave signed the extension, by the way?

Kay

Kay,

We are starting to run into some scheduling constraints for next week, at 
least with Bob Priest.  I'd like to get together with Bob and Marvin early 
next week to discuss the agreement--moving toward finalizing before June 12.  
Bob is only available Monday.  Bob and Marvin think it is a good ideal to 
then meet with RW Beck.

I'd like to email Marvin and Bob the next version sometime today?
