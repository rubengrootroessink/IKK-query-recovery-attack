I got a form that consultants sign, and I'll compare them.

Here is the "Form B" that every employee signs.  I am not sure how helpful 
this will be, but I wanted to make sure that whatever we ask the Enron 
employees to sign is consistent, or at least not in conflict with, what they 
have already signed.

Thanks - Gregg
