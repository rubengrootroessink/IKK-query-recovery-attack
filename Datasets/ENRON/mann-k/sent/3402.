I'm swamped.  I got up at 430 to work this am.  Got here at 7 yesterday so I 
could go to the game. 

Those young uns recover quickly, don't they?

Still missing you,

Kay

How are you guys doing?  Nothing new here, I'm just 
hanging out recuperating.  I was up all day yesterday 
and didn't feel too tired.  Of course the real test will 
be when I have to walk a lot!  My incision is still 
pretty tender, but I'm sure that's to be expected.  My 
waistline has gone down about 2 inches though since I've 
lose all that swelling from the infected gallbladder.  
You guys won't recognize me when I return (ha)!

Ruthie is recovering from her surgery a whole lot faster 
than I am.  She's not yelping any more when she gets off 
the bed.

That's about all of my news.  What's going on over there?
