Looks great to me.  I'm glad to know (as a NS customer) that my gas won't
be cut off this COLD November.

Kay - Here is my attempt to turn the term sheet into something executable.
I have accepted all of William Harmon's changes except for the second
paragraph under amended terms.  William used the wording "The payment late
payment amount is calculated...".  I changed it to "The payment interest on
overdue amounts is calculated..." to be consistent with the reference in
the above paragraph.  I don't think this changes any substance, but I defer
to you.  I think that is all I changed.  I also added a quick intro. and a
paragraph on future payments to reiterate this is only for October
purchases.  Neither may be necessary, let me know.  I am not sure your
availability tomorrow, but I would love to hear from you ASAP in the
morning to get this in front of Peoples for signature.  Russell Diamond is
coordinating the internal Enron approvals with Global Finance, Credit and
RAC.

Thanks again for your help on your vacation day.

Gregg
