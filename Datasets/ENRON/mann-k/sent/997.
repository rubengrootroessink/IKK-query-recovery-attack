I thought the conference was pretty good.  I had a great room, with a HUGE 
jacuzzi tub.  Did anyone get promoted?  No one said anything about 
promotions, so I figured nothing interesting happened in that regard.  

I've been throwing out accumulated paper today, cleaned out my person, got 
out some clothes to give to the maid.  It all feels good.

I'm going to do email now.  See you tomorrow!
