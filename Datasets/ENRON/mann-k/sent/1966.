Kay,

I had a copy of the last redline for Exhibit B-1.  Don't have execution
copy.

On Exhibit h-2, Training -- I'll look for it, but think Kathy had it last to
identify it as H-2.

Thanks,

Lee

Lee (and others),

Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic
version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless
there is some reason to handle it otherwise.

Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do you
have more copies of that document that we can attach?

Kay

Folks,

John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for the
ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on Guarantee
Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change to
the Emissions Test Exhibit.

John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2,
this
is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
circulation.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect scope
of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit liability
amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads, guaranteed
delivery schedule for purchased options.

This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire
contract
document.


Regards,

Lee

Kay,

I edited the Termination Schedule replacing the term Purchase Amount per
unit to Unit Liability Amount for consistency with the new structure.

4.   In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.
