What fun.

I know T. Mueller is on holiday.  I suspect he would want AI and St. Paul to 
agree in writing that this doesn't prejudice any rights/constitute a waiver, 
etc.

You may have considered this already, but payment to /request for payment to 
EEPC may trigger the responsibility to pay VAT. 

Good luck, and keep me posted.
