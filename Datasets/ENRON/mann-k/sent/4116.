I'm remembering now.  It was a term sheet which was never executed, as far as 
I know.  I believe FPL prepared it, and we may have commented on it. Let me 
see what I can find.

I don't remember a PPA for Homestead.  I'll check, though.

Kay:

A while ago, you sent me a copy of an FPL PPA for Homestead. Could you please 
resend me the document?

Thanks,

Ben
