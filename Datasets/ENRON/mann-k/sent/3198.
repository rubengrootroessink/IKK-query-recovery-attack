Hi Carlos,

I should be easy to reach on my cell until around 930 Tuesday.  Feel free to 
call.

In my absence you can feel comfortable talking to Jeff.  He seems pretty 
reasonable and easy to talk to.  Plus, he knows a lot about Enron stuff.  You 
will want to discuss the risk memo with him, copying Sheila I guess.  Ask 
Jeff.  Like I said before, I'll back you up on whatever decisions you make, 
for whatever that's worth.  

My folks  number (just in case you lost it) is 817 292 3367.  

Ciao,

Kay
