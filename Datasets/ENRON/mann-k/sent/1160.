I don't know if you got this, so here 'tis.  I was out of town and missed the 
presentation, although I've worked with Herman, Roger and David on these 
issues.  I'm sure they would be glad to give the presentation again for 
others with a need to understand the complexities of off balance sheet 
treatment of power plants.

Herman and I will see you at 10:00am tomorrow to discuss accounting issues 
related to our power plant development and sale activities.

Our presentation will be based upon the following attachment.  

Hard copies will be available tomorrow in 38C2.

Regards.

Could you check with David and see if he could fax copies of the PowerPoint 
plates to me in Portland so we have a fighting chance of following along by 
tying in by phone?    If that is possible, try to send them by Tuesday. Thank 
you very much.
