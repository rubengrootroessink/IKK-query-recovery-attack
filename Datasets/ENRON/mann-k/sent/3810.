Once these changes are made (on Version 5) and the changes received from
the contractor (currently in Version 4) are removed, do you want me to
circulate a blackline against Version 3, which I believe was the last
version seen by Lee Johnson? If so, who do you want to receive copies of
Version 5 of the LV Cogen Agreement?

Peter, from what I can see, the GE E NExt B/O rev 4 doc appears to be
ok.

Please get it signed and the final distributed to us before April 30th.
