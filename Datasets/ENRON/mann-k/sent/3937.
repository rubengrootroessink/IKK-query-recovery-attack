I'll check.  I remember signing the faxes and signing the originals, but not 
the return.  However, last week was the WEEK FROM HELL, so I easily could 
have missed it.

This is really just an excuse to write - did you give me the executed pages?

Thanks,

 Dear Kay,
 
As of this afternoon, we have not received Enron's original signature pages 
for the Letter Agreement and Guaranty.  Have these been forwarded to our 
office?  If so, please advise as to how they were sent and the expected date 
of delivery; if not, please let me know when you will be able to send them.
 
 
Thanks,
Tremaine Wright
