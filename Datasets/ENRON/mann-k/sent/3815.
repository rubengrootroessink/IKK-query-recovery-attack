Ed is the only one I've heard from today.  I've forwarded his questions to 
our local counsel in Mississippi for their input insofar as the questions 
involve capacity to contract.

You'll be pleased to know that I understood his questions.  I'm so proud.

Kay

Subject: Contract comments and Master Agreements

Kay,  just thought I'd check to see how things are progressing.  The only one 
I have heard from is Ed Sacks.  He has some good issues that I cannot 
answer.  I asked him to be available Thursday and think about how he'd like 
to see the structure work from a credit perspective.

Have the Master Gas and Power agreements been forwarded to MDEA, et. al.??

Thanks,

Reagan
