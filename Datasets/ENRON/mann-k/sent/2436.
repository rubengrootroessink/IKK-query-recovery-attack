Hi.

We can get a computer hook up through Time Warner for $15 month.  Could you 
ask John if he likes it?  Can it be installed anywhere in the house?

Thanks,

Kay

Thank you for your participation in our first two pilots.  Your effort, time

We are excited to announce the beginning of Internet Service Ordering today, 
Wednesday, January 10.  Many of our vendors are ready to begin providing

ClickAtHome Internet Service Providers whom are currently available for 
internet service are

MSN will be available in late February, providing both dial-up and DSL
