Sheila,

I just realized that this is at the same time as our GE conference call.  Can 
we adjust the time of the GE call?

I have a feeling that Roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market 
stuff, but I could be wrong. I just don't get the feeling that it is directed 
to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to Turbine Torture.  
Do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask?

I'm expecting a draft of the ABB facility agreement tomorrow.  A & K really 
dropped the ball on that one, although I wish I had expedited them more.  I 
still haven't heard from Kent, despite email, voice mail, and calling Lee.  I 
hope he is ok, because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all.

Did you see that Moby Dick (aka, GE) is swallowing another big fish 
(Honeywell).  I heard it increases their size by a third.  So I guess the 800 
pound gorilla is now a 1066 pound gorilla. (ok, I admit I used the 
calculator).

Talk to you soon,

Kay

See you didn't miss it after all, although we had Herman and David.  It would 
be comforting to know they are saying the same stuff.  Be sure to stop him 
and ask lots of fact specific questions so everyone will understand how  much 
fun this is.   Wish you were here.
