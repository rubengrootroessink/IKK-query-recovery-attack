Subject: Sample SSEP Contract


Attached is a draft of the SSEP standard packaging contract.  This is 
currently
being converted to our EDrafter Web-based format (The business person fills 
in a
database of information and populates the document, which is then sent to the
customer).  Our next phase in this process would actually be to make EDrafter
available to the customers for them to fill it in and work from it in a
ProjectNet extranet workroom environment.

Regardless of what document we end up with in our process, I think we should
consider a similar process for our "template document".  It would be efficient
for the business people (for example, the SSEP sales force can generate the
attached contract in about 10 minutes) and would free up legal time for both
parties.  Just food for thought.
