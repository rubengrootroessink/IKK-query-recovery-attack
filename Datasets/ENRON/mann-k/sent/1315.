Subject: Form Offbalance sheet EPC

Hi, gang. Sheila called last Friday and let me know you were working on this 
off-balance sheet EPC form, and that it was expected to be out on Friday, 
maybe Monday for review and commment, which was needed PDQ becuase of a 
looming project.  I have not seen any copy of the form or had any update on 
the status of the project.

Kay/Dave, could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big 
picture status?
