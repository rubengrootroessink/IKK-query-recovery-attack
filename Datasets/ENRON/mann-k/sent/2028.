I know Ben wants us to substitute the one signed by the other guy.  I'll take 
care of it.

Kay

Can you please fax Karla Hesketh at ABB a copy of the signed change order?  I 
have a copy of the change order with Mike Sandridge's signature on it, but 
I'm not sure which signature page we're using as the final official document 
and therefore which version I should fax to Karla.

Thanks,
Rebecca

Hi  Rebecca,

By any chance did Ben leave a copy of the signed contract change order with 
you?
If so could you fax a copy to me at 713-821-3526.

Thank you,
Karla
