The balance due to GE is being escrowed at closing, with standing 
instructions to release payments to GE on a fixed payment schedule.  I will 
email you the current draft of the instructions.

Kay:

This financing transaction is much more "involved" than others. I know
nothing about Pegasus Power or Salmon.  What comfort are we getting that we
will get paid.  Is there an LOC in place.  Are there guarantees to back up
these debt financing.  Is GE secured in preference to this debt. 

Kent

Hi Kent,

I can get a redline done for you if you want to tell me what it should be
redlined against.

I don't know about getting rid of the requirement for the inhouse counsel
opinion.  Maybe after you look at things we can discuss it.

Thanks,

Kay

     Attached please find the latest Salmon Energy Turbine Agreement
(second document below), as well as a blackline (first document below)
showing changes made to the version circulated last Friday.  Pursuant to
your instructions, the performance values in Article 10 are per the 24
Unit master agreement.  In addition no changes have been made to the
Maximum or Unit Liability Amounts or payment schedule. To complete the
agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.
