Gregg,

Joel is a lawyer with Global Finance.  Since Corp will be loaning the money, 
I contacted that legal group to get their buy in (they are Sarah's lawyers, 
so to speak).  Anyway, I thought the change of name from enovate to enervate 
is priceless.  Enervate= to weaken or destroy the strength or vitality of...

Strange choice for a company name!!!
