Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    



Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)
