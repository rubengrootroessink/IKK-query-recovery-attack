It won't hurt my feelings if you want to contact ABB's lawyer directly. His 
name is Dave Onuscheck, and his email is david.onuscheck@us.abb.com.  I'm 
home with a sick kid, and I don't have his telephone number with me.  

Peter Thompson has worked on the form.  Do you have the draft with the memo 
of issues?
