This is the contract that we said would be the jumping off point (an accurate 
description) for our GE discussions.  As I recall, we need to give it the off 
balance sheet treatment before it is distributed to the masses. Rose, can you 
take responsibility for the basic OBS stuff?  I suggest we discuss assignment 
and indemnity separately (and soon).

My assistant is setting up the legal team's conference call for Wednesday at 
830.  Details to follow.

Kay
