The only ABB change order I know about is the one that cancelled two 
transformers.  It has been signed by ABB  but not Enron, but it is agreed.  
It resulted in a cancellation charge of around $350,000, and obviously 
lowered the contract value.  I'll get a copy and send it to you.

Subject: Change order to the ABB transformer contract

From the below, it does appear that for the PSCo project they want to make a 
change order to the ABB transformers.  I have a call into Ben Jacoby to 
discuss paying in full vs obtaining consents.

Subject: Change order to the ABB transformer contract

Per our phone conversation, here is the latest copy I've seen of Change Order 
#1 to the ABB transformer contract.  Your document should be drafted as 
Change Order #2 and any additional costs should be added to the contract 
total of $7,503,600.00, as amended by Change Order #1.  I'm assuming you'll 
have one of the attorneys on the Fountain Valley project (Al Larsen?) look 
over the language and confirm that the first change order has been executed.
