    Attached please find a clean and blackline of the latest draft of
the Enron South America Break-Out Agreement.  The only changes made to
this version is the addition of today's date and the 72/25 split of
Change Order 3 in Section 6.2.  We are still missing the Agreement
Reference in section 6.7.1.  We haven't made any changes to the exhibits
since the last time they were circulated.  I will pull them out of our
Houston database and circulate them shortly.
