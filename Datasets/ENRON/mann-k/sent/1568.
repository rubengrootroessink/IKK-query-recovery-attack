The referenced section are primarily names and addresses for invoices and 
official notices.

I'll pass the other info along.

Thanks,

Kay, 
I don't have a copy of the GE contract, so I can't look at the sections 
referenced below.  I do have: 

Item #4 below:  I think the guaranteed delivery dates are the still the same, 
as specified in the GE contract:
turbines 9,10,11 October 30, 2000
turbine 12 November 30, 2000
I haven't seen any change orders that amend the delivery dates of these 4 
turbines.

Item #5 below: turbine unit/serial numbers
turbine 9 309266
turbine 10 309307
turbine 11 309376
turbine 12 309398

I've been talking to Rob Taylor at A&K regarding the Austin turbine 
take-out.  I'll forward you the latest email on that topic.

Eric,

Has this info been provided to Andrews and Kurth yet?  It is needed to finish 
the facility agreement for the LM's, especially if you are trying to move 
these out of the existing contract on Monday.

Thanks,

Kay

 Eric,  here are some questions from Peter, the AK lawyer who is working on 
the contract. If you can respond by return email, Peter can keep this moving.


1.  Payee and Address for Invoices referenced in Section 6.7.2 of
the Agreement

 2. Section 6.7.1 Agreement reference [you might see if NEPCO has a reference]

 3. For the recitals, what is the kW capacity of its plant and where
is the plant located?

 4. According to the spreadsheet, the Guaranteed Delivery Dates for
Units 9-11 was 10/30/00.  The Guaranteed Delivery Date for Unit 12 is
11/30/00.  Are these still the dates we are using?

 5. Please provide the serial numbers for Units 9-12 for Section
10.2.1. 

 6. Please provide the names, addresses, etc. for Sections 25.1 and
25.3 


Thanks,

Kay
