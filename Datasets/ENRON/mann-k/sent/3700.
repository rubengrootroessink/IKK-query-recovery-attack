Hi Warren,

I'm going to forward a couple of emails relating to the Delta transaction.  
Please print and set up like you did the Northwestern stuff.

Thanks,

Kay

PS  I'm on a long conference call, but feel free to walk in.

Kay:

Attached are copies of the Salmon promissory note to PPL and the Security
Agreement.  Greg says a Financing Statement is coming from Freshfields.
Greg asked for an ENA letter similar to the GE letter to be signed at escrow
funding agreeing to the execution of these forms at closing.  I will
duplicate the GE letter.  I'm still waiting on his and Isabel's response to
our proposal re the escrow.  Greg advises that the additional language on
the Turbine Contract should be coming shortly.
