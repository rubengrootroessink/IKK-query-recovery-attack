Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question 
concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and 
assumption agreement.

The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being 
subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.  If there is a subsequent 
problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.  I believe Enron has 
coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened 
until there is a certainty of closing.

A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I 
will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this 
transaction.

We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement, 
based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark 
transaction.    I'll make the changes.

Hope this information is helpful.

Kay
