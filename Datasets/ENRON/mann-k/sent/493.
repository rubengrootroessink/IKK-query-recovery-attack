Subject: VEPCO Information Request

To all:

In our last meeting with VEPCO we presented a structure that would 

1).  Allow Enron to sell the Edgecombe plant to VEPCO at a fixed price at the 
end of the term of the PPA (around $325/kW)
2).  Allow VEPCO to buy the plant from us at a fixed price at the end of the 
term of the PPA (around $425/kW).

This structure caps our downside risk into a quantifiable number (it also 
limits our upside but we're willing to give that up to protect against a big 
negative hit).


In order to evaluate this structure, VEPCO has asked for some specific plant 
information.  We have most of this info in various forms and I would like 
your help pulling it together.

1).  Full plant description (equipment, design, drawings)
2).  Construction costs (have we gotten updated NEPCO numbers for this 
project?)
3).  Permits (timeline for obtaining, run hours allowed on both natural gas 
and fuel oil, emission limits)
4).  Fuel contracts (in process).

Please let me know what you have and an estimate on timing to get the rest of 
the request.

If we can negotiate this structure with VEPCO, we will make a significant 
jump in getting the internal okay to move forward.

Thanks for your help,

Heather
