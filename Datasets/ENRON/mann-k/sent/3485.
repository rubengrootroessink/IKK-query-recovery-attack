Would it help if I found the name of some finance contact at Delta Power?

I'm thinking attorneys need a wholly-owned sub to do our overflow work.  I
had to draw a picture for this transaction - the finance people are taking
over

I'd better ask Delta on that one, since there is a financing involved.  I
believe PP to be a wholly owned sub/project co, but I'll confirm.

What is the relationship between Delta Power and Pegasus/Salmon.  I feel
like I'm playing that game called "Telephone"

PP will own 80% of SE, Enron owning the remaining 20%.
