I'm just afraid to say anything about anything because of what you said the 
other night about, gee you can't do anything right.  I guess I'm a little 
upset because you comment on how I do things (I don't even try to fold 
clothes, pack the car, unpack the groceries, load the dishwasher, etc.) but 
if I say something about how you do something, you get upset and say you 
can't do anything right (so I should feel guilty about saying anything about 
anything).

Gotta go.  We can talk about it later if you want.

Love,

Kay
