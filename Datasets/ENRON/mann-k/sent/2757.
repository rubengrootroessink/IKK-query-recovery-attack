John and Randy,

I got a call from Bob Sevitz regarding a change I made to the EECC revisions 
to the Co Op City EPC contract.  Specifically, I deleted language he had 
added to the waiver of consequential damages.  Bob had added a provision that 
said that the waiver was "subject to" the indemnification section of the 
contract.  I felt this was too broad of a carve out, especially from the 
contractor's point of view.   Any tweaking of the indemnity language (to 
blatantly reconcile it with the waiver) can occur during the drafting process.

Just wanted to pass this along.

Kay
