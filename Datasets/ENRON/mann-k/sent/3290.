We need to cancel Michael's appt with Sharon for that Monday.  Also, why 
don't you try to find at least 2 people to go with you to the Astro's game on 
Tueday.  I'll come if I can.

Yes. I fly out at 2:30 on Monday the 9th and return 10:30pm Tuesday night. I
can try to attend another meeting if necessary. This is for all the officers
but they are doing it in small groups so I would think it would not be a
problem. Honestly, I would like to change it since I fly back to Houston
Sunday morning the 8th from Orlando. I'm not as good at traveling as you.

I only have you out on April 5 and 6 on my calendar.  Is there another day?
