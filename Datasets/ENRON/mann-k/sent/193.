Here's another draft:



Note in particular changes in exclusivity (now bilateral), tax abatement 
(exh. A), termination rights, term.  I also made a minor change to dispute 
resolution.  As for their hesitancy to give us trade secrets, these should be 
covered by the confidentiality provisions, although this version is very 
basic (see underlined language).  I just want to make sure we get the gas 
supply contract ASAP. We can do a full blown confidentiality agreement that 
helps.  

I never heard back from Dutch Bumgardner.  I'll get the interconnection 
agreement started on this end, unless you think otherwise.

Hope you are having a good trip.

Kay
