It is amazing what I find if I check my email.  Disregard the request for 
escrow agreements!

The escrow agreements and fee schedule appear fine to me.  If you have any

Attached are what I hope are the final and execution copies of the three
escrow agreements as well as the schedule of fees. Changes are highlighted
in red.  Please forward your comments to me.

Thanks,
  Lari
