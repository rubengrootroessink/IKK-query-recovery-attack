Hi Karen,

Our accounting contact is leaving tomorrow at 100, so it would be helpful to 
get this information as soon as possible.  It would also help if you could 
send a redline against the version I had sent you, as this was the last draft 
reviewed by Accounting.

Thanks,

Kay

Karen,

Please send me the revised version with the language you believe reflects 
Rusty's suggestion. Otherwise, I will have to go to Accounting twice.

Please email me with the specific performance language you want to add to 
meet their request.

Thank you,

Kay
