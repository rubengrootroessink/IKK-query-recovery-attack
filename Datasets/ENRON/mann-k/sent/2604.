Kay:

I don't see a problem with reaching agreement on one form (Kendall LLC) and 
then duplicating it for the Titan project if we transact on both.

I am expecting a call this morning from PSEG's developer to discuss site 
visit(s) and the due diligence binder(s).  I believe that they are serious on 
moving forward on the Kendall project.  I will determine their interest in 
transacting on the Titan project.

Since we are not asking for any money down, I would like to be able to keep 
marketing the sites until the transaction closes.  

It is still unclear to me how the closing would go on this deal.  Would they 
sign the SPA and wire the money simultaneous with our signing over the LLC 
member interests or would these events occur on two different dates?  Let me 
know how you see it happening.  It seems to me that we could make it all 
happen at one time.

On the NRG call, I am waiting to hear back from NRG.  Based on my discussions 
with them yesterday, Friday is looking like a tough day for the call (Ben is 
unavailable in the afternoon and the NRG guys are travelling in the 
morning).  Either it will happen Friday afternoon without you/Ben (commercial 
issues only) or we will set it up for Monday.

Fred

Fred,

If we have the same purchaser for both, it would be a lot easier to agree to 
the form, then duplicate it.  Do you see any problem with this? I will have 
to have the electronic form emailed to me, then I can make the changes.  I 
brought the hard copy, but I don't have access to the electronic form. Have 
they indicated if they want to go forward with this, or are they still 
kicking tires?  I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's 
most important, especially since I'm on the road.  Do we want to continue 
marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination?  
I don't think 3 weeks would be a problem after signing.  No TurboPark!!!

On the issue of the conference call Friday, I have a meeting with the 
customer which starts in the am, then I'm on the road.  Monday would be 1000 
times better, if this is at all possible.  In that won't work, I will have 
more details about timing of my Friday meeting tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay
