I'll get the draft working, but it would probably be a good idea to discuss 
this a bit.

Subject: Draft CA for curves

Kay - We have previously discussed the idea of a CA to specifically cover the 
curves.  We need to put this at the top of the list for this week.  Can you 
prepare a CA for the distribution of enovate curves to specific individuals 
at Peoples?  I would like it to read as follows:
Basis and Index curves will be provided daily for all points at which enovate 
has a position, whether hedged or open, to specific individuals employed in 
the risk management area.  (Individuals should be named on a schedule).
Curves are being provided for the express purpose of independent risk 
analysis of the enovate portfolio by Peoples Risk Management personnel.   

In return, the specific individuals will not forward, copy, or otherwise 
distribute the curves to any individual not on the approved schedule.  No 
communications, written or verbal, will be made to any person other than the 
enovate GM or the Enron designated enovate risk committee member regarding 
any aspect of the curves.  

I need some language regarding audit rights, but this should get you 
started.  Call me to discuss.

Gregg
