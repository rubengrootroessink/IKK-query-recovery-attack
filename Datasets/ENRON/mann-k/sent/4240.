Hi Ben,

I've given it a quick look. Looks a lot different from when I last saw it.  I 
don't see a triggering event on the obligations in 2 a.  Was there another 
fix agreed to by all (maybe the "as required by law" language?)  Also, any 
idea why the service charge language was deleted in b?  Maybe it isn't a 
problem.  Also, do you have a copyy of the site plan approval?  

Talk to you soon,

Kay
