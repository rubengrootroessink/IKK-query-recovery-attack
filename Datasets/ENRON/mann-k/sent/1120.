Hi Dale,

I would contact Kathy Clark.  As far as I know, there have been no change 
orders (unless my memory is failing, which is a possibility!).

Kay:  Do you know whether EE&CC has someone keeping watch over the ABB 
transformer contract & associated change orders, and if so, who that might 
be?  I need to get a good read on what CO number we are up to, etc.

Hope things are well with you.

Dale, will you get involved in this change order as well? Hopefully, this one 
will be much simpler than the GE change order since we are just changing 
design parameters for two units on the existing order. Ed has already 
indicated an ok for this added expenditure.

Jody, can you assist again? Sorry, but I will be in Las Vegas again until 
next Wednesday. I'm available by cell phone (503-703-4600) if I need to do 
something on this or there are any questions. The ABB e-mail contains the 
transformer identifier numbers and new parameters. My conference call notes 
of the requested changes are also attached. The total losses for the loss 
guarantee increase from 218 to 240 kW per the attached. The original contract 
is in the file and another copy is on my desk for reference if needed. I 
think all the information is here and just needs to be put into the proper 
format. Thanks.

We confirm that we wish to proceed with the changes as discussed in our 
conference call and described in your e-mail included below. We will promptly 
initiate a change order to the original contract with ABB that included the 
purchase of these two units in the amount of $99,000 (two units at $49,500 
each).

Mike,
     As requested, we have looked at the original design of the Enron Las 
Vegas
84/112/140MVA units (SO# LNL9518-1 & -2) and find that we can not be compliant
with the items as described in Don Hammond's conference call notes as shown
below , unless we do a re-design.  We can still build the adjusted units in 
the
original production schedules, given the timely authority to proceed in that 
new
direction.  If the units are built according to the new re-designed 
parameters ,
ABB would have to make the necessary material and performance changes to get 
to
Enron's desired characteristics, especially for the impedance change and the
necessity to perform in a higher ambient temperature.

     Overall this re-design will require a price adder to each of the 2
transformers, of $49,500.00/each .  Key factors in this cost adder would be 
the
engineering re-design effort, the additional radiators required, and the use 
of
high delivery fans.  The overall footprint dimensions and guaranteed 
performance
of the transformer also must be adjusted to meet the new parameters requested 
,
as follows:

Characteristic      New Design           Original Design

H/X Impedance       13%            9%
Ambient Temp        46 degree C          40 degree C
Sound (dBA)         70/72/73       70/72/73
Overall Length      315"           350"
Overall Depth       238            195
Overall Height      232            243
NL Losses(KW)  43             57
Load Losses(KW)     197            161
Total (KW)          240            218
Aux Losses(KW) 9              6.5

     Please provide this data to Enron and confirm that we are to proceed with
this adjustment ASAP, so that we can complete engineering on the new design, 
and
then provide the drawing information that Enron has requested from our 
drafting
department. That drafting effort has been put on hold until these redesign
issues are resolved.  The confirming Enron change notice for the technical and
the monetary changes will also be required.

     Please advise when you think that we will have feedback on these changes
from Enron.
     Thanks
     Frank
