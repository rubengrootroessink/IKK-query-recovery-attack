Hi Lupe,

I heard a rumor that Tribasa had found somebody to buy out the loan.  Another 
victim, perhaps?

I can't imagine how you must have felt to get a call from Don.  Maybe he's 
looking for a new opportunity in Mexico, since Bufete didn't pan out.

I've been busy working on a read deal with some very bright commercial 
people.  It is very challenging.  Sometimes I feel so uninformed.  This is a 
nice change! I feel like it is elevating my professional development.

I ran into Chip recently.  He seems happier now that he has Erik's old job.

More hugs - 

Kay

Hi Kay, how is life in Enron? I thought about you yesterday because I ran
into our Tribasa friends, and among other things they told me they were
going to pay Enron today the remaining 100% of the loan!! I still cannot
believe it! Anyway, something must be going on, because belive it or not,
Don has been calling me, which I find somewhat disturbing. Maybe he doesnt
remember I dont work for him anymore!
Well hope everything is going well.
Big hug. Lupe.
