Hi Heather,

Don't have the answers to your questions, but I wanted you to see the 
attachment to Gregg's email.  It outlines some of the commercial aspects of 
the loan agreement, although it might not be in a form you can easily 
decipher.

1.  I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change.  I asked around 
yesterday, and I have someone checking it out.  Initially going through Corp 
(vs. ENA) made it a bit more complicated to track down.

2.  I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review.  I think that 
the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of 
reference to a named guideline or procedure, or by attachment as an exhibit.  
I will resend the email for your easy reference.

Hope this helps.

Kay

Subject: More stuff

1-Is there anything left to do to change the name under the LLC agreement to 
enovate?
   2-I am attaching the overview cash protocol that was discussed during our 
meeting with Treasury, Accounting and Finance.  Who can begin crafting a 
services agreement around this template?  

That's it for this moment.

Thanks,

Gregg
