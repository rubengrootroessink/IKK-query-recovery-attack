I've taken a stab at revising the consent agreement to reflect the following 
changes:

Adding a material adverse effect clause - Lisa/Rose, I paraphrased on this.  
Making the consent effective the later or signing or financing.

I have ZERO pride in authorship.  This is based on ESA, but I would think 
would apply to TP as well.

I think we should get this to GE no later than 1000 am tomorrow if at all 
possible.
