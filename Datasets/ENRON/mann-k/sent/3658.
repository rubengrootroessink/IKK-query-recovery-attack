I will prepare a first draft of this requested CA for Matt Gimble 
(bialateral) in connection with discussions with Seminole Electric 
Cooperative, Inc. out of Tampa, Florida.

Additionally, Michael Brown has requested a bilateral CA with an entity (name 
unknown at this time) that is a load aggrigator and site developer.  Enron 
will be giving proposals, ideas and "propriatary intelectual capital" and the 
term will be for 1 year.  The catch is, Michael wants language in the CA that 
the "Unknown at this time party" can not shop our proposals.  I will work on 
a first draft of this one too.

Kate,

Regarding the Confidentiality Agreement that we need for Seminole Electric, 
the following are the items that we would like to include:

One year term
Construction of a 500 - 1,200MW coal facility expansion to Seminole's 
Palatka, FL power plant
Construction of a 500 - 1,200MW coal facility at Seminole's Taylor Co., FL 
site
plus whatever confidentiality lingo that is normally added

Let me know what I left out (David? Bruce?)

Thanks,
Mathew
