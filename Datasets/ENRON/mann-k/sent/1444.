Hi John,

Thanks for your call the other day.  The team is currently focused on getting 
the funding approved, as you can see from the attached.  Also, we have had 
some discussions with Fuel Cells about the contract to purchase the 
equipment.  I expect to forward a draft to you soon for a sanity check.  It 
may be a Connecticut law contract due to the State's involvement.  The next 
big item will be the project development agreement.  The tax credit 
monetization is still on the horizon, and if the funding approval is granted, 
we will want to talk about your sense of how that might work.

Again, thanks for checking  in.

Kay
