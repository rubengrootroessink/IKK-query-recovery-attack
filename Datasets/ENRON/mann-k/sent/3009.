Well, that's one reason why I don't think there's a lot of risk to it.  I 
know in previous deals the GE frame guys have agreed that we could give three 
redacted copies to suitors, and the real one to THE ONE.  I think a casual 
conversation will work.  The guarantees are nothing special, although the LD 
ramp rates sometimes matter.  Lastly is delivery, but again, I don't think it 
will be a big issue.

Maybe if Jake knows that he probably won't have to tell Lee who the suitors 
are, that might help.

Thanks for the update.  I suggested to Jake that he do that (but perhaps too 
obliquely) yesterday.  I will ask directly that he make it so.

What is your sense as to the things that need to be redacted?  The breakout 
contract is structured in terms of what remains to be paid (rather than what 
the overall purchase price was).  I had understood that this was the subject 
matter that GE is most sensitive to.

Neither have us have spoken to GE.  I think Sheila spoke to Lee, but I don't 
know the substance of the conversation.  We asked his permission  on the 
Intergen deal, I believe.  I told Jake last night that there are arguments 
which can be made on both sides as to whether GE needed too consent to having 
the contract distributed to a potential partner.  He said he wanted to talk 
to you about it.

My suggestion would be that someone on the commercial side discuss the 
general status, and ask if it is ok to send out a redacted contract.  That is 
the most conservative approach.

Carlos:  Jake is hoping to get a copy of the turbine contract out to Delta 
this afternoon.  

Do you know whether anyone has approached GE for consent to disclose the 
contracts to potential purchasers?

It sounded yesterday as though the form of contract may be changing, anyway.  
Either way, GE's consent is probably required.  Do you agree?

Would you or Kay mind coordinating with Jake how and when the document can go 
out?
