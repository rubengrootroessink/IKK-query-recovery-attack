Kay,

Please have the appropriate managing directors and officers of CAED I
and CAED II execute the attached resignations and return the executed
resignations to Doug Pedigo.  If any other persons were manging
directors or officers of CAED I or CAED II prior to closing, please have
them execute similar resignations and furnish them to Doug.  Thanks.

George
