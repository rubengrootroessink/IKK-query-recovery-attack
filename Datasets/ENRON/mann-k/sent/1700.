Hi Guys,

In a conversation with GE today, they indicated that they thought it would be 
appropriate to insert the performance values in the text of the document, and 
do away with the exhibit.  Frankly, I like that approach also.  Could you 
please make that revision and resend the document?

Thanks,

Kay
