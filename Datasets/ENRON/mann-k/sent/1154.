ESA, EECC and Finance Teams,

Attached for your review is the Electrobolt EPC Contract (our doc # 
39444.04), which incorporates the negotiated provisions of the Electrobolt 
MOU.  To assist you in your review, I have also attached (1) a blackline of 
the Electrobolt EPC marked to show all changes from the RioGen EPC Contract 
distributed October 17, and (2) a blackline of the Electrobolt EPC marked to 
show all revisions to the EECC form EPC contract.

Please note that the comparison document, prepared by DeltaView, shows new 
text in blue double underscore, deleted text in red strikethrough, and moved 
text in green (double underscore at the new location, strikethrough from 
where moved).

Please call if you have questions/comments.

Regards,
Dave Gohlke
