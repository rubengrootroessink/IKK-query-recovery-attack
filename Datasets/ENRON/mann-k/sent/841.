We are staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, which is nice.  There will 
be a private party as SeaWorld, which could be fun. They usually do 
everything first class all the way, since it is the officers shindig.  I get 
to see some nice people I only see once a year.  Everyone parties hard, too.

Diet time!  I've done ok so far, considering the travel.  This means I've 
lost the weight I gained when I was on the road every week.

I will put this on our calendars.  Too bad you won't make the Compaq thing, 
but maybe next year.  San Antonio, wow what a let down from the other 
cities.  That will be a nice time of year though.  I can recommend some good 
restaurants since I took Ric there last year for his birthday.  We stayed at 
the Menger and had a great time.

This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at  St. Francis, which may be his new 
school (so far, so good).  I'll be in around1000

Most Fridays I'm going to TRY to pick Michael up since I'm away so much, 
which means leaving by 445 or so.

October 4, ENA orientation in the am.

October 19/20, Neil is out of town, so I have to pick Michael up from school 
(leave at 430)

October 26/27, hope to be vacation time.  Neil has a meeting in San Antonio 
(usually it is in Miami, San Francisco, Phoenix - not so great this year).  
It is the officer's meeting for Enterprise, and spouses are invited.  This 
means we won't be in town for the Compaq thing. Figures, of course.  Thanks 
for asking.

I'm watching for some good vacation days, also...
