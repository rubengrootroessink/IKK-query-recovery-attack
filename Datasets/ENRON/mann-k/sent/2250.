I kinda hate to leave the premises since the sitter isn't sitting for us.  
However, it is supposed to be a beautiful evening, so we can have some adult 
time on the back patio.

I put a couple of steaks in the fridge.

Love,

ckm

You should have said something. I could have waited for Michael to finish
eating and taken him to school.
Would you like to go out tonight? Sounds like we can at least meet somewhere
after work. Let me know. Love, Neil

Hi.  I'm at home, trying to waiting to visit GE's offices which are at 610
and 290.

Michael has been invited to have pizza with Stephen this evening.  Tommy
and Julie are going out, and Stephen has a sitter (Sam won't be there), so
he wanted to have a buddy over for pizza.  I told Julie that Michael's
calendar is open for this evening.  Hope that is ok for you.
