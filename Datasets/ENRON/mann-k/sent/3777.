Attached please find the latest LV Cogen Turbine Agreement (first
document below) that incorporates the changes received from Dale on
April 17, as well as a blackline (second document below) showing changes
made to the version circulated on April 10. As I mentioned in my prior
e-mail, the April 17 comments referred to an earlier version that
referenced Turbines no longer in this deal. As a result, I only changed
the Guaranteed Delivery Date for Unit 24. To complete the agreement, we
will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.
