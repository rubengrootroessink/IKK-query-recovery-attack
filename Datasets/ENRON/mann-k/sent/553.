Hi John,

Looks like it is worthwhile to finish up what you were working on before.  

Thanks,

Kay

     Tammy,

     I decided to go ahead and draft the Consignment Agreement in the
     interest of saving time. I'll send you a copy later today, but I
     thought you might want to let Bob know so we don't duplicate efforts.
     The Agreement will generally follow the form of the Mitsubishi
     agreement.

     Steve
