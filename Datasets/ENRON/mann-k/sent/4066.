Hi Rebecca,

I'm trying to locate the sig pages for the NW guaranty.  These were the docs 
that I approved after I had approved the letter agreement.  These signed 
pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me.  
To you remember if you brought them to me before?  I haven't really searched 
- I thought I would ask first.

Thanks,

Kay
