Hi there,

We've had about 15 minutes of rain, I think.  Just enough to keep the 
mosquitos happy!  

Kay

Hi Sweetheart. Yes we did get a little rain this morning.Just glad to get
some,at least we won't have to water today.A nice high tide but they had
sold out of bait when Dad went down. It is great that Charlotte will be
able to visit with Michael tonight. Hope you and Neil have fun at the
party. I bet it was a thrill to see Sammy hit the home run. I guess Paige
is at school? We are fine. Love you,Mother
