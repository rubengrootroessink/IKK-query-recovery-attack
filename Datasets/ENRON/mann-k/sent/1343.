ARTICLE X.  PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES AND ACCEPTANCE

  =20
10.1   Performance Guarantees. Seller guarantees that each Unit will meet t=
he=20
Performance Standards for Electrical Output, Efficiency, Water Consumption,=
=20
Noise and Emissions as set forth in Section 10.2, when Performance Tests ar=
e=20
conducted in accordance with the Performance Test Procedures.

10.2  Performance Standards. Each Unit shall meet Performance Standards as=
=20
described in this Article and as set forth in the following table below in=
=20
order to achieve Acceptance:

=092MW Power Plants=092.4MW Power Plants=093.0 MW Power Plants
Electrical Output, kW=092000 kW=092400 kW=09
Heat Rate (LVH)=0948%=0948%=09
Water Consumption=09600 gal/h=09620 gal/h=09
Sound level=0965 dB(A) at 100 feet=0965 dB(A) at 100 feet=09
Emissions=09=09=09
Nox=09<1 ppmv=09<1 ppmv=09
SOx=09<0.1 ppmv=09<0.1 ppmv=09
CO=09<20 ppmv=09<20 ppmv=09
VOC=09<20 ppmv=09<20 ppmv=09
Particulates=09<100 mg/m3=09<100 mg/m3=09


10.2.1   Heat Rate Guarantee.  Seller guarantees that the Heat Rate as=20
measured for each of the Units=20
as demonstrated during the Performance Test, shall be __BTU/kWh. In the eve=
nt=20
the Heat Rate exceeds the Minimum Heat Rate Guarantee, Seller shall take al=
l=20
necessary actions to correct, retest the deficient Unit and cause the=20
deficient Unit to meet the Minimum Heat Rate Guarantee.  Failure to meet th=
e=20
Heat Rate Guarantee shall prevent Acceptance, unless Purchaser explicitly=
=20
waives this guarantee in writing. =20

10.3.2   Electrical Output Guarantee.  Seller guarantees that the Electrica=
l=20
Output of each Unit as demonstrated in the  most recent Performance Test=20
shall be equal or greater than 2000 kW (for a 2.0 MW Unit), 2400 kW (for a=
=20
2.4 MW) Unit, and 3000kW (for a 3.0 MW Unit). [Is this a net number?  Where=
=20
is it measured?]
 =20
10.3.3   Emissions Guarantee. Seller guarantees that the emissions of the=
=20
[Unit] for the above listed categories when the [Unit] is operated=20
[conditions?]

10.3.4   Water Consumption Guarantee.=20

10.3.5 [Sound Guarantee. Seller guarantees that the near field average=20
A-weighted sound pressure levels of the [Unit?  Facility?] shall not exceed=
=20
65dB(a) 9referenced to 20 micropascals) when measured during the Performanc=
e=20
Test at one and a half (1.5) meters above the ground level and one (1) mete=
r=20
from the surface of the Equipment.]

10.3.6 Reliability.

10.4    Remedy for Failures to Meet Performance Guarantees.  Except as=20
specified in Section 10._] the failure to achieve the Performance Guarantee=
s=20
by the Acceptance Deadline [to be defined] shall constitute a default under=
=20
this Agreement, and Purchaser shall have the remedies specified in Article =
[].

10.5   Testing.

10.5.1   Notice of Installation Completion; Conducting Tests. Seller shall=
=20
deliver Notice to Purchaser that a Unit has achieved Installation Completio=
n=20
so that the Unit is ready to be tested.  Within [fourteen (14) days] of=20
receipt of this Notice, Purchaser shall perform the Performance Tests in=20
accordance with the Performance Test Procedure; however, Purchaser shall no=
t=20
be required to conduct Performance Tests prior to [] days from the Delivery=
=20
Date, or date of actual delivery, whichever is latest. Purchaser shall give=
=20
Seller five (5) days notice of the time of the Performance Tests. Seller=20
shall be present or to have a representative present at the Performance=20
Tests, and shall provide technical advice during the tests; however,=20
Purchaser may at its option conduct the test without Seller, assuming notic=
e=20
was properly given in accordance with this section.

10.5.2   Test Results. Performance Tests shall be conducted on a unit-by-un=
it=20
basis. Upon the completion of each Performance Test Purchaser will issue a=
=20
Performance Test Certificate setting forth the results achieved during such=
=20
test.  In the case of multiple Performance Tests on a Unit, performance sha=
ll=20
be measured by the most recent Performance Test.

10.5.3   Costs of  Retests.  If one or more additional Acceptance Tests are=
=20
required doe to the failure of a Unit to pass its Acceptance Test, Seller=
=20
will bear the additional costs (if any) incurred by Purchaser [in excess of=
=20
those costs normally associated with operating the Unit]. Such additional=
=20
costs may include, but not be limited to, cost of testing, instrumentation,=
=20
fuel, consumable spare parts, and additional personnel required to conduct=
=20
the tests.

10.6   Acceptance.  Upon the successful completion of the Performance Test=
=20
for a Unit, Seller shall submit a Performance Test Certificate to Purchaser=
=20
indicating that a Unit has achieved the Performance Standards and it ready=
=20
for Acceptance.  Purchaser shall within ten  (10) days of receipt of such=
=20
Performance Test Certificate, either sign such certificate acknowledging=20
concurrence or reject such certificate specifically stating the reasons for=
=20
such rejection. Acceptance for each Unit (and its associated Equipment) sha=
ll=20
occur upon the issuance of the Performance Test Certificate by Purchaser as=
 a=20
result of the Unit having met the Performance Guarantees.  Acceptance of th=
e=20
each Unit to be installed in a Facility shall occur when all of the followi=
ng=20
have occurred:=20

(a) the issuance of a Performance Test Certificate by Purchaser as a result=
=20
of a Performance Test indicating that the final Unit has met the Performanc=
e=20
Standards;

(b) all completion of training  and the delivery of O & M Manuals and speci=
al=20
tools required hereunder shall have occurred;

(c) Seller has delivered to Purchaser a waiver of liens in form as shown in=
=20
Exhibit-S that have been or could have been placed upon the Equipment and=
=20
that there are no outstanding claims of Seller or any Vendor with respect t=
o=20
the Equipment for that particular Facility;

(d) all of the Units in the Facility have achieved Installation Completion.=
=20
[and there are no punch list items remaining to be completed.]

10.7 Obligation to Improve Performance.  If the Performance Test should=20
indicate that a Unit has met the Specific Performance Guarantees but not th=
e=20
Guaranteed Performance Criteria, then for a period of ninety (90) days=20
following the Performance Test Seller shall have the obligation to use=20
reasonable efforts to improve performance so that the Guaranteed  Performan=
ce=20
Criteria are met. Such efforts shall be at Seller=01,s sole cost and risk.=
=20
Performance Tests shall be conducted in accordance with this Article. =20

10.8    Reduced Purchase Amount for Failing to Meet Guaranteed Performance=
=20
Levels.  Should the Performance Test of a Unit demonstrate that the Unit ha=
s=20
met the Performance Standards except for the Electrical Output Performance=
=20
Standard, the Purchase Amount related to that Unit shall be reduced by the=
=20
percent by which the Unit fails to meet the Power Output/kW Performance=20
Standard, so long as the Unit has achieved ninety percent of the guaranteed=
=20
level. Seller shall within 30 days refund any prior payment received for th=
e=20
Unit in excess of the reduced Purchase Amount.
