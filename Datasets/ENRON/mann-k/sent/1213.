We can do the 11:00 call later this afternoon if that works better with your 
son.  Just let me know.  I am flexible today.

Hi Gregg,

I'm home with my sick son this am.  (It was one of those 102 plus fevers at 
430 this morning.)  I've asked the temp assistant to have my enovate stuff 
sent out so we can get some work done.

Talk to you later,

Kay
