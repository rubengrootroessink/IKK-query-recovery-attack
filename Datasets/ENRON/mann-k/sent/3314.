Just go ahead and turn it, putting in a [Note:] for any missing pieces.  That 
will make it easy for me to search. 

Thanks, and have a good weekend.

Kay

Will do.  Do you have the serial number and delivery date for the new
turbine?  Do you have the specifics on how the payment schedule will
change? Do you want me to wait for that info before I turn the new
draft?  I need to leave the office today no later than 3:45 CST.

Yes.  How's that for an answer.

I think you want to revise against this version, since this is the
latest
version Lee has seen, then blackline against the 20th version.

THANKS!!!

Kay

No problem.  I left you a voice mail message.  This looks like the
agreement that I made these revisions to and sent to Carlos Sole (and
copied you on) on March 20.  That agreement deleted the agency
references, etc. and included Lee Johnson's changes to some of the
specific performasnce guarantees in Article 10.  It did not, however,
include turbine 28. Let me know if you want me to revise the atached
document or the one I sent to Carlos.

Hi Pete,

I have a fire drill for you.  This contract needs to between Salmon
Energy
LLC and GE, with no agency reference.  In other words, a CA Development
form.  Any chance of getting this today?

The delivery dates on one of the turbines will be changing, as is the
payment schedule.  Also, the designation of one of the turbines will
change.  Salmon will be receiving units 19, 20, 23 and 28 (a new one).

Thanks,

Kay

Bill Williams has confirmed that the attached version of the LVC-2
contract
is the final form.  I have added a footer stamp identifying it as "Rev 5
-
3/27/01".  Everything else is identical to the draft circulated March
12.


The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.

Thanks.
