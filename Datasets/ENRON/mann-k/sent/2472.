Gentlemen,

I have made the revisions to paragraphs 16 and 22 as suggested.  I have also 
changed the state designation of the Tarheel notary to Texas.

If this version is acceptable, we will execute originals and forward to you.  
Do you need more than one original for the optionor?

Thank you,

Kay
