I believe that this is the most recent version.  Lee, check the dates to make
sure they are right.

Kent,

Please send Kay the Amendment #4 draft (shedule change for Units 19,20,23,24).
I think you had it last.  I can't seem to find it either.

Lee,

Your changes to the letter look fine to me.

I'm attaching the latest version I have on change order #2.  Are we ready
to go with this one?

(See attached file: changeorder#2rev7.doc)

We would like to close out #3 and #4 soon.  I believe GE prepared #4.
Could you send me a copy of the latest draft of #4, as it was inadvertently
deleted from my computer. Meanwhile, I'll work to get you a draft of #3.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for
sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that
deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing
of
performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than
prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an
impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other
consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract.

I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections.

Thanks,

Lee
