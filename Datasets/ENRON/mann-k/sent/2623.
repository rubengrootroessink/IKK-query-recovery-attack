Opps.  I thought we were talking about the same CO.  Could you please send 
me  a copy (or electronic file) of the letter you are incorporating by 
reference?

This CO will need to be signed by Janet Dietrich, Managing Director.

Is the replacement N-1 the same as the replacement N-1 in CO #2?

I'll give this the final once over as soon as I get the letter.

Thanks (and sorry for the confusion),

Kay
