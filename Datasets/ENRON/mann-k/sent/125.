Hi guys,

Here are some quick thoughts:

2.10  Suggest we delete "specific" from second line.  
3.3  (i)To protect cash flow neutral status we need to get the money a couple 
of business days before date due.
6.2  We need to discuss changes which could materially impact the value of 
the agreement to MEH, not just the risks/responsibilities.

I'd bracket the concept of what the Admin Service Fee is supposed to cover.  
Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing 
docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?  I think we probably need to 
limit our role to "short of litigation" type stuff.   Maybe "reasonable 
efforts, short of litigation", something like that?

That's all for the first quick read.  

Kay

Subject: Agency Agreement


As we discussed, in an effort to forward our internal discussions and 
memorialize the results of our discussions in Chicago last week, Boyd and I 
have produced a new draft of the Agency Agreement.  The changes can be 
inspected by launching the attachment in Word and then going to Tools --- 
Track Changes --- Highlight Changes to display and print the changes in the 
document.

A number of questions must be addressed.  They include, in no particular 
order:

Can we delete the confidentiality article?

Is it commercially important to restore the langauge on displacement 
deliveries?

What will the compensation arrangements be?

Are we willing to deduct the administrative fee from the net cumulative 
revenues?  [Doing so "loses" us $10,000 a month.]

Will we collect accounts receivable directly or have payments made to a 
deposit account in which we will retain a security interest?

How should Section 2.9(ii) be recast to allay Boyd's regulatory approval 
concern?

Is the new Section 2.10 acceptable?

How must the agreement change to reflect the "two county" concern?

I look forward to discussing this with you at your convenience.  DT
