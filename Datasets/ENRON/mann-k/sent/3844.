Might close on the letter agreement today.  You didn't miss much - mostly 
negotiations with GE re: change orders. Our tax guys are happy, and 
Accounting is hanging in there.  We have revised the payment schedule in the 
doc, but NW doesn't have the change.  I'll send it to you.  The change is 
minor.  I need to revise the assignment/assumption agreement, then we'll be 
ready to go when GE signs up to the CO's.
