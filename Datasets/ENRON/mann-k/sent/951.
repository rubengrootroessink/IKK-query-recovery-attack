Subject: Re: LM6K Change Order #2  

I suggest the changes as shown on the attached.  

Chris is researching a drawing number so that we have them committed to a 
certain specification.



I've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery.  I'm referring to 
these as "Equipment" and part of the "Units" so it is clear that the 
warranties apply.

Is there any change to the sound guaranty level (or other guarantees) for the 
units utilizing these stacks?
