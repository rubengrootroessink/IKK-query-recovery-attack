David,

How about 400 this afternoon? I have another call at 230, but it should be 
over by then.

Kay - attached is Roy's writeup on our Hub Agency discussion last week.  Let 
me know what your schedule looks like today.  If you have time, I would like 
to go through this with you and David to get your thoughts and kick-off the 
drafting.  

Thanks,

Gregg
