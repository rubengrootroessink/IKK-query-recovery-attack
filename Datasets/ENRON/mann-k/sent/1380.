Heather and Ozzie
We just concluded a review of the agreement documents and noted all changes,
corrections, etc. to make it in compliance with discussions last Tuesday
which resolved all/most of the business issues. 
 Jackie Scheib has committed to red line the agreement that was sent to us
last night, to be in accordance with our internal review this afternoon, and
to get it out sometime over the weekend to FCE and to Enron.  At the same
time we are trying to finalize the attachments (exhibits) for early next
week. 
I suggest we each review the red line on Monday and set up conf call late
Monday or Tues am to resolve any outstanding business issues or
"wordsmithing", so we can try to get this behind us.
