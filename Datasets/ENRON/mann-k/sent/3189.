I had thought I would be the lawyer on the Mitsubishi consent, until I was 
removed two weeks ago in favor of Rose. Then I heard today from Ozzie that 
Rose was off and another ENA lawyer ( I don't know who) was heading up the 
effort with Mitsubishi. I didn't suggest you get involved, and as you can see 
I wasn't copied on any of the arrangements ( until you forwarded them to me 
). I think this is by design, as Ozzie has asked that I  focus my time on 
finalizing arrangements with FPUA, FMPA and Turbo Park.

I'm not planning to get involved since this is your deal.  Is that ok with 
you?
