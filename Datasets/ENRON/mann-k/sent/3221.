Re:  Acquisition of General Electric 7EA Turbines

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Pursuant to our discussions last week, the following summarizes the main=20
commercial terms agreed to by NorthWestern Corporation (=01&NorthWestern=01=
8) and=20
Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") regarding NorthWestern=01,s purchase thro=
ugh=20
the LLC referred to below or as otherwise accomplished without violation of=
=20
the Turbine Contract referred to below (the =01&Purchase=018) of two (2) Ge=
neral=20
Electric (=01&GE=018) 7EA combustion turbines (the =01&Turbines=018), the f=
irst of which=20
is presently located at a GE storage facility, and the second of which is=
=20
scheduled to be available for delivery in February, 2002, and both of which=
=20
are subject to purchase from GE under an agreement with GE dated as of May=
=20
31, 2000 (the =01&Turbine Contract=018) with respect to which ENA has the r=
ight to=20
cause a joint venture limited liability company in which, prior to commerci=
al=20
operation of the Turbines, ENA holds a 20% equity interest and a wholly-own=
ed=20
NorthWestern subsidiary (the =01&NorthWestern Subsidiary=018) holds an 80% =
equity=20
interest (the =01&LLC=018) to become the purchaser:

1.  Purchase Price:  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbin=
es=20
(subject to adjustment as described below). [Adjusted how?  Need specific=
=20
reference. Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent=
=20
with the structure?  Definitely sounds like a UCC deal,  for what that=01,s=
=20
worth.]
2.  Closing Date of Purchase:  The Purchase will close on a date on or prio=
r=20
to September 1, 2001, as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days=
=01,=20
written notice to ENA,(provided that such notice may not be given less than=
=20
30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement relating to the=20
Purchase).  [What happens at closing?  Payment of the balance?  In the=20
interim are we going to be obligated to perform under the GE contract in a=
=20
certain manner?  Are we taking on implied obligations to NW?]
3.  Cash Down Payment:  NorthWestern will pay ENA an $8.0 million down=20
payment for the Turbines.  The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0=
=20
million down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement=
=20
with ENA providing for the Purchase.  The second installment ($5.0 million)=
=20
of the $8.0 million down payment will be due at the earlier of (i) closing =
of=20
the Purchase, or (ii) July 15, 2001. [The remaining $40m due at closing, as=
=20
well as any other amounts due to changes, etc?]
4.  Liquidated Damages:   If, prior to the assignment of the Turbine Contra=
ct=20
[is proper reference to closing?], the purchaser under the Turbine Contract=
=20
receives any liquidated damages under the Turbine Contract, then ENA will=
=20
give notice thereof to NorthWestern as promptly as possible. [Then what?]
5.  Carry Period:  ENA will provide an interest-free carry on the unpaid=20
purchase price of the Turbines until July 15, 2001. If the closing of the=
=20
Purchase occurs after July 15, 2001, then the unpaid purchase price of the=
=20
Turbines will be increased by interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the=
=20
unpaid purchase price of the Turbines ($40.0 million) for each day from, an=
d=20
including, July 15, 2001 to, but excluding, the closing date.
6.  Dual Fuel Conversion on Unit 2:  ENA will not proceed with this change=
=20
order to effect the conversion.  Instead, it will be the responsibility of=
=20
NorthWestern to effect the change order with GE.  [does this mean they will=
=20
be negotiating a change order while E Next is still the purchaser? Are we=
=20
committing to pay for the increase?  Does the purchase price increase?  Is=
=20
there a limit?]
7.  Unpaid Price of Second Turbine:  At the time of closing, one or more=20
installments of the purchase price of the second Turbine will be payable to=
=20
GE under the Turbine Contract (the =01&Unpaid Installments=018).  ENA will =
be=20
obligated to pay the Unpaid Installments to GE as they become due under the=
=20
Turbine Contract.=20
8.  Guarantees:   There will be no guarantee by Enron Corporation of any of=
=20
the representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities or other obligation=
s=20
of ENA in connection with the Purchase.  All obligations of the LLC under t=
he=20
Turbine Contract, as well as all obligations of the NorthWestern Subsidiary=
=20
to ENA in connection with the transaction, will be guaranteed by NorthWeste=
rn=20
Corporation.

[governing law? Limit on remedies/damages for this letter? Dispute resoluti=
on?

NorthWestern and ENA have acknowledged that, subject to review and approval=
=20
of the structure of the Purchase and the negotiation of final documentation=
=20
relating to the Purchase (which documentation will incorporate the commerci=
al=20
terms set forth above), the above commercial terms have received all=20
necessary NorthWestern and ENA internal approvals. [Is this true for Enron?=
] =20
In light of this acknowledgement, NorthWestern and ENA (by signing this=20
letter in the space provided below and returning the same to NorthWestern)=
=20
agree to negotiate, in good faith, to agree upon such structure and such=20
documentation, with a view to executing and delivering a mutually acceptabl=
e=20
definitive agreement relating to the Purchase as promptly as practicable. F=
or=20
the avoidance of any doubt, it is expressly stated, acknowledged and agreed=
=20
that each of NorthWestern and ENA must be satisfied with such structure and=
=20
such documentation in its own discretion.

[I question whether there is enough wiggle to keep this from being a bindin=
g=20
obligation to sell]

By agreeing to the commercial terms set forth in this letter (by signing th=
is=20
letter in the space provided below and returning the same to NorthWestern),=
=20
ENA grants NorthWestern, and NorthWestern grants ENA, an exclusive =01&no s=
hop=018=20
period through the close of business on Friday, April 13, 2001; and ENA=20
agrees that, during such =01&no shop=018 period, ENA will not discuss or ne=
gotiate,=20
directly or indirectly, with any person or entity other than NorthWestern f=
or=20
or in respect of the purchase or other acquisition by such person or entity=
=20
of the Turbines; and NorthWestern agrees that, during such =01&no shop=018 =
period,=20
NorthWestern will not discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, with an=
y=20
person or entity other than ENA for or in respect of the purchase or other=
=20
acquisition by NorthWestern of turbines from such person or entity..  As=20
consideration for ENA agreeing to such =01&no shop=018 period, NorthWestern=
 will=20
pay to ENA, via wire transfer on the date of receipt by NorthWestern of ENA=
=01,s=20
signed agreement, $1.0 million (the =01& No Shop Payment=018).  The No Shop=
 Payment=20
will not be subject to refund by ENA for any reason or upon any circumstanc=
e=20
(including, without limitation, failure of NorthWestern and ENA to agree up=
on=20
the structure of, and enter into a definitive agreement relating to, the=20
Purchase). =20

If ENA is in agreement with the foregoing, then please so indicate by signi=
ng=20
this letter in the space provided below and returning the same to=20
NorthWestern (by facsimile at 605/978-2840 and to the attention of the=20
undersigned).


       Very truly yours,


       NORTHWESTERN CORPORATION
