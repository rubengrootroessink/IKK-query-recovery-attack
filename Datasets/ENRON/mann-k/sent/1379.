Joel,

Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the 
documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.

As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as 
possible.  

If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.

Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate 
most of their legal issues now.

I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.

Hope this helps.

Kay

Subject: Enovate

i faxed comments on the CA and note to Heather at Bracewell earlier today. 
Would like to see copies of the LLC Agreement and the propsed guaranty. 

Who from tax and accounting is reviewing this deal?

Is there a reason for member guaranties rather than equity funding agreements 
or note purchase agreements or any other structure?


Is a DASH/GASH prepared?

Who in legal handled the formation of the Enovate entity? [just in case I had 
questions about structure, etc.]
