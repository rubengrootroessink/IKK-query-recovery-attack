Kay and Stuart

I'm not working on this project but the forms of agreements are modified from 
forms I prepared and had reviewed by outside counsel in Mississippi and 
Alabama for legal sufficiency.    I prepared the basic forms for Steve Walton 
in March of this year after he had contacted Steve Van Hooser for assistance 
in drafting real estate documents on the Caledonia project.  Steve Walton 
then provided them to Robert Shaw to use for acquisition of property in ENA's 
name.  I haven't heard anything about the project since then.

This was sent to me by one of the developers.  I believe it relates to an 
expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.  I don't know 
which lawyer has been working on it, so I'm sending it around to see if 
anyone claims it. Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been 
working on it.

Kay,

This is the format for the land options that Robert Shaw of New Century is 
using in Caledonia, MS.  Please advise if these documents are appropriate.

Thanks,
