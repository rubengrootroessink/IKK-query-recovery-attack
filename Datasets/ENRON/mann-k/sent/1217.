1.  6 months is fine.  I think the standard should be higher on the 2.0 MW 
units.

2.  I would say that there should be a drawing for the foundation.  We should 
make the standard relative to the drawings either "substantially in 
accordance" or "not materially different."

3.  If termination is for a cause created by FuelCells.

4.  We should have a storage option if FuelCells is ahead of schedule on 
their deliveries.

5.  We should be able to assign to CRRA in all cases.  A financial standard 
for everyone else is fine.
