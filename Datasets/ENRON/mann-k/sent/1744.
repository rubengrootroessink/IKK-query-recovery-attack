Opps. Sorry about the confusion.  We are selling the equity in CA to Coral, 
so I call it by that name.  I'm looking for a list of what you need as 
referencedin the last line of this email.

Hope that helps,

Kay

Kay,
   Attached are the latest versions of the CA Energy Development
breakout agreements.  Please note that, because the agreements deal with
only one Unit each, the term "Unit Liability Amount" has been replaced
with "Maximum Liability Amount."  Also, there is no need for an Exhbit
N-1, so that reference has been deleted as well.  The agreement is still
missing an Agreement Reference number, Ben Jacoby's fax number, and the
information needed for the exhibits.  Thanks, Chris
