I'm working on it now.  Maybe we (Enron) could review it tomorrow morning, 
then send it to FCE.  I can meet around 10:00.  That way, we can get it to 
them in time for weekend review.  Does that work?

Subject: FuelCells

I spoke briefly to Jeff.  He said that they resolved all the major economic 
issues with FuelCells.  Here is what I believe to be the resolution.

1.  Foundations--FCE to do; our obligation to deliver site in the required 
conditions.

2.  Shipping--As we previously proposed; not to exceed amount

3.  Escalation--None.

4.  Financing Adder--Considering 3.6% adder.

5.  Termination points--Jeff said 9 months, 5 months and 4 months.  I assume 
that means 9 months after expected installation for the first 7 units, 5 
months for the next 7 and 4 months for the last 8.

6.  Termination Price--Average price of order.

Where does everything stand on the redraft?
