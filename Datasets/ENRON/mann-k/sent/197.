Well, I've lost today somewhere along the way.  How about Friday morning?  
You and I can discuss the agency agreement, then get them on the line.  
Anytime is good for me.  

Kay

Thanks for the quick turn.  As for Dave Gorde, I am available this afternoon, 
Thursday (which he is not) and maybe Friday morning.  Tammy Shepperd, 
Accounting, was also going to check on the necessity of a DASH so I would 
like to include her to the extent she is either available or interested.

Thanks,

Gregg
