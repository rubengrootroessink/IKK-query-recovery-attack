Good, I didn't want to ask Ed.  He's very busy. 



So which curse word did you use?

Subject: CA request

Kay, I need another CA drafted for the City of Alexandria LA.  We will be 
exchanging information on possibly managing their gas and electric portfolio 
for a 5 year term (maybe a little longer or shorter?)  They have two working 
generators that we would manage, as well as possibly purchasing economic 
power off the market.  They have an additional 33MW's that we would consider 
repowering.  Along with that, we would be managing their natural gas needs to 
supply the generators and/or selling the gas in the market when their 
generation is not needed.  

Here is their information:
 Attn: Mr. Gerard Alwell
 Alexandria, City of
 D. G. Hunter Generating Station
 1011 North 3rd Street
 Alexandria LA 71301
 318-473-1291
