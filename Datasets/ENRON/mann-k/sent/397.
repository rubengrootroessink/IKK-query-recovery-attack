Hi Karen,

Did I mess up?  I saw Herman and he told me that the 1000am was held.  I hope 
I wasn't supposed to be there.

Please call if I can help.

Kay

I have tentatively reserved conference room 2938 to discuss transferring the 
Austin turbines from the West LB structure.  If anyone is unable to attend, 
please let me know so we can possibly reschedule for next week.  Thanks.
