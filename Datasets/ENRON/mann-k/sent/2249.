Hi.  I'm at home, trying to waiting to visit GE's offices which are at 610 
and 290.

Michael has been invited to have pizza with Stephen this evening.  Tommy and 
Julie are going out, and Stephen has a sitter (Sam won't be there), so he 
wanted to have a buddy over for pizza.  I told Julie that Michael's calendar 
is open for this evening.  Hope that is ok for you.
