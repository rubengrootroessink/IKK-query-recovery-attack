Isabel,

I'm waiting on Delta to give me language concerning a performance guarantee 
adjustment for site conditions before turning the execution version.  

The GE parent guaranty and LOC are in the all the earlier versions I sent, 
and remain unchanged.  Please let me know if you don't have the earlier 
versions.

Kay

Do you know when we might receive a revised Turbine Contract?  The lenders
would like to review the GE parent guarantee.
Thank you
Isabel

The following language/numbers are acceptable to GE:

|-----------------+-----------------|
| April 30, 2001  |$50,234,000      |
|-----------------+-----------------|
|                 |                 |
|-----------------+-----------------|
|                 |                 |
|-----------------+-----------------|
|            TOTAL| $50,234,000     |

Such April 30th payment shall constitute full and final payment for the
Units, except that Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of any
and all amounts associated with any Change Order after the Effective Date.
The final payment is also subject to Section 6.1.3.

The form of the letter of credit is included as an exhibit to the turbine
contract (exhibit D) and the form of GE parent guarantee is attached as
Exhibit C-1.
