So do you know where the piece of the contract came from?  Maybe we can track 
down the rest.  I have seen an electronic copy of a contract which may or may 
not be the correct one since the delivery date is last June.  I think ENA 
needs a complete copy of the contract, including any executed change orders.  
Do you think someone in your group might have that?

Many thanks,

Kay

What I have is on the fax to you right now.  I do not have the entire 
contract.  Sorry,

My fax number is 63491.

FYI, I want to see if we are in compliance with the confidentiality 
provisions of those contracts.  In fact, I would  like to get a copy of the 
501 D contract (I have the GE contract).  Do you have a copy of the entire 
thing?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I have that information, provided by EECC and reviewed by Ben J and Jeffrey 
K.  If you are somewhere where I can fax it to you or bring you a copy, let 
me know.

Hi Guys,

I'm trying to figure out what info we submitted from which turbine 
contracts.  Could someone please identify the contract and what was sent to 
Allyson?

Thanks,

Kay
