Please tell Mike that I'm on a conference call, but can step out if he wants 
to come up.  Obviously, I'm in my office.  Please call him and tell him.

Will do!  Mike Miller is leaving you a voice mail wanting to know a good time 
to "pop up."

Please call Sheila and let her know we've made some progress with GE.  Please 
see if there is time she wants to talk prior to 300 CST.

Thanks,

Kay
