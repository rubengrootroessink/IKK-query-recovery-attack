I think the LLC agreement would be a big help.  Thanks!

The certificate of formation will not change.  The certified  Certificate of 
Correction will be attached to it.  The original Certificate will never be 
changed.  I asked this exact question this afternoon.

The Certificate of Correction will be filed with Delaware tomorrow and we can 
expedite an original to be delivered to us on Friday.  I am running out the 
door.  Leave me any instructions re additional needs/questions/problems.  My 
cell number is 713-305-9013 and home is 936-271-4554 if you need anything 
else today.

I need to provide the NCPUC a copy of the incorporation documents as soon as 
I can. How long will it take?

Kay

I have requested for CT Corp. the best route to correct the spelling of 
Edgecombe.  I believe we file a Cert of Correction.  CT Corp will confirm 
this afternoon.

The only other documents I have in my file which will need to be replaced are 
the LLC agmt and the officer election consent.

I will proceed expeditously and let you know when complete.

Hi Matt,

We have an LLC which should  be signing a contract soon.  I believe the name 
as filed was Edgecomb Development, but it should be Edgecombe Development, 
LLC, named for the county in which the power plant will be built.  Can you 
take care of getting this changed officially?

This may sound silly, but our customer looked up the official records and 
pointed this out, so we need to fix it. Also, we have told the State that the 
name is Edgecombe.

Many thanks,

Kay
