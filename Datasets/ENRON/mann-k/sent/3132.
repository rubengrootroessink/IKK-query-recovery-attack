Your mom just called and said your dad's surgery will be at 2:30 p.m. 
Tuesday, March 20th.  They will be there by noon on the 20th, and the surgery 
will last 1.5 hours and then they'll watch him for 2 more hours before they 
put him into ICU. They are hoping he'll only be in the hospital 48 hours.
