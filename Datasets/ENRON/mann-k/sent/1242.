Hi Rose,

I'm home sick with a sick kid, but I wanted to make sure you got this little 
bit of info.

To all,

As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
are aware of any others.

Thanks,

Kay
