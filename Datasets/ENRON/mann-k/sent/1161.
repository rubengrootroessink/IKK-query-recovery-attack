I understand completely.  Those ear infections can be very painful.  Nothing 
can get to you like your kid in pain.  If it makes you feel any better I have 
a 20year old (I can't believe it) and a 6 year old (even more unbelievable), 
and both have a lot of allergies and sinus infections, etc.  My oldest  also 
had a lot of ear infections, and it seemed to be painful.  But she out grew 
the problem.

I expect to be in town Mon-Thurs, with high hopes of taking Friday off to 
join my husband at his officer's meeting in San Antonio.  

Kay

Thanks for the quick turnaround. My apologies again for not getting back to 
you on Friday.  It turns out that my daughter  now officially has her first 
ear infection.  The joys of parenthood.  Talk to you on Monday.

Gregg
