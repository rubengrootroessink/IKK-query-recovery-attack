Mitch,

The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during 
the conference call.  They requested something along the lines of what is in 
the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language:

SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated 
warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or 
in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to 
maintain an equity position in either of these companies.  SWPC further 
acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity 
will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts.


How does this sound?

Kay -

No way.  My reading of the contract indicates that they can't withhold 
approval anyway.  Did they bring this up in Friday's conference call?
