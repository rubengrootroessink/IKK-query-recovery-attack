Hi again,

Have you been asked to prepare the promissory notes referenced in the letter 
agreement?  If not, please put this on the list.  Also, what else will need 
to be prepared to close this deal?

I haven't heard for Coral yet, so I don't know if they bought in on closing 
early next week yet.  Since funding is required they may balk.  As soon as I 
know something I will let you know.

Thanks again for your help,

Kay
