Hi Kent,

These are some requested changes to the Salmon a/k/a Delta break out 
agreement.  I'm not comfortable that Lee has reviewed these, as the comments 
were previously forwarded in another email.  In any event, we are looking for 
GE's blessings on this addition.

It seems to me that we are approaching time to gather GE's signatures on the 
various docs.  I will forward separately the email I received from our 
outside counsel with the final forms of everything but the break out 
contract, the assignment and assumption agreement and the GE parent guaranty.

Thanks for your assistance.
