Sounds good to me.  I'll check with Neil.  I know Michael would love it.

Thanks,

Kay

By the way, I picked up a Paper City just to read about you.  I feel like I
know someone famous.  Actually, going to a polo match sounds like a lot of
fun.

Bart just asked for your phone number, which I gave him, of course.  Maybe
the Houston office can pick up the rest of the power work on the project,
should it go forward.
