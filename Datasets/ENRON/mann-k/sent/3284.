I attach the form of the AAB agreement from Fountain Valley. Peter, if
you
have the override agreement for that deal, can you e-mail to thsi
circulation?

Bart, the project managers would like to get this form to ABB, who is in
our offices today. I have asked Matt Tezyk to call and check with you to
make sure you are on board before they do so. Can you let us know?

In the absence of the electronic form of the override agreement, I will
get
Renee Alfaro to scan the hard copy I do have of the Fountain Valley
document and send it to this distriubution.
