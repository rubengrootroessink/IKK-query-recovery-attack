I will make these changes this morning. Do you want me to circulate the
revised draft once these changes are incorporated, or are we expecting
more comments?

Subject:  Revised Salmon Agreement


Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill
Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's
consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).
