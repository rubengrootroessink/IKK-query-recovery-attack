How depressing.  I really was liking the idea of a Durango.  I do think Lisa 
and Bobby have been pleased with theirs, but maybe they've just been lucky.

Mitsubishi isn't attractive to me, but I don't know why.  I really can't 
think of much unless I go back to the idea of the small Lexus.  The big one 
is just too expensive.  I don't want a Ford (that knocks out a lot), you 
don't like the 4 Runner, and the Land Cruiser is too expensive also. 

I don't remember being particularly impressed with either the Yukon or the 
Tahoo.

What else is there?

Good morning! Hope your day is going well.

I spoke with John and Marc (area mgr) and both said they would not buy
another Durango. Both said they have rescued their spouse more than once.
Maybe we should look at something else. John is driving a Montero by
Mitsubitshi that he likes a lot.

I'm taking an early lunch so I can beat the crowd to the PO.
