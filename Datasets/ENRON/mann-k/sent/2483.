You sound so pitiful.  I haven't forgotten you!

I haven't seen this. I guess that's what happens when you get passed over...

Hi Ben,

Has anyone asked you to take a look at this?  If not, I would be interested
in your comments.

Kay,
Lisa asked me to see if you would represent ENA Legal at the meeting
between EE&CC and ENA on Monday, Jan 29th.  Having worked at both
companies, you would add a lot of insight to the crafting of a "new project
development process".  The agenda is for Ozzie, Mike Coleman, Lisa and you
to give brief presentations (5-10 minutes each) on the project development
process, with recommendations on changes to be made.  You've already seen
the notes, but I'm attaching an updated version.

Please let me know if you will be available and if you want to change any
discussion bullets and/or recommendations.  The most recent message had the
meeting taking place on Monday, January 29th from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm (with
lunch provided).  Megan will let everyone know which room will be reserved.
There is also a pre-meeting tomorrow (Wed) at 10:30 am in EB 2868 (it
should only last 30 minutes).  Thank you in advance for your help.
