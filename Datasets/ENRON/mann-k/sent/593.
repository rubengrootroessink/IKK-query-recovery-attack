Chris/Ben,

We had discussed having two change orders so that the ESA stuff is easily 
identifiable/assignable/etc.  Is this still the plan?

In addition, the dual fuel cost will be split between ESA and ENA ($280,000 
to ENA and $280,000 to ESA).

Kathy and Kay,

I have revised change order #2 to account for the additional scope added by 
ESA.  Please review  and comment.  I did not change the effective date.

For information purposes, all but item "b" are attributed to ESA.

Regards,

Chris
