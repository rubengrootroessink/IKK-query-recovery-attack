Please see below which gives "sign off" from Kent Shoemaker on all the last
drafts of all the documents.  Kent has not, of course seen the final drafts
circulated last night but I do not believe that the changes do anything
other than conform to the credit documentation.  I apologise for sending
duplicate forms last night. I will resend all final versions shortly.
Thanks

Documents look okay.

I'm confirming two things:  (1) wiring instructions, and (2) that Dan Rowley
has authority to opinion on GE (I had assumed this but thought I better
check - he's out of office until this evening).

I'll let you know both answers soon.

Kent
