I am scheduled to be in NYC and Danbury, Connecticut as of tomorrow 
afternoon, through the remainder of the week. I'm assisting with the 
negotiation of a contract for the purchase of fuel cells.  This is a Jeff 
Ader/Ozzie Pagan/Heather Kroll deal.

Don't know if you guys like to keep up with such things, but I'm glad to keep 
you informed.  

Kay
