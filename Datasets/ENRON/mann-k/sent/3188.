Subject: Organizational Announcement

We are pleased to announce organizational changes to the Enron South America 
legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of 
the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the 
region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  John Novak will become General Counsel of 
ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be 
responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets 
businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance 
Schuler, will be provided from EWS Legal in Houston to support ESA's 
wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, 
General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA 
businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new 
structure is attached.

This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal 
support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.
