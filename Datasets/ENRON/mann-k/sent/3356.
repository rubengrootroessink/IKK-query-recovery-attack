Kay,

I am back at the plate for another shot at your schedule.  There is a 
Distinguished Speaker Luncheon this Thursday at noon at the Houston Club 
featuring Larry Dierker, Milo Hamilton and Jerry Hunsicker of the Houston 
Astros.  Could you please be a guest at our table?  Hawaiian shirts are 
required.

Let me know.  Hope you can make it.

cgt
