Subject: RE: Escalade

The last quote I sent over was for 36 months and
I haven't taken into consideration the price/tax
savings of the Lexus.  I contacted our remarketing
department and they are still working on getting
#'s.

I'll let you know soon!!!

Leatha,

I have a couple of questions.  Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in
addition to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?  Both time
frames are mentioned in your explanation.

Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?  Does the cost
include the tax trade on the Lexus?

Thanks for your help,

Kay

Kay,
The dealership will not come down on the price
for the gold and wood trim.  I have an aftermarket
company that can do both for $550.00.  Here is
a 36 month quote for the Cadillac including the
gold and wood.  Please review and let me know if you
have any questions.

EQUITY LEASE FOR TERM OF 36 MONTHS

$  39976.38          Cost of vehicle
    2498.52*Sales tax
     161.00*Registration
    7500.00*Cost reduction
------------
$  39976.38          Delivered price
------------
$    568.33          monthly depreciation
     187.81          Monthly lease charge
------------
$    756.14          Monthly rental

$  12016.15          Termination value @ 48 months

*to be billed on delivery

Let me know what you think.

Leatha

Hi Leatha,

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it,
however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the
extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we
asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the
wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount
the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get
reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to
"work on it".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my
Lexus.

Thanks,

Kay
