I don't know who started the initialling kick, and I don't know if I care if 
it continues.  I don't know if Lee cares.  It is probably an EECC artifact.  
If GE doesn't care, then I don't care.  ( I hear strains of a show tune "I 
don't care, I don't care").

I think I've lost my mind.

This is step 2 in an ongoing mystery.

When I got the files from Peter there were no initial lines for the 
contract.  I was surprised, but presumed that this was no longer a 
requirement.

Bill Williams has said he is prepared to initial whatever we put in front of 
him.  If we do the new form, we would have to redo the pages anyway (I 
presume).  If we take that course and I get the electronic version up here, I 
will ask Bill to sign on.

Engage, Mr. Data.

Dale,

Has GE initialled all the pages of the break out contract?  If so, it would 
be very helpful if you could ship me the originals.  That way, we only have 
to change the names, which will make it easier for Lee when we have to ask 
him to sign.  Also, has someone from the Enron side initialled all the 
pages?  That helps, too!

Kay
