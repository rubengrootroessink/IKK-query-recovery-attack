Hi Charlotte,

We've been invited to someone's house for dinner on Feb 2.  Can you take care 
of Michael?  The dinner is in River Oaks, so we could just drop him off.

Michael  got a hair cut this weekend.  I think it makes him look taller.  I 
wish it worked that way for me!  It is very short, and I think very cute.

Kay
