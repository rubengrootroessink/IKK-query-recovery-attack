Subject: Energy Law Committee

Dear all,
 
In light of the opening of the energy industry, the Mexican Bar Association 
has been asked by different sectors to create the Energy Law Committee. I am 
pleased to inform you that I have been asked to chair such committee.
 
As part of our endevors, we will be involved in the upcoming reforms to the 
energy industry.
 
Very truly yours,
