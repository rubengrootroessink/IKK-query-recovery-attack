Anytime in the next hour is good, since I didn't eat breakfast.  I would love 
a caffeine free Diet Coke.

That does sound good.  When do you want it?  Now?  Do you have a Diet Coke?

An Antoines tuna and some jalapeno chips sounds good.  I can give you my 
badge and you can charge it.  

Thanks,

Kay

What would you like and when do you want it?  I'll go down and get you 
something.

Is it possible for you to arrange for me to get a sandwich or something for 
lunch?  I'm stuck on this call.
