Lisa,

I've made some preliminary suggestions on the term sheet. We will have some 
comments on the asset management attachment, but I don't have those together 
yet.

In looking through our files I don't find a confidentiality agreement.  
Therefore, I'm attaching a draft of what we would like to have executed so 
that we can send you other documents.

Thanks,

Kay
