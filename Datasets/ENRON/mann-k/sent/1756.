Subject: Exhibits to the CA Energy Development Agreements


  Attached please find clean and blackline versions of the exhibits to
the CA Energy Development Agreements.

To complete the exhibits, we need to include the following:

1. Exhibits B-1, H-2 and R need to be added.

2. Do we need to add language to section B of Exhibit A-1 because
these are dual fuel turbines?

3. Should the scope be changed in Exhibit B because these are dual
fuel turbines?

4. In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5. For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all of the
documents that it should have received by now.

6.  If required, we need to have a Seller Parent Guaranty for
Exhibit C-1.
