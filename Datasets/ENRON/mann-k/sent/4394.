In a seperate e-mail, I sent out the LOI to TECO which incorporated most of 
Fred's comments. On the tolling term sheet, I agree with Fred's comments. Kay 
- where do we stand on having outside counsel review this? I have indicated 
to TECO that we will have a draft tolling term sheet to them by Wednesday. 
Please let me know.

Thanks,

Ben

Ben/Kay:

Attached are my comments on the Midway Tolling term sheet and LOI.  

I will be out on Monday but will have my cell phone on.  My conversations 
will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes, but I will do my best to be 
available.

Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss.  I have asked Dave 
Kellermeyer to call either one of you on Monday with an answer to the minimum 
block size for the tolling term sheet.  I am taking the air permit home to 
review and will leave you a message if I determine the answer.

Fred
