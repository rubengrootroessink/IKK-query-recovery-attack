Hi John,

I believe Ben Jacoby has mentioned our deal with NorthWestern.  In connection 
with that transaction, we have prepared the attached assignment and consent, 
which is patterned after the Pastoria form. We would like to get it wrapped 
up in the next two weeks, if possible.

Please let Ben or me know if you have any questions.
