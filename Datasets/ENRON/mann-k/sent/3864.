When sending out the assignment and assumption agreement, are we sending 
originals to all four people listed in the second paragraph?  Do you remember 
how many originals are required?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,
The deal team needs to sign and send out the notices (for Fountain Valley 
they had V&E do all that).  The notice needs to be faxed to:
Elizabeth Burnett (phone 212-325-9943, fax 212-325-8304) - she is replacing 
Shazia Sarker who (we just found out) is leaving CSFB on Friday.  Shazia's 
name and number need to be changed throughout the documents.  V&E also faxed 
copies of the notices to: Karl Wiemer at Milbank (phone 212-530-5209, fax 
212-822-5209), Lisa, Rose and myself.

The Assignment and Assumption Agreement needs to be signed by the deal team 
for ENA, then sent to Karl Wiemer, Ann Roberts, Jose Mercado and Doneene 
Damon for execution by E-Next Generation LLC (see addresses below).  The Bill 
of Sale also needs to be sent to Karl, Ann, Jose, and Doneene for execution 
by E-Next.

The second notice is called the "Prepayment Notice" and includes the amount 
to be funded 2 days later.  I took the V&E form used for Fountain Valley and 
removed names and amounts, however I believe Rose had some additional 
comments, so let me talk to her before attaching a sample Prepayment Notice.  
I'll get back to you shortly.  Thanks.

Hi Catherine,

I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.

 << File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Notice of Purchase.doc >>  << 
File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Assignment & Assumption Agmt with GE 
ack.DOC >>  << File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Bill of Sale.DOC >> 

I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
form for that one yet.

Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?

Thanks,

Kay
