I don't think she's in.  You might want to leave her a voice mail.

Subject: Delta - ENA Consent Jurisdiction Issue

Sheila, in connection with the Delta turbine sale, we have one pending issue 
with respect to the jursidiction clause that would have us consent to either 
NY state or federal court (you had revised the document to only have NY 
federal courts apply, but the Lenders have responded that they need the state 
court reference in the event that the federal courts will not take the 
case).  Attached is the redline to show how the clause has been revised to 
eliminate the waiver of forum non-conveniens and how the jurisidiction will 
only apply to the consent agreement, but I'd like your approval to accept NY 
state court as well.  In the alternative, Lender's counsel has commented that 
in another Enron transaction they were involved with, they accepted Delaware 
state and federal courts.  Also, please note that the opinion letter is no 
longer required.  Thanks in advance:

Carlos:

The only two changes we requested to the ENA Consent that Isabel Parker did
not make were as follows:

1.  Section 2.1(f) - no deletion of "best" from knowledge; and
2.  Section 5.8 - no deletion of NY "state court" jurisdiction.

I have not spoken to Isabel about these last items, so I don't know if they
were inadvertent or intentional, although my e-mail to her was fairly
specific about Enron accepting federal court jurisdiction in NY but not NY
state court.  Note that it is rather unusual to object to NY state court
when federal courts in NY are considered acceptable.  Please review and let
me know.  Thanks.
