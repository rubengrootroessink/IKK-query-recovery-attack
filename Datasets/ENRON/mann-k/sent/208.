Not to suggest anything, but I'm going to try this for that stubborn 10-15lbs.

Subject: Weight Watchers

Thank you for your interest in the upcoming Weight Watchers session starting 
July 19th. Unfortunately, the person in charge of confirming your 
participation (Michelle Kapfer) is out on vacation until July 17th, which is 
why you have not received a response to your e-mails.  As stated in the 
announcement, space is limited to the first 60 persons who respond via 
e-mail.  As an update, let me inform you that Michelle has received 31 
responses (from you guys); of course, this does not take into account the 
previous other responses she may have received from last session's members. 

 Please remember that Michelle will be sending out e-mail confirmations upon 
her return on the 17th.  

Thanks again,

Iris
