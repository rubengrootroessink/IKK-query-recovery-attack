Hi there,
?
When I was at Monday's Astros' game, I thought I heard them say that Enron is 
sponsoring some type of kid's book drive at next Sunday's game.? I have quite 
a few gently used kids books I am looking to give away, so I was wondering if 
I could do it in connection with that program.? I will not be at the game 
Sunday, and I didn't locate a reference to the program on your website.
?
Is there a way for me to donate kids books for whatever program Enron is 
sponsoring, without going to the game?
?
Many thanks!
?
