Sheila handled FV.  Today was the first day I had seen them.

We "took" her from El Paso, not that we like to steal from our customers (we
may have another opening, by the way!!).  She's been here a couple of
months.

Just to be sure, I never saw these before correct?  She's going to do this
job but Lee thought I had seen everything before and I could just sign off

Danetta worked it for the  Fountain Valley project.  How long has she been
here?  I didn't know there was anyone other than you.

Kay, unless I've lost my mind, I've never seen these docs before.  What
deal
was it on.  I don't have anything on CA Development.  I don't remember
executing any attorney's opinions?

Yes, this stuff is for the purchaser's bank.

Kay:  Is there anything different from the forms you and I worked on
earlier.

Hi Danetta,

I heard a rumor that you are the one to look at this stuff.  I know that
you recently went through the process in connection with the Fountain
Valley transaction.  I'm happy to serve up those forms to Freshfields if
that makes it is easier for you.

My number is 713 345 7566.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Kent,

I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are
working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and
selling some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the
turbines are turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are
buying new LM's to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta
Power is financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on
the attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response
to the attached.

I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy
anyway.

Thanks,

Kay
