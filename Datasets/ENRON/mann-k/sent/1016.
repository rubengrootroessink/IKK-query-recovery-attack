I think the easiest way is a power of attorney.  I've talked to Deb Korkmas 
about it (I hear she's the one to handle such things), and I've asked 
Kathleen to identify the most active development entities so that we deal 
with as many as possible at once.

As for the expense account, I figure she can just tell Ben to sign her name 
to the reports.  ANy other ideas?

Does any formal documentation need to be prepared to accomplish this?
