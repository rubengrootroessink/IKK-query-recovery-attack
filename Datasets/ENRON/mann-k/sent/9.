Lee,

I've notified Ben Jacoby who will be responsible for formal notification
from ENA to proceed on the additional dual fuel units.  I'm relatively
certain that ENA wants to proceed with these, and I've advised them that GE
needs the answer this week--by Friday.

Tell David to expect to hear from Ben shortly.

Thanks!

Mike
