It may not be a good name for a company, but I may have a new word for the 
effect some of these protracted discussions with my partner are having on me.

Another topic, has Kathleen prepared a draft CA?  The first risk committee 
meeting is scheduled for this Wednesday and I would like to provide this 
prior to the meeting if possible.

More to come.

Gregg,

Joel is a lawyer with Global Finance.  Since Corp will be loaning the money, 
I contacted that legal group to get their buy in (they are Sarah's lawyers, 
so to speak).  Anyway, I thought the change of name from enovate to enervate 
is priceless.  Enervate= to weaken or destroy the strength or vitality of...

Strange choice for a company name!!!
