Hi Cindy,

Would it be possible to block some rooms for a couple of weeks while people 
make their reservations?  I'm thinking maybe ten rooms for May 4, 5, and 6, 
out on the 7th?  I would like it best if the individuals could call you 
directly to make the reservation.  How does that work for you?

Thanks,

Kay
