IT IS RAINING!!!  I hope it is raining at the house.  It looks like it 
probably is raining all over town.  Hope you get some there.

Neil's address is nmann@erac.com.  Paige's address is 
recordp@southwestern.edu.  She can get her email from Houston (don't ask me 
how).

We had a great time this weekend, too.  I'm glad it worked out so well.  I 
thought it was very relaxing.  I would love to have the recipe for the beef.

I will probably go to North Carolina Wednesday, returning Thursday or Friday.

Take care!

Love,

Kay
