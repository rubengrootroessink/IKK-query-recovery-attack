Subject: Ledford-Titan Option to Purchase

Kay:  
   Per my voicemail, at the request of the Ledfords, Fred and Rusty
have agreed to limit the easement area in the Option for Purchase and Grant
of Easement between the Ledfords and Titan Development to a 100' area
adjacent to the railroad right-of-way.  The following reflects that
modification to the third "whereas" in the Ledford-Titan Option incorporated
this morning following my conversations with Fred and Rusty.  
   WHEREAS, Optionors desire to grant to Optionee, and Optionee desires
to obtain from Optionors, an option for the grant of an easement in, over
and within the strip of land 100' wide in Parcel 2 (defined below) which is
immediately adjacent to and east of the railroad right-of-way for the
installation of drain tiles, pipelines, and other utility uses across other
property owned by Optionors ("Parcel 2"), as more particularly described in
Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (the
"Easement"); 

Additionally, I have received a fax copy of the executed Fehr agreement. I
am stopping by their attorney's office today to pick up the originals and to
put together the joint counterpart signatures.  I am also meeting with the
Ledford's attorney this afternoon and hope to finalize the execution of that
Option as well.  I will fax you the fully executed copies tomorrow morning
when I return to the office and the original versions will follow by fed ex.
Please call either Mark Gershon or me on Mark's cell phone 847-869-2015 with
any questions or comments. Thank you.
