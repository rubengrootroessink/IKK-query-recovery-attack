NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
> court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World
> Series.
>
> "The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
> conference earlier today. They were joined by members of the Major
> League Players Union.
>
> "'We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,' said the
> Mets batting coach. 'We were confused by the irregularities of the
pitches
> we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit.'
>
> "One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets
batters
> had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls.
> It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls,
> though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches.
>
> "Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had
> extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World
> Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier
> in the year.
>
> "'The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of
> our right to hit,' said the Mets batting coach. 'The World Series is not
> over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely.'
>
> "Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series
> games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each
> game.
>
> "'While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls,
> there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the  World
> series,' the commissioner said.
>
> "Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base
> percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of
> the final scores of the games. 'It's clear that we were slightly on-base
> more often than the Yankees,' said a Mets spokesman. 'The World
> Series crown is rightly ours.'
>
> "The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in
> some light jogging for exercise. He has stated that he believes 'we need
> to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment.'"
