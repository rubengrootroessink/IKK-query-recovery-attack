I am not responsible for THIS Tribasa mess.  My responsibility ended when 
Tribasa IV was signed.

Buenas suerte,

Kay

In retrospect, I apologize for not contacting Ms. Mann earlier (my former 
colleague who is responsible for this Tribasa mess) for she indeed did 
confront the issue that we are confronting.  Based on the attachment below 
and the other emails I am forwarding you, it appears that our procedure for 
accelerating EECC's payment rights will be to issue a letter to Republic Bank 
who will then issue a default letter to Tribasa and then based on that we can 
then issue a demand to AI.  If Ms. Mann so desires, she is welcome to 
participate in our 2:45 conference call, by rsvping through email.
