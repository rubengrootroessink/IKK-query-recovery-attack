Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this matter.  I will 
drop Mr. Derrick a voice mail, but I would faint if he objected.

John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation of a 
draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available today to discuss 
this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.  Additionally, it would be helpful 
to discuss the tolling arrangement with Ken.

Thanks,

Kay
