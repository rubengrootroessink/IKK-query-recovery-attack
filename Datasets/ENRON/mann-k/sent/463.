In speaking with Allyson, she believes we need to have the responses the 
Public Staff's data request no later than sometime next week.  The Staff 
wants to have a meeting or conference call to discuss our responses during 
the week of August 28th.  Therefore, Allyson suggests that we have a call 
this week to discuss how and when we will pull this information together.  
Sounds like a good idea.

Please let me know when you are available for the call this week.  I suspect 
it will take between 30-45 minutes.  Also, please let me know if you have NOT 
received a copy of the data request, as these should have arrived via company 
mail.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Public Staff Data Request

Could we set up a conference call in the next day or two to go over the data
requests, establish a responsible party for putting together the information
for each question, and set a time frame for getting it in?  I am tied up
most of Thursday afternoon, but am generally available the rest of the week.

I thought I'd e:mail the revised data requests upon receipt;  if I haven't
heard from Gisele by this afternoon, I will fax them.  :Let me know if you
are interested in receiving copies of the local government resolutions.
There are no surprises; they simply adopted and signed what I drafted
without even retyping them.
