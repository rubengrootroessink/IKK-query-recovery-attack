I asked Fred to check into what it would take to have Enron set up a third
party escrow arrangement.

Subject:  Intergen - Escrow

I spoke with Mary Perkins in Treasury.  She indicated that we are currently
working with Chase Bank and City Bank for our third party escrow
Agreements.  Mary will forward Kay and I electronic copies of both of their
standard agreements.  The timeline for a standard agreement is at least 3
days and increases with the level of complexity of the Escrow Agreement's
terms & conditions.  The cost for either bank to set-up and administer the
escrow would be approximately $5-$10K, with additional cost if the
Agreement was overly complex.

Kay:  Call me to discuss our proposed Escrow Agreement T&C's and how a
draft form of this Agreement should be best incorporated into the
transaction documents.  At a minimum, we should attach it as a sample form
and have the Letter Agreement(s) contain "substantially in conformance
with" language.

Fred
