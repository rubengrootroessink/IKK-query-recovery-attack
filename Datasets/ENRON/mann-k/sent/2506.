At this time it appears that I will be going to NYC on Wednesday, returning 
Friday afternoon or possibly Thursday night.  I'll miss the Turbopark closing 
dinner, which is not all bad, as it will save me a lot of calories and a 
headache.  I will miss getting the pat on the back.  I didn't want to miss 
Michael's open house, though, as that was more important.

As you know, things are subjec to change.
