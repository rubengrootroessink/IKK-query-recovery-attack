Can the gas company also make the same requests?

Subject: RE: CPCN proceeding - AG intervention

The NC Attorney General asserts a statutory right to intervene which I think
misreads the statute but which the Commission has always allowed.  The AG
routinely intervenes.  I suspect that in this case they are interested in
the possibility of bypass and the merchant plant issue.  I will call Len
Green today to find out.  The AG can make the same discovery requests that
the Public Staff makes, subject, as was the case with the Public Staff, to
the execution of a confidentiality agreement.

Hi Allyson,

What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has
intervened in the CPCN proceeding?  Is this typical?  Does the AG's office
(or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the
confidential information we file?

Thanks,

Kay
