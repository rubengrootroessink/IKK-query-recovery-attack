Hopefully you will get some credit for it, also.

I just love Lisa.  I think she's a ton of fun.

I will just put you out all day as jury duty.  I haven't been called in a few 
years, I'm sure my time is coming.

We had an assistants staff meeting today at lunch.  Lisa Mellencamp will be 
doing the law conference in October, and I will be helping.  You know we will 
have a good time!

Duty is actually in the afternoon, but I think I will spend the morning 
getting mentally prepared at home.
