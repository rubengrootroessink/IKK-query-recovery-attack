You're on.  He's getting to be such a good age for theater.

My guess would be the week of the 4th of July, then again sometime in
August.  I agree that he really should see it.  If you want to take him,
that's great, or we will be glad to take him.

           I keep forgetting to discuss this with you.  The Lion King will
be
here for the entire month of July, and Michael MUST see it.  I don't care
whether you two take him or me, but it's an absolute.  This will be my
third
time to see it.  The tickets go on sale around June 1.  Do you know yet
when
you will be on vacation?
