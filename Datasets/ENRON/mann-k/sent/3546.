Me again.

Here's the version I referenced in my earlier email.  I believe we need to 
restore the stabilizer stuff, but I wanted to get agreement.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Revised Salmon Agreement


Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).
