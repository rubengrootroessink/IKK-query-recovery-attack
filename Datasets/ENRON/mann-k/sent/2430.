You are not just buying a pig; you are buying a brighter future for the youth 
of Texas.  When you purchase a pig from the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo 
(HLS&R), Junior Swine Auction Committee, all proceeds will go into the HLS&R 
Scholarship Fund benefiting Texas youth.  Pigs are $600 each and are 
approximately 225 lb. gross weight.  The pigs can either be donated to The 
Houston Food Bank or delivered to a processor for your personal use.   To 
participate please contact Jessie Jewell at 5-4983.  Because this is a 
tax-deductible contribution, Enron will match your donation dollar for 
dollar.  Click here to print out the Matching Gift form.  

Individuals donating $600 or more are eligible for an invitation for two to 
the Whole Hog Cookers BBQ Tent at the Championship BBQ Cook-off held February 
9 and 10.  Individuals donating $600 or more can also receive an invitation 
for two to the Swine Auction Breakfast and Swine Auction on February 28.  
Cash contributions of any amount are gladly accepted.
