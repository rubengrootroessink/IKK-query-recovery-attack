Dear Kay,

Confirming our discussion, The Texas Lawyer has asked King & Spalding to
organize a Roundtable Discussion of lawyers and business people to discuss
how the two professions relate to each other in the context of complex
business transactions. 

The Roundtable would take place privately in a conference room in our
offices with a court reporter recording the discussion, which would then be
published in an upcoming issue of the newspaper. Participants will have the
opportunity to edit their remarks before they are published. John Cogan will
be co-chairman of the proceedings with our partner, Chris LaFollette.  I
unfortunately cannot attend as I will be out of town. 

The Discussion will take place on Thursday, March 15, from 2 to 3:30. We
will hold a planning session over lunch in one of our conference rooms from
12:30 to 2. No other preparation would be required.

You would be a terrific representative from Enron to join us and provide
Enron's perspective. Please confirm your attendance as soon as you get the
internal approvals by calling John Cogan at 713.276.7371 or by e-mail at
jcogan@kslaw.com.

Best regards,
John
