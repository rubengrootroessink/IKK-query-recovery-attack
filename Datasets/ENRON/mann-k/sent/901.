In connection with the attached, please note the highlighted language at the 
end of the document.  We couldn't decide what it means, so it needs to be 
re-written or deleted.

The party we are contracting with is Virginia Power, not NC Power. If we 
misstated this previously, we would like to clear it up now.

Thank you,

Kay Mann
