Heather,

I'm guessing that Peoples wants to use this form in lieu of the credit 
agreement.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Kay -- The attached notes look like they would be used for member loans to 
Enovate under the LLC Agmt (i.e., loans for capital expenditures and other 
purposes not covered by the credit facilities provided under the Credit 
Agreements).   (As you'll see when you review the attachments, those notes 
are non-interest bearing demand notes.)

Re:  the attached form of note -- it should work for purposes of member loans 
under the LLC Agmt, but you will need to decide how the LLC Agmt loans and 
the Credit Agreement's revolving loans "work" together ... i.e., can the LLC 
Agmt loans be paid from cash flow that would otherwise go to pay down the 
revolvers, and will they be subordinated to the revolvers?
