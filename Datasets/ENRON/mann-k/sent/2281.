I can't believe we have a puppy.  Everything smells like puppy to me, even 
though I took a very long shower.  Michael and Pal had a nice visit this 
morning.  Pal is still whining a bit.  I brought one of our puppy books to 
the office, and I'll sneak a peak when I can.  I did read about the up at 
night stuff, and it says that so long as you don't let them get in bed with 
you, the whining should stop pretty quickly.  I hope the resting on the chest 
didn't mess it up, but boy, was I desperate.  He did great using the grass 
when we got up.  He definitely knows why we go outside.

Kaley picked on him a little, but she was at her food bowl.  I set up the 
little crate where she can't look in it, so he has an escape.  We should walk 
the perimeter to make sure there aren't any escape routes.  We probably need 
to protect the air conditioner wires until he is old enough to train to the 
electronic fence.

Thanks for taking the pig rat back. 

Love,
