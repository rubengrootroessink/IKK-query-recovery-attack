I think he will absolutely love it.  Our wedding is at 4, but we can bring 
him over earlier if that helps with the museum trip.

   I hope you don't change your mind about going to the wedding Sunday.
I plan on taking Michael to the new Star Wars exhibit at the Museum of Fine
Arts.  They showed some kids on TV, and they were quite taken with it.
