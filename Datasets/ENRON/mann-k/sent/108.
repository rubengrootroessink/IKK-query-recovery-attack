Stan,

For some odd reason I am having difficulty forwarding this email to Peggy and 
Sheila.  Please forward it to them for me.

Thanks,

Kay

From my end I will probably have the memo summarizing the issues complete 
tomorrow, there will however, because the final terms of the assignment 
agreement assigning the GE contracts to Mitsui have not been agreed to by 
Mitsui  that will make one element of the memo contingent on finalization of 
that assignment agreement form.   We sent Mitsui a draft of that assignment 
agreement some time ago, but they have not yet responded.  It is likely that 
they are waiting until they get a letter from EEIM which indicates that 
Mitsui will be paid for certain Pre NTP work before Mitsui finalizes the for 
of the assignment agreement.  I understand that a letter regarding such 
payment to Mitsui is being sent to them by Steve Irvin today.

Once my memo is complete, I will forward it to Brian Barto among others and 
hopefully there are some items that he and I will be able to get cleaned up 
in the "Final GE Contracts" he forwarded me.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 221-1524 with any questions.

Hi Stan,

Not to rush you, but do you have an estimate of when you will have
completed  your review/memo?

Thanks,

Kay
