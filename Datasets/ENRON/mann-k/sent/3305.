Well, things are hopping around work!  Dan and I have barely had time to say 
hello, and you know how I am about getting my dose of Dan.  I've got several 
deals going great guns, so you know how that goes. I had lunch with Stuart 
and Kathleen today, and that was fun.  Neil and I have a date night tomorrow, 
so we are trying to decide what to do.  I suggested we just walk around the 
downtown hot spots, if the weather is nice.

I've got diamond seat tickets for next Tuesday's opener.  I'm going to tell 
Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave 
me alone.  I figure if that doesn't do it, nothing will.  Neil gets to go 
with me, which is really nice.  It is a 4 o'clock game, which I think is a 
neat time.  Daylight savings time starts next week, so I guess the sun will 
be setting as the game ends.  I'm glad baseball season is back, although I 
did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game.

Carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the 
hospital so she could be induced.  Texas Women's was too busy to take them.  
They finally called them in at 700 tonight to come in, so I guess they will 
have a late night.

You bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen.  I keep hoping to have an hour to 
bring it by.  I figure it will be good  no matter when you get it.

My transfer to Power Trading is back on.  I think some of the work I do is 
transferring with me, but I'm not sure.  In short, I don't know what the 
difference will be.  It isn't supposed to happen until May, so I'm not giving 
it too much thought.  Elizabeth gave me a brochure for another seminar - this 
one in Newport Beach at the Four Seasons.  I'm liking the sound of it!

I miss you terribly, as does Neil.

Take care and get well quickly.  It isn't the same without you!!!!!

Kay
