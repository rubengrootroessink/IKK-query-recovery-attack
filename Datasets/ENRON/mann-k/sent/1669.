I can see if I can come up with a reason to go to New York if you want to go 
there.  I know New Orleans has deals that time of year.  There is also 
Guadalupe River Ranch, and some decent B & B's in Galveston.

They do not have anything for the 29-30th. She said there was something in
her reservation book she wanted to check out but it didn't look good. I
asked about other dates and she said nothing back to back. She will e-mail
me later today or Monday with more info. You mentioned New Orleans. How
about New York if we have to fly? We also talked about London after the
first of the year. The 30th is very close to the first...NM
