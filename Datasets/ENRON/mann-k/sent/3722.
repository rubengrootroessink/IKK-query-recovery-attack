Oh why not.  You probably need to get an overview of the entire deal, as you 
may want some outside help.  If we are building a plant and selling power, 
there are lots of folks at Enron who weigh in on it.

Doug,

see attached term sheet for NMC (Arpin, WI site).  Please provide comments 
and changes as appropriate (plus add language for your insurance product in 
the place holder).

Carlos,

Doug and I will provide you background.  I am not sure if you are the 
appropriate Legal Support (please direct us to the appropriate person if you 
are not).

This is a starting point and is fairly general (to facilitate discussions 
with NMC).

Thanks, Ron.
