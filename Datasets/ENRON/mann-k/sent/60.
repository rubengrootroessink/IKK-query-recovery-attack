On further review, I don't think we need to challenge the proposed
reference to Parking and Loaning Transactions as being "interruptible".
Although Peoples' GTC does not characterize this service as interruptible,
there are provisions in the GTC re scheduling and priority that render the
service interruptible, e.g. Sect. 6.3.
