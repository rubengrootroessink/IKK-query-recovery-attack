Since you both asked the same question, I thought I would send an email.

The little I know about rail is that the railroads control the contracts.  
You do it their way.

There is a lot of language in the LM contract concerning shipment, risk of 
loss, insurance, delivery.  I haven't thought through it all, but these 
issues probably need to be considered.   It may be best to work through GE on 
a change order basis to have them handle the shipment and storage elsewhere.  
Otherwise, we run the risk of having a dispute with them later about any 
problems or damage.  

I will be talking to GE this afternoon if you want the topic to be discussed 
then.

Good luck!

Kay
