To tell you the truth, this stuff is difficult for me to retain, so I could 
be completely off base. I would like to have Herman walk through it again.

It makes one wonder whether one can be in any position in these deals and not 
be in a lease.  Maybe we should ask Herman to describe one.  I was under the 
assumption that if the PPA is not plant specific, there is less of a concern 
on who the EPC contractor is.  I also thought the O&M affiliate was fatal 
even if we sold down the equity.  Have I missed the question again?
