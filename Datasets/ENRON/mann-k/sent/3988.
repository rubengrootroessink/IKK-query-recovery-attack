The  memo was very helpful.  It would be great to meet in person and discuss 
issues. I'm out of town now, but I believe either the 8th or 9th would be 
great.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I got your email about the 1 month contract, and I hope you got a memo last 
Friday from John Brunini giving you our research to date. I may be in Houston 
next week (probably the 8th or 9th) and possibly again early the following 
week. Would it make sense for us to try to visit on this matter when I'm in 
town? If so, when might you be available?

Wilson
