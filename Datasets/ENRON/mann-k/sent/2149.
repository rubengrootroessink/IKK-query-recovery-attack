Kay:

I have copies of the Articles of Organization, the LLC Agreement, and a
member's consent electing officers for each of the entities (and provided
these to George by fax on 12/7).  George advised last week that SEL wanted
the originals of the "minute books" for the two entities.   Therefore ENA
should prepare to have the original organizational documents ("minute
books") ready for delivery to SEL at closing.  I am unaware of any efforts
to obtain federal EIN's for these entities.  Thanks.

All,


I need to apply for a Texas sales and use tax permit for CAED I and II very
soon.  Who has the current corporate data on these LLC entities (such as
business address, names of managing officers and directors (i.e., persons
authorized to execute documents on behalf of the LLC's), and the federal
EIN numbers)?  Also, have these entities registered to do business in
Texas?  Anyone, please help if you can.  Thanks!

Carolyn,


In addition to the invoice change, the periods should be removed from
"LLC" on the cover page, in the first paragraph of the first page, in
Section 1.78 and on the signature page of each Facility Agreement.  The
change relating to invoices is that the address of the invoices in
Section 6.7.2  should be as follows for one of the Facility Agreements:


CA Energy Development I, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901


and as follows for the other:


CA Energy Development II, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901

Thanks,
George

George:

Kay Mann is looking for your requested language providing that GE will
invoice the LLC directly.  I am unable to find your request.  Can you
please
furnish this, as Kay intends to address this with GE today.  Thank you.
