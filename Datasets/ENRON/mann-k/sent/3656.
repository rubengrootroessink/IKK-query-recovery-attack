Enron CEO uses vulgarity in attack on fund manager
(UPDATE: Adds share price, paragraph 15)

HOUSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s (NYSE:ENE - news) top executive=

George W. Bush embarrassing headlines when he unwittingly uttered it in fro=

of an open microphone last fall.

But unlike Bush, Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling=

analysts.
Bush made headlines on the campaign trail last year when he remarked to Vic=

President Dick Cheney that a New York Times reporter was a ``major-league=

asshole,'' not knowing that a microphone had picked up his remark.
Skilling laid down the insult after an exchange with Richard Grubman,=20
managing director of Highfields Capital Management in Boston, who asked to=
=20
see Enron's balance sheet and was told it would not be available until its=
=20
inclusion in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing later this month.
``You're the only financial institution that can't come up with balance she=

``Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that. Asshole,'' Skilling=20
responded with a laugh.
Skilling, whose candor frequently gives his public relations staff fits, to=

Reuters in a telephone interview that he knew the microphone was on.
``The specific fellow that I was not real happy with is a shortseller in th=

market. I don't think it is fair to our shareholders to give someone a=20
platform like that they are using for some personal vested interest related=

to their stock position,'' Skilling told Reuters in an interview.
``I get a little exasperated with that sort of thing, and I want people to=

know I am exasperated,'' he said.
Grubman said he felt ``pretty thin-skinned'' about the remark.
He disputed Enron's assertion the balance sheets and cash flow statements=

Grubman said, adding:
