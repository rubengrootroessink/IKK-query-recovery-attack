Subject: ABB transformer purchase

I'm circulating some language for the ABB transformer purchase agreement. =
=20
Please let me know if you have any problem with the language.

The buy back language is new.  The assignment language is intended to addre=
ss=20
some concerns raised by ABB - the changes are marked in red.

Buy back option.  (5.4.3)

At Purchaser=01,s option, Seller will arrange for storage of the Unit or Un=
its=20
to be stored for up to one year following the successful conclusion of=20
factory testing.  Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Amount in full, and will=
=20
pay the actual storage charges, billed quarterly during the year the Unit o=
r=20
Units are stored.  Title and risk of loss shall be with Purchaser during th=
is=20
storage period.  Purchaser shall have the right (but not the obligation) to=
=20
sell the Unit(s) back to Seller for 30% of Purchase Amount of the Unit(s)=
=20
after the end of the one year storage period.  Payment will be due 30 days=
=20
after receipt of written notification by Purchaser of its intent to exercis=
e=20
this option.  Title and risk of loss shall be with Seller as of the time of=
=20
payment.

If Purchaser desires to sell the Unit(s) prior to the expiration of the one=
=20
year storage period, Purchaser may request, and Seller agrees to act, as=20
broker for the re-sale of the Unit(s). The terms of the remarketing agreeme=
nt=20
will be subject to mutual agreement.


Changes to assignment language.


22.2   Assignment by Purchaser.  This Agreement or any right or obligation=
=20
contained herein may be assigned, from time to time, by Purchaser without=
=20
Seller=01,s consent to:

(i) Agent (in the case of an assignment by Purchaser) or an Affiliate of=20
either WestLB or Agent;

(ii) a joint venture, partnership, limited liability company or other simil=
ar=20
entity in which Agent or any of its Affiliates is a venturer, partner or=20
participant with no less than a nineteen and one-half percent (19.5%) equit=
y=20
interest;

(iii) any Lender;

(iv) any Indemnified Party;

(v) any entity for the purposes of financing or sale of the Facility;

(vi) any party (1) for which Agent or any of its Affiliates has agreed to=
=20
construct or develop a facility using the Equipment, or (2) to which the=20
Agent or any of its Affiliates has agreed to convey a power plant project=
=20
which it has under development; or

(vii) any contractor or developer (including, without limitation, Enron=20
Engineering & Construction Company and/or NEPCO) which is retained by Agent=
=20
or any of its Affiliates to construct or develop a Facility using the=20
Equipment.

In the case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or (vii)=
=20
(other than  Enron Engineering & Construction or NEPCO), Seller shall be=20
entitled to request and receive an appropriate guaranty, letter of credit,=
=20
payment bond or other reasonable form of payment security, in amount not to=
=20
exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time o=
f=20
the assignment, unless the assignor agrees to remain liable for all future=
=20
liabilities under this Agreement.  A letter of guaranty, letter of credit, =
or=20
payment bond provided by an entity rated BBB+ or better shall be deemed to =
be=20
an appropriate form of security for the purpose of this provision.

Except for (i) through (vii) above, this Agreement may not be assigned by=
=20
Purchaser to other parties without the prior written consent of Seller whic=
h=20
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Seller agrees =
to=20
respond to any request for consent within thirty (30) Days following its=20
receipt of such request.  Any failure to respond within the foregoing time=
=20
period shall be deemed to be a grant by Seller of its consent to the propos=
ed=20
assignment.  In determining whether Purchaser shall be permitted to assign=
=20
this Agreement, Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding=
=20
its consent if the proposed assignee does not have substantially the same o=
r=20
better credit quality than Agent unless (a) the proposed assignee provides=
=20
appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other assurances of payment=20
issued by an entity or person with substantially the same or better credit=
=20
quality than Agent, or (b) the assignor agrees to remain liable for all=20
future liability under this Agreement.  Purchaser shall have the right to=
=20
assign or pledge, from time to time, all or any portion of its right, title=
=20
and interest in, to and under the Agreement as collateral for financing of=
=20
any Facility without Seller=01,s consent.

When duly assigned in accordance with the foregoing (including, following a=
ny=20
collateral assignment, upon foreclosure by any collateral assignee) (i) thi=
s=20
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the=20
assignee (and all rights hereunder, including, without limitation, any and=
=20
all warranty rights, shall be assigned to the assignee as if such assignee=
=20
were an original party hereto), and (ii) the assignor shall be irrevocably=
=20
relieved and forever discharged of all liability under this Agreement so lo=
ng=20
as the assignee executes an assumption of such liabilities.  Any other=20
assignment by Purchaser shall be void and without force or effect.=20

Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, in connection with any=20
assignment permitted under this Section 22.2 to any assignee, the Purchaser=
=20
shall have the right, from time to time by Notice to Seller and without=20
Seller=01,s consent, to (i) designate such assignee to be the successor of=
=20
WestLB hereunder, (ii) designate such assignee to be the successor of =20
=01&Agent=018 hereunder, (iii) designate such assignee as a sub-agent of th=
e Agent=20
hereunder, and (iv) designate that such assignee has succeeded to all of th=
e=20
rights and obligations of both WestLB and Agent, whereupon (notwithstanding=
=20
the first WHEREAS clause hereof, but subject to any subsequent appointment =
of=20
an =01&Agent=018 hereunder) each reference to =01&Purchaser=018 hereunder s=
hall be deemed=20
a reference to such assignee acting in its individual capacity and each=20
reference to an =01&Agent=018 herein shall be deemed deleted.

Upon any permitted assignment of the rights under this Agreement to acquire=
 a=20
Unit or Units, and the assumption (in accordance with the terms hereof) of=
=20
the obligations related thereto, Seller shall enter into a separate purchas=
e=20
agreement with the permitted assignee (each, a =01&Facility Agreement=018).=
  The=20
terms of each Facility Agreement will be in strict conformity with the term=
s=20
and conditions of this Agreement, except for site specific changes as agree=
d=20
by the Seller and such assignee.  In no way shall the Facility Agreement=20
increase the liability or responsibility of Seller, Purchaser, or Agent und=
er=20
this Agreement.

The parties further agree that the provisions of this Agreement relating to=
=20
assignment will only control the assignment of Purchaser=01,s or Agent=01,s=
 rights=20
and obligations under this agreement prior to Acceptance of the Unit to be=
=20
assigned. Following Acceptance, Purchaser or Agent shall be permitted,=20
without Seller=01,s consent, to: (i) assign its rights under this Agreement=
,=20
(ii) convey any ownership interest that it may have in the Facility and/or=
=20
(iii) convey any ownership interest that it may have in the entity which ma=
y=20
own the Facility.=20
