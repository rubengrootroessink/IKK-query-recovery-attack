Kay, was Dale to make the change Lee has listed below.  If yes, it was not 
Done.  Tom Constantine has been working the drafts for Dale.  Can I get Tom 
to make the change, resend back out as the final and get to Lee Johnson as 
well as Rose Engeldorf?

Kay/Bill,

Bill says he agrees and accepts our comments to the A&A.

One change required to the Rev 5 document.  In Exhibit B, Add item "27)One
additional Human Machine Interface (HMI) per Unit (desktop PC type)"

Include these changes and we can get this done tomorrow.

Thanks,

Lee

Kent,

Please review and note that this needs to be completed by week's end.
Closing date is 5/1 and I'm out rest of week 5/2-6.  We may need some of
Kay's help if we don't like what we see.  But let's try to work it out with
Dale Rasmussen first (Enron Portland office).

Lee

Hello Lee.  (I know your thinking - What now!)

As I'm sure you know, we are fast approaching a full notice to proceed on
the LVCII project.  One item that we have as part of our EPC contract with
Modern Continental South, is an Assignment and Assumption Agreement whereby
MCS will assume certain responsibilities for (owner), and abide by the
conditions set forth in that agreement.  We will ask GE to participate in
that Agreement.  I have attached that agreement to this e mail for your
review.  Current plans are for a full NTP (Notice To Proceed) to begin
construction on May 1, and we are working hard to be ready for that key
milestone to occur. Your review and concurrence on the draft document
attached below is appreciated.

Please review and contact me should you have any questions.

Sincerely

W. J.  (Bill) Williams Jr
