It would be very helpful if you could participate, or have your designee 
participate.  Sorry for  the short notice (what else is new). Perhaps we can 
also arrange a discussion about the interconnection agreement.

I'm out this am, but will pick up voice mail.

Thanks,

Kay

PS  I can't wait to hear about St. Lucia.

Subject: Edgecombe Energy and Capacity Contract

In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process 
of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.

Thanks,

Kay

Some of you may have received this already.  I have not compared it against
