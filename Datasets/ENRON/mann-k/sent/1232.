SZ really grows on you, doesn't he?  Just like Carlos.

Neil leaves tomorrow.  He was out ONE night last week.  I am encouraging him 
to get a hunting lease.  He thinks I'm very supportive.

Yes, Norman is out of town.  Isn't Neal out of town too?  I'm sorry about the 
strep throat.  I sure hope it doesn't get you like it did last year (that was 
awful)!  I still haven't done anything with the Confidentiality doc. for 
Peoples.  Maybe I can work on it tomorrow and get with you next week.

One funny note, I was looking for a document on Stuart's directory and found 
a file called "Jeffrey Kennan is getting on my nerves.doc".  It was an 
Easement Agreement.  When I found that, I almost fell out of my chair 
laughing!

Take care of you and your little man!

Poor Carlos.  He is almost pitiful.  I think it is a great idea to watch for 
a good networking opportunity.

I'm off on Friday, too.  In fact, both Michael and I have strep throat and 
spent the day at home.  I'll probably be in no more than 1/2 day tomorrow.  
Is Norman still out of town?  Will you have the house ALL to yourself?

Kay

Hi Kay,

I just talked to Carlos.  They had their meeting today with the EES group, 
and what can I say?  Since Carlos told me that you are his exclusive head 
hunter, can I be the mingling coordinator?  Don't you think it might be nice 
to have Carlos meet Stuart and some of the group, like for lunch or 
something?  He is feeling sooooo lost.

By the way, I think I am taking Friday off, okay?

Kathleen
