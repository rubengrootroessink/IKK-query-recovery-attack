fyi, Steve should work with Ms. Clark to determine amount of payoff is 
required for TurboPark.  Obviously, this is impacted by the date of payoff.

We have discussed with GE et all the prospect of a changed order to the 
existing master contract for the new ones.  So far, no one can find a problem 
with that approach.
