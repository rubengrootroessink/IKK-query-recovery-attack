Just want you to know that I should be getting an EPC  form to work on from 
EECC re 9710. I didn't get to discuss this with J. Schwartzenburg on Friday, 
since I didn't see him for after work on Friday.  I opted to see Michael 
instead since I had been out of town.

I've got the form break out contract for the LM 6000's.  I'll get it ready 
for you to review re the ESA deal.  It will probably take me a few days to 
get it in shape to let it go.

Hope you've had a great weekend.  I don't  think the weather could have been 
better.

Kay

Kay, I have a forom inmy hands that I will finish over the weekend and get to 
you on Monday to workfrom. Does that work for us from a timing pointof view? 
I know how you like to work weekends.

Also too, and more important: are you up from drinks this evening? We are 
hoping you can break a tie between keffer (Paper City) and me (Roll-in).

Hi guys,

Just wanted to check to see if there is a "go by" affiliate EPC contract, 
destined to be 97 10 compliant?  I'm ready to start working on it from ENA's 
standpoint.

Thanks,

Kay
