Subject: joke; from "da hudgins"

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment:
Get their parents to
 tell them a story with a moral at the end of it. The
next cay the kids
 came back and one by one began to tell their stories.

Janey said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of
egg-laying hens.
One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket
on the front seat of
the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the
eggs went flying and
broke and made a mess.

"And what's the moral of the story?" asked the teacher.
"Don't put all
your eggs in one basket!"

"Very good," said the teacher.

Next little Lucy raised a hand and said, "Our family
are farmers too. But
we raise chickens for the meat market. We had a dozen
eggs one time, but
when
they hatched we only got ten live chicks and the moral
to this story is,
don't count your chickens until they're hatched."

"That was a fine story Lucy

Johnny, do you have a story to share?"

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my Aunt
Karen. Aunt Karen
was a flight engineer in Desert Storm and her plane got
hit.  She had to
bail
out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle
of whiskey, a
machine gun and a machete. She drank the whiskey on the
way down so it
wouldn't
break and then she landed right in the middle of 100
enemy troops. She
killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she
ran out of  bullets,
then she killed twenty more with the machete till the
blade broke and then
she killed the last ten with her bare hands.

"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "what kind
of moral did your
  Daddy tell you from that horrible story?"

"Stay the Hell away from Aunt Karen when she's been
drinking."
