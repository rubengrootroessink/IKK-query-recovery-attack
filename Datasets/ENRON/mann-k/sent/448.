Both are in VEPCO, names under the Word icon on the email.  I'll try to 
remember next time.

It's easier if you just tell me the names because I have to know 
directories.  I assume these are in your VEPCO files.  I'm going to try and 
see if Comparerite works. If not, I'll do it the old fashion way, the Word 
way.
