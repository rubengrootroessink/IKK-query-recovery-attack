Hi Steve,

We need wiring instructions for the account that will receive the $ from 
escrow.  It should be an  account where money goes in and out in one day.  
Can you track down the info?

We are waiting for the lenders to comment on the proposal that they will 
close once we deliver our deliverables.  Stay tuned!

Kay
