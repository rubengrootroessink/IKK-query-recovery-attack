I expect to be out of town Wednesday and Thursday of next week (don't worry, 
Ben can ALWAYS find me).  I would like to review the stuff before I leave 
town.  Could I come over Tuesday and give it a look?

Do you guys think we need or should give Intergen the assignment docs and the 
bills of sale?
