I haven't seen it come back.  I spoke with Lynn around Christmas, and he said 
the person who would sign was out of town, but was supposed to be back last 
week.  I'll be glad to follow up.   I was out last week and just haven't 
worked to that point on my "to do" list.

NEPCO and EECC have signed, by the way.
