I forgot about Grandma.  I bet you love the temperature today (BRRRR).

Hamburgers sound good to me.  

I think MAM does ok in the morning, he just needs his hours of sleep.  Paige 
was worse to get up.

I had to drag him out of bed this morning. He is not a morning person like
his mom. I think he is more like his sister in that regard. We made it on
time and he even finished breakfast.
Remember I will be taking grandma to the doctor today. If the weather holds
maybe I will grill burgers tonight and get Michael can get to bed early.
Love, Neil
