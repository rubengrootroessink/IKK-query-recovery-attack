I had a HUGE lunch (Vincent's), so something  light sounds good.  We could do

So do we have someone to watch the menagerie?

I can probably get out around 600.  I could probably leave sooner, but I

I haven't talked to Ozzie today.  When I spoke with him last night, we were
arranging to meet in NYC next Wednesday, and I told him we could celebrate
there.

The closing dinner for the big financing will be on Feb. 8.

Just thought I'd keep you current!
