I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really=

Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I=20

need to make a list of Exhibits called out in the current doc version, pull=

them all together, and clean them up.=20

Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff? [Rorschach, Reaga=

Kay,

We are starting to run into some scheduling constraints for next week, at=
=20
least with Bob Priest.  I'd like to get together with Bob and Marvin early=
=20
next week to discuss the agreement--moving toward finalizing before June 12=
. =20
Bob is only available Monday.  Bob and Marvin think it is a good ideal to=
=20
then meet with RW Beck.

I'd like to email Marvin and Bob the next version sometime today?
