Thanks.  I really appreciate all your good work, and will pass that along to 
David Runnels and Paul Pipitone soon.

Subject: Exhibit M-1 of CA Energy Development/ABB Facility Agreement

Yesterday, Mike Sandridge faxed me an addition to the spare parts listed
on Exhibit M-1.  The additional spare parts were "Lot Spare Bushings".
However, the information he provided does not show the expected purchase
lead time, which is provided for other items in Exhibit M-1.  It is a
minor issue, but can I e-mail Mike directly for clarification, or would
you have someone on the business team pass this along?
