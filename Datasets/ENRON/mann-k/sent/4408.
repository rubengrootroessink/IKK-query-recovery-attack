Life being what it is, I've received a mark up of the tolling term sheet, 
which crossed in the mail with the mark up you sent.

Ben/Kay:

Attached are my comments on the Midway Tolling term sheet and LOI.  

I will be out on Monday but will have my cell phone on.  My conversations 
will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes, but I will do my best to be 
available.

Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss.  I have asked Dave 
Kellermeyer to call either one of you on Monday with an answer to the minimum 
block size for the tolling term sheet.  I am taking the air permit home to 
review and will leave you a message if I determine the answer.

Fred
