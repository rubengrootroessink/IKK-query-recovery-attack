Hi Kara,

Michael has been seeing a speech/language therapist, and recently she raised 
an issue about Michael's ability to "blend and unblend" sounds in words, 
specifically as it relates to reading readiness.  She had this conversation 
with Neil, so I don't know the details.  We are meeting with her today to get 
more input, but I wanted to mention it to you, just in case you had a comment.

I know this is something we can discuss at Michael's conference on May 31st, 
but if you would like to discuss it before hand, I can be reached at 713 304 
8716 9 (cell), 713 345 -7566 (office - just tell my asst you are Michael's 
teacher), 713 973 6325.

Thanks so much,

Kay
