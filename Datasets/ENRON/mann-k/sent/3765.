Subject: Status of LVCII - E-Next gas turbine breakout contract

Hello to all.

This e mail is just a request for completion status of the GE Breakout 
contract for the LVCII gas turbines.  We are contemplating a full notice to 
proceed with the EPC contractor May 1, 2001.  The breakout contract is an 
exhibit to the EPC contract, and we would like to have the executed version 
for our file.

No pressure - just a request for status and a heads up as to what is ongoing 
with the LVCII project.

Cheers

Bill W.
