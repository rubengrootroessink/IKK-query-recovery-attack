I guess someone thought of this again.  I'll wait to see what Ben says.

This is when I'm out of town, which is fine by me.

I would suggest the week of the 19th through the 23rd. Wednesday and Thursday 
evenings work well for business dinners/socials.

I have always enjoyed Americas, Churascos, or Cafe Annie for business 
gatherings.  I think that we should invite the Coral folks just to keep the 
night interesting (we can also talk with them about other transaction 
opportunities - they may be in the market for additional projects).

Have any steps been taken to plan this event?  I can call John Jones at 
Intergen to run the concept and dates past him.  Let me know.  I am in the 
office until 2 pm on Wednesday and then on vacation on Thursday and Friday.

Subject: LM6000 Closing Dinner - It's About Time!

Folks:

I'd like to get everyone together for a closing dinner around the 1st of 
March or so to commemorate the closing of the Intergen LM6000 deal. Other 
people I'd like to invite include: Kevin Presto, Janet Dietrich, Lee Johnson, 
Carolyn Campbell, John Keffer, George Kuchbach (sp?), John Jones, Doug 
Pedigo, and Chris Colbert. We can also use this as an opportunity to talk to 
Intergen about other transaction opportunities. Any thoughts on whether we 
should invite the Coral folks?

 Please let me know your availability, and of any restaurant recommendations.

Thanks,


Ben
