ABB is struggling with a fundamental assignment issue.  Their concern appears 
to relate to assignment to a project company or contractor which might not 
have the financial ability to pay.  I believe they are looking for some type 
of security (LC, bond, guaranty).  I didn't sense that they have an issue 
with the identity of the assignee, just the ability to pay.

Comments?
