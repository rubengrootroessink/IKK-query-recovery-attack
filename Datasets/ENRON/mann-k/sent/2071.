I'm trying to clean up after Blue Girl.  Can you tell me again who signs for 
LJM so that I can get signature?  Who does their legal work?  

Thanks,

Kay

With high hopes that this is the FINAL final version, I'm attaching what I 
believe to be the execution copy.  Some things have been cleaned up, and 
Brownsville has been added to paragraph 5.  I'm going to start collecting 
signatures.

Thanks,

Kay
