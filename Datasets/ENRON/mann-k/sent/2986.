Sorry to hear about Bobby's wreck.  I hope he feels ok tomorrow.  Neil's 
number at work is 713 596 8716, and  his email is nmann@erac.com.  I know you 
probably checked this, but are you sure you don't have car rental insurance 
under your auto policy?  Always good to check.

Paige got a kick out of seeing Bobby.  I'm sure he enjoyed the fine cuisine.

I feel the same about going up next week.  There will probably be a more 
appropriate time later.

Paige is coming home for SB next week.  I suspect she'll come Friday or 
Saturday, but don't know for sure.  We are probably going to the Matagorda 
livestock show and auction this weekend, and maybe the rodeo.  It must be 
good - like the Belton rodeo.

Hi and hugs to all!

Love,

Kay
