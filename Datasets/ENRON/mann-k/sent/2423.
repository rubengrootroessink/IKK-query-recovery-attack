Subject: January 8 Letter Agreement with Original Signature of Sweetgum

Kay and Carolyn,

Ozzie Pagan just handed me a letter agreement with Sweetgum's original 
signature on it.  It is the January 8 letter from ENA to Sweetgum with 
enclosures of the final execution forms of the three (3) Facility Agreements 
(Receipt acknowledged by Sweetgum).

Kay,  do you want me to send this to Carolyn?

Kathleen
