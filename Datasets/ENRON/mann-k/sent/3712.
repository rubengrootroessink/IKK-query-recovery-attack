Subject: ENA Request for Instruction from PPL

Kay:

Another thought:  It seems that perhaps we should require a letter from PPL
instructing ENA that the attached forms of Promissory Note, Security
Agreement and Financing Statement are the forms desired, negotiated and
approved by PPL for purposes of obtaining its financing, and acknowledging
that PPL indemnifies ENA from and against, and that ENA shall have no
liability or responsiblity, whether pursuant to the letter agreement or as
sole member or otherwise for, the substance or content of the Promissory
Note, Security Agreement and Financing Statement.  What do you think?

Is there anything we need to get them to consent to?
