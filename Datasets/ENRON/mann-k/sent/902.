Karen,

It appears to me that this version of the document allocates a new risk to 
Enron:  risk of damage to a certain road during construction.  It would seem 
that the responsibility to repair it should be limited to damage done as a 
result of the construction.  Also, it is unclear as written as to whether we 
can repair it ourselves, or whether the City fixes it and sends us the bill.  
What is the intent?

Thank you,

Kay

Subject: Yorkville Annexation Agreement

Kay:  As Mark Gershon mentioned in his email, we are wrapping up the
Yorkville Annexation Agreement.  For your benefit, I have forwarded to you
by fax (to fax number 713-646-3491) an additional copy of the final revised
Annexation Agreement for your review and approval.  As  I mentioned in the
fax coversheet, upon your approval, I will substitute the original signature
pages from teh previously executed version with the final version.  We had
previously received approval from teh Konicek's to do the same with their
original signature pages.  Thanks and please call with any questions or
comments.
