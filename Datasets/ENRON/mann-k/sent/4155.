I'm leaving on vacation after tomorrow for 2 1/2 weeks and there's no way I 
can get to this before I leave.  Would you please handle this for me in the 
interim?  If not, please talk to Kay about who could handle this for Greg in 
my absence.  It may just need to go to outside counsel.

Thanks!

I will review this, but one of you needs to also.  Thanks.
