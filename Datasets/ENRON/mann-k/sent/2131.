Per the prior e-mail, I am forwarding the InterGen draft of an ENA

Citibank has advised me that we need Enron to provide an incumbency
certificate.  I've attached a blank one for you to fill in the appropriate
people.  They need this as soon as possible.  They also need us to insert
wiring instructions into each of the Escrow agreements - I am in the process
of inserting our instructions - please provide your wiring instructions as
soon as possible.
