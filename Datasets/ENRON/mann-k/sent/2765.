I'm all for that.  I may take him out very early to look at the tractors.

Subject: Sharon Seals appointment

Sharon just called asking about Michael's 2/19 appointment at 5:30. She
knows it's a holiday for some kids and has an opening at 2:30 if you would
like to change it. Please e-mail her at rseals@pdq.net and let her know what
you want to do.
I just remembered the 19th is Lyle. Why not give Michael the day off?  NM
