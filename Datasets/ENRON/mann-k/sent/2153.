Scott:

Please find attached a draft CA between Enron North America and NRG
Development Co., Inc. per our discussions on power plant project
opportunities.

Please review and provide me with your comments/proposed changes.  If this
form is acceptable, please have it signed by an appropriate representative
of NRG Development Co., Inc. and fax to me at (713) 646-3037.  I will then
forward you two signed originals for NRG's execution.

If you have any questions or wish to discuss, please contact me at (713)
853-5406.  I will be out of the office next week but can be reached by cell
phone at (713) 412-4612.  Please leave a voice message on my cell phone and
I will respond as soon as possible.

Best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season.

Regards,
Fred Mitro
