Never a dull moment!  It is hard to get deals done at Enron, which as 
shareholders we should probably be glad. Chicago is only slightly more 
difficult because of the utility angle - and mind set.  

Michael's temperature STILL hasn't gone done.  And of course, now the weekend 
is coming.  I guess it is time to call the doctor again.  And you!
