Hi Paul,

Any luck with the draft of the ABB facility agreement form?  Looks like we 
might have some business.

I have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to GE, but have not had 
any comments.  I would like to set up a conference call with GE to discuss 
it.  How is your schedule tomorrow or Monday?

Thanks,

Kay
