Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is a legal memo regarding Westinghouse's delivery obligations with 
respect to the 501D5A gas turbine generator package.  I will forward you an 
additional copy by fax.
