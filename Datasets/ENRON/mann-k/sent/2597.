Kay:

I talked with Gary Hickey at Dynegy this afternoon regarding their interest 
in doing a deal involving one or both of the following:

 1.  Purchasing 100% of the member interests of an ENA development project,

 2.  A transaction involving generation equipment (7EA, W 501D5A, or LM 6000)

Gary is a V.P. over Dynegy's eastern U.S. and International Development 
group.  He indicated that their preferred areas for a development project 
transaction would be in the SERC, PJM, and Illinois regions.  I described the 
equipment available for transactions and Gary said that he would take a few 
days to look into it and get back to me.

Please draft a CA that would encompass these potential transaction 
structures.  I am sure that Enron and Dynegy must have a form of CA that has 
been agreed upon in the past.  Let's see if we can use that form with only 
the minimal required changes.  Please forward me the draft so that I can get 
it to Gary by Monday.  I am cc Kathleen as she is looking into the 
Constellation Power CA for you.

Thanks,
Fred
