Duran is fine. I had it in my mind that Calger had signed the incumbancy=20
cert.  My mistake.

I'm trying to set up a closing table and have these guys sign this am befor=

Subject: RE: escrow instruction

Kay:

The person signing the escrow instruction must be someone who is listed on
the incumbency certificate that we previously submitted to Citibank (i.e.,
Thomas or Duran).  Can we change the signatory to Duran as opposed to
Calger?

(I suppose we have the same issue with PPL, as Vicens is not named on PPL's
incumbency certificate and Citibank already raised that issue for them on
the escrow agreement.  I will let Greg Lang know.)

Carolyn,

Please revised the signature page for escrow instruction to reflect Chris
Calger as a signatory.

Thanks,

Kay
