I haven't seen the originals.  I can send you an email which has the name of 
the files, but I do need them printed so that the footer appears with the 
name as opposed to the temp file number.

Thanks!

Kay

I told them to bring the originals back to you because I thought you needed 
them.  Do you have them so I can come get them and do this for you.

Suz,

Please print four sets of originals of each of the documents you faxed this 
am (name in footers).  

Thanks,

Kay
