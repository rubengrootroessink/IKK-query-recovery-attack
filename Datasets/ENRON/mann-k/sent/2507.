Hi Charlotte,

We are starting to check out our options for the summer, and one of the 
things we are considering is the day camp that Enron is involved with.  They 
pick up and deliver from the Enron building, and I was wondering if you might 
consider picking Michael up from here (Enron).  I suspect most days he could 
go to your place.

I have no idea if this is the direction we will go, but I thought I would run 
it by you early on.  I have to think about how much travel I might have, as 
it might be hard on Neil to take Michael downtown in the morning.  Paige has 
applied for a job at Enron, though, so if that worked out we would be in good 
shape.

Here's a link.   They have some neat themes.

Have you heard of any other good day camps?  You seem to be plugged in fairly 
well.

Thanks,

Kay
