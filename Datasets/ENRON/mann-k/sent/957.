Here is the ABB contract you referenced in your email.

I am working on a 97-10 compliant EPC contract for NEPCO/EECC.  However, I 
wonder about the challenges presented with the need for NEPCO to enter into 
subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all 
the way down the line. This is a very tall order given the contracting 
environment.

Your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off 
the balance sheet, and worthy of further discussion.

Hi Paul,

This will need the same facilities agreement treatment as the GE contract we 
are working on.

Thanks,

Kay
