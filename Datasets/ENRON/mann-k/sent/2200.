Attached please find drafts of the following:

Notice
Assignment and assumption agreement (with GE acknowledgement)
Bill of sale
Exhibits for bill of sale and for the notice

I expect that there will be sets of documents for CA Energy Development I and 
CA Energy Development II.  CA Energy Development II will include a 
transformer as well as a turbine generator set.

Please let me know if you have any comments.
