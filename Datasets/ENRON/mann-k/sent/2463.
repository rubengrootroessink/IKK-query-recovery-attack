Baby Michael arrived today!
8:00 a.m.
9 lbs. 1 oz.
22 inches

Leslie went into labor last night, and mother and child are doing great!  
They will be at Women's Hospital, Room 424 for a couple of days.  Michael and 
Leslie are still deciding on a middle name.  Emma will be going to see her 
new baby brother later on today!  
Congratulations to the whole family!
