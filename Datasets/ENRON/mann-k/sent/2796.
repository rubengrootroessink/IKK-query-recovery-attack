Sounds good on all fronts. What about the Coral guys?

Do you want to include Mike Sandridge also?  Kathleen?

I'm happy to volunteer my assistant, Suzanne, to help with the logistics, 
restaurant suggestions, keeping track of rsvp's.

Subject: LM6000 Closing Dinner - It's About Time!

Folks:

I'd like to get everyone together for a closing dinner around the 1st of 
March or so to commemorate the closing of the Intergen LM6000 deal. Other 
people I'd like to invite include: Kevin Presto, Janet Dietrich, Lee Johnson, 
Carolyn Campbell, John Keffer, George Kuchbach (sp?), John Jones, Doug 
Pedigo, and Chris Colbert. We can also use this as an opportunity to talk to 
Intergen about other transaction opportunities. Any thoughts on whether we 
should invite the Coral folks?

 Please let me know your availability, and of any restaurant recommendations.

Thanks,


Ben
