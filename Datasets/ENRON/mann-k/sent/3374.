Opps.  No, I don't have anything yet.  I got a message from Ben 2 hours ago 
that said to hold off on Montana Power.  Did you hear differentlly?

The issue is getting an assignment agreement that GE will sign.  I've 
requested copies of the docs signed on the Pastoria deal, which is the most 
recent GE frame assignment transaction.  That should be our starting point.

Kay,

Once we sign the exclusivity agreement, I would like to get MPC a draft of 
the Assignment document for their review.  How long will it take to have a 
version ready for MPC.

Thanks,

Chris
