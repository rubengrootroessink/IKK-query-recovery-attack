My understanding is that they are putting all "new" employees in the Enron 
address book because they are going to consolidate all the entities.

Kay, could you please have your assistant get your name and E-Mail address 
moved into the "ECT Adress Book" rather than the ENRON Corp Address book.  If 
there is a specific need for you to remain in the Enron Corp address 
directory, please let me know.     Thanks bng
