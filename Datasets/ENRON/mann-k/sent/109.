I'm glad you found something interesting to do. Let me know if you meet 
anybody famous!

We now have televisions in the elevators.  At first, CNN ran all the time.  
This morning we started getting messages from management about the SAP 
program.  It is kind of odd to get into an empty elevator, but hear voices.  

I was discussing Enron with my 20 year old daughter.  I found it difficult to 
summarize what Enron does, and what kind of opportunities it has for college 
grads.  Any wisdom you have on the subject would be appreciated.

I know your husband must be overjoyed to have you back.  His gain is our 
loss, but I understand completely.

Take care and keep in touch,

Kay

Hi Kay how are you! I have been back in Mexico for a month. I just started

world, but very interesting. I am working in the finance department, working
primarily in valuation of new investments. Well I just wanted to touch base
with you and say hi. I hope everythis is excellent!.
By the way I bumped into Jean Michele Enriquez the other day, and he loves
working with enron!.
Well if you are ever in Mexico, please let me know. My phone numbers here
are 525 292 1387 and 525 261 23 00.

Big hug. Lupe.
