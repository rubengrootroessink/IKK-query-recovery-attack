Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:



I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after "WestLB". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay
