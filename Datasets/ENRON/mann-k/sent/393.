Subject: All-Employee Meeting Postponed

We have decided to postpone the All-Employee Meeting, which was scheduled at 
10 a.m. Wednesday, August 9, and concentrate our efforts on a successful kick 
off of our 2000 Houston United Way campaign.  This year's United Way gameshow 
event, "Who Wants to Help Millions?", will run, as previously announced, from 
11:15 a.m. to noon in the Hyatt Regency's Imperial Ballroom, followed by 
lunch in Antioch Park from noon to 1:30 p.m.  We encourage all employees in 
Houston to attend this fun event and cheer your business unit representatives 
on to victory and to helping others in the community.

We will communicate the new date of the All-Employee Meeting as soon as it 
has been determined.
