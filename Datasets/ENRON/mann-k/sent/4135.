With your permission, I will send it to Lee and Kent.  Who else from ENA
should get a copy?

    <<City of Austin Gas Turbine Agt - Blackline of  83017 v.5 to
v.7.DOC>>


      Attached is a blackline of the City of Austin Turbine Agreement
   showing changes made to the version that went to GE on February 12.
This
   draft includes both Lee's and Eric's changes to Exhibit A, as well as
   the addition of the contacts for notices in Sections 25.1 and 25.3.
It
   also contains a few minor clean-up items identified by Lisa Bills
when
   she reviewed LV Cogen (e.g., the definitions of Performance Test
   Certificate and Performance Test Completion Certificate were out of
   order).  To complete the agreement, we will need to include the date
of
   execution and Exhibit H-2.  I particularly wanted Eric to review this
   before it went to the other side.  If it looks acceptable, I would be
   happy to send a copy to GE.
