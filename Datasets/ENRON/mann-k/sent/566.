I'll check on the geotech.  What is involved in the site development plan?

Don't give up! There may be a way to get this done.

Kay:

I have to get going with the Site Development Plan effort and Geotech work.  
From your email it sounds like I will be unable to do that.  If this is true 
that is likely to delay us a bit (approx. 3 - 4 weeks).

Please advise,

Jeffrey

Just a reminder that until the finance arrangements are fixed and the rules 
are clear, Enron can't incur any hard costs related to the Virginia Power 
deal.  This means Enron can't obligate itself to purchase any equipment or 
materials, or enter into any services agreements except for studies, etc.

I will try to get some clarification on what can be done at this point, and 
will pass it along as soon as possible.

Kay
