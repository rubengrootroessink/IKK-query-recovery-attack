Gentlemen,

Does the Mississippi constitution impact the issue?  The munies are 
specifically citing Section  100 of the Mississippi constitution, and have 
faxed me an opinion of the Mississippi AG interpreting this section. If you 
will email me your fax number I will fax it to you.

Kay

Subject: Consequential Damages in Mississippi


Kay-attached is a summary of the enforceability of consequential damages
clauses under the laws of Mississippi.  Greg Evans prepared the summary and
can answer any questions in my absence.  Greg can be reached at
713-751-3279.  I'll be on the road until Monday, but can retrieve e-mails
and voice mails.
