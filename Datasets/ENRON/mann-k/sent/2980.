Dale,

Has GE initialled all the pages of the break out contract?  If so, it would 
be very helpful if you could ship me the originals.  That way, we only have 
to change the names, which will make it easier for Lee when we have to ask 
him to sign.  Also, has someone from the Enron side initialled all the 
pages?  That helps, too!

Kay
