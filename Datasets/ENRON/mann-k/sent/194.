Hi Gregg,

Here is a new draft which incorporates comments that Boyd and I have made.  I 
haven't reviewed this version yet, but I wanted to get it to you asap. I 
would like to look at this draft before it goes to Peoples, and I'll give it 
priority for tomorrow am.

I spoke with Dave Gorde (RAC).  He is prepared to discuss line of credit/DASH 
at your convenience, although tomorrow he is tied up with PRC.

I'll go ahead and get a draft of a "simple" revolving line of credit doc 
started, unless you think otherwise.

Kay
