Gentlemen,

Here are some points which require commercial et al input:

Do we intend to include gas transactions in our calculation of profit?

We will be buying electricity to serve their load.  How should be be paid for 
those costs?  How often?

Jim Homco questioned whether we should buy the fuel oil.  What do you want to 
do?

I've added the definition of Scheduling Equipment Costs.  How should it be 
used in the agreement?  Are we limiting our provision of scheduling equipment 
to the equipment  listed in the exhibit?

What financial security will be required of them?

Are we attaching Marketing Strategy and Trading/Risk policy, or establishing 
a time line?

How do we deal with the possible cost of establishing a control area?  Are we 
absorbing it?  Will there be additional infrastructure costs?

Have the exhibits been updated?  If so, could I get the latest version?

Kay
