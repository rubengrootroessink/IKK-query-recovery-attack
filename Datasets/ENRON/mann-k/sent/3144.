Bob Carter has been working on this although he is transitioning it  to 
Carlos Sole.  Bob already contracted for the DC tie line.

Are either of you familiar with  this project? We have had no contact with 
the ENA/Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don't want to bust any 
structuring goals.

Our project manager (Scott Laidlaw) and engineer (Harry Okabayashi) want to 
issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to 
support the ENA work. 

I am not in the office today, so please include Renee Alfaro on your response.

Please clarify if our contractors including engineering services on the 
Texas-Mexico HVDC project are required to be "off-balance" sheet.

Best Regards,
