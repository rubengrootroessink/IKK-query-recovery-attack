We are getting the Enron treatment from Coral.  I hope Carolyn told you I 
called yesterday - Coral was looking for Shell approval.  I'm guessing it is 
in a coma.  I usually have 30 voice mails, and I have had 4 today, which 
tells you something.  Good  time for Michael to be sick!  

Carlos has interviews today and tomorrow with ENA.  I think he is looking 
good for Mexico.  You guys are the absolutely best qualified for that 
business, and I'll start planting that seed when I can. 

By the way, thanks for the great job on Coral.  Did you hear from Rose on the 
HSR on TurboPark?  

We do want Astros tickets for next year - at least 15 games.  Are more 
available?

I heard that Hampton had an issue with Patty Biggio (thank goodness, these 
salaries are absurd), and I guess I'm glad to see Ausmus come back.  However, 
he is not a substitute for a pitcher.  And how is Shane?

Ciao,

Kay
