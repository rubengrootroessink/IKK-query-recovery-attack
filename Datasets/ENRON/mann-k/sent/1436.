Hi Jeff and Barbara,

I would really like to stay where I am, if possible.  I like being close to 
Suzanne, not to mention the good neighbors and the benefit of facing the wall.

Thanks,

Kay

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a 
completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, 
November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.
