John Moore is unable to attend the meeting scheduled for Thursday at 9:00 
a.m., so we were wondering if you guys would be available at 9:00 a.m. on 
Friday.  Please let me know.  Thanks, Suzanne, x37340 or via email

In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process 
of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.

Thanks,

Kay
