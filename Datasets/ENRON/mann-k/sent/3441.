Kay,

I fiddled a little with the BPUB LOI.  You can see the redlined changes in 
the attached document.  Kathleen FEDEX'ed two CA orginals to BPUB yesterday 
evening and the plan is for them to sign the CA today, I will then email a 
clean LOI to BPUB and to their outside counsel, Davidson, in 
San Antonio.
