For better or worse, all the folks under the heading "Origination"  and 
"Development" are ours, although Kathleen has a special role with Development.

I received a report from HR and it appears there is conflicting information 
regarding some of the titles for various employees.  Please verify that the 
titles are correct for everyone in your group.  The ones that I made changes 
to are in red.

Thanks, Paula.

I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet.  Please 
use this new file as opposed to the one I sent earlier.

Please review the attached org chart for March and submit any changes by noon 
tomorrow.  It is imperative that all of the information on the attached file 
is accurate, including titles, as this information is being given directly to 
John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen.

Thanks, Paula.
