I feel fairly confident that you received change orders 1-4.  If not, please 
advise.  One of those change orders changed the delivery dates for the LV Co 
Gen equipment.

The Guaranteed Delivery Dates in Section 10.2.1 were taken from the
original agreement.  I am not aware of any change order modifying those
dates.

I'm reviewing.  Are dates in Section 10.2.1 correct?  Lee, I'll forward
you
my comments separately.
