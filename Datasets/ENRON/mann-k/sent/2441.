   I just noticed it's a Friday.  He's welcome to spend the night if
you like, and I'll bring him home the next morning.

Hi Charlotte,

We've been invited to someone's house for dinner on Feb 2.  Can you take
care of Michael?  The dinner is in River Oaks, so we could just drop him
off.

Michael  got a hair cut this weekend.  I think it makes him look taller.  I
wish it worked that way for me!  It is very short, and I think very cute.

Kay
