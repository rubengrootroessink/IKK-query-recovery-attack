I NEVER talk to him anymore.  I haven't talked to him in TWO weeks!  I 
usually don't go more than a day or two, at the most.

It is a message from him (although he appears to be silent, there was an 
earlier memo I did not send to you).  I wonder what is up other than his 
reduced hours in Houston, Debbie Chance leaving our group for paper.
