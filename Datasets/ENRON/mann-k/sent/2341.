Subject: RETIREMENT

It is with mixed emotions that I announce my plans to retire from Enron 
effective 1 February 2001.  On the one hand, I will look forward to the 
adventures that retirement offers; but on the other, I will miss working with 
those of you whom I have come to know over the years.  I thoroughly enjoyed 
my ten years with Enron, and it has been a privilege to lead EECC.  I wish 
all of you and Enron the very best and continued success.
