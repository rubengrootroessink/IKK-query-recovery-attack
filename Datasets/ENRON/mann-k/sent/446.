Gorman's will be picking up/delivering on Tues/Fri.  They had Mon/Thurs 
available, but Monday am is too hard to remember.  Besides, Delmis may be 
able to bring our clothes in on Tuesdays, and I'm generally home early on 
Friday.

Our driver's name is David.  His cell phone is 713 545 4186.  We can call him 
if we ever need pick up/delivery on a different day.

He will leave us a sack today.

How's that for cool?

Kay
