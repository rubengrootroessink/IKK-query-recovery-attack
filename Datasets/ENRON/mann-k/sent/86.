I think you sent me an email which had some information from the gang about 
the tests, etc.  Do you still have it?

Thanks,

Would you please call Mitcha and get the relevant information?  I suppose 
that a demand letter (under the warranty?) could be in order but any 
pre-litigation moves need to be coordinated with Richard Sanders.  Maybe this 
hasn't risen to that level yet, but $12 Million sounds pretty serious.
