Is this the same lady you asked about this morning? If not then the lady
this morning got the Lee Ann Womack tickets. The two Def Leppard tickets are
hers. Is she sure she does want all 4? Remember, with the purchase of 4 you
get the 5th one free, so to speak...NM

Kay,

If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack)
I would like to purchase those.

Do you mind checking to see if you have 2 tickets for March 1 (Def
Leppard), if you do I would like to purchase those also.

Just let me know.

Thanks so much!
