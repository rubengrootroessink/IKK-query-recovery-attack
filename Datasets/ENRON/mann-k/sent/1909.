Ben decided to send the exhibits to Coral, so that's where this question came 
from.

Will we have an exhibit U?

I know we owe you some answers from your email of the 6th.

Ben, Exhibit U indicates that liquid fuel guarantees are in Sec. 10.8.4.  I
could not fine them in that section.  Could you point me to where the liquid
fuel guarantees are located?
