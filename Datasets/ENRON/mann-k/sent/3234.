I have  a better chance of remembering "mamona".  I have to build up to the 
good stuff.

My home number is 713 973 6325.  If call notes picks up, try me on my cell at 
713 304 8716.  Did you find the fax?  You can fax it to me if that speeds up 
you getting out of the office.  Call and let me know.

Thanks,

Kay

I prefer "mamona" but "hija de su putisima madre" also has a nice ring.
Since I am at the office, would you guys like for me to conference you in
once the document arrives?  If so, what are your numbers?

Marisa can swear much better than me in Spanish.  Would "huevona" be
appropriate?
