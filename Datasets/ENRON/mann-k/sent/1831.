Ben

This is the letter that Bob Long from Coral Energy sent me.  I asked him if 
Shell would be a guarantor for Coral's debts, but he said that, no, Shell 
does not guarantee the debts, but instead provides the liquidity that Coral 
Energy needs in order to pay them.

As discussed Coral Energy LLC is 100% (direct/indirect) owned subsidiary of
Shell Oil Company ("Shell").  As in the ordinary course of business Shell
provides liquidity support to its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Given the short term nature of this obligation we would hope that you concur
that there is little risk in accepting this Guaranty from Coral Energy LLC.

Regards,


Robert E. Long
