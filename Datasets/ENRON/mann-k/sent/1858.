Kay, I have told Rob that we are not pushing GE for this point.  WestLB is 
plenty protected without it.  If GE gives a yes to the change on Monday - 
Great!  If no answer or answer is no - we take what we have.  Therefore, 
please log  call into GE on Monday am and let them know we need an answer on 
Monday and would appreciate if they would accomodate us.

Lisa

Kay mentioned to me (I think it was on Friday) that she may be talking to GE 
about this - don't know if she did or what the outcome was, so stay tuned.

Thanks,

Rose

Winston & Strawn has asked that the following be added to the Consents
to Assignment (e.g., in the "Successors and Assigns" paragraph):

"WestLB is an express third-party beneficiary of this Consent."

Please forward the revised draft of the GE Consent to Winston & Strawn
(toxley@winston.com).
