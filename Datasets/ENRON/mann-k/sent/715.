One of them is essential to the call.  If they can't change the time but 130 
Central is still ok with them, then leave it as is.  Please leave me a voice 
mail of the outcome.

Mike Barnas is traveling and Kent is in Houston.  I left both of them 
voicemails.  Rose is out of her ofc and I left her a vm too.  Are Mike and 
Kent critical in case they can't make the call?  Just wondering if I should 
cancel.  I need direction here please.  

Please leave me a copy of your itinerary so I'll know where you are.

Please check with Mike Barnas,Kent Shoemaker (GE contact list) and Rose 
Engeldorf and see if they are available at either 1100 Central tomorrow or 
100 Central.  If that works for them, please reschedule the conference call, 
send a confirming email to Mike, Steve Swift, Kent, Marty, Scott, Rose, 
Sheila (and leave her a voice mail -she is on the road), etc.

Thanks!

Kay

PS.  I have a 330 flight today- Heather arranged.  I'll let you know the 
details when I have them.  I'll travel to Chicago tomorrow, returning to 
Houston tomorrow at a decent hour.
