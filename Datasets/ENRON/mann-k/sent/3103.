Reagan,

Specifying it is for infrastructure costs may cause heartache.  

Don't worry, I'll do the legal work!

Subject: Infrastructure Costs

Kay:  Based on my conversation with Marvin, I think he is looking for 
something like this:

EPMI would be guaranteed a monthly minimum fee as reimbursement for 
infrastructure costs calculated as the amoritized capital costs over the 
contract period.  The monthly minimum will be considered to be met provided 
EPMI's 40% share exceeds the monthly amoritized cost calculation.  Otherwise 
"The Cities" agree to pay the shortfall between the guaranteed minimum and 
the profits acrued to EPMI during the particular month.

Just thought I'd communicate it a little better after I thought about some 
more.  Try it on for size, see what David thinks, ....

Thanks,

Reagan
