Hi Steve,

Good to hear from you.  

Your right, my job is completely different.  Funny how things evolve like 
that.  I love it, though.  Very few hurt/sick/deceased folks.

Paige is finishing her junior year at Southwestern, and Michael is in 
kindergarten at St Francis.  We are very blessed.

Hope all is well with your family.

Kay
