I suspect they are accustomed to people wanting to structure for an MTM deal 
from a commercial standpoint.  Doesn't sound like our objective here.

Kay -- The comments in the attached doc relate primarily to accrual vs. MTM 
accounting.  They seem to be recommending repeatedly that our language covers 
an accrual accounting deal, and does not work for MTM accounting.  Is this 
assumption correct, or am I missing the point?  Please let me know what you 
think.  Thanks -- David

Here's the latest, not-yet-final-but-getting-better agreement.

I may not have sent this to everyone who needs it, but I know Reagan will 
take care of it.  Speaking of Reagan, he is generating exhibits.
