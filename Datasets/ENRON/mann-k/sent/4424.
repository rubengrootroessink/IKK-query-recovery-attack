Why would you ask a question out of the blue?

When you ask a question you usually have heard a rumor.  What did you hear?

The New York Hilton sounds good and the location is good.  We are paying for 
this, so we don't want to spend a fortune.  I also emailed Nellie in 
Klauberg's office to see if she had any recommendations/connections.  You 
know I do make sure his bills get paid!!!!!!!

Are you going to be doing business on your vacation days because if you are, 
I'm not going to charge you.  I just don't think that's right.  Have you guys 
had any new additions to your group?

Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may 
favorite locations. It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I 
can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I 
might remember the names.
