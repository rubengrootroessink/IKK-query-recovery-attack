Hi Stacy,

I don't know if Jeff or Debra mentioned this to you, but this is a master we 
need in place in connection with a gas/power asset management arrangement 
with the cities of Yazoo City and Clarksdale Mississippi.  As you can see, 
Jeff suggested you take a look at it before it is sent to the customer.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached are drafts of the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement for gas.  Upon 
completion of a guaranty I will incorporate a section for same.
