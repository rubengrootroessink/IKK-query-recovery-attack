I haven't worked with any workout folks.  Do you know Lisa Mellencamp (in ENA 
Legal)?  She isn't in that area any more, but she used to be.  She might know 
the players.

Thanks very much Kay!

It certainly was a challenge.. it was great to have the moral support from 
you and others in Legal and Finance!

Now I need to determine what to do for an encore... know of any good 
(corporate finance) workout positions?

Best to you,

Chip

Congratulations on your promotions, which demonstrate that ethical standards 
(coupled with stubborness) deserve to be  rewarded!
