Heather, 

Doesn't look like this will apply to you.  The person we need to include in 
our discussion is out of town.

Talk to you soon,

Kay

I don't think we need Heather for this conversation.  The goal is to finish 
the necessary templates, namely ISDA and guarantees, and determine a process 
for negotiating with third parties going forward.  What do you think?

Gregg

Is this something I should have Heather Brown participate in?
