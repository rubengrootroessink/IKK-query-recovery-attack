Hey Andrea,

We are going to FW tomorrow, as my dad is having surgery to unclog one of his 
carotid arteries.  I'm kinda nervous about this one.  Everything else is 
going well.  Michael, Paige and Neil are all well and happy.  Paige has 
applied to the Astros for a summer job.  Seems like a long shot, but she 
really wants to do it.  Michael has a kid in his class named Colin Waters.  
His dad is the travel secretary for the Astros.  Unfortunately, I haven't met 
him yet.

I can't wait to hear about your reunion.  I know it will be a blast.  Have 
fun!

Kay

Kay - just checking in.
I go to Orlando Thursday for 25th college reunion.
Will try to get to the Astros game Friday.
Been working at our Greenway Plaza office until the
one at Woodway/610 is expanded/improved, etc.
Word has is we may not start the Equiva account until
May - supposed to be April 2, but we are all busy
loading hundreds of traveler profiles.
Hope all is well with you!
Andrea
