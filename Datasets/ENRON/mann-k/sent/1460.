I got lots done Saturday, but I can't remember what!  You know how that 
goes.  I bought a few Christmas presents, which felt good.  I went to the 
grocery store and spent lots of time without rushing.  That felt decadent.

We didn't get hit too badly.  Jack ran off during the worst part of the 
storm, scaring Neil and I horribly.  A  neighbor brought him back.  We are 
having an electronic fence installed soon, so I hope that will help.  

I'm glad Michael got to see Uncle Bob.  He was very impressed that his name 
was so close to Uncle Bobby's.  

I'm guessing that we may come down for a day or two next week.  Sorry I can't 
get organized.

Hope you are enjoying better weather today!

Love,

Kay

Hi Sweetheart. Dad and I wanted you to know we missed you but enjoyed both
your boys.Just sorry the weather was not better. Micheal was on his very
best behavior[Neil also]. Uncle Bob was so glad to see them. After they
left he was sorry he had not taken a picture of them. We enjoyed their
visit. They left to go home this morning. Did you get any shopping done
this week end? Did you have a bad storm at your house last night? We just
had rain. Let us know your plans for the holidays when you can see Paige's
plans. We understand. Love you,Mother
