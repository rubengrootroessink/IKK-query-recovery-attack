Scott,

I'll give you what we got from FCE when we meet at 300.  Remind me if I 
forget!

Kay

Subject: Fuel Cells


1.  Can I get a copy of the FuelCell Energy purchase order form.  Jeff said 
that you would have a copy.
2.  I forwarded to you a memo from Bingham that discusses the permitting 
requirements for the proposed projects.  FYI--I plan to call Bingham today 
with some follow up questions.
3. I forwarded to you a memo by ENSR on the air permit requirements for fuel 
cells.
4.  Please let me know when you can meet today to discuss the MOU.
