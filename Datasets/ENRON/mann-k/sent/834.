I need to provide the NCPUC a copy of the incorporation documents as soon as 
I can. How long will it take?

Kay

I have requested for CT Corp. the best route to correct the spelling of 
Edgecombe.  I believe we file a Cert of Correction.  CT Corp will confirm 
this afternoon.

The only other documents I have in my file which will need to be replaced are 
the LLC agmt and the officer election consent.

I will proceed expeditously and let you know when complete.

Hi Matt,

We have an LLC which should  be signing a contract soon.  I believe the name 
as filed was Edgecomb Development, but it should be Edgecombe Development, 
LLC, named for the county in which the power plant will be built.  Can you 
take care of getting this changed officially?

This may sound silly, but our customer looked up the official records and 
pointed this out, so we need to fix it. Also, we have told the State that the 
name is Edgecombe.

Many thanks,

Kay
