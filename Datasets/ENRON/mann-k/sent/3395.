Gentlemen:

We have enclosed revised drafts of the following documents:

1.  Letter Agreement between ENA and PPL, marked to reflect revisions from
the prior draft dated April 1, 2001;
2.  LLC Agreement between ENA and PPL, marked to reflect revisions from the
prior draft dated March 16, 2001; and
3.  Guaranty Agreement from Delta in favor of ENA, marked to reflect
revisions from Delta's draft dated April 2, 2001.

These documents are being furnished simultaneously to Enron, and are
therefore subject to further review.

We suggest a conference call at 1:00 p.m. central time today to review these
documents.  Please use the same dial in and pass code numbers (877-232-0064;
25581#).

Thank you.
