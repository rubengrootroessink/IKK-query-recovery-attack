Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name 
has been misspelled.  I have been speaking with Peoples recently about the 
potential sale of some financial options via Enovate.  This has brought up to 
issue of the ISDA agreement.  I don't know if you are the one working on this 
specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person 
working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and 
that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension 
is 36900.

Thanks,

Steve

Sara,

We were trying to finalize the ISDA between PEC and Enovate.
Fred is going to be out of the office until Thursday, but I wanted to
forward the ISDA information he has been working on.
Based on the ISDA materials attached, do you know how close (best quess:
number of days, weeks or months) we are to finalizing the contract?

Thanks,
Brian
