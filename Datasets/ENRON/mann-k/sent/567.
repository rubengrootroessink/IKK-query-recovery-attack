Hi Gerry,

Enron is a great place for an engineer to work in a non-technical position.  
In fact, I work with reformed engineers daily, in various capacities.  

Enron has an analyst program for college graduates, where the analysts go 
through six month rotations in various parts of the business. In addition, 
there is a good job search feature on Enron's website.  If you see something 
that looks promising, I'll check things out around here to see if I can get 
the inside scoop.  

FYI, Enron North America, Enron Broadband, and Enron Energy Services are good 
choices.  ENA is the old Enron Capital & Trade, so it is the real heart of 
Enron (yes, it is where I now work).  Enron is also focusing on industrial 
development (paper, steel, and who knows what else). I don't suggest EECC. 

Hope to see you soon,

Kay
