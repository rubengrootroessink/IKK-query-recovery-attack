Please email me whatever version of the doc you sent to them.  

When it is time for discussions meaningful discussions I would like to be 
involved.  

Thanks,

Kay

I asked Scott Maggie (NRG-CA) to see if their comments could be forwarded to 
us tomorrow so that we can better prepare for Friday's call.  The 
NRG-Pittsburg personell are a commercial business person, a developer, and 
NRG legal.  I am OK proceeding without legal on the line.  I can handle the 
questions that come up on the transaction structure.

Fred:

I think it's premature to have legal on the line. If they have specific 
comments on the docs, they need to send them to us and we can quickly get 
back to them. If they want to have a commercial discussion, we can proceed 
without legal.

Thanks,

Ben

Kay:

I spoke to NRG this morning.  They would like to arrange a conference call 
for Friday (most likely in the morning) to discuss the proposed transaction 
involving the GE 7EA.  Are you available to call in from New York?  If not, 
can Carolyn Campbell sit in for you on the call?

Let me know sometime today.  

Thanks,
Fred
