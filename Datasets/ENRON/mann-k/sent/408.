Hi Kay!

How are yall doing? We are doing okay. Katie had to be at her school at 8
for a band thing and you would think it was the darkest day of the year.
But, I think secretly she was looking forward to seeing her friends. Since
she's in 8th grade, she's feeling pretty big.

I accidentally brought home a roll of Paige's film. I think it's Paiges, it
has a picture of Mikey on it. But it could be yours. Anyway, there were a
couple of really cute pictures of your kids and mom and dad, so if it's okay
with you I would like to get some copies made for me to keep before I mail
the roll to you. Is that okay?

There are a couple of really cute picures of Paige carrying Michael piggy
back!

Take it easy!

Love you!

Lisa
