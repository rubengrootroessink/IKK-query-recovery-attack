The closing docs are on top of my cabinet, near my name plate.  Help yourself.  

Thanks,

Ok.  One question...I have a draft of the "Written Consent of Manager of Montana Megawatts I, LLC" prepared by Marisa.  One of the resolutions was the election of officers (not directors) of the company.  Is the document making Ben a director in the closing documents?

Anyway, I'll prepare his resignation, I was just wondering if he was an officer too.

Ben,

I need to get you to resign from the Montana Megawatts BOD.  Will you be in this week?  If not, we can handle it with fax/fed ex.

Kay

Kathleen, 

Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.  Thanks.
