Hi Jerry,
 
Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take steps to extinguish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the transaction.  I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve for his review.  Basically it just says that Enron doesn't have any continuing obligations to GE under the previous letter.
 
Before we release the funds we would like to get an executed, revised letter from NorthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to be wired.  My fax number is 713 646 3491.
 
I did not have the certificate signed, but will dig it out and see what I can do.  Quite frankly I just overlooked it.
 
Kay
