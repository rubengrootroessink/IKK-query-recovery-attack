Absolutely!  Almost all of the original contract will go away, but Rahil and I will go through it first thing in the morning and mark it up for you.  I know Rahil has language regarding the index from one of the traders that we will forward as well.

In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:

1. Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.

2. A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.

I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.
