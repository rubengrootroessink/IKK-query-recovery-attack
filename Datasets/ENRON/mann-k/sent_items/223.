I gave the IP Transit deal a quick look, and it appears to me that what we need to do is prepare an amended confirm, with the capacity and price varying, depending on the month.  May want to revisit the starting dates based on our letter agreement.  Please take a look at the confirm and see if there is anything else you think we need to change.

I suggest that we make a capacity/price schedule and attach it, amending the confirm to refer to the new schedule.

What do you think?
