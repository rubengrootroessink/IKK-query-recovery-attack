At the risk of asking a stupid question, are we in breach under the project agreement?  I didn't comb it, but I also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me.  If we have a paid up call on 100 MW, that is probably something we would want to preserve.

More to consider!

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

Stuart:

Here is my shot at your memo.

I will have the accounting spreadsheet from Theresa Vox today.
