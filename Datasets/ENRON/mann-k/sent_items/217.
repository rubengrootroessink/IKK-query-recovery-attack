I'm disappointed that GE didn't call.  Must not have wanted to take the Enron credit risk.

I think we will also need to report it to the merger legal team, which I will take care of once we know what is up.

Mike Young from NW called to advise me that they received GE's consent. NW plans to send us notice of this tomorrow. I believe this will trigger our obligation to pay NW the balance of payments we hold, discounted at 7.5 % p.a. I believe this means that we will need to pay NW $5.1 million of the $5.2 million we have been prepaid.

Let's talk about this in the AM.
