Yes, but since we signed the power it seemed that someone else would actually execute the certificate. By the way, it was certificate #2, so I changed the language in the power to reflect that.

Thanks Kay.  I will check in again with Liz Evans at NorthWestern on the status of the Payment.  Were you able to locate the Certificate?
