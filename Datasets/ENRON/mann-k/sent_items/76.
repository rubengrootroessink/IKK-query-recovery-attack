Jennifer asked that I pass the word along that she is having a Christmas party this Friday, December 14 to try to put some cheer into this holiday season.  Pass the invite around and see you around 7:00.

Take 59 to Greenbriar/Shepherd exit
Exit Greenbriar towards Rice University
Continue straight on Greenbriar until Wordsworth
(if you arrive at Holcombe, you have gone too far)
