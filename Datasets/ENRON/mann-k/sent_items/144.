For what it is worth, this is from Blue Ridge Power Agency website:  http://www.brpa.org/



About BRPA:
Blue Ridge Power Agency ("Blue Ridge") is a non-profit corporation established in 1988 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and falls under Section 501(c)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is a "joint action" agency that operates as directed by the Board of Directors. Each member appoints one Director and one Alternate from its organization to the Board.
The ultimate goal of the organization, through the power of numbers and economies of scale of cooperative, "joint" action, is to pursue those activities which will insure the most reliable and lowest cost wholesale electric power supplies possible for its members today and in the future.
There are currently nine members of the agency as listed below, consisting of seven municipalities, one state institution and one electric cooperative. Blue Ridge represents its members' best interest in several forums by direct staff involvement and/or coordination of the efforts of its attorney(s) and consultant(s). In each of these areas, wholesale and/or retail power supply and service issues are involved: energy and transmission contract negotiation; contract administration; consolidated billing; state and federal regulatory proceedings and litigation; state and federal legislation which includes education and lobbying efforts; joint purchasing; industry information dissemination; training; and "as assigned."
The current efforts of Blue Ridge and its staff are focused mostly in two areas: (1) administering its current power supply contract with Cinergy and the associated transmission contract with American Electric Power; (2) representing BRPA members' interest where wholesale power supply and transmission issues are involved, particularly in regard to the electric industry's transition to a restructured, "customer choice" structure. Generation was deregulated at the Federal level in 1992. Efforts now concentrate on the restructuring of the regulatory provisions for continued monopoly service at the transmission, distribution and customer service levels of the industry. It is especially crucial that the laws and regulatory structures that develop over the next few years are fair, non-discriminatory and promote real competition.

It is unclear to me that the coop has the authority to bind the members.  What do we know about that?

I appreciate your concern about the lack of timing, but this one went from 0-60 in 5 secs flat as their board meeting is this Wednesday and they have it only once a month.  I will def. be more sensitive to allowing some more lead time going forward.

Blue Ridge is a Coop which consists of the members listed below.  I believe we can sign one CA which binds Blue Ridge and all its affiliates, but when it comes to signing final deal documents, we'd have to do it via individual towns.

Regards,

I'm in, but with lots going on.

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency, as in what type of legal entity is it?  It sounds like it isn't one, if we would be signing CA's with each member.  Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them.

Rahil, it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around.  We want to do the best job possible for you!

Thanks,

Kay

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil
