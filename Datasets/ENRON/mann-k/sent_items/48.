Travis,

The draft opinion is going to Davis Polk as we speak.  Eric is going to try to find out if they will comment tonight.  Kate Cole had some comments on the Certificate of Secretary, and I passed the comment along through Eric.

We are putting together diligence folders in connection with the opinions (what the heck).  We'll tee up the next round of companies once we get the list.  Cheryl was going to talk to someone at WGM to confirm which ones are going in next.

I'm still here.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Kay
