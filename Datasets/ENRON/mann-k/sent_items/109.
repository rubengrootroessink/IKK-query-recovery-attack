Hi David,

Sorry I missed you when you came by. I'm glad A & K will be playing such a vital role in the upcoming months.  The level of service you give is very much appreciated, now more than ever.

Thanks for the wine.  It was quite good.

Merry Christmas (just in case I don't see you before the holidays).

Kay
