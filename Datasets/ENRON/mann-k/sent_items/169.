Importance: High


Kay:

I am attaching execution sets of the following documents:

	1.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement;
	2. ENA Promissory Note; 
	3. Amended and Restated LLC Agreement;
	4.  Certificate of Amendment; and 

	5. ENA Closing Certificate. 
Please have an authorized representative execute 4 originals of every
document, except for the Note where only 1 original is needed. In addition,
please courier all originals to my attention so that all Closing documents
remain in one place. Thanks.


Best regards,

Marisa
