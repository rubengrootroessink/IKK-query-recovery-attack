Could we have a copy of the list with Kay added? if there wil be a reallocation of assignments, then we should hold tight on work on these project until we know what is what.

Ben,

As Fred pointed out, he thinks the "gas" agreement you are referring to is the Amended and Restated Gas Sales Agreement, which is Exhibit "A" to the Cash Flow Interest Agreement.

John and/or Bart:  I have a copy of the Cash Flow Interest Agreement.  Who wants it?

Kathleen

Folks:

Attached please find Rev 5 of the site list. I've added the Onondaga Gas
Transport Agreement to the list, and Kay's name to certain development
projects given her extensive history with these projects.

Please use this as a source document to replace the prior version. Fred,
please provide a copy of the transport agreement to Kathleen, and let me
know which Enron entity is the counterparty to OCLP.

Regards,

Ben
