Kathleen:  I looked at a recent invoice from our service company and the total fee is $286.00 - There is a first year statutory representation fee charged by the registered agent of $160.00 on top of filing fee, certified copy fee and service company charge for handling filing.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Teresa

According to the schedule of fees from the above SOS site for Delaware:

Certificate of Formation costs:
$50.00 (State Tax & Filing Fee)
$20.00 (Certified Copy)
Same Day Fee, if we want it $100.00
24 hour fee $50.00

I will confirm these fees with the corporate secretary tomorrow.
