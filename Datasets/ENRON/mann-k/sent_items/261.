Dave is around. Digs are OK, but it's odd that all this money was spent, given our current circumstances.

No need to hold off.  I'm not worried about GE.

I need Dave to sign one more document.  Is he around?

How do you like your new digs?

Kay:

Do you want to continue to hold off on the wire until the letter gets signed? FYI, Louise has given the OK to the wire.
