I have asked for something from GE indicating that Jeff D. had the authority to sign the consent.  I would think that this shouldn't take very long.

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay
