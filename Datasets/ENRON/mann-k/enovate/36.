 Enovate's bank account is already set up under the Enron global agreement 
with Citibank. 

The facility will be lent by ENE and People's.  If People's does not fund its 
half of enovate obligatiosns and an overdraft of the enovate Citibank account 
occurs, ENE would eventually be liable for the overdraft amount to Citi 
(Sam-please confirm.)  If Enron would be liable under its gloabal account 
agreement then Enron needs an indemnification/guarantee from People's in the 
event that People's does not fund its half.
