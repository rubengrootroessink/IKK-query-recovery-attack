Attached is a draft of the CA for Peoples based on Gregg Penman's information 
below.  Gregg says he also wants some language to be included regarding audit 
rights.  I did not include this language because I'm not sure how to word it 
(and I could not find an example).

By the way, I used another People's CA I got from Ed's directory as an 
example because it seemed to fit better than the one I got from you on Friday.

Gregg wanted some pretty specific reference to the confidential data being 
supplied to Peoples, and most of the examples I reviewed were more general.  
Please let me know what I need to change.

Kathleen



This is the example I used:

Kathleen,

We have forms for confidentiality agreements.  All CA's are processed through 
Kay Young, as she maintains the data base.  Kay, could you point Kathleen to 
the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft? By the 
way, I've assembled the emails I received on changing the form.  I'll be 
happy to take a crack at the revisions if you tell me which form to start 
with.  I know it will have to be processed through before it becomes standard.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay - We have previously discussed the idea of a CA to specifically cover the 
curves.  We need to put this at the top of the list for this week.  Can you 
prepare a CA for the distribution of enovate curves to specific individuals 
at Peoples?  I would like it to read as follows:
Basis and Index curves will be provided daily for all points at which enovate 
has a position, whether hedged or open, to specific individuals employed in 
the risk management area.  (Individuals should be named on a schedule).
Curves are being provided for the express purpose of independent risk 
analysis of the enovate portfolio by Peoples Risk Management personnel.   

In return, the specific individuals will not forward, copy, or otherwise 
distribute the curves to any individual not on the approved schedule.  No 
communications, written or verbal, will be made to any person other than the 
enovate GM or the Enron designated enovate risk committee member regarding 
any aspect of the curves.  

I need some language regarding audit rights, but this should get you 
started.  Call me to discuss.

Gregg

Subject: CA for enovate

Kathleen - As we discussed, here is a high level overview of what I am trying 
to accomplish.  

Purpose: Employees and representatives of Peoples Energy will be provided 
information related to the operations of enovate, L.L.C. that is necessary or 
appropriate to review the accuracy of data and verify that the operations and 
controls set forth in Section VIII of the enovate, L.L.C. Risk Management 
Policy are being properly implemented and followed.  Information may include 
forward curves such as price, basis, index,volatility and interest rates to 
the extent they relate to the operations of enovate, L.L.C. 

Restrictions:  All information provided is deemed confidential.  Information 
provided may only be used for the purpose mentioned above.  None of the 
provided information may be distributed or communicated to any person who is 
not subject to the confidentiality agreement.


Call me with any questions you may have.  Thank you for your assistance.

Gregg
