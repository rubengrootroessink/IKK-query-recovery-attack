I spoke with Don Shindler this afternoon.  He is making the changes to the 
Schaffer agreement and called me to clarify a couple of points.  He said the 
document will be ready to by sent out by the end of the day today.  I told 
Don that tomorrow morning delivery should be fine.  I called Kevin Schaffer 
and left a message on their answering machine letting them know that the 
revised agreement was going to be delivered tomorrow morning.  I asked Kevin 
to call  me back today if delivery tomorrow represented some form of problem.

Don will send an email copy of this revised version to myself, Rusty, and Kay 
Mann.

Don:  Please include Kathleen Carnahan in this email distribution.

Thanks Don for jumping on this.  I should have thought to send it to you as 
well earlier.  I will be out Monday/Tuesday on business in Florida next week, 
and on holiday for the balance.  In the interim, please call either Fred 
713-853-5406 or my cell phone 713-562-0936 if you have any questions.  I dont 
have the Schaeffer's lawyers number (or cant find it right now), but either I 
or Fred can call Kevin and get it if necessary.  Their lawyer has probably 
already attempted to call Karen by now.  Hope all is well with you, and that 
you have a peaceful Thanksgiving.

Fred :  Kevin's number is 815-844-6493.
