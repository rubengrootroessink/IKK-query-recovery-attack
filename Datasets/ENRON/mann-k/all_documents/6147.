TECO has asked that we schedule our call for tomorrow at 10:30 AM. Kay, I 
would like to meet with you at 9:30 to discuss the MOU. I don't believe their 
counsel will be on the call at 10:30, therefore your participation is 
optional (although you know we'd always prefer to have you).

Regards,

Ben

Lorie:

Please put the TECO call on my and Fred's calendar. Thanks.
