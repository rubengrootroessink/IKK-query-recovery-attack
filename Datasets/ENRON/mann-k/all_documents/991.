Kay:
The Village's attorney drafted the agreement and therefore we do not have an
electronic version -- unfortunately, he does not have email either.  The
redlined version you are reviewing now reflects only minor changes from that
originally executed by ENA approximately a month ago.  Please let me know if
I can be of any assistance.  Thanks!
