>  Pursuant to our earlier conversation, I have made all of the
> changes we discussed to the Lv Cogen Turbine Agreement and  override
> letter.  You had asked that I revise Article XXI in the override
> letter so that the confidentiality and proprietary provisions would
> apply to ENA as agent.  To do so I have had to make revisions
> throughout the Article and, as a result, intend to include it as an
> annex to the override letter.  What I have done is to make any

> They are just conforming changes.  Let me know what you think.
