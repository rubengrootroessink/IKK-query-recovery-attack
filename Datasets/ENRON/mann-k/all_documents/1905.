Greetings,

I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more 
standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.  The goal is to 
develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the 
same  points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.  Sheila 
has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might 
find interesting and/or helpful.

You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.  Please 
let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.

Thank you,

Kay
