Sheila:

Thanks for the article.  Water is definately a hot topic in the Chicago 
area.  Our existing facility (Lincoln Energy Center) in Manhattan is in 
pretty good shape with the GE Dry Low NOx burners.  At peak usage times the 
plant requires a peak water usage of around 125 gallons per minute (gpm) or 
120,000 gallons per day based on a 16-hour run schedule.  This is probably 
one of the lowest water consumption levels of any power plant in Illinois.

The two other sites (Plano and Pontiac) which we have permitted this year 
required significant discussion on the water usage issue.  In our local 
zoning discussions/meetings we presented information that the proposed 
facility would have an estimated maximum water usage of 1000 gpm (this 
equates to approximately 1,000,000 gallons per day on a 16-hr basis).  This 
was based on an equipment configuration of 10 LM 6000 units, which we felt 
was a fairly conservative water use estimate.

Our Kendall County Special Use Permit for the Plano site has a specific 
condition on water usage which limits the maximum draw from on-site wells to 
1000 gpm based on a 24-hour average.  I believe that this translates into a 
instantaneous maximum of approximately 1350 gpm.  This amount was determined 
by an ENSR study of the amount of water that could be withdrawn from the deep 
acquifer without impacting the overall levels of the acquifer.  The City of 
Yorkville Annexation Agreement on the Plano site does not impose a maximum 
water usage quantity.

The attached article suggest that some water use limitations may be imposed 
by the State of Illinois.  I will check with our Chicago council to determine 
if such limitations would override zoning permits which have been already 
validly issued.  My suspicion is that the State limitations would govern 
given that such limits are being designed specifically for peaker plants.  I 
will let you know.

Fred

FYI, I attach a recent report regarding water issues that are affecting power
projects being developed in Illinois. We had previously raised a similar 
concern
with you.


Regards, Paul.
