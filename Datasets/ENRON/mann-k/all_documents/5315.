Kent
In answer to your question as to when the GE opinion should be dated, it
should be dated the execution date of the Turbine Contract, which I believe
will be tomorrow, May 2.  Please could Carolyn, Kay or Greg let Kent and
myself know if the Turbine Contract will be dated a date other than May 2.
Thanks
Isabel
