Subject: Signature Pages and Wire


Jerry-as we discussed, here are PDF files containing Enron's signature pages
to the Letter Agreement and the two Change Orders.  As soon as you receive
these, you will send to Ben, Kay and me your client's signature pages to the
Letter Agreement and Guarantee, and Mike will begin the wire transfer of $3
million.  Mike will also send to Ben, Kay and me the Fed reference number as
soon as he gets it.  Finally, as agreed, Paul Hastings will assemble the
documents for distribution to the parties.  To that end, Kay, please send
the 6 originals of the signature pages by overnight delivery to Jerry.

Regards
