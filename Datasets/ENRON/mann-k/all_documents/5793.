Read the text before looking at the picture.

A class of elementary students started a class project to
make a planter to take home and wanted to have a plant in
it that was easy to take care of, so it was decided to use
cactus plants. The students were given greenware pottery
of a clown planter, and they painted them with glaze and
had them professionally fired at a class outing so they
could see the process. It was  great fun.

They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters, and
they grew nicely but unfortunately the children were not
allowed to take them home.

The cactus plants were removed and a small ivy replaced
them, and the children were then allowed to take the
planters home.

The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time....
