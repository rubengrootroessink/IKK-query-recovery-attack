Kay,

Tom will be out today & he called in and asked me to prepare a brief summary 
of our interim agreement with MDEA for May.  He indicated that you would 
prepare a formal version of these details for execution.



Should you have any questions, please contact myself, Kayne Coulter or Lloyd 
Will.

Thanks & Regards,
Jeff Miller
