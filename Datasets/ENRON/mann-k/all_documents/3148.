Kay--Would you like us to get you signature pages (for the GE and ABB 
breakout contracts) on behalf of ENA from here, or is it more efficient or 
uniform if you get a signature there before getting them to GE and ABB?  
Sheila needs the fully executed agreements for TurboPark, so let me know.

Attached is the GE override letter to accompany the facility agreements. 



I'm trying to figure out the ABB form.
