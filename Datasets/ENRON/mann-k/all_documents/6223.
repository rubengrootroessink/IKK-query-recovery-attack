You definitely have to have patience to deal with all the "stuff" around 
here.  It's a good thing I've mellowed. Plus, it's my job.  

Michael is a doll!  I don't think it's supposed to rain on Saturday, but that 
could change at any moment.  The Women's Center needs all kinds of things.  I 
have a friend that works for the United Way and goes over there quite often.  
If you have clothes, they want you to take them to their Resale shop but they 
also need linens, just everything really.  I usually give my things to 
Kristine's church just because I always forget to put them in the truck and 
bring up here.  

I've got next Thursday and Friday on my calendar.  I hope you guys have a 
great time.  21, I remember that, wild child that I was!  Any of the camera 
places should be able to do that enlargement.  I know Wolfe Camera over at 
Allen Center does that type of thing.  I don't know how long it will take to 
get it back.  What exactly do you want to get done, and I'll call and 
inquire.  I'll need the size you want it mounted to also.

This place amazes me!  Thanks for  your help.  I have no patience for it.

We went to Michael's school conference today.  His teacher raved about how 
everyone just loves Michael. He is so sweet.  He is staying with my folks 
this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.  I can't wait for him to come 
home.  Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, 
and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.  I've got to take 
Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.  Plus, I spent last weekend 
with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.  I hope to  PURGE 
the house of all the junk I have.  I hope it is raining, because  that is 
great cleaning weather.  I want to see bare space in my closet.  I think I'll 
call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need.

I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.  Next Thursday is 
Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.  Do you know anywhere that can 
enlarge a photo and mount it on a board?

I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.  Go figure.

I need to send off my Tx tax and bar dues today.  I'll want to fed ex, just 
in case you are sending anyone else's today.

Thanks,

Kay

Let me see what I can do.  I can't believe you haven't gotten any kind of 
notice.  

I still need your credit card information for the phone bill.
