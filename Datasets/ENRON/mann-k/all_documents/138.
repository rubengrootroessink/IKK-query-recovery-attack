Suzanne, please forward this to Jeff.  My email is acting up again.

Hi Jeff,

I thought I would pass this email along to you since you've been working on 
some of the aspects of the Peoples deal.  I don't want to interfer with 
whatever you have going on, but I'm happy to assist/participate in whatever 
way makes sense.

Kay

Subject: Affiliate Master Purchase and Sale Agreement

Here is some more info. regarding the Affiliate Master Purchase and Sale 
Agreement that is on the list.  

Attached is a draft agreement prepared by Simon Halfin at Peoples.  It is 
based on the 3rd party contract that Jeff Hodge is working on with Peoples.  
The agreement is intended to be a master contract that would facilitate a 
blanket of structured term transactions between the utilities (Peoples Gas 
Light and Coke Co. and North Shore Gas)  and MEH.  It will be filed with the 
Illinois Commerce Commission for approval.  My understanding is that the 
transactions will still be subject to the annual prudency process of each 
utility.  I am not sure your strategy on this one, but would think that a 
combination of you, Jeff Hodge, and Boyd would be most effective.  I 
understand that Dynegy and Nicor filed a similar agreement as part of their 
Hub Agency Agreement that Boyd has reviewed.  I am sure he can confirm that 
or not.

Thanks,

Gregg
