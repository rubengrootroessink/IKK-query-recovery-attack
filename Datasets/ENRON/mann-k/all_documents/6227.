Kay,

We are starting to run into some scheduling constraints for next week, at 
least with Bob Priest.  I'd like to get together with Bob and Marvin early 
next week to discuss the agreement--moving toward finalizing before June 12.  
Bob is only available Monday.  Bob and Marvin think it is a good ideal to 
then meet with RW Beck.

I'd like to email Marvin and Bob the next version sometime today?
