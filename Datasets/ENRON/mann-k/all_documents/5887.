Kay - I have asked Dale to get with you and Lisa Bills to arrange a meeting 
in Houston to have a sit down and get this bugger done.  I propose Thursday 
or Friday of next week.  The same would go for ABB.  Let me know what Dale 
has arranged, and what you think of the idea.  The basic concept is to get in 
a room for 1-2 hours, and get this document done.  I'll let you guys decide 
on Peter Thompson or whatever is to be used for outside legal.


Regards

Bill Williams

Hi there,

I need to get with Lee Johnson on another deal, and I know he will ask about 
LV CoGen.  Anything I should tell him?

Thanks,

Kay
