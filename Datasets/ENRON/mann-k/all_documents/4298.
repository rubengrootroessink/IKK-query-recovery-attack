One of the World Hunger issues is that GE does  not want Enron to be able to 
issue a unilateral change order which would impact the manufacturing schedule.

We have the same issue in the Arcos Power Island deal.  

Following is what I intend to propose to solve the Arcos problem and might 
work  for World Hunger:


" Purchaser acknowledges taht Seller's ability to accomodate changes in 
manufacturing scope in a timely or cost effective manner diminish as Seller 
gets further along into the manufacturing process, and after a point changes 
can only be made after assembly completion or in the field without adversely 
affecting Seller's manufacturing obligations to other clients (a "Client 
Impact").  Where such a Client Impact circumstance exists, Seller shall 
identify such constraints to Purchaser in its proposal submitted pursuant to 
Clause 17.2.(b) [time and cost estimate to accomodate the Change 
Order-Variation Order], which Purchaser shall take into account in evaluating 
Seller's proposed cost and time changes arising out of such Variation scope 
change. "




I would appreciate your thoughts as to whether this works for us in the World 
Hunger document-  I do  not want to propose for Arcos if it gives you great 
difficultly for World Hunger.
