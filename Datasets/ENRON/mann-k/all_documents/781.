Attached are the clean and red-line versions of the ComEd Tolling term sheet 
on the Plano site.  I will fax the clean version to ComEd's wholesale group 
this afternoon.

I inserted a section on the last page related to finance/accounting issues 
which Buyer (ComEd) shall reasonably co-operate with.  I will meet with 
Herman Manis next week to discuss the specific issues/language needed to 
maintain mark-to-market viability.

The main goal of this term sheet is to guage ComEd's level of interest in 
buying capacity and energy from the Plano site, thereby mitigating the 
transmission risk and significantly enhancing the value of the site in a 
sell-down transaction.

Call me to discuss any of this information.


Fred
