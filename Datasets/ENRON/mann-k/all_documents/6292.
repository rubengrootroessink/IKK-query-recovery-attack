One other item - we attempted to incorporate all the lessons learned from 
earlier work on the Pompano Developer's Agreement. I hope the attached is not 
too painful.

Thanks for your help.

Ben

Hello.

The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for 
review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have 
attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any 
desired changes.

Thank you,

Kay
