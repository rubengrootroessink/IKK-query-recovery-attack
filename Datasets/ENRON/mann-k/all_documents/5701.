Hi there,

We need the exact name of the YC entity which will be buying the gas.  Is it 
Yazoo City or the YCPC, or what?  Same info is required for Clarksdale, 
although not as urgently.

If you will email me the addresses of all who need to review this, the YC 
contract will be ready tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay
