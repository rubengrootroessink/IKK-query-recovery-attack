Attached is Art 11 as it appears in Rev 5, redlined to reflect my proposed 
fixes to the Change Order article.   GE has expressed concern over 
Purchaser's right to be able to force GE to proceed with a Change Order.   As 
presently drafted I do not see where the Purchaser has that right.  I have 
modified Article 11 to incorporate language similar to Arcos on this subject  
( we have not reached final agreement on the Arcos language- but we are 
reasonably close- I hope).  I have also imported the reasons for changing the 
Guaranteed Completion since the reasons for changing the Purchase Amount are 
now in Art 11.   

I think this needs an Enron team discussion before sending to GE.
