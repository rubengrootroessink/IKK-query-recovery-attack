Janine:

I don't need Stokes & Bartholemew to serve as lobbyists - I need them to 
continue to serve as local counsel on a few projects we're continuing to work 
on. I've been using Johnny Hayes for lobbying matters.

Kay - do we need to do anything to keep Stokes on board as local counsel for 
our Haywood and Shelby projects?

Thanks,

Ben

Our lobbyists are the same.  I will call you to discuss what you are working 
on.  There are some tax issues which could have a potential impact.

Thanks for the e-mail. Who is our lobbyist? I still have a need for Stokes & 
Bartholemew (Gif Thornton and Bill Bruce). Other that that, I think I'm 
covered. Please let me know the name of the lobbyist before terminating.

Thanks.

Ben
