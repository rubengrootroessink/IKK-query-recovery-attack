Per the conference call of Wednesday, I revised Section 9.6 (with Scott 
fixing my drafting).  Attached document contains a redline of the section.

I think this can be included in the version that goes to GE.  I discussed the 
concept with Jim Sutherland- he agreed with relaxing the unilateral 
requirement in the case of GE.  We would not want to do this in the case of 
other vendors.
