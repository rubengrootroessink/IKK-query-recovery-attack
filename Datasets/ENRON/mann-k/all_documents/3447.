Kay - I believe this was brought on by the most recent push to wrap up more 
loose ends, particularly breaking out risk books to individual traders.  As 
such, we need to get a few things done.  Those that impact you, or anyone 
else you direct me to, are:
1-Appointments
2-A CA for all persons working on behalf of enovate.  This is meant to be 
signed by both Peoples and Enron employees and is meant to prevent 
dissemination of confidential information outside of each respective parent 
organization. Ed Hearn prepared another CA for enovate recently and I could 
ask him to work on this if you would like.  Just let me know.

I have a few other things, but I am being yelled at to come to a meeting.

Thanks - Gregg

Hi John,

I'm out of town, but will give this a look when I return.

Subject: Confidentiaility Agreements regarding enovate


Hello Kay -

It's been a long time since we've last spoken and I hope things are well.
In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related
to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly.  I finally
have reviewed them and have a couple comments.

The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
each agreement.  Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a
confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction.
However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular
agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in
connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual
relationship.  The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's
and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement.  Accordingly, the proposed changes
are my attempt to clarify the usual text.

Please call if you wish to discuss.  I believe my procrastination has
resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your
attention to this is appreciated.  Thanks.
