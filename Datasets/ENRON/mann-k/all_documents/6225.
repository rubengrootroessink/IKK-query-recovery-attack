Maybe it is on the development phone list.  I don't have it at hand.

Remember not to throw away baby stuff!  My oldest daughter, Sara has already 
bought a complete wardrobe for the baby including girl and boy outfits.  I 
guess I had better get on the ball and at least buy a "I Love Granny" bib or 
something!  Ha.

Do you know Carlos' cell phone number?  His normal secretary is out.
