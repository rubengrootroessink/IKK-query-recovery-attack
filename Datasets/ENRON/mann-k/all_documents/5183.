Ben:

We do not have an executed copy of this DASH.  Also, given the likely changes 
of certain conditions in the DASH, I would recommend that we update this DASH 
and circulate it up through to Louise.

Chip:

As a follow up to my voice-mail, please advise as to whether we would need to 
reDASH the Haywood deal prior to execution of an amendment which would move 
the milestone payment date to Aug. 1, 2001 from May 1, 2001. I have attached 
the original Dash for your reference.

Thanks,

Ben
