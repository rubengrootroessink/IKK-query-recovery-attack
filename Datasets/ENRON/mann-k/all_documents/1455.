Heather, Scott, Kay, Stephen:

The attached file is a redlined markup of your draft purchase contract
prepared by our outside counsel, with a few added comments from our group.
Please note these comments are intended to be preliminary and non-binding,
for discussion only. Most of these comments don't address the scope of our
meeting today, but are more detail oriented. Please call me if you have any
questions before we meet Wednesday.
