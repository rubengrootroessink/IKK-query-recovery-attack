Tremaine:

Further to our conversation with Marguerite, attached please find a mark-up
of the Escrow Agreement.  Once  you have run the revised draft by Citibank
for approval, please send me a final version of the same so that I may
forward the document to Kay Mann for signature.

Thanks,

Marisa Reuter
