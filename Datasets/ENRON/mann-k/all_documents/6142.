Thanks. I put in a call to those guys and am waiting to hear back. In the 
meantime, maybe you could call their in house counsel to get reaquainted 
since you've already worked together...

One other item - the Pompano developers agreement - I need to talk to you 
about this tomorrow (early if possible) as local counsel is waiting for our 
comments. I heard rumor that AEW was still working on this despite her 
vacation. In any case, we need to get some comments back to Debbie Orshefsky 
on Thursday if possible.

Regards,

Ben

 Anytime which works for you is fine, as this is more important than my other 
meeting.

 Kay:

 My afternoon tomorrow looks full - do you have any time before 2 PM to 
discuss the TECO MOU and have a call with them? I will check their schedules 
as well...
