Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have attached a closing checklist for the Salmon Energy transaction
between ENA and PPL.  Please review and advise of any comments.  ENA has
requested final drafts of all documents by mid-day Friday in order that it
can immediately circulate documents for execution in anticipation of the
closing next week.  Thank you.
