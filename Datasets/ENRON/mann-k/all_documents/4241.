We should sign these at the same time as we get the assignment docs signed by 
GE on the NorthWestern deal.

Please advise how to respond to GE.  Kay has the change order for final 
review and approval, and Jody Pierce's group has the invoice.

Attached is a copy of the invoice that we issued for the storage of Unit #1.
This invoice has not been paid.  I believe you are waiting for the signing
of the contract change order.  Neither of us expected this process to take
this long.

As we have an agreement that the equipment will be stored, and we agree on
the price of the storage, I am requesting that this invoice be paid
immediately.
