David,
Attached below is the draft form EPC contract (cost-plus, like we discussed 
at our mtgs in SF this week) that I sent to Lisa, Roseann and Sheila last

Karen Jones (in Portland) and Sheila Tweed have been working on just the same 
thing, so I'm forwarding your request to them.

Subject: Standard EPC contract

Next week, Herman and I will be working on a generic 97-10 compliant EPC 
contract.

Could you forward electronic versions of 1) basic fixed price EPC contract 
and 2) basic Cost Plus EPC contract.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks.
