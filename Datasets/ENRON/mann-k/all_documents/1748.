Kay -

What's the best way to have this covered by warranty?  9000 hours is 
significantly beyond the 12 month warranty period; however, since the notice 
occurred during the warranty period, would filing a warranty claim help cover 
the replacement?

Ross, what is the normal recommended replacement criteria for the row 3 
blades, in terms of run hours?  Is it significantly more than 9000 hours?

Thanks,

Mitch

Don,
Yet another Technical Advisory, that we just received. PLease post on 
Dealbench and ensure that Duke gets a copy to ascertain we are not attempting 
to hide anything. I plan on having some discussion with SWPC pursuant to who 
pays for this, can we get it done during our upcoming outage,etc to prepare 
for the next round of Dan Barpel questions.
Ross

Dear Mr. McCormick,

Attached below is Technical Advisory 2000-014 which is applicable to the
above subject unit(s).  The purpose of this TA is to recommend replacement
of the original W501F Row 3 turbine blades with blades of a new blade
design.

During the 1996-1998 time period shroud lifting and cracking has been
observed on several W501F Row 3 turbine blades.  The issue was attributed to
high local temperatures and stresses in the Z-shroud area of the blade.


Please let us know as soon as possible what your plans are relative to
implementation of this Advisory.

Very truly yours,
 <<...>>
