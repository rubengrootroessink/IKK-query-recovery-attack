I sent the draft ILA extension letter to Marvin and Bob.  I will follow-up 
with them this afternoon to get any comments.

I'm thinking my last email was unclear.  

I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the 
extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their 
review.  I assume that the  commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale 
will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think 
it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two 
lawyers I know about.
