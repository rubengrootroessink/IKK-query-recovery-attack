Kay:  I sincerely apologize for being so out of pocket.  I have been just 
buried trying to restructure a bunch of EES and ENA contracts/obligations 
etc. in light of the possiblity of the CA IOUs filing for bankruptcy.  I have 
been locked on day long calls for the past few days.  However, I should be 
able to get in touch with you later this afternoon to map out what may be 
required and I am sure we can handle what you may need.  I'll touch base 
later today.  John
