Kay:

I will review your comments on the LOI.  I wanted to check with make sure 
that someone at King & Spalding is reviewing the Midway term sheet along with 
the LOI, so that we can send the term sheet to TECO on Monday/Tuesday.

Let me know.

Fred

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)
