Folks:

Have you all had a chance to comment on this? I think you all should be OK as 
we styled this after the last Pompano agreement. In any case, your comments 
would be appreciated at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,

Ben

Hello.

The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for 
review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have 
attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any 
desired changes.

Thank you,

Kay

PS  Pardon the formatting.  It will be cleaned up by those with the ability 
to do so.
