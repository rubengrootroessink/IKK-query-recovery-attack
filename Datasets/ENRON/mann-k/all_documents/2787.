This is the GE "break-out" contract.  I do not know Brett's timing on signing 
it.   The contract does not contain the "financing specific" indemnification 
provisions, etc.  Those will be found in the "Override Letter" which will 
stay in place as long as the turbine contract is in the financing structure.  
Once the turbines are out of this structure - for instance, if the CAA 
lenders are taken out by project lenders - the "Override Letter" will no 
longer be in effect and the general, more vanilla ts and  cs will apply.

I will send you the latest copy of the "override letter" also.

Rose
