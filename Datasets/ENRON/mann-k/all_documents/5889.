I will be in Houston tomorrow, and have a call in to Paul Pippitone (?) and 
Peter Thompson to pin down where we are and what needs to be done.  I will 
try to pull Rose into that meeting as well.

Assuming we don't get everything resolved at that meeting, Bill has suggested 
(appropriately, I think) that we should have a follow-on all-hands meeting 
next week in Houston with GE as well.  Thursday has been proposed.

Hi there,

I need to get with Lee Johnson on another deal, and I know he will ask about 
LV CoGen.  Anything I should tell him?

Thanks,

Kay
