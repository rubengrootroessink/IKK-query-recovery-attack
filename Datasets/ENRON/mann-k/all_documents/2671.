Attached please find a clean copy of the latest draft of the E-Next
Generation CISO2 Agreement and Exhibits, as well as blacklines showing
changes made to each from the prior draft we circulated.  To complete
the agreement, we need Ben Jacoby's fax number and a liquid fuel
performance guarantee. As for the exhibits, we need the information for
Part B of Exhibit A-1.  We will also need to add Exhibit H-2, Exhibit R
(if necessary) and confirmation that we will not have any site specific
information usually contained in Exhibit U.
