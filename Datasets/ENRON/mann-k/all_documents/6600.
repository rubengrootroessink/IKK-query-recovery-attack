Hello Kay---

I need some free legal advice and you are my favorite attorney.  I'll buy
you a drink as payment in kind.

Try and remember El Paso work in Arizona.  Arizona has statue that says you
must make a twenty day preliminary notice to file a lien.  If you don't file
such notice you waive your right to ever file a lien.  I remember this from
our previous work out there.

We have a vendor who is supplying services to one of our subcontractors.  He
has sent us a twenty day notice to file a lien.  There is no dispute but he
is sending the notice anyway.  I understand all of that.

My question is this----it asks for us (BE&K) to sign and acknowledge receipt
of the notice.  It doesn't exactly read like I am required to acknowledge
receipt.  What do you think or remember?  Am I required to sign the notice
or not.  Minor point I know, but I'd rather not raise the flag in
Birmingham.

Thanks.  I really just want to hear from you and this is all I could come up
with for an excuse to write.

Gerry Turner
