Not everything in the data request responses was confidential--some of it is
public by nature.  For example, we were asked for material from the Form 10Q
which is filed with the SEC and is a public document.  It is my recollection
that the data regarding turbine configuration and the noise footprint, for
example, were not treated confidentiality.

The things that were submitted under seal primarily dealt with cost
information;  I do recall that we submitted the portions of the turbine
contract documents under seal.  As a practical matter, the Public Staff is
the only entity which has requested the information, and will not
disseminate it, particularly over our objections.  A problem would only
arise if the same discovery was sought by another party, which is unlikely
at this point, and which could be objected to.

One more thing.  Did someone send you copies of equipment contracts?  Those
have confidentiality provisions which need to be considered.  Therefore,
please advise what you received from Enron in that regard.

I was under the impression that most of what we were submitting we were
submitting as confidential information, specifically including the
responses to the Public Staff's data requests.  I don't recall the
specifics at this point.

Thanks again,

Kay

The Application itself is public.  The testimony is public.  Without going
back through the material we have supplied (which I would be happy to do,
if
you like), the primary material that was confidential was the cost data and
supporting work papers.  Also, the engineering plan we filed recently in
response to a data request was confidential.

Let me know if you would like me to walk back through it more specifically.

Hi Allyson,

Someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public
information.  Is the petition itself public?  What else would be public?

I know this is a variation to the "what is confidential" question. Once
again, your assistance is appreciated.

Kay
