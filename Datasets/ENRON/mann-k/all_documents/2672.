Attached please find a clean copy of the latest draft of the
E-Next Generation CISO1 Agreement and Exhibits, as well as blacklines
showing changes made to each from the prior draft we circulated.  This
is identical to the documents for the CISO2 documents but for the unit
number and agreement reference.  To complete the agreement, we need Ben
Jacoby's fax number and a liquid fuel performance guarantee. As for the
exhibits, we need the information for Part B of Exhibit A-1.  We will
also need to add Exhibit H-2, Exhibit R (if necessary) and confirmation
that we will not have any site specific information usually contained in
Exhibit U.
