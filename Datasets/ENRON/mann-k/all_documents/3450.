Hi Brian,

Here are my observations/questions:

Has David Marshall reviewed the CO?

Kay & Jeff:

I received Scott Dieball's legal review and comments late Friday and have 
incorporated his comments into the Rev 4 attached below.  Kay, it was Jeff's 
and my goal to have this Change Order executed by today, Monday to support 
GE's storage arrangements for Unit 1.  I have now incorporated Jeff's 
comments, Lisa Bills comments and our legal review.  If this is acceptable to 
both of you, I will get this moving for signatures right away.
