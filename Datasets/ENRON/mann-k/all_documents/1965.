Kay:

Since you did not include a cover message with this email, I am not sure if 
you are just keeping me in the loop on this matter since Marc failed to send 
a copy of his email to me or are you requesting some assistance on my part.  
Please advise. 

I am in Washington at the moment but  would be happy to assist in any way I 
can.

Attached is a revised memo outline the payment of the turbine once assigned 
to Mitsui.  If you could please give me your final comments so that we can 
send this to the banks.

Thanks,

Marc
