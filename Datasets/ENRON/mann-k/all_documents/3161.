Kay,

Ader and I met with NJ Natural Gas earlier this week to discuss fuel cell 
opportunities in NJ.  As a gas supplier in NJ, these guys are very interested 
in developing some fuel cell projects as a means to increase throughput on 
their system.  They also have a strong relationship with the state commission 
(called the Board of Public Utilities, I think) and there are green funds 
available to subsidize costs, etc.  Sound familiar?

I need to get a CA to these guys and I am forwarding to you the one we signed 
with CRRA.  I like this one because there is an exclusivity clause in it.  
NJN may not agree to exclusivity, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

Here's the contact:

Mr. Thomas J. Kononowitz
Senior Vice President Marketing Services
NJ Natural Gas
1415 Wyckoff Road
P.O. Box 1464
Wall, NJ  07719

732.938.1134


Will you or someone in your cluster take care of this for me?  Much thanks.

Heather
