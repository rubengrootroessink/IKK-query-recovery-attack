Kay-

Here is some initial information regarding the process.  I am asking Lloyd to 
forward the control area contract documents he and David Portz have been 
working on.

Thanks,

Regan attached below is the process that Clarksdale has to start to become a 
Control Area in case they don't have it.

We should be able to get our systems hooked up to them in 60 days once we 
have the green light from Ozzie to charge (approx $300K).

It will be tough to get their portion done in less than 4-6 months due to the 
dependency on others who tend to not cooperate.

One of the major items we need to help them with is completing their 
Interconnection agreement and get this process started and then some form of 
Services contract that can be used for the audit, I have a draft one that I 
will forward to you by end of the week.

Thanks.

Keith,
The Certification process is initiated at the NERC level and the Region
will respond when notified by NERC.  I have attached all the files that
represent the NERC and SPP Certification procedures.

I have been attempting to find information on how to become a Control
Area
in SPP. I have not been able to find any area to help yet and I was
directed to the both of you for help. Any information you could provide
would be helpful.
Thanks,
Keith
