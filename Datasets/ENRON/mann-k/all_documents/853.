Here is a very quick skeleton of what I think we discussed Friday.  This 
should be consistent with Sam's summary at the end of the meeting.  However, 
if anyone has any clarifications or additions, please let me know as soon as 
possible.  I have an 8:30 meeting tomorrow morning to discuss this concept 
with Peoples.

Thanks,

Gregg
