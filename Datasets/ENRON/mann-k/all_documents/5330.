I am indifferent so long as whoever signs is authorized and we have an
incumbency certificate covering them.
Thanks

Isabel and Greg,

I'm having a logistical problem.  The only managing director of Salmon is
not in the office today.  I can have the membership certificates signed by
(1) a vice president or (1)  the managing member or (3) elect a new
managing director.  What's your preference?


Kay
