John:
I have reviewed the insurance article and would not mind recommending a few=
=20
minor changes but respect your wishes not to. However, I did find a couple =
of=20
places where it is definitely needed.

After speaking with a few marine experts at Wortham I have found our Hull &=
=20
P&I wording to be deficient [did this on another project]. I believe Clause=
=20
19.1.4 should be changed to the following recommended wording. You are=20
welcome to change the limit [$10 million] but I think the wording is more=
=20
appropriate for all agreements going forward.

Hull & Machinery and Protection and Indemnity Insurance. Seller shall ensur=
e=20
that if any owned or non-owned watercraft of any kind is used for performan=
ce=20
of the Work, Hull & Machinery and Protection and Indemnity insurance shall =
be=20
provided for the vessels in the amounts as follows:

Hull & Machinery:
Full current market value of the watercraft.

Protection &Indemnity including excess collision liability [unless otherwis=
e=20
provided by the hull coverage]:
$10,000,000 each occurrence or the full current market value of the vessel,=
=20
whichever is greater.

Such insurance may be provided by the vessel operator or by Seller as Selle=
r=20
deems appropriate.

The aircraft clause needs a couple of changes:

In Clause 19.1.6 insert =01&aircraft=018 after =01&non-owned=018 in the thi=
rd line.

Such insurance may be provided by the aircraft operator or by Seller as=20
Seller deems appropriate.


Please let me know if you have any questions.
Paul

David and Paul:

As you are aware Sheila Tweed has been championing achieving a standardized=
=20
turbine purchase agreement with GE for domestic applications.  Attached is=
=20
the current draft of such document.  Please review the insurance provisions=
=20
to see if there are any changes needed.   I believe the current drafting is=
=20
what we have used in the past.  =20

Given the technology issues of late do we need to make any changes.  This=
=20
would be for 7FA and LM6000 applications which I believe the market views a=
s=20
proven technology so I assume we will not need to shift collateral damage t=
o=20
GE and expose GE to insurer subrogation.


Scott Dieball and I are in London- Enron House.  Today Tuesday our telephon=
e=20
number is  44-207-783-0517.   Please call at your earliest convenience so w=
e=20
can discuss conceptually.

I would prefer not to make drafting changes for the sake of style at this=
=20
point.
