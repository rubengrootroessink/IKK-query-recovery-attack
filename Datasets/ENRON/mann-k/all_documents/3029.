Attached below is the standard form GE Term Sheet.  Certain items have been 
left blank, including price and shipment dates.  GE told me that the 
$39,970,000 per turbine set number is still the notional price based on the 
GenPower Dell scope.  This aforementioned scope means that we will need to 
purchase an extra static starter ($900,000) and a water wash skid ($150,000) 
to take two sets of two turbines and split them up intop three projects 
(Longview, Ft Pierce, Fla Peaker).  As usual, things like dual fuel ($2 MM), 
peaker stacks ($1.5-2MM) and inlet cooling options are scope additions and 
are not included in the MSRP.  Please get me your comments as soon as 
possible to keep the process moving.  We can use this term sheet with 
business points discussed with GE to get the DASh process moving.  Shipment 
dates are still uncertain.  GE will try and accomadate us with turbines that 
will work for combined cycle as well as peakers for summer 2003 start dates.  
We will not know what (if any) turbines that we will get until GE goes into 
their DASH process next week.

Thanks,

Mike J Miller
