Fred,

For the record, I don't agree with your legal interpretation of the "impeded" 
issue, nor do I agree with any rumor mill which opines as to what contributed 
to the demise of the VEPCO project.

It is unfortunate (and in fact disturbing) if people who didn't have first 
hand knowledge of the facts (and who lacked an understanding of  the legal 
issues involved) have downplayed our position with SW.  

Kay
