Chris / Kay:

I talked with John today and told him about Northwestern. I basically said we 
were close to agreement on doing a project in Montana for the first unit, 
with the destination of the second undetermined at this time. I asked him not 
to disclose this to the rest of GE until our deal is signed. He was very 
positive on this.

I also mentioned the air filter, and he stated that he thought the LD clock 
stopped when the unit was put into storage. I suggested that both GE and 
Enron look into this to make sure we're in agreement before we bring a 
partner in. He appreciated the suggestion and told me Jeff Darst would get 
back to me.

Chris - in the meantime, could you please review the contract on this point?

Thanks.

Ben
