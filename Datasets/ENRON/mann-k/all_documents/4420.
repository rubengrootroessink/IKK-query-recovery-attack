Thanks, Nigel.

LATEST MARKET DEVELOPMENT #2

To Distribution:

Recently we sent out a notice that the insurance market is requiring that=
=20
warranties from major equipment manufacturers [mainly prototype turbines]=
=20
were to come first before insurance. Following is a summary of recent marke=
t=20
changes that underwriters are requiring related to the vendor=01,s warranty=
=20
issues on prototype machines. Please note that the market could become more=
=20
restrictive and require the following on proven technology as well. This=20
market change should be incorporated into the contracts between Enron and i=
ts=20
vendors for the purchase of major equipment for power plants.

Underwriter requirements during:

Construction Period:

1. Vendor=01,s Warranty for the part that failed - required as builder's ri=
sks=20
policy does not cover it.
2. Vendor=01,s Warranty for resultant damage within the casing - now being=
=20
required by underwriters.
3. Vendor=01,s Warranty for resultant damage within vender=01,s scope of su=
pply -=20
now being required by Underwriters.
4. Vendor=01,s LD's following all of the above - underwriters now requiring=

machines.=20
5. Vendor=01,s responsibility for collateral damage to items not within the=
ir=20
scope of supply and resultant LD's =01) underwriters are not asking for thi=
s.

Operating Period [Permanent Insurance]:

1. Vendor=01,s Warranty for part that failed - required even though machine=
ry=20
breakdown [boiler & machinery] coverage will respond.
2. Vendor=01,s Warranty for resultant damage within the casing - now being=

r=20
this.
5. Vendor=01,s responsibility for collateral damage to items not within the=
ir=20
scope of supply and resultant LD's - underwriters not asking for this.

We have been told that two-year warranties after Taking-Over are generally=
=20
all that underwriters expect.  We also have been told that if there were=20
problems such as we have experienced at Dabhol, longer warranties would be=
=20
extremely useful in arranging favorable terms and conditions on the permane=

insurance. If there were no problems after two years it would not make much=
