Kay,


I Hope you had a good weekend. I do again have email (I'm back in Miami).

Regarding the Plat for the Midway project property, I'd rather use Ben that 
Dave to sign the Plat which will be filed during the construction period.  
Would his title be "Attorney-in-Fact"?

Regarding Certosa Holdings,  I would like to discuss the benefits and issues 
of throwing Certosa Holdings into bankruptcy.  Are you available to discuss 
later today?

Greg

Hi Greg,

I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on 
the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option 
payment credited to the purchase price of the land.

As for officers of the development company, I would use Dave Duran.  Ben 
holds a power of attorney, but isn't an officer.

Hope you get email!

Kay
