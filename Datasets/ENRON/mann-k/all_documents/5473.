Attached for your review are the following documents

1. Amendment Number 3 to the Securities Purchase Agreement;
2. Amendment Number 4 to the Project Development Agreement;
3.  Amendment Number 1 to the Guaranty; and
4.  The Assignment of Interests (in preparation for Friday's closing).

As you will see the new SPA calls for Seller's Wiring Instructions to be 
attached as Schedule 2.5.  Please let me know where I can get that 
information.  Also, I spoke with AES' attorney about the Guaranty issue but 
she had to check with AES and I have not heard back from her.

Please call me with your questions and comments at your earliest 
convenience.  Best regards.
