Fellow Sufferers,

Below you will find:

(a)    a revised Consent to Assignment, and

(b)    assignment language waiting to be framed:

Please note that in the interest of time I am sending them to you before the
GE team has had an opportunity to review them.  Accordingly, there may be
some addition comments from our side.

Happy reading!
