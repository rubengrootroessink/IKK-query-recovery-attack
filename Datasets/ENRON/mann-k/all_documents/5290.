Kay:

The person signing the escrow instruction must be someone who is listed on
the incumbency certificate that we previously submitted to Citibank (i.e.,
Thomas or Duran).  Can we change the signatory to Duran as opposed to
Calger?

(I suppose we have the same issue with PPL, as Vicens is not named on PPL's
incumbency certificate and Citibank already raised that issue for them on
the escrow agreement.  I will let Greg Lang know.)

Carolyn,

Please revised the signature page for escrow instruction to reflect Chris
Calger as a signatory.

Thanks,

Kay
