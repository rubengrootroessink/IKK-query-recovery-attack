I will look at it too and provide comments tomorrow.  I forwarded it to Ann 
Elizabeth and Carlos.  I don't know which ENA attorney is on this project, so 
Kay, you may want to touch base with them.  Thanks.

Kay / Christi:

We need to get a law firm reviewing this agreement as soon as possible. As 
Christi has worked with several on past projects, I thought she could help. 
Please let me know how we should proceed.

Thanks,

Ben
