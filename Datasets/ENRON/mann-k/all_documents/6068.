On May 1st, iBuyit Payables was activated for all organizations supported b=
y=20
Houston Accounts Payable Processing Center.  Since this transition, over 30=
00=20
invoices have been successfully processed by this on-line tool.  This is an=
=20
exciting step towards transitioning all of Enron to the on-line processing =
of=20
invoices.

Despite this initial success, I want to take this opportunity to address so=
me=20
of the concerns that we have been hearing about this new tool and the=20
processing center.

I sent an invoice to Accounts Payable a while ago, but the vendor still has=
=20
not been paid.
The goal of the Accounts Payable Processing Center is to route the invoice=
=20
through iBuyit Payables for coding and approval within 4 business days of=
=20
receipt of the invoice by Accounts Payable.  As with the introduction of an=
y=20
new process, Accounts Payable is experiencing transition issues and this=20
process time is currently 8 to 10 business days.  Accounts Payable is worki=
ng=20
very hard to overcome these issues, and expects to achieve the normal=20
processing time of 4 business days within the next 9 business days.

When I call the Accounts Payable Call Center, they are unable to locate my=
=20
invoice.
This again is a result of the current backlog.  Between the time that the=
=20
Accounts Payable Processing Center receives an invoice, and the time that t=
he=20
invoice is scanned and entered into iBuyit Payable, it is very difficult to=
=20
locate that invoice.  Once normal processing time is achieved, this=20
=01&blackout=018 period will be no more than 4 business days.  In the meant=
ime, it=20
is critical that invoices are not resubmitted until you are certain that th=
ey=20
have not been received by Accounts Payable.

What can I do to help process my invoices in a more timely manner?
Vendors should submit invoices directly to the Accounts Payable Processing=
=20
Center (PO Box 4734, Houston, TX 77210-4734, ATTN:  Enron AP) and should=20
indicate the company number and name, contact name, and coder=01,s EID. =20
Currently:

*   90% of invoices are received outside of the Accounts Payable Processing=
=20
Center=20
*   On average, invoices received by Accounts Payable are already 37 days=
=20
past due
*   On average, 40% of invoices received by Accounts Payable do not have th=
e=20
correct company number

Submitting invoices directly to Accounts Payable with this information will=
=20
dramatically increase the speed and accuracy of processing.=20

Providing you with efficient, accurate, and friendly service is very=20
important to us.  We appreciate your patience as we work to achieve normal=
=20
processing levels of service.  More importantly, we look forward to working=
=20
with you on future enhancements that will enable iBuyit Payables to play a=
=20
valuable role in your invoice payment activities.
  =20
For invoice payment status please call the AP Call Center at (713) 853-7127=
=20
or toll free  (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to=20
<mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.=20
