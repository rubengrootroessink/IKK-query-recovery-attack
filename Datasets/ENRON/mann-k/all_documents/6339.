Enron Golfers:

Hey guys, Sarah Edwards is a friend of a friend's daughter who desperately 
needs help to stay alive and all you duffers out there can help:

The 100 holes for golf for Sarah Edwards will be Monday June 4 at
Sweetwater CC. Sarah needs a lung transplant and
approximately $150,000 of the costs are not covered by insurance or
medicaid.  

For more info on Sarah, visit Sarahssoldiers.com 

Here is how the 100 holes for golf works:

*Free golf at Sweetwater
*You play as many holes as you can (100 is not mandatory)
* We provide your lunch, drinks and snacks
* You get pledges from your friends to play
*pledges may be flat amounts, per hole, per birdie or per eagle

Lets all keep Sarah alive! Can I get some other tentative commitments?

thanks!

Steve
