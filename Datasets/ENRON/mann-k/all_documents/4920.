Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have enclosed initial drafts of the closing memorandum and of a letter
from ENA confirming that it has no objection to and will not act in
furtherance of frustrating execution of the financing documents between
Salmon and PPL.  Please review and advise of any comments.

We await receipt of comments to the escrow disbursement instruction letter.
Thank you.
