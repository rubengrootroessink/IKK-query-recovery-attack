Yes, Money did flow yesterday.  Lee Johnson is coming by today to put his 
signature on the clean version (I have a faxed signature).  Kay Mann is 
putting together the turbine contract.  A draft should be available in the 
next couple of days.  This contract is going to be substantially the same as 
the existing LV breakout contract with changes to payment schedule and 
delivery.  

A  quick synopsis of our deal:

Units 19,20,23, and 28 will come out of e-Next under the Salmon breakout 
contract that is being sold to Delta Power.
This contract will adhere to the payment schedule delineated in the existing 
draft of the LV Cogen breakout contract.  This contract remains substantially 
the same with the exception of delivery dates and serial numbers asssociated 
with swapping unit 24 for unit 28.  Unit performance will be delineated at 
ISO conditions.

Units 24,25,26, and 27 will be purchased under a contract similar to the 
existing LV draft with appropriate changes for delivery, payment schedule 
(the one in the AIP), and liability amounts (the bigger purchase price).

Steve

Steve,
   Was this amended document signed and did money flow yesterday?  It is 
imperative that you keep us in Finance in the loop on any documents and 
associated money needs right from the start, along with Teresa Voss in 
Accounting.  CSFB needs to receive the executed version of this agreement 
within 20 days of execution or it is a default under the facility - could 
lead to termination!  Please also insure that Finance and Finance Legal (Rose 
Engeldorf) receive executed copies as well.

I would appreciate receiving a timeline on when you think the actual turbine 
purchase contract will be ready for Finance, Finance Legal and Accounting to 
review.  It cannot be executed as you know until all such parties have signed 
off on it.

Thanks, Lisa

This is the purchase contract for the 4 new LM 6000s.  This is the first time 
I've seen it - have you seen this before?  It sounds like they are signing 
the contract today...

Nice try getting us to sign up for four more.  What a salesman!  I have made 
some changes to reflect the First Amended and Restated  Agreement in 
Principle.  Unless we hear back from you (call Steve) we will sign the 
attached. I am also corrected the dates in the first paragraph of Appendixs C 
to "April 4" . OK?

Sheila,

I had that same version, so I accepted changes and updated to reflect our
current agreement.

Thanks,

Lee
