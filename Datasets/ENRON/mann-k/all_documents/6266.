>Subject: Fwd: Ah, a woman humor! 
>
>A woman in her 50's had a heart attack and was taken to the 
>hospital. While on the operating table, she had a near death experience. 
>Seeing God, she asked Him if this was "it." God said, "No, I am sending you 
>back. You have another 40 years, 2 months and 8 days to live."
>
>Upon recovery, the woman decided to stay in the hospital and have a 
>face lift, body sculpting liposuction, breast correction, a tummy tuck, 
>etc. She even had her hairdresser come to the hospital to change her hair 
>color before she was released. She figured that, since she had such a long 
>life ahead of her, she had better make the most of it.
>
>She left the hospital after all the operations, and while crossing the
>street, she was hit by an ambulance and was immediately killed.  
>
>Arriving in front of God, the woman demanded,  "I thought you said I had 
>another forty years left to live. What happened?"
>
>God replied, "I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you."
