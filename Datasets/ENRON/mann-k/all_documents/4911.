Doug,

see attached term sheet for NMC (Arpin, WI site).  Please provide comments 
and changes as appropriate (plus add language for your insurance product in 
the place holder).

Carlos,

Doug and I will provide you background.  I am not sure if you are the 
appropriate Legal Support (please direct us to the appropriate person if you 
are not).

This is a starting point and is fairly general (to facilitate discussions 
with NMC).

Thanks, Ron.
