the first part of Sec.77-5-725(u) supports your statement ("to purchase...on 
behalf of its members"). To me, that might support buying as agent in a way 
that the action of MDEA would be a binding commitment of CPU. However,  the 
second clause ("and to sell the same to its members") would seem to go the 
other way.

Also note subsections o, p and q.

Under municipal law in Miss. there is the concept that a public body may not 
"delegate" its statutory functions to others. I know you can't do it when 
it's a discretionary public function being delegated to a non-public entity. 
I'm not so sure about one public body delegating to another. I'd like to hear 
from David Hunt on this.

Would you read that to mean the authority to buy power "as agent for" the
Cities?  Seems not entirely clear but not entirely out of the question.
