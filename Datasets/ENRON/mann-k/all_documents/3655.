Renee-

I understand your need to incorporate the actual changes into the change 
order itself as opposed to an attachment.    After reading GE's (Jeff 
Darst's) document, I can't easily extract from it what you need.  I need to 
write something from scratch.  Instead of trading several emails with 
yourself and Jeff Darst, it would be more efficient for me to give Jeff a 
call myself to come up with something acceptable to the both of us which also 
meets your requirements below.  (I'm thinking that the actual scope items 
should be in your change order and GE's requirements/recommendations for the 
future modifications can be attached -- Much the same way their standard 
specs are attached to a purchase contract. ) 

I'm in Austin today and tomorrow (Thursday) and will be back in the office on 
Friday.  If you can't wait, or need to talk to me before that, give me a call 
on my cell phone (713) 412-6873.

Hope this helps.
Eric

Eric,

I need to incorporate the essential parts of what Jeff Darst refers to as 
Attachment 2 below (91209_14 Jul 2000_Chiller Provisions.doc) into the Change 
Order, not as an attachment.  This Attachment contains specifications as to 
what they are providing as well as stipulations as to how we are to install 
the inlet chillers.  I need to know which are the specifications as to what 
they are providing and how the scope is being changed.  I'm not concerned 
with their recommendations of how we are to install the inlet chillers since 
that is our scope and our liability/warranty.

Please separate out the scope items that need to be included in the Change 
Order and provide me with the wording so that I may get another draft of this 
Change Order out for review.

If you want to get together to discuss, please give me a call.

Thanks
Renee Alfaro

Attached are our comments to your draft of CO #1.  Our proposed attachment 2

We are still looking for a copy of the Consent to Assignment.
