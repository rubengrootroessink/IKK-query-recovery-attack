In connection with the required Turbopark notices and documents related to 
the turbine sale to Delta, attached for your initial review and comment are 
drafts of the initial notice to CSFB, an assignment and assumption agreement 
and a bill of sale.  Three of the turbines being sold derive from the May 
2000 agreement with GE and one of the turbines being sold derives from the 
April 3, 2001 "Agreement in Principle" with GE.  Please note, if possible, we 
would prefer not to identify what amount is owed by E-Next on the turbines 
(this impacts the purchase price section in the exhibit on the initial 
notice).

Lastly, as a background refresher, ENA is effectively selling 4 turbines to 
Delta Power as follows.  ENA presently owns 100% of Salmon Energy LLC.  Delta 
is going to place in escrow the monies owed on 4 turbines (as well as ENA's 
profit on the transaction) and after such escrow deposit, ENA will then 
proceed with the submittal of the CSFB notice and execution of the assignment 
and assumption agreement and bill of sale.  After these steps have occurred, 
then ENA will sell 80% of its interest in Salmon to Delta Power.  At some 
future date, ENA's remaining 20% interest in Salmon will be transferred to 
Delta.

Thank you and please call me with any questions.
