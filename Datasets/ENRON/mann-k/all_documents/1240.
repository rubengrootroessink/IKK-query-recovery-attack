Here is Molly Harris' latest draft of the Credit Policy.  Could you please 
take a quick look at it and let me know if you see anything that would 
conflict with any other policies or the LLC agreement?  Thanks,

Gregg

Please find attached Credit's last version of our Credit Policy for MEH.  
Please review for comments by tomorrow.  We would want to make any final 
changes and provide to Board meeting of JV on Wednesday.

Greg - what is status of legal name?  It appears to have changed.



Thanks
Molly
