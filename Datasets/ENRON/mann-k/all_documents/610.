I agree. Kay would you canvass the group to see if we are ready to transmit 
to Rob Taylor who will incorporate it into the draft and then send it back to 
me so that we can send it to GE?   Please ask Rob to send it to you also 
since I will be out of the office tomorrow.  Please send to Barnas and 
Shoemaker at the earliest opportunity.  We have a room for Wednesday's call.  
If you don't get an email about it, please let me know.  Thanks!
