Not a problem.  Kay and I will try to get together later today.  

I see that I failed  to complete my train of thought under Section 14.1(i) re 
warranty term.  So attached is a revised copy of my markups to GE's suggested 
language.  You can disregard prior version.  

Have a safe trip,

Scott

Would you all mush on without me today?  I will be traveling to Portland and 
won't be available until about 5:30 your time today.
