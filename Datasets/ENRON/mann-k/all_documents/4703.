Attached please find the latest Salmon Energy Turbine Agreement (second
document below), as well as a blackline (first document below) showing
changes made to the version circulated on April 2.  This version
contains Lee's changes to Exhibits A, A-1, B and B-1.  No changes were
made to the Maximum Liability Amount, Purchase Amount or Unit Liability
Amount. Power System Stabilizers are included in the scope.  To complete
