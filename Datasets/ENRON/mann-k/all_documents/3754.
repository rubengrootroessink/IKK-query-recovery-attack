A couple of us have been discussing having a spa weekend at the Lake Austin 
Spa following the legal conference in San Antonio.   I've checked with the 
Spa, and they will give us a group rate for 6 or more folks staying at least 
two nights (usually they require 3 nights), beginning May 4th.  The cost will 
be north of $1000 (single) including food and activities.  Spa services will 
be extra.  The Spa has a great website at www.lakeaustinspa.com.  

It will be a good idea to block some rooms fairly soon, although the drop 
dead commitment date will come later.  Please let me know if you have any 
interest in joining us.

Kay

ps, I'm not trying to exclude anyone with this email, so if I've left out 
someone who might be interested, please include them.
