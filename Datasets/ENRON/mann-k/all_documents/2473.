Mike:

Attached is a form of acknowledgement letter that Coral would like ABB to 
sign at such time as the Facility Agreement is signed. The Facility Agreement 
is the "break-out contract" for the single transformer (LNL 9517-1) being 
assigned to CA Energy Development II, L.L.C., in which Enron is presently 
selling 80% of the member interests to Coral (the parent of Tejas Energy NS 
Holdings, L.L.C.). The remaining 20% will be sold to them after commercial 
operations of  their plant. Please have this acknowledgement letter reviewed 
as soon as possible. I assume there should not be any issue as the total 
transformer contract will be paid in full (except for the retainage) prior to 
the execution of the Facility Agreement.

Lastly, it would be very helpful if we could somehow expedite the completion 
of the Facility Agreement. I believe Dave Onuscheck has the form proposed by 
Kay, and that we are awaiting his comments.

Thanks much for your help on this.

Regards,


Ben
