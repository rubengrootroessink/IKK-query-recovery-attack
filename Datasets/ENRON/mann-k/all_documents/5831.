Fred:

I would like you to take a first shot at incorporating the terms we discussed 
today and in Tampa with TECO. Please get me your revised term sheet as soon 
as possible.

Thanks,

Ben

Attached is the latest version of the term sheet I have been preparing for a 
transaction with TECO.  It is set up for Ft. Pierce but can be easily changed 
to Midway.
