Kay:

Any progress on drafting a letter of intent, or are you still waiting on 
feedback from the team?

Just let me know.  Thanks!
Bill

Herman/Billy,

This is still very early in the process, but some thought as to structure 
options for earning recognition might be worthwhile.

I've made some revisions the Bill's document to make sure we are on the same 
page before I prepare the LOI.  

 << File: NRG Term Sheet.doc >> 

Do we want to give any sort of description of how the benchmark will be set?
Do we want to mention the cancellation provisions?

Thanks,

Kay
