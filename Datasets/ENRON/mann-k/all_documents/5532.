Kay-I spoke to George, and although he will check with InterGen, he believes
that InterGen will be amenable to allowing Enron to exercise its put.  I
don't think they'd go to GE for an acknowledgment from GE that the exercise
was okay, but frankly, based on what GE has already agreed to, I don't think
anyone needs it.
