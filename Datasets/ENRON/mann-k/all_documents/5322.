Peter: Further to voicemail and email, please send the current version of the 
GE Breakout agreement for the LVCII project to Lisa.Bills@enron.com and 
Roseann.Engeldorf@ENRON.com

We anticipate that it will be necessary to modify the GE Agreement per 
comments that would be transmitted by Rose or Lisa and would ask that the 
document be turned around as quickly as possible.

If you have any questions you can reach me at 904 630 5376.
