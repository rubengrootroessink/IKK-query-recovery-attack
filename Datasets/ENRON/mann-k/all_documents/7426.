Another research report. Miss. Code Ann Sec 21-27-59 provides that nothing in 
the law pursuant to which CPU was created shall be construed to prohibit the 
municipality from using general revenues to pay the "immediate expenses of 
operation and/or maintence" of the system. However, the statute provides that 
nothing requires the municipality to do so either.

We've found no case law expanding on this statute. Thus, there is no clear 
answer whether obligations of CPU to Enron would be considered the kinds of 
expenses which may be paid. If a guarantee by CPU of the obligations of MDEA 
is insufficient,  then it may be worth raising this issue with David Hunt.

As I mentioned in my voicemail last week, I do have some comments on the 
proposed agreement. Please let me know if you wish to discuss.
