I have finally reviewed the below.  Comments:

In the 2nd recital to begin and elsewhere where stated, we need to build in 
flexibility for other ancillary equipment besides the ABB Transformers.

What do we do about selling the equipment for more or less than what's due 
WestLB?  How will the money flow?  What accounting impact will this have?

Regards, Lisa
