Please do. Please include in the notes that the transaction with Northwestern 
is completed, and the only deliverable which will trigger the income 
recognition is a Consent & Acknowledgement from GE which we expect to get 
before the end of Q2.

Thanks,

Ben

Ben,

Chris Sherman believes the Blue Dog turbines should be moved from Q3 to Q2.  
However, I wanted to check with you before I made any changes.  Is this move 
appropriate?

Thanks, Paula.
