I have marked it up with my comments for our discussion.  Also,
1.  Is DevCo the "Agent" as stated in the first paragraph of the Consent, or
the "Buyer" (or both)?  If DevCo is not the Buyer, who is and shouldn't they
sign the Consent?

2.  I have not attempted to add the requirement for 15/18 months evidence of
the units going into a "real project" vs. staying in DevCo and thus
remaining in the financing structure because I don't know if it really
belongs in the Consent.  Remember the issue is that the financing is not
sufficient to pay for all of the units so some (how many?) must be
refinanced out before new ones can come in.  Failure to do this means we get
suspended/terminated.  Based on the direction from Stan for Entergy: seek to
get the right to stop if they can't show a project 15/18 from delivery, we
should discuss where we think this should go.

3.  Related to 2 above, we must have payment ahead of termination or an LC
for the delta.  We discussed an LC with Enron two phone calls ago and they
were going to check on the ability to get this.  The SPV must minimally show
the ability to pay the termination.  Has Commercial Finance looked at the
pay/terminate schedules?

I am back in the office tomorrow.
