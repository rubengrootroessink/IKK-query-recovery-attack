Please see additional comments in Section 2.4 of the Declaration of 
Covenants.  
I missed this until this morning but the number of votes per parcel does not 
account for the propety to be conveyed by deed to the POA.  This includes the 
road, the drainage ditches and the pond.  Parcel 1,should lose between 2 and 
3 acres, Parcel 2 would lose about 1 acre and Parcel 3 would lose about 10 
acres.  

The decision not give Parcel 3 voting rights or cause Parcel 3 to be assessed 
was negotiated and agreed to by Enron and Cooney Midway Groves.  However, 
since having this property dedicated as the open lands in perputity to meet 
the requirements of the entire 117 acre PNRD, perhaps the POA should be 
oblicated to pay any costs associated with this land: property taxes, 
insurance, maintenance etc.  The only thing we could do with this land is 
lease it out for grazing, which may allow us to keep an ag exemption.
