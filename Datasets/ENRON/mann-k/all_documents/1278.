Karen - I will ask legal to forward you the draft of the loan document as 
soon as it becomes available.  I expect it by the end of this week.  If that 
changes I will let you know.  As for your question regarding the amount, the 
worksheet is simply an attempt to capture the potential maximum needs based 
on certain assumptions.  Depending on the positions we have in place, the 
various business lines could offset each other, but they could also be 
additive.  I tried to pick a middle ground for my request so that there is a 
realistic expectation of what the potential needs could be.  As for Global 
Finance, Sarah is back in the office so she will be handling the FASH.  
Lastly, I am currently assuming that the Peoples loan will mirror our loan 
with identical caps.  However, we have not presented a draft to Peoples yet 
for their review so they may have other ideas which they have not 
communicated yet.

Thanks,

Gregg

Gregg,

Please e mail me a copy of the draft loan document at its current state, or a 
termsheet outlining the agreed-upon covenants/features.  I assume the loan 
document for both our piece and People' will be the exact copy for 
covenants/rights etc.  

The worksheet seems to imply a maximum cash needs, i.e. assuming all deals 
outstanding (which = 50% of the maximum capacity) will need funding at the 
same timeframe.  Do the underlying business lines have overlapping periods 
such that the outstanding amount at any given time is really less than the 
aggregate?  
We will need someone from Global Finance to fill out the FASH addendum before 
Ben Glisan signs off on the DASH.  Let me know who covers for Sarah at her 
absence.

Please take a quick look at the attached and give me a call.  Thanks.
