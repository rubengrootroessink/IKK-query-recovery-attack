Don't have it, but we can ask local counsel.  If you can email me the 
question you would like asked, I will pass it along to our Miss lawyer.

In speaking with Marvin regarding Clarksdale's authority to raise rates, he 
pointed to me their statutes.  Is this something that you have a copy of 
since this is a public filing.  Also, the same for Yazoo.
