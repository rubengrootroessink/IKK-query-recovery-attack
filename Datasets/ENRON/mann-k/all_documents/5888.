Yes, we have a TECO CA.

The counterparty to the Participation Agreement is with Fort Pierce Utilities 
Authority.  The reason you thought we were just sending out the public 
documents is because that is want Ben wants you to think.  He had Fred Mitro 
send out alot of the "unexecuted proposed agreements" to TECO prior to our 
meeting the other day (which is why Bart and I have been concerned).

Do you know if we had TECO sign a confidentiality agreement?

Who is the counterparty to the participation agreement?  I thought we were 
just sending out  the public documents.

Thanks,

Kay

Just so you know, Ben and Fred have provided copies of the Participation 
Agreement and Option to Lease between us and Fort Pierce Utilities Authority 
to TECO.  Both documents contain "Confidentiality Clauses".
