Audrey,

Attached for your review are drafts of the following documents

1. Amendment Number 3 to the Securities Purchase Agreement compared against 
the version circulated on Monday;
2. Amendment Number 4 to the Project Development Agreement compared against 
the version circulated on Monday;
3.  Amendment Number 1 to the Guaranty; and
4.  The Assignment of Interests (in preparation for Friday's closing).

In order to expedite the review process, I am simultaneously sending copies 
of these documents to ENA for their final approval; therefore, they remain 
subject to further changes if necessary.

Regarding Amendment 2 to the SPA and Amendment 3 to the PDA, ENA will be 
faxing executed copies of the documents directly to AES this evening.

Please call me with comments at your earliest convenience.

Best regards.
