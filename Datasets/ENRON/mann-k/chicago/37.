Bob/Kay:

Thanks for your help last week with these ComEd LOI's.  

Janet signed the documents Friday afternoon and we faxed a copy of each to 
ComEd.  ComEd will use the electronic versions below to generate executable 
copies on their letterhead and send them back to me.  I will bring them up 
for initialling once I recieve them.

Fred
