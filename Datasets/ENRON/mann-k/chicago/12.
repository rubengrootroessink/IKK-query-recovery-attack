In discussing the signing of Amendment #1 with Greg Penman, a couple more
changes were made to the document.  As reflected in the attached marked
draft, the signatories for each member have been changed, and a missing
quotation mark has been added.  Per my discussion with Greg, Peoples MW will
sign two copies and leave them with EMW in the Chicago office this
afternoon.
