I ended up staying up (must have been that last cup of coffee!) and revising 
the agreement last night.  Attached is a clean copy.  I am having my 
secretary run the blackline this am and she will email it to you (her name is 
Deborah Morris, so look for an email from her.)  IMPORTANT!-- There are 
several bracketed notes in italics that call to your attention items for your 
input.  These are intended to be removed before this goes to VEPCO!

Kay--I'll call you later today or tomorrow, after we get their changes and 
have a chance to review them.  Best regards.
