Kay,

I don't know if Rahil forwarded this to you or not, but here is the VEPCO term sheet.

Karla, John, and Jim,

It was good meeting with you at your offices last week.  Attached is a draft proposal highlighting the new structure we had agreed upon during our discussions.  Please review the proposal and comment as necessary, as agreeing upon a common premise will help us move forward more efficiently.  We will be meeting again later this week to discuss the various options that are available, and would appreciate your feedback with respect to specific structures, definitions, etc. you may have in mind (and that we may not have captured here).

Feel free to call either Heather or myself with questions or ideas at anytime.


 

Look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Rahil
