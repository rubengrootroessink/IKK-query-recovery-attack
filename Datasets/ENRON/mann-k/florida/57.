Greg:
I have a couple of comments on Article 15 Insurance.

It appears that most of my changes were entered but I see a couple of modifications still needed.

15.1 is titled "Customer's Insurance" but the paragraph below it discuss 'each Party" so this needs to be changed so the title refers to the list of insurance requirements below and the title refers to the whole article.

15.3 in the fifth line delete "coverage, coverage for" and in the sixth line delete "and".

15.4 in the third line delete "of".

15.6.1 in the third line a space is needed between "policies" and "are".

I believe that is all that is needed. Please let me know what FPL's response is.
Paul

Please find attached the Midway IA redlined to show the differences between the generic and the project specific draft and also showing the comments I've collected to date   Please note that the comments were added by changing the font and format rather than by using the track/highlight changes function.  

As you know we had scheduled a call with FPL for tomorrow.  Since we have not sent FPL our comments, I suggested to Tom Sanders of FPL that we postpone the call until Monday. This is assuming we get them our comments to them tomorrow.  If that is not possible, we may need to push the call back further.   hope that redlining and consolidating the comments will help with your review.   

Please provide me with any additional comments at your earliest convenience.
