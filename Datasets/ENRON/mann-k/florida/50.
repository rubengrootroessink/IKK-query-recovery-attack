Dear Team Enron Pompano Beach:

This morning the attached motions to dismiss were delivered to the Agency
Clerk at DEP in Tallahassee.  The motions seek dismissal of the amended
petitions submitted by Margate, the City of Coral Springs and the City of
Coconut Creek, respectively.  We will keep you apprised of any responses to
our motions or DEP rulings.

Thanks very much, 

Paul C. Savage
