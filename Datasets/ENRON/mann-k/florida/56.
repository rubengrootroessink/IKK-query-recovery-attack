 <<ENRONPOMPANOMOTION TO STRIKE AND DISMISS PETITIONS FOR FORMAL
ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING_v1.DOC>> 
Dear Team Enron Pompano Beach:

Attached is our motion to strike and/or dismiss Coral Springs' second
amended petition.  Because the petition is substantially the same as those
previously submitted in this action and in the Deerfield action, you will
recognize our motion to dismiss arguments.  

A new argument appears, however, on the first five pages of the motion
wherein we argue that it was improper for Coral Springs to have submitted a
second amended petition well past the DEP's imposed deadline.  We ask the
administrative law judge to accordingly strike the second amended petition
and refuse to consider it.

We would like to send this out this evening for filing with DOAH tomorrow.
Please forward any comments or suggestions you have by the close of business
today, if possible.  

Thank you very much, 

Paul C. Savage
