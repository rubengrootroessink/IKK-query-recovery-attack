When the 3 of you are happy with the form, send it out.  I'll review in more detail once we hear back from the owner.  Please don't have another lawyer approve it while I'm gone based on my review thus far, as I want to give it some more thought.  Plus, it will need to go to Accounting and possibly Finance.  

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is the a redline of the revised Homestead Option.  This redline is against the one provided by Alger's attorney and includes all of your suggested changes.  The deal has changed to obtain an option on 5.0 acres; purchase price, firm at $1,100,000.00 and Option Payments at $11,000.  I have highlighted two areas (Sections 6 and 14) that still need to be addressed.  Please advise of any additional changes.
