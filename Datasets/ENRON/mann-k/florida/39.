I'm trying to clear out some invoices.  I'm processing an invoice for T. Johnston, I think it is around $16k.  If we will continue to have charges from him, these should be paid through Marchris.

I have around 300k to process for Greenburg, most of which relates to Pompano and Deerfield before I was involved.  Please advise if you want to review these before these are paid.
