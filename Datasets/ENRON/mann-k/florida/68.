 <<POMPANORESONSE TO BROWARD COUNTY'S MOTION TO INTERVENE_v1.DOC>> 
Dear Enron Pompano DOAH Team:

Attached is our response to Broward's motion to intervene in the Pompano
DOAH proceeding.  The requirements for an intervention motion are the same,
by rule, as are those for petitions, so you will recognize the arguments
from our motions to dismiss.  Please pass along any comments before Monday
evening, if possible.  

Thanks very much, 

Paul C. Savage
