I agree with your & Kay's comments.

Section 6 "Free Opiton" is nothing more than a wish the City put on the tab=

Kay / Steve:=20

Attached are my comments. I've tried to address Kay's concerns below, and=

agree with them wholeheartedly. From a commercial perspective, paragraph 6 =

a non-starter.

Let's discuss. Thanks.=20
