Here is an overview of what projects are active:

1.  Midway - Greg Krause

The hot item is a Property Owners Association Agreement that will be entere=
d into between Midway Development Company, L.L.C. ("MDC") and Cooney-Midway=
 Groves (the owner of the property on which MDC has an option to purchase).=
  The agreement will not be entered into or effective until MDC has given n=
otice it will proceed with the project (and, thus, we control the trigger).=
  I have asked Chris Boehler at A&K to turn a redline draft that incorporat=
es changes that Greg and I discussed last week with he and Darren Inoff.   =
David Layman at Greenburg Traurig (our Florida counsel) also needs to incor=
porate some changes now that the platting has been done.  Chris is to send =
his redline to Greg, David and you.  David is to make his additions and the=
n send a composite to Greg, you and Chris.  This will probably take a week =
or so and then it can go to the counterparty when everyone on our side is i=
n agreement with the changes.  The biggest issue we have right now is that =
Cooney-Midway Groves wants to maintain control over the property as long as=
 they own an interest in one of the tracts and we are not willing to allow =
that when we will own 2/3 of the property but have less than 1/2 of the vot=
e.  This is because the agreement is designed to give one vote to each acre=
.  There are three tracts, of which CM will own one and MDC will own 2, but=
 the 3rd tract is not alloted any votes since it must remain undeveloped la=
nd for a retention pond.

Chris is also working on some title commitment letters for the option we ju=
st secured from Clyde Thompson and Paul Freeman.  There's no rush on those =
and can definitely wait until I get back.

2.  Pompano - Steve Krimsky

Pompano has 2 issues that are hot.

1.  The infamous Developer's Agreement.  Debbie has turned another draft an=
d has asked that we bless it before Thursday so that she can go visit with =
the city attorney on Friday.  The hearing in Pompano is scheduled for the e=
vening of June 12 and you have indicated that you will attend.  I'll send t=
hem a note to tell them you'll be there.  We need to have a deal worked out=
 with the Pompano commissioners before the public meeting.  The thing to ke=
ep in mind here is that in Pompano, unlike Deerfield, the same group that w=
ill be approving our request for a zoning change is the same group we have =
to negotiate the developer's agreement with.  Allegedly, they will settle f=
or $1.5 MM in annual payments.  I've laid a copy of the agreement Debbie ha=
s prepared on your chair.

2.  In an effort to block the power plant project, Broward County has draft=
ed a proposed ordinance that will place a moratorium on the approval of any=
 power plant air permits until the matter can be studied at length.  The pr=
oblem is, they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air p=
ermit process.  That is expressly delegated to the Dept. of Environmental P=
rotection ("DEP").    However, the DEP hasn't taken the clean approach and =
said they have NO authority but it has stated that BC is entitled to reason=
able rules and regulations and DEP will let them have some permit approvals=
; HOWEVER, air permits for power plants are expressly not delegated to BC. =
  Greenburg is probably a week away from being able to give us a legal opin=
ion on the likelihood that Broward County will be able to do something that=
 is legally defensible.  Once they started looking into this, it became qui=
te the legal search because at one time BC did have the authority to pass s=
pecial acts. However, in 1977 their special act authority was cut off but t=
he legislature ratified all rules they had in effect at that time.  After t=
hat, they were granted charter power to adopt have such authority as a char=
ter county to adopt their own home rules as long as they were not inconsist=
ent with state or federal law or the constitution.  In 2000, they repealed =
all prior acts relating to the issuance of air permits and said they would =
rely on their charter power to make up their own rules.  Problem is, the DE=
P has expressly not given them the right to have a say in air permits for p=
ower plants.  Needless to say, this is sticky and icky.  My recommendation =
is that we don't jump out and incur litigation costs.  Let us get a memo to=
gether, go talk to the county attorney and show him that they don't have th=
e right to do this.  The hearing on adopting this ordinance is 2 p.m. on Ju=
ne 12, same day as the commissioner's meeting on the Developers Agreement. =
 Between now and June 12, Debbie Orshefsky would like to talk to the attorn=
ey and to the DEP.  Indications are that the DEP will strongly support us a=
s this could be a turf battle for them.  The county attorney may come to hi=
s senses and advise the commission that passing such an ordinance will be c=
ostly as it is unenforceable if challenged.  We can also ask the DEP to iss=
ue a "declaratory statement" and it is likely that statement would say that=
 state law is pre-emptive and the ordinance is invalid.

This is a very, very broad brush of what is a very legislative history inte=
nsive issue.  Debbie will be looking to you to read the memo that will come=
 next week and agree on a strategy on going forward.

3.  Deerfield - Steve Krimsky

Unlike Pompano where the commissioners who vote on the rezoning are the sam=
e who vote on the developer's agreement, in Deerfield they don't have a say=
 over any of the approval process.  However, to facilitate coming into the =
city, they expect something.  If we can agree on the form of developer's ag=
reement, then it would be substantially used in the same manner in Deerfiel=
d.  In Deerfield, they have said they want 3 things:  a payment in lieu of =
taxes, a landscape fund to fund upkeep of a particular street (which is bas=
ically an adopt a street program and is required of any new business coming=
 into Deerfield) and they want an easement to put a cellular tower on our p=
roperty.  I've told Steve Krimsky the latter can be a headache because if t=
hey are successful in leasing the space on the tower to third parties, that=
 creates a lot of traffic going across your property.  It is very do-able, =
we just need to structure it correctly. I've done several radio tower agree=
ments and we can use those as go-bys.  They may also want a "fire service f=
ee" if we give one to Pompano.  There's also lots and lots of negative publ=
icity on a daily basis and Eric Thode is wanting to respond with an editori=
al in the Sun-Sentinel.  I'll forward the most recent version they have bee=
n sharing amongst themselves and not we lawyers.  The hearing in Deerfield =
is June 8th and you may want to attend it as well. =20
