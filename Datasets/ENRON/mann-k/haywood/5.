Audrey,

Attached please find new Amendments to the Securities Purchase Agreement and 
the Project Development Agreement which extend the May
9, 2001 date in each of the agreements to May 11, 2001.  In order to expedite 
the review process, I am simultaneously sending copies of these documents to 
ENA for their final approval; therefore, they remain subject to further 
changes if necessary.  Please call me with comments at your earliest 
convenience.

Best regards.
