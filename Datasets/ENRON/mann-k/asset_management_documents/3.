Here is the EMA that David sent.  Can you send it along to the legal for review.

Thanks,

Tom.

Enjoyed talking to you today. Here is a working document should it appear that we will get a green light. No need to out your revised deal in this format (a letter summary will do). If you do want to flesh this out, give me a call. This EMA is for Redbud only.
