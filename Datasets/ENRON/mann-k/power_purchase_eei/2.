Attached is a draft Confirmation which requires further input from the 
commercial team but should give you a good framework of such transactions.
Please not that in the attached we are the toller and own the plant, we may 
want to change certain aspects of the deal if we wanted to use someone else's 
plant and toll our gas.
 
Regards

Hello Marcus,

I heard a rumor that you have a form of tolling agreement.  I would 
appreciate the opportunity to look at it, just to see what one looks like 
since I hear tolling agreements discussed.  I understand it hasn't been 
signed yet.

Thanks,

Kay
