Kay forwarded this to me as "keeper of the O&M Form".  The current form is 
attached.  Please give me a call with any questions that you may have.

Marty

P.S.  Does this now allow me to collect the lunch you referred to below?

I got this request from a former EI colleague, now with EES.  Do you have 
something he can look at?

Thanks,

Kay

How is everything going?   Long time no see.    


I have a favor to ask you.  Do you happen to have with you a form of OM 
Agreement that EECC (or anyone else)  used (favorable to the OM Provider) 
which could be used as  a starting point.


We still need to get together for lunch and I still need to show you Reagan's 
baby picture.  

Andrew
