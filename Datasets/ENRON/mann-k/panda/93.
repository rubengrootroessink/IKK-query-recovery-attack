Kay:

Attached are some things that Jake will need to sign.  These are items that
were mentioned as pending in my last distribution of documents for
execution.

1.  Resolutions of Salmon (page one is the two members electing the
designated directors, and page two is the new directors electing the new
officers).  I had previously furnished this to you, but the names of the
officers to be elected were blank).

2.  Resolutions of Salmon authorizing execution of the PPL promissory note
and related security agreement and the GE consent and agreement (these were
prepared by the Paul Hastings firm).

3.  Secretary's Certificate with Incumbency (this is required by
Freshfields).

The Secretary's Certificate with Incumbency may be required today.  The
resolutions are not needed for funding but will be needed prior to closing.
If you have any questions, please call.
