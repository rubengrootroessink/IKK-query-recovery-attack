Kay, as I told you, Carolyn put out a set of intial draft documents and we 
debriefed Jake and Stephen.  Based on our meeting, Carolyn was going to make 
certain revisions based on the answers to the questions below and certain 
other items we raised during our meeting.  Nevertheless, your input is 
required on the following:

1.  We have discussed eliminating the payment of a development fee, which if 
Delta /  Panda were to breach its obligations prior to the funding of the 
Escrow would be non-refundable and serve as a form of liquidated damages.  
Commercially the inclination is to avoid that fee, we need to confirm that 
approach.

2.  We need to interface with Dale Rasmussen on the status of the break out 
contract and how quickly it can be incorporated into the form of Facility 
Agreement that would be part of our transaction.

3.  Have we established an LLC that will be sold for this project.

4.  Please see Caroline's questions 6, 7 and 13 below.

5.  Please see faxes that I left on your chair on the broker issue and 
whether we need to respond in writing.  Sheila Tweed's position was not to.

6.  John asked whether K&S should open a separate subfile or include the time 
charged within the Blue Dog file?

Thanks and we'll talk tomorrow.
