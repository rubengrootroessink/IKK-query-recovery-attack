Unprofitable Anger

Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in
the lap of fools.
- (Ecclesiastes 7:9)


Every day of our lives we are placed in situations that engage us
with other people, whether it is in the office, our homes, or in
public places. Do you recall the last time someone cut you off in
traffic, or you were forced to wait in line because someone up
front got held up? Perhaps your employer did something that was
downright unfair. Anger can result from many circumstances.

A friend once told me that anger is like warning lights on the
front of your car dashboard. They signal that there is something
going on under the hood, and we should take a look to examine the
source of the problem. Anger can be traced to a few sources.
First, when we lose control of a circumstance that we have placed
certain expectations on and those expectations do not result in
our desired outcome, we are tempted to get angry. The source of
this type of anger is both fear and protection of personal
rights. You see, when we believe we have a right to something, we
have not given the Lord permission to allow an outcome different
from what we want. If an outcome is different from our
expectations, this may stimulate fear.

For instance, if a vendor failed to deliver an important job on
time due to something out of his control, you may respond out of
anger. Please know that the source of your anger is the fear of
what might happen to you or what this might say about your
abilities to manage a project. You no longer are in control of
the circumstance and this creates fear in you.

The next time you get angry ask the Lord what is the source of
that anger? Did the Lord allow that failure to let you see what
is "under your hood"? God has not given us a spirit of fear, but
of love, power, and a sound mind (see 2 Tim. 1:7). Give up your
rights to expectations that God never gave you. You will find a
new freedom in Christ you never knew you could have.
