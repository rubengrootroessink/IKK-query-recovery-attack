Thirsting After God

..."Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit"....
- (2 Kings 2:9)


The first requirement to move in greater power and authority in
God is to hunger for it. Yet even this hunger is born from God.
Elisha hungered after God. Elisha saw many miracles as Elijah's
servant. But he wanted more. He wanted a double portion of
Elijah's spirit. When he asked Elijah for this, the prophet
responded, "You have asked a difficult thing." It wasn't because
it couldn't be granted. Elijah knew that with great anointing
came a great weight of responsibility and difficulty.

Second, humility comes before honor. Elisha was known as the
"servant of Elijah." How would you like to be known as "the
servant of John"? Your name is not even mentioned. This was the
preparation of Elisha. It has been the preparation of many men of
God. Consider Joseph, the servant of Pharaoh. Consider David, the
servant of Saul.

Third, Elisha committed himself totally to his calling. The
Scripture says when Elisha was called to join Elijah, the younger
man left his farm business completely. He slaughtered his oxen
and had a great feast for the community. It was all or nothing.
He could not fall back on his farm trade if his new venture
didn't work. This demonstrates Elisha's pioneer spirit in
stepping out, not knowing what was ahead.

Do you want greater anointing in God? "You will seek Me and find
Me when you seek Me with all your heart. I will be found by you"
(Jer. 29:13-14a). Begin thirsting for God's anointing in your
heart today. This is the starting place.
