GOD'S MINISTRY OF DARKNESS

For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for
Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our
mortal flesh (2 Corinthians 4:11).

What is the point of troubled times in our lives? What is God
trying to do? What is He trying to teach us? Peter wrote,
"Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you,
which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange
thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the
sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also at the
revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exultation" (1
Peter 4:12, 13).

In God's ministry of testing, we learn a lot about ourselves.
Whatever is left of simplistic advice such as "Read your Bible"
or "Just work harder" or "Pray more" gets stripped away. Most
people going through testing times would love to resolve the
crisis, but they seemingly can't and don't know why.

In God's ministry of darkness we learn compassion. We learn to
wait patiently with people. We learn to respond to the emotional
needs of people who have lost hope. We weep with those who weep.
We don't try to teach or instruct or advise. If God took away
every external blessing and reduced our assets to nothing more
than meaningful relationships, would that be enough to sustain
us? Yes, I believe it would.

Perhaps God brings us to the end of our resources so we can
discover the vastness of His. We don't hear many sermons about
brokenness in our churches these days, yet in all four Gospels
Jesus taught us to deny ourselves, pick up our cross daily, and
follow Him. I don't know any painless way to die to ourselves,
but I do know that it's necessary and that it's the best possible
thing that could ever happen to us.

"No pain, no gain," says the body builder. Isn't that true in the
spiritual realm as well (Hebrews 12:11)? Proven character comes
from persevering through the tribulations of life (Romans 5:3-5).
Every great period of personal growth in my life and ministry has
been preceded by a major time of testing.

Lord, I submit to Your testing so I may come to the end of my
resources and joyfully discover Yours.
