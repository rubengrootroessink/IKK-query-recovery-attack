FACING A DECISION

Show me your ways, O LORD, teach me your paths (Psalm 25:4 NIV).

In today's and tomorrow's devotionals, I would like to share with
you 10 questions you'll want to ask yourself and pray about when
you're faced with a decision. The first five are generic. They
represent moral issues and godly wisdom that are normative for
all times.

  1 Have you prayed about it? Prayer was never intended to be a
    fourth-down punting situation in which we ask God to bail us
    out of our hasty decisions. It was intended to be a
    first-down huddle. We aren't supposed to ask God to bless our
    plans; we're supposed to ask God for His plans.

  2 Is it consistent with the Word of God? In our culture,
    ignorance of God's Word is no excuse since resources abound.
    I believe that every home should have at least a concordance,
    a Bible dictionary, a topical Bible, a good commentary, and a
    study Bible with notes. Most pastors would love to share what
    God has to say about a given matter. If they wouldn't, you
    have called the wrong pastor!

  3 Can I do it and be a positive Christian witness? A seminary
    student stopped by my office and told me about a job he had
    been offered. It would take care of his financial needs, but
    he had some reservations concerning the sales pitch he was
    required to use. I asked him if he could use the sales
    technique and be a positive witness for Christ. He didn't
    take the job.

  4 Will the Lord be glorified? Can I do this and give glory to
    God? In doing it, would I be glorifying God in my body? Am I
    seeking the glory of man or the glory of God? Am I doing this
    to be noticed by man or am I seeking to please the Lord?

  5 Am I acting responsibly? God doesn't bail us out of our
    irresponsibility. But when we are faithful in little things,
    He will put us in charge of greater things. Don't get ahead
    of God's timing or you will be over your head in
    responsibilities. Seek to develop your life and message, and
    God will expand your ministry.

Dear Lord, help me take a good, hard look at these questions and
then avoid at all costs any compromise with Your will in my life
today.
