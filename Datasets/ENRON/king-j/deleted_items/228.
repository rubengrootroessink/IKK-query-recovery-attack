Horizontal Versus Vertical

Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the
Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
- (Exodus 2:12)


Moses saw the pain of his people. He saw the bondage and the
injustice. His heart was enraged, and he decided he would do
something. He would take matters into his own hands. The result
was murder. The motive was right, but the action was wrong. He
went horizontal instead of vertical with God. The action was
wrong. Moses fled to the desert, where God prepared the man who
would ultimately be the deliverer of a nation. But it took 40
years of preparation before God determined Moses was ready. He
was a professional businessman-a sheepherder. It was during the
mundane activity of work that God called on him to be a
deliverer.

Moses was like a lot of enthusiastic Christian businesspeople who
seek to solve a spiritual problem with a fleshly answer. The
greatest danger to the Christian businessperson is his greatest
strength-his business acumen and expertise to get things done.
This self-reliance can become our greatest weakness when it comes
to moving in the spiritual realm. We're taught to be problem
solvers. But, like Moses, if our enthusiasm and passion are not
harnessed by the power of the Holy Spirit, we will fail
miserably. Peter had to learn this lesson too. His enthusiasm got
him into a lot of trouble. But God was patient, just as He is
patient with each of us. Sometimes He must put us in the desert
for a time in order to season us so that Christ is allowed to
reign supreme in the process.

Before you act, pray and seek the mind of Christ until you know
it is God behind the action. Check it out with others. You may
save yourself a trip to the desert.
