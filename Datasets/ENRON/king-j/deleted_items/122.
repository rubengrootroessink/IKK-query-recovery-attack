Dear Mr. King:

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to assist you today.  I have included the information to provide your network administrator in regards to your trouble with the Super StreamMachine.

Super StreamMachine uses a socket connection via the HTTP 1.0 protocol on port 80.  Upon initial connectivity we utilize standard HTTP headers to initiate the login and response.  It appears that there are certain caching engines that disallow this mechanism as they require all message packets to be HTTP 1.0 compliant. We do not send a full HTTP header on all messages and thus is being blocked by the cache engines.  You would either have to be able to get to our server directly without being routed through the cache engine or the cache engine tuned to allow non HTTP packet checking after the initial connection is generated.

Here is the IP address for Super StreamMachine:  204.107.120.3.  If your network administrator can check to see if this IP is being blocked by the cache server, this may be the answer to your problem.

If you have further concerns or inquiries, please reply to this message or call Client Services at (800) 669-3900 or (402) 970-5805.

Thank you for choosing Ameritrade!

Sincerely,

Josh Wells
