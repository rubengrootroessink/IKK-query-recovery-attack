Subject: I-45 speed limit


I received this today.  Knew it was going to happen.

Houston/Harris County has wasted little time complying with the new speed
limits imposed by the TNRCC. I learned last evening, from my husband, that
the stretch of I-45 between Hobby Airport and NASA Rd. 1 now has a speed
limit of 55 mph. Noontime yesterday, there were six police cars with people
pulled over along that stretch.

Let's be careful out there!
