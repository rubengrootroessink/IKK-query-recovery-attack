CHANGING DIRECTIONS

Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are God my Savior,
and my hope is in You all day long (Psalm 25:5 NIV).

The next five questions to ask yourself regarding God's will are
to help you when facing a change in direction.

  1 Is it reasonable? God expects us to think. His guidance may
    transcend human reasoning, but it never excludes it. God
    doesn't bypass our mind; He operates through it: "Brethren,
    do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be babes,
    but in your thinking be mature" (1 Corinthians 14:20). We are
    warned in Scripture not to put our mind in neutral. We are to
    think and practice what we know to be true (Philippians 4:8,
    9).

  2 Does a realistic opportunity exist? Closed doors are not
    meant to be knocked down. If you have a hopeless scheme, let
    it go. If it isn't God's timing, wait. If a realistic
    opportunity exists, and all the other factors are in
    agreement, then take the plunge. God may open a window of
    opportunity, but it will close if not taken advantage of. The
    faithless man asks, "What do I stand to lose if I do?" The
    faithful man asks, "What do I risk losing if I don't?"

  3 Are unbiased, spiritually sensitive associates in agreement?
    Be careful not to consult only those who will agree with you.
    Give your advisors permission to ask hard questions. Don't be
    afraid of "no" answers. If it isn't God's will, don't you
    want to know before you make the mistake of acting
    impulsively?

  4 Do I have a sanctified desire? Don't think that being in the
    will of God must always be an unpleasant task. The joy of the
    Lord should be our strength. I find my greatest joy in
    serving God and being in His will. But don't get the idea
    that if everything is wonderful, you must be in the will of
    God. Is this a desire to satisfy a lust of the flesh or a
    Spirit-filled desire to see God's kingdom established and
    people helped?

  5 Do I have a peace about it? This is an inner peace. Is the
    peace of God guarding your heart and mind?

If you have been able to answer yes to all 10 of these deciding
factors, what are you waiting for?

Thank You, Lord, that I can trust You with the details and
direction of my life today.
