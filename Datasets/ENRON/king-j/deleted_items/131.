BELIEVE IN GOD

Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to
God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those
who seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).

The life of Wilma Rudolph, the great Olympic sprinter, is a
remarkable story of faith. Wilma was born with health problems
that left her crippled. "Will I ever be able to run and play like
the other children?" Wilma asked her parents.

"Honey, you have to believe in God and never give up hope," they
responded. "If you believe, God will make it happen." Taking her
parents' counsel, she painfully struggled to walk. By the time
she was 12, to the delight and surprise of many, Wilma no longer
needed her braces. She went on to play basketball on her
championship high school team and win three gold medals in the
1960 Olympics.

When you hear inspiring stories of faith like Wilma Rudolph's, do
you sometimes wonder, "What could I accomplish if I took God at
His Word?" Faith is the foundational principle of the Christian
life. Believing who God is, what He says, what He has done, and
what He will do defines the kingdom of God.

Furthermore, faith is the essence of the Christian's day-to-day
activity. Paul wrote: "As you therefore have received Christ
Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him" (Colossians 2:6). How did you
receive Christ? By faith. How then are you to walk in Him? By
faith. In Scripture, walking refers to the way you conduct your
everyday life. Victorious Christian living and spiritual maturity
are determined by our belief in God.

We tend to think of faith as some kind of mystical quality which
belongs only in the realm of the spiritual. But everybody walks
by faith. It is the most basic operating principle of life. The
question is, in what or in whom do you believe? We are challenged
to believe in God and take His Word seriously.

Thank You, Lord, that Your Word stands forever in heaven. I can
trust in You and Your Word despite my changing feelings and
circumstances.
