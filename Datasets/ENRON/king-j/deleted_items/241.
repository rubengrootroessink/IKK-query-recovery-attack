SING AND MAKE MELODY

Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your
heart to the Lord (Ephesians 5:18, 19).

How pathetically unaware we are of the biblical prominence of
music in the spiritual realm. It is interesting to note that
whenever the evil spirit came upon King Saul, David (the heir
apparent to Israel's throne) would play his harp and the evil
spirit would depart (1 Samuel 16:23). When Elisha was about to
inquire of God, he said, "'Now bring me a minstrel.' And it came
about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came
upon him" (2 Kings 3:15). During the reign of David, more than
4000 musicians were assigned to sing in the temple night and day
(1 Chronicles 9:33; 23:5). It is the mark of Spirit-filled
Christians to sing and make melody in their hearts to the Lord
and speak to each other in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs
(Ephesians 5:18, 19).

On the other side of the truth lies the destructive power of
secular music. A former satanic high priest showed me numerous
symbols on popular record albums indicating commitment and
bondage to Satanism. He told me that about 85 percent of today's
heavy metal and punk music groups are "owned" by Satanists. They
have unwittingly sold themselves to Satanism in exchange for fame
and fortune. Few of these artists actually practice Satanism, but
most are hopelessly lost and lead others astray through the
godless message in their music.

God created sound and formed our bodies to respond to it. Our
ears pick up the sound around us and send a signal to the brain.
Some sounds irritate us; others soothe us. There is music that
makes you want to march and music that puts you to sleep. Even
without lyrics, music with harmony and order can affect the
nervous system positively while discord produces a negative
effect.

What role does music play in your life? Are you filling your mind
and home with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs? Or are you
allowing destructive secular music to rob you of your joy and
vitality in the Lord?

You are the God who sings over me, Lord. Thank You for the gift
of music and for the songs You give me in the night.
