Fruitful Suffering

..."It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my
suffering."
- (Genesis 41:52)


Joseph named his second son Ephraim. Ephraim was given to him
after he had been delivered from his suffering of 13 years.
Joseph said that he named him this because God had made him
fruitful in the land of his suffering. Ephraim means "twice
fruitful."

Joseph was fruitful in two instances. He was fruitful during his
time of adversity and in his prosperity. When God brings us into
a time of suffering, it can be a fruitful time. It's rare for us
to see the fruit during the suffering period. But know that the
roots are going deep into the spiritual soil of our soul because
of our pressing in to God during our time of suffering. This is
producing a work in our character that cannot be seen until it
finishes the process. Such was the case for Joseph.

It was not until several years after such a time of suffering
that I began to see the fruit of the trials that the Lord allowed
me to experience. How grateful I am to understand some of the
"why" that has led to a new life in Him that I would never have
had without this period.

Samson had great anointing but lacked character. We see many
today who have great anointing yet lack character. But God is
raising up Josephs who not only have great anointing for these
days but also great character. Suffering produces character.

If you find yourself in a time of suffering, now is the time to
press into God. Let your roots grow deeper. Whenever there is a
famine, tree roots are forced to drive deeper into the soil to
find water. These times are designed to create such a deep-rooted
faith that our natures will be changed forever.
