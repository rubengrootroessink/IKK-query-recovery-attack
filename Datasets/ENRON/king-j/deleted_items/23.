OUR TRANSFER

He delivered us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us
to the kingdom of His beloved Son (Colossians 1:13).

Perhaps you have heard the illustration of the two dogs. Some
people say that we have two natures within us vying for control
of our lives. They claim that our old sin nature, which we
inherited from disobedient Adam, is like a big black dog. Our new
nature, which we inherited through Christ's redemptive work, is
like a big white dog. These two dogs are bitter enemies, intent
on destroying each other. Whenever you involve yourself in
worldly thoughts or behavior, you are feeding the black dog.
Whenever you focus your mind and activities on spiritual things,
you are feeding the white dog. The dog you feed the most will
eventually grow stronger and overpower the other.

This dramatic illustration may motivate Christians toward saintly
behavior, but is it accurate based on who we really are in
Christ? Since God "delivered us from the domain of darkness and
transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son" (Colossians
1:13), can we still be in both kingdoms? When God declares that
we are "not in the flesh but in the Spirit" (Romans 8:9), can we
be in the flesh and in the Spirit simultaneously? When God says
that "you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the
Lord" (Ephesians 5:8), can you possibly be both light and
darkness? When God states that "if any man is in Christ, he is a
new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have
come" (2 Corinthians 5:17), can we be partly new creature and
partly old creature?

But be careful. Can a Christian sin? Of course! "If we say that
we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not
in us" (1 John 1:8). But having sin and being sin are two
completely different issues. When we choose to walk by the flesh
we will sin, but, as 1 John 2:1 reminds us, we don't have to: "My
little children, I am writing these things to you that you may
not sin."

We will spend the next few days exploring the scriptural bases
for this truth.

How liberating to know today, Lord, that I am in the light, that
I am a new creature, and that my new nature is firmly anchored in
Your work of reconciliation.
