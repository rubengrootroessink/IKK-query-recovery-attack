THE EFFECTS OF THE FALL

Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because
all sinned (Romans 5:12).

Unfortunately, the idyllic setting in the Garden of Eden was
shattered. Genesis 3 tells the sad story of Adam and Eve's lost
relationship with God through sin. The effects of man's fall were
dramatic, immediate and far-reaching, infecting every subsequent
member of the human race.

What happened to Adam and Eve spiritually because of the Fall?
They died. Their union with God was severed and they were
separated from God. God had specifically said: "You must not eat
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat
of it you will surely die" (Genesis 2:17 NIV). They ate and they
died.

Did they die physically? No. The process of physical death was
set in motion, but they were alive physically for several hundred
more years. They died spiritually; their souls were separated
from God. They were banished from God's presence. They were cast
out of the Garden of Eden and guarding the entrance were cherubim
waving a flaming sword (Genesis 3:23, 24).

After Adam, everyone who comes into the world is born physically
alive but spiritually dead, separated from God. Paul wrote, "As
for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which
you used to live" (Ephesians 2:1 NIV).

How did Jesus remedy this problem? In two dramatic, life-changing
ways. First, He died on the cross to cure the disease that caused
us to die: sin. Romans 6:23 begins, "The wages of sin is death."
Then He rose from the dead to give us spiritual life. The verse
continues, "But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ
Jesus our Lord." Jesus Himself said, "I came that they might have
life" (John 10:10).

The bad news is that , as a child of Adam, you inherited
spiritual death. But the eternally good news is that, as a child
of God through faith in Christ, you will live forever because of
the life He has provided for you.

Thank You, heavenly Father, for sending Jesus to die on the cross
for my sins and then raising Him from the dead so I may have
life.
