SIGNS AND WONDERS

By this all men will know that you are My disciples if you have
love for one another (John 13:35).

Signs and wonders validated the ministry of Jesus and the
apostles. After quoting from the prophet Joel and demonstrating
that the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost was biblical,
Peter preached about Jesus of Nazareth as "a man attested to you
by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed
through Him in your midst" (Acts 2:22). Of the apostles, Paul
said, "the signs of a true apostle were performed among you with
all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles" (2
Corinthians 12:12).

However, signs and wonders would also accompany false teachers
and false prophets (Matthew 7:21-23; 2 Peter 2:1-22). In fact,
biblical references to signs and wonders in the last days are
nearly all credited to false teachers, false prophets and false
Christs (Matthew 24:11, 24). The false prophet in the tribulation
"deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which
it was given him to perform" (Revelation 13:14).

Jesus is no longer with us in the flesh and there are no more
apostles. Jesus identified the sign of a disciple as markedly
different: "By this all men will know that you are My disciples,
if you have love for one another" (John 13:35).

Does this mean that signs and wonders have ceased? I certainly
don't want to be identified with an evil generation that seeks
only after a sign, but I also don't want to be associated with
the powerless, anti-supernaturalism evidenced in Western
rationalism. Both the power of God and the wisdom of God are
expressed in Christ. Paul said, "For indeed Jews ask for signs,
and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to
Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those
who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God
and the wisdom of God" (1 Corinthians 1:22-24).

Lord, reveal to me the true source of my spiritual experiences.
If they are not from You, I renounce them and command Satan to
leave my presence.
