Seeing the Works of God

Others went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the
mighty waters. They saw the works of the Lord....
- (Psalms 107:23-24)


When you were a child, perhaps you may have gone to the ocean for
a vacation. I recall wading out until the waves began crashing on
my knees. As long as I could stand firm, the waves were of no
concern to me. However, as I moved farther and farther into the
ocean, I had less control over my ability to stand. Sometimes the
current was so strong it moved me down the beach, and I even lost
my bearings at times. But I have never gone so far into the ocean
that I was not able to control the situation.

Sometimes God takes us into such deep waters that we lose control
of the situation, and we have no choice but to fully trust in His
care for us. This is doing business in great waters. It is in
these great waters that we see the works of God.

The Scriptures tell us that the disciples testified of what they
saw and heard. It was the power behind the gospel, not the words
themselves, that changed the world. The power wasn't seen until
circumstances got to the point that there were no alternatives
but God. Sometimes God has to take us into the deep water in
order to give us the privilege to see His works.

Sometimes God takes us into the deep waters of life for an
extended time. Joseph was taken into deep waters of adversity for
17 years. Rejection by his brothers, enslavement to Pharaoh, and
imprisonment were the deep waters for Joseph. During those deep
waters, he experienced dreams, a special anointing of his gifts
to administrate, and great wisdom beyond his years. The deep
water was preparation for a task that was so great he never could
have imagined it. He was to see God's works more clearly than
anyone in his generation. God had too much at stake for a
30-year-old to mess it up. So, God took Joseph through the deep
waters of preparation to ensure that he would survive what he was
about to face. Pride normally engulfs such young servants who
have such access to power at such a young age.

If God chooses to take us into deep waters, it is for a reason.
The greater the calling, the deeper the water. Trust in His
knowledge that your deep waters are preparation to see the works
of God in your life.
