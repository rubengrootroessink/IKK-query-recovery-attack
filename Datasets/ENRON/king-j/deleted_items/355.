             from Freedom in Christ Ministries


Having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace
(Ephesians 6:15).

The next piece of armor is the shoes of peace. When you receive
Christ, you are united with the Prince of Peace. You have peace
with God right now (Romans 5:1), but the peace of Christ must
also rule in your heart if you are going to live victoriously,
and that is possible only when you let the Word of Christ richly
dwell in you (Colossians 3:15, 16).

The shoes of peace become protection against the divisive schemes
of the devil when you act as a peacemaker among believers (Romans
14:19). Peacemakers bring people together by promoting fellowship
and reconciliation. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall
be called sons of God" (Matthew 5:9). Anyone can divide a
fellowship, but it takes the grace of God to unite us in Him.

Too many Christians insist on common doctrine as the basis for
fellowship. They reason that if we don't think the same and
believe the same, there is no basis for peace. But common
doctrine isn't the basis for fellowship; common heritage is.
We're all children of God. If you wait to fellowship with someone
until you agree perfectly on every point of doctrine, you'll be
the loneliest Christian on earth. Instead of insisting on the
unity of the mind, preserve the unity of the Spirit by taking the
initiative to be the peacemaker in your relationships (Ephesians
4:3).

Some people like to play the devil's advocate in their
relationships and churches. I ask, Why? He doesn't need any help!
In His high priestly prayer, Jesus prayed, "I in them, and Thou
in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, that the world may
know that Thou didst send Me" (John 17:23). We have the promise
that "the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet"
(Romans 16:20). Ask God to use you to bring unity to your
relationships by making you a peacemaker.

Heavenly Father, use me today to bring unity to Your family.
Enable me to be a peacemaker.
