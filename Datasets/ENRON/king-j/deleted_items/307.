THE SIGNIFICANT DOMINION

Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let
them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky
and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creeps on the earth (Genesis 1:26).

In the original creation, Adam didn't search for significance; he
was significant. He was given rule over all His creatures. Was
Satan on the scene at creation? Yes. Was he the god of this world
at that time? Not at all. Who had the dominion in the garden?
Under the authority of God, Adam did, that is until Satan usurped
his dominion when Adam and Eve fell. That's when Satan became the
god of this world.

Do you realize that the significant dominion Adam exercised
before the Fall has been restored to you as a Christian? That's
part of your inheritance in Christ. Satan has no authority over
you, even though he will try to deceive you into believing that
he has. Because of your position in Christ, you have authority
over him. You are seated with Christ in the heavenlies (Ephesians
2:6).

First John 3:8 says, "The Son of God appeared for this purpose,
that He might destroy the works of the devil." The whole plan of
God is to restore fallen humanity and establish the kingdom of
God where Satan now reigns. This work of God is not just for our
personal victory but for all of creation. "For the anxious
longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the
sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not of
its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that
the creation itself will also be set free from its slavery to
corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God"
(Romans 8:19-21).

Thank You, Lord, that I am part of Your redemptive plan. Show me
my responsibility so I may live a life of purpose.
