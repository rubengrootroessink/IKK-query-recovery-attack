Jeff
 
Here's my resume.  Im gonna try to push the  TXU thing by making some calls.
If you can send it to someone there too that would  be great, the more angles the 
better.  Id certainly appreciate any help you  can give me.  I also meant to ask you,
i don't know if we mentioned Calpine on the phone,  thats one thats in town, but i dont
really have a contact.
 
 
Thanks for the help.
 
Matt
