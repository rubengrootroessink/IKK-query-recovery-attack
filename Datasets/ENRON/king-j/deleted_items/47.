January 30

THE DEFINITION OF DISCIPLESHIP

Encourage one another, and build up one another, just as you also
are doing (1 Thessalonians 5:11).

Jesus' primary call to His disciples is seen in His words "Come
to Me" (Matthew 11:28) and "Follow Me" (Matthew 4:19). Mark
records: "He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him, and
that He might send them out to preach, and to have authority to
cast out the demons" (Mark 3:14, 15). Notice that Jesus'
relationship with His disciples preceded His assignment to them.
Discipleship is the intensely personal activity of two or more
persons helping each other experience a growing relationship with
God. Discipleship is being before doing, maturity before
ministry, character before career.

Every Christian, including you, is both a disciple and a
discipler in the context of his Christian relationships. You have
the awesome privilege and responsibility both to be a teacher and
a learner of what it means to be in Christ, walk in the spirit
and live by faith. You may have a role in your family, church or
Christian community which gives you specific responsibility for
discipling others, such as husband/father, pastor, Sunday school
teacher, discipleship group leader, etc. But even as an appointed
discipler, you are never not a disciple who is learning and
growing in Christ through your relationships. Conversely, you may
not have an "official" responsibility to disciple anyone, but you
are never not a discipler. You have the opportunity to help your
children, your friend, and other believers grow in Christ through
your caring and committed relationship with them.

Similarly, every Christian is both a counselor and counselee in
the context of his Christian relationships. A good counselor
should be a good discipler, and a good discipler should be a good
counselor. Biblically, they are the same role. Your level of
maturity may dictate that you do a lot of Christian counseling.
But there will still be times when you need to seek or receive
the counsel of other Christians. There will never be a day when
we don't need each other.

Father, help me remember that I will never be so mature that I
need not receive godly counsel from my brothers and sisters in
Christ.
