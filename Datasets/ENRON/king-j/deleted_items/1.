THE ESSENCE OF TEMPTATION

For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our
weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are,
yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15).

I have found that many Christians struggle with the distinction
between temptation and sin. Bombarded by tempting thoughts, they
conclude that there must be something pretty sick about them. But
even Jesus was "tempted in all things as we are." But finish the
verse: "Yet without sin." As long as we are in the world, we are
exposed to temptation just like Jesus was. But He didn't sin, and
we don't have to sin either (1 Corinthians 10:13).

The basis for temptation is legitimate human needs. We will
either look to the world, the flesh and the devil to have our
needs met, or we will look to Christ who promises to meet our
needs (Philippians 4:19). The essence of temptation is the
invitation to live independently of God.

The power of temptation depends on the strength of the
strongholds which have been developed in our minds as we learned
to live independently of God. If you were raised in a Christian
home where magazines and television programs of questionable
moral value were not allowed, the power of sexual temptation in
your life will not be as great as for someone who grew up exposed
to pornographic materials. Why? Because your legitimate need to
be loved and accepted was met by parents who also protected you
from exposure to illegitimate means of meeting your needs. The
person who grew up in an environment of immorality may experience
a greater struggle with sexual temptation simply because that
stronghold in the mind was well-established before he was born
again.

Jesus was tempted to meet His own physical needs by using His
divine attributes independently of the Father to turn a rock into
bread. But instead He responded, "Man shall not live on bread
alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God"
(Matthew 4:4). We also must respond to temptation by relying on
God to meet our needs.

Dear Jesus, help me not to listen to the voice of the tempter
today but to run to You as the source for meeting all my needs.
