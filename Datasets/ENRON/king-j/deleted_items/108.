DEAD TO SIN

Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God
in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal
body that you should obey its lusts (Romans 6:11, 12).

Sin is the condition into which all descendants of fallen Adam
are born (Romans 5:12). Sin is living our lives independently of
God. It's the result of being deceived by Satan to believe that
meaning and purpose in life may be achieved apart from a personal
relationship with, and obedience to, the Creator of life
(Deuteronomy 30:19, 20; 1 John 5:12). In the non-Christian, sin
permeates the old nature, dominates the old self, and perpetuates
the deeds of the flesh. Satan is at the heart of all sin (1 John
3:8). He deceives people into believing a lie and counsels them
to rebel against God.

When you received Christ you died to sin and its power to
dominate you was broken. Satan and sin have not died; they are
still strong and appealing. But you no longer have to sin because
you are dead to sin and alive to God in Christ (Romans 6:11). You
are not dead to sin because you consider it so; you consider it
so because it is so. In Christ you have already died to sin.

Paul goes on to say that we are not to use our bodies as
instruments of unrighteousness (verse 13). If we do, we allow sin
to rule in our mortal bodies. For example, it is virtually
impossible for someone to commit a sexual sin and not use his
body as an instrument of unrighteousness, allowing sin to rule.
Ask the Lord to reveal to your mind how you have wrongly used
your body, especially sexually. Renounce that wrong use and then
submit your body to God as a living sacrifice. It is your
responsibility not to let "sin reign in your mortal body that you
should obey its lusts" (Romans 6:12).

Loving Lord, I know that sin's power over me has been broken.
Help me live today in the light of that truth by renouncing sin
and submitting my body to You.
