THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD

Therefore, take up the full armor of God, that you may be able to
resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm
(Ephesians 6:13).

A primary element in our protection from Satan and evil is the
armor that God has provided for us and instructed us to put on in
Ephesians 6:13-17. When we put on the armor of God, we are really
putting on Christ (Romans 13:12-14). And when we put on Christ,
we take ourselves out of the realm of the flesh, where we are
vulnerable to attack, and we place ourselves within the dominion
of Christ, where the evil one cannot touch us. Satan has nothing
in Christ (John 14:30), and to the extent that we put on Christ,
the evil one cannot touch us (1 John 5:18). He can only touch
that which is on his own level. That's why we are commanded,
"Make no provision for the flesh" (Romans 13:14), meaning "Don't
live on Satan's level."

It would appear from the verb tenses in Ephesians 6;14, 15, that
three of the pieces of armor--belt, breastplate and shoes--are
already on you: "having girded . . ."; "having put on . . .";
having shod. . . ." These pieces of armor represent the elements
of your protection made possible when you receive Jesus Christ
and in which you are commanded to stand firm. The Greek tense of
"having" signifies that the action it refers to was completed
before we were commanded to stand firm. That's the logical way a
soldier would prepare for action: He would put on his belt,
breastplate and shoes before attempting to stand firm. Likewise,
we are to put on the full armor of God after having already put
on Christ.

When you read through Ephesians 6:10-20, you will notice the
emphasis on the active part we must play on behalf of our own
spiritual defense: "be strong" (verse 10); "put on" and "stand
firm" (verse 11); "take up," "be able," "resist," and "stand
firm" (verse 13); "stand firm" (verse 14); "taking up" (verse
16); "take" (verse 17)' "pray at all times" and "be on the alert"
(verse 18).

Over the next several days, we will consider each of the six
pieces of armor from Ephesians 6:13-17.

Teach me my responsibility in spiritual warfare, Lord, that I may
be strong in You and in the strength of Your might.
