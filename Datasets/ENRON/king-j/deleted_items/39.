When God Seems Far Away

Why, O Lord, do You stand far off? Why do You hide Yourself in
times of trouble?
- (Psalms 10:1)


One of the great mysteries of God is His ways. Some of His ways
almost appear to bring us into the most difficult places, as if
He were indifferent to our circumstances. It would appear that He
is turning His head from our sorrows. These events in our lives
have a particular objective to perform for us. That objective is
to bring us to the end of ourselves that we might discover the
treasure of darkness. "Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when
I looked for light, then came darkness" (Job 30:26).

When we are taken into these dark periods, we begin to see light
that we never knew existed. Our sensitivities become heightened
and our ability to see through spiritual eyes is illuminated.
Unless we are taken into these times, our souls never develop any
depth of character. We do not gain wisdom, only knowledge.
Knowledge is gained through understanding; wisdom is gained
through the experience of darkness.

After we go through these periods, we discover that God was, in
fact, with us throughout the entire time. It does not feel or
appear that He is there when we are in the midst of the dark
periods. However, He is there walking with us. He has told us
countless times that He will never leave us. However, when we are
in those dark periods, it does not feel like He is there because
He does not rescue us from the circumstances. He does this for
our benefit in order that we might become more like Jesus. Jesus
learned obedience from the things He suffered (see Heb. 5:8).
What does that say about how you and I will learn obedience?
Embrace the dark times and gain the wisdom that God intends for
you from these times.
