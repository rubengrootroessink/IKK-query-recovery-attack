Standing in the Gap

I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and
stand before Me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not
have to destroy it, but I found none.
- (Ezekiel 22:30)


The people of Israel fell into sin when they worshiped the golden
calf. It would not be the last time God's people would fall into
idol worship. They had forgotten the great things God had done
for them. This angered God so much that He was going to destroy
the whole nation. Only one thing changed God's mind in the
matter-Moses. Psalm 106:23 says, "...had not Moses, His chosen
one, stood in the breach before Him to keep His wrath from
destroying them." Moses was a man willing to stand in the gap,
sacrificially, for those who were not deserving of such
sacrifice. This sacrificial love by Moses is called for among His
people today.

The prophet Ezekiel described another situation in which God's
people fell into sin. God was ready to destroy the nation when He
spoke to Ezekiel, asking him if there is a man willing to stand
in the gap so that God would not have to destroy His people.

Judah was a man who stood in the gap on behalf of his younger
brother Benjamin. Joseph held his brother Simeon hostage as
insurance that the other brothers would bring Benjamin to Egypt.
Judah had a long history of a me-focused life, but in this
instance he came forward to stand in the gap for his younger
brother. He responded to the anguish of his father, Jacob, by
personally guaranteeing the safe return of both Simeon and
Benjamin. Judah's sacrifice was rewarded (see Gen. 42-43).

Just as Christ did, we are to be those who will stand in the gap
on behalf of others who are not aware of their own vulnerable
condition. It is a proactive sacrificial position. Who is God
calling you to stand in the gap for? Perhaps it is a mate;
perhaps it is a business associate who has not come to know the
Savior; perhaps it is a wayward child. Are you willing to become
the sacrificial offering to God to change His plans of judgment
because of your willingness to stand in their place? This is a
hard teaching. This is what Jesus did for each of us. When we
stand in the place of another, God moves because of our
willingness to stand on their behalf. If we don't, His plans will
go forward because He is a righteous and holy God who will honor
His own word, even if it means destruction. Are you willing to
stand in the breach of the wall for someone today? Perhaps you
are the only person who will stand on someone's behalf.
