UNDER SPIRITUAL ATTACK

The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall
away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons (1 Timothy 4:1).

A seminary student stopped by my office to tell me he was having
difficulty getting to school on time. What should have been a
five-minute drive lengthened to 45 minutes because a voice in his
mind kept telling him to turn at intersections. Not wanting to
disobey what he perceived to be the "still, small voice of God,"
he was treated to a tour of the city almost every morning.

A pastor's wife, desperately needing the comfort of the Holy
Spirit and desiring His leading, passively believed that whatever
entered her mind was from God. She soon found herself bound by
fear and plagued by condemning thoughts.

These examples underscore the wisdom of John Wesley's words: "Do
not hastily ascribe things to God. Do not easily suppose dreams,
voices, impressions, visions or revelations to be from God. They
may be from Him. They may be from nature. They may be from the
devil. Therefore, do not believe every spirit, but try the
spirits, whether they be from God" (Martin Wells Knapp,
Impressions, Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, 1984, p. 32).

In a survey of 1700 professing Christian teenagers, 70 percent
admitted to hearing voices, like there was a subconscious self
talking to them. I don't believe they are psychotic or paranoid
schizophrenic. There is a battle going on for their minds. I have
shared with many tormented people that they aren't going crazy
but are under spiritual attack. They usually respond, "Praise the
Lord, someone understands." It's freeing to know this truth,
because if there is a battle going on for our minds, we can win
that war.

Lord, today I choose to test the spirits and assume my
responsibility to think upon that which is true.
