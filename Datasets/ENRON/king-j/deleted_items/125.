Possessions of the Kingdom

But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward
they will come out with great possessions.
- (Genesis 15:14)


Whenever God brings you through a time of great adversity, you
can expect to come out of that experience with great possessions,
if you have been faithful through the trial. This is a universal
truth. Wisdom comes from obedience, not knowledge. When we have
been tested and proven, the reality of our faith results in
possessions from God that we would never receive if we had not
gone through those trials. These are precious in His sight and
should be valued greatly. Those who know you will be amazed at
the wisdom that comes from your mouth. It is one of those
mysteries of the gospel that only those who experience incredible
testing and hardship can explain.

God kept the people of Israel enslaved 400 years, but when the
time came to free them from the bondage of slavery, they came out
with great possessions. These physical possessions symbolize the
spiritual possessions we receive when we come out of being
enslaved to those things that have hindered us all our lives.
These possessions are to be shared with others so that they also
can know how they might become free.

What has God freed you from that allows you to share your
possessions with others? Share what God has done in your life
with someone you work with today. It may be the possession they
need most in their life.
