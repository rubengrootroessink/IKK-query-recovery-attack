Passing the Tests

The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to
one of your neighbors-to David.
- (1 Samuel 28:17)


When God anoints a person, a pattern of testing appears to take
place at specific times in the leader's life. God often takes
each leader through four major tests to determine if that person
will achieve God's ultimate call on his or her life. The person's
response to these tests is the deciding factor in whether they
can advance to the next level of responsibility in God's Kingdom.

Control-Control is one of the first tests. Saul spent most of his
time as king trying to prevent others from getting what he had.
Saul never got to the place with God in which he was a grateful
recipient of God's goodness to him. Saul was a religious
controller. This control led to disobedience and ultimately being
rejected by God because Saul no longer was a vessel God could
use.

Bitterness-Every major character in the Bible was hurt by another
person at one time or another. Jesus was hurt deeply when Judas,
a trusted follower, betrayed Him. Despite knowing this was going
to happen, Jesus responded by washing Judas' feet. Every anointed
leader will have a Judas experience at one time or another. God
watches us to see how we will respond to this test. Will we take
up an offense? Will we retaliate? It is one of the most difficult
tests to pass.

Power-Power is the opposite of servanthood. Jesus had all
authority in Heaven and earth, so satan tempted Jesus at the top
of the mountain to use His power to remove Himself from a
difficult circumstance. How will we use the power and influence
God has entrusted to us? Do we seek to gain more power? There is
a common phrase in the investment community, "He who has the gold
rules." Jesus modeled the opposite. He was the ultimate servant
leader.

Greed-This is a difficult one. Money has the ability to have
great influence for either good or bad. When it is a focus in our
life, it becomes a tool of destruction. When it is a by-product,
it can become a great blessing. Many leaders started out
well-only to be derailed once prosperity became a part of their
life. There are thousands who can blossom spiritually in
adversity; only a few can thrive spiritually under prosperity.

As leaders, we must be aware when we are being tested. You can be
confident that each one of these tests will be thrown your way if
God calls you for His purposes. Will you pass these tests? Ask
for God's grace today to walk through these tests victoriously.
