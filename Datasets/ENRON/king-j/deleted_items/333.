THE BELT OF TRUTH

Having girded your loins with truth (Ephesians 6:14).

The first piece of armor for the Christian warrior is the belt of
truth. Jesus said, "I am . . . the truth" (John 14:6). And
because Christ is in you, the truth is in you. However,
continuing to choose truth is not always easy. Since Satan's
primary weapon is the lie, your belt of truth (which holds the
other pieces of body armor in place) is continually being
attacked. If he can disable you in the area of truth, you become
as easy target for his other attacks.

You stand firm in the truth by relating everything you do to the
truth of God's Word. If a thought comes to mind which is not in
harmony with God's truth, dismiss it. If an opportunity comes
along to say or do something which compromises or conflicts with
truth, avoid it. Adopt a simple rule of behavior: If it's the
truth, I'm in; if it's not the truth, count me out.

When you learn to live in the truth on a daily basis, you will
grow to love the truth because you have nothing to hide. You
never have to cover up to God or anyone else; everything you do
is in the light. Furthermore, when you live in the truth you
dislodge the lies of Satan, the father of lies (John 8:44).
Remember that if Satan can deceive you into believing a lie, he
can control your life.

Jesus prayed, "I do not ask Thee to take them out of the world,
but to keep them from the evil one" (John 17:15). How? "Sanctify
them in the truth; Thy Word is truth" (verse 17). You will only
dislodge Satan's lies in the light of God's revelation, and not
by human reasoning or research.

The only thing a Christian ever has to admit to is the truth.
Walking in the light and speaking the truth in love may seem
threatening to some. But in reality truth is a liberating friend
and the only path to fellowship with God.

Forgive me, Lord, for entertaining lies and walking in darkness.
Give me courage to face the truth and to speak the truth in love.
