The Famine That Leads to Freedom

Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not
die.
- (Genesis 42:2)


F. B. Meyer in his book, The Life of Joseph, describes a time in
the life of the 12 sons of Jacob in which they were driven from
their lives of self-satisfaction to an unlikely place to save
their lives. Many years earlier they had thrown their youngest
brother into a pit, then sold him into slavery. Thirteen years
later he became the second most powerful person in Egypt. Now the
world was experiencing a famine, and Joseph controlled all the
stored grain of Egypt.

As long as the hills were green and the pastures clothed with
flocks, as long as the valleys were covered over with corn and
rang with the songs of reapers, Reuben, Simeon, and the rest of
them would have been unconcerned and content. But when the mighty
famine came, the hearts of these men were opened to conviction.
Their carnal security was shattered. They were being prepared for
certain spiritual experiences they would never have dreamed. And
they were being prepared for the meeting with Joseph. This is how
God deals with us; He breaks up our nest, He loosens our roots,
He sends a mighty famine that cuts away the whole staff of bread.
Then, at such times, weary, worn, and sad, we are prepared to
confess our sins and receive the words of Christ when He says,
"Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give
you rest" (Mt. 11:28).

A missionary once said, "There is a place where we will all be
obedient." Joseph was a type of Christ in the Old Testament. The
famine was an event designed to bring the brothers to repentance
and a saving knowledge, physically and spiritually. It created
the circumstances that led to freedom for these men. For they had
been in bondage to a wicked crime against their brother for many
years. It was the forgiveness from Joseph that led to that
freedom.

Is your life passing through a time of famine? Are your supplies
limited? Is God leading you into directions that you would not
normally seek? Perhaps this is God's hand creating circumstances
for His purposes. Now is the time to look attentively as He
directs you to unlikely sources.
