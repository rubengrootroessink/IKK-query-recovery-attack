The estate has been working with traders in order to validate curves.    We are also talking with brokers and reviewing Megawatt Daily archives.
Can I get some curve information from the Ercot team?   

  I have three specific dates to verify:  11/30, 12/3 and 12/30.
We are validating the marks for the daily, balmo, the prompt month and the cals.on the above mentioned dates.

Do you have this information?

I have talked to Peggy at APB.  She is willing to pass on info on the dailies,  but the historical data is something they want us to pay for.  I dont really need help with the daily stuff,  just the dates listed above.

I would appreciate any help that you can give,
