The Purpose of Crucibles

The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord
tests the heart.
- (Proverbs 17:3)


This proverb describes one of God's strangest mysteries. It is a
description of God's formula to refine the human heart in order
to bring out its finest qualities. The significant leaders who
make the greatest mark for the Kingdom had to experience their
own crucible and fire. Without it, the dross can never be removed
from the human heart. Without it, the encumbrances weigh us down.
God understands the human heart. He understands that for us to
become all that He hopes for us, there are seasons of fire.
Joseph went through many tests. Succeeding in the test qualified
him for greater responsibility. The greater the use in the
Kingdom the greater the crucible to prepare the right foundation.
Some of God's greatest crucibles are found in the marketplace
where we live every day: the employee who betrays our trust, the
client who refuses to pay, the vendor who falls short of our
expectations.

Each of these is God's tests to find out how we will respond.
What tests are being brought your way today? His grace has been
provided that we might pass the tests that He brings before us.
Should we fail, we need not fear. His grace is sufficient for
this as well. Ask God for the grace to walk with Him in whatever
tests He has placed before you this day. He is able to accomplish
what He wants for you.
