THE WILL OF GOD

If any man is willing to do His will, he shall know of the
teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself
(John 7:17).

Knowing the will of God is not just a twentieth-century problem.
People were struggling at the time of Christ. Some people were
saying of Him, "He's a good man." Others were saying, "He leads
the multitude astray" (see John 7:12). How could these people
know whether He was leading them into truth?

Seizing the opportunity, Jesus set forth standards of divine
guidance. His first admonition was, "My teaching is not Mine, but
His who sent Me. If any man is willing to do His will, he shall
know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak
from Myself" (John 7:16, 17). The essential prerequisite to know
the will of God, according to Jesus, is a willingness to do it.

What is the will of God? God's will for those who believe in Him
is to be alive in Christ for the purpose of establishing His
kingdom by overcoming the evil one and becoming fully the people
He has called us to be. Notice the opening words of the Lord's
Prayer: "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy
kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven"
(Matthew 6:9, 10). When praying this prayer, we are asking for
God's will to be accomplished on earth as it presently is in
heaven. Apparently God's will is being perfectly executed in
heaven but not on earth.

Are you totally committed to do God's will without knowing for
sure what it is? Do you hold any reservations about turning your
will over to God? Do you really believe that God's will for you
is good, acceptable and perfect (Romans 12:2)? If God is God and
you call Him Lord, doesn't He have the right to exercise His will
in your life?

Father, may Your will be accomplished in my thoughts, words and
deeds today as it is being accomplished in heaven.
