Godly Rewards

You have said, "It is futile to serve God. What did we gain by
carrying out His requirements and going about like mourners
before the Lord Almighty? But now we call the arrogant blessed.
Certainly the evildoers prosper, and even those who challenge God
escape."
- (Malachi 3:14-15)


Have you ever felt that serving God had little reward and the
ungodly seemed actually to be more blessed than you? This is what
the people of God felt. God heard their cry and responded through
the prophet Malachi to explain God's view on this matter.

Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, and the
Lord listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in
His presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored His
name. "They will be Mine," says the Lord Almighty, "in the day
when I make up My treasured possession. I will spare them, just
as in compassion a man spares his son who serves him. And you
will again see the distinction between the righteous and the
wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not"
(Malachi 3:16-18).

Notice that after the people complained about this, they began to
talk to each other, and the Lord listened and heard. God had been
taking note of those who were serving Him and honoring Him. There
is a day coming in which God will honor His "treasured
possessions." We will see that there is a distinction between the
righteous and the wicked on that day when "the sun of
righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will
go out and leap like calves released from the stall" (Mal. 4:2).
What a beautiful picture of what we will feel like on that day.

Faithful obedience is rewarded by God. It often requires
patience, suffering, and perseverance. Be of good cheer; He will
reward you if you faint not.
