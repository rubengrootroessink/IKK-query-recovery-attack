Impossible Tasks

But He answered, "You give them something to eat."
- (Mark 6:37)


Has anyone ever asked you to do something that seems totally
ridiculous? The very suggestion of their instruction may have
brought laughter or even anger for proposing the idea.

I imagine that the disciples may have felt this way when Jesus
responded with this comment when they asked him how they were
going to feed the 5000 who stayed around to hear him speak. The
disciples suggested a logical answer to the problem, "Send the
people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and
villages and buy themselves something to eat" (Mk 6:36).

That wasn't the answer Jesus wanted. He saw the need of the
people. He had compassion on them. He wanted to solve the problem
with a Kingdom response, not logic. He asked them what they had
in their hand.

So often what we already have in our hand is what Jesus wants us
to use to solve our problems. We must add faith to what we
already have in our hand. Then we will see the gospel of the
Kingdom manifested to solve problems in a supernatural way. Jesus
wanted to meet a need in which God would receive the glory.
Sending the people away did not meet the need, nor did it bring
glory to the Father.

Do not settle for the gospel of salvation only. Jesus came that
we might experience the gospel of the Kingdom in its fullest
sense. Our job is to look past our logical reasoning and see how
God might want to solve our problem in a supernatural way.
