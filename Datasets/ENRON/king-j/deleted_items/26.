John,

Those are 3 dates that i don't have.  I would have to go to the brokers.  Let me know if you need to do that.

The estate has been working with traders in order to validate curves.    We are also talking with brokers and reviewing Megawatt Daily archives.
Can I get some curve information from the Ercot team?   

  I have three specific dates to verify:  11/30, 12/3 and 12/30.
We are validating the marks for the daily, balmo, the prompt month and the cals.on the above mentioned dates.

Do you have this information?

I have talked to Peggy at APB.  She is willing to pass on info on the dailies,  but the historical data is something they want us to pay for.  I dont really need help with the daily stuff,  just the dates listed above.

I would appreciate any help that you can give,

JForney
