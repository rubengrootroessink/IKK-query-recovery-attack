A Man Who Has God's Favor

"...Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with
you."
- (Zechariah 8:23)


Few men of God have become extraordinary people of faith without
the influence of mentors. A mentor is one who takes
responsibility for the spiritual and, sometimes, physical care of
another. It requires a commitment from the teacher and the
student.

Elijah mentored Elisha. Elisha became one of the greatest
prophets in all the Bible. One of the primary reasons for this
was Elisha's hunger. Elisha wanted a double portion of Elijah's
spirit. It was this hunger that drove Elisha to be sold out to
God's purposes for his life.

I have been privileged to have had many mentors throughout my
spiritual life. In each stage of my maturity, God brought new
mentors who had unique gifts that the previous mentor did not
have. God has given me the hunger to desire a double portion of
those positive attributes of my mentors. This desire is sorely
missing among many today. I fail to see the hunger among many who
could be used greatly in the Kingdom. Instead, they get
distracted by the cares of this world. It is an attitude of a la
carte versus an attitude of pressing in to the full measure of
what God might have for them.

Who are the people of God He has placed in your life? Are you
learning from them? Are you seeking a double portion of their
anointing? What prevents you from gaining from their wisdom and
experience? God may have brought them into your life to prepare
you to be a man or woman of God with great anointing. However,
there is a time of training and waiting to prove out your own
faith. Ask God today if there is someone He would have you mentor
or be mentored by.
