LORD, TOUCH ME

Then again He laid His hands upon his eyes; and he looked
intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly
(Mark 8:25).

One of the greatest personal crises I have faced in the ministry
revolved around the issue of forgiveness and a board member. I
struggled relating to this man, and I knew that I couldn't
continue on the way things were. So I decided to resign my
pastorate.

The week before I was going to read my resignation to the
congregation, I got sick. I was flat on my back with a
temperature of 103.5 and I totally lost my voice. It was easy to
recognize that God wasn't pleased with my decision. I began
reading the Gospels and came upon Mark 8:22-26 where Jesus healed
the blind man. I noticed that after Jesus' first touch, the man
said, "I see men . . . like trees" (verse 24). I suddenly
realized that I saw this man like that: a big tree, an obstacle
blocking my path.

Then Jesus touched the blind man again and he began to see people
clearly, not as trees. I got the message. "Lord, I don't love
this man. I know You do, and I want to. But You will have to
touch me like You did that blind man. Lord, I need You to touch
me so I can be the person You want me to be." And God did! I
chose at that moment to forgive the man completely.

The next Sunday I went to church, not to resign, but to preach.
My voice was still so husky that I almost couldn't speak. I
confessed to the congregation my own independence and my desire
for the Lord to touch me, to see people as people, not as
obstacles to my goals. At the end of the sermon, I invited anyone
who desired a touch from the Lord to join me at the altar. Soon
the altar area and the aisles in the front were packed with
people. Eventually all but a few people had come forward. It was
a revival!

Guess who was one of the few? To my knowledge he never changed,
but I did. And I thank God to this day that He put me flat on my
back to make me the pastor He wanted me to be. If I had had my
way, I would probably be out of the ministry today.

Lord, touch me today that I may love the difficult people in my
life as You do.
