LIVING WITH SIN'S CONSEQUENCES

Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the
wrath of God, for it is written, "Vengeance is Mine, I will
repay," says the Lord (Romans 12:19).

Forgiveness does not mean that you must tolerate sin. Isabel, a
young wife and mother attending one of my conferences, told me of
her decision to forgive her mother for continually manipulating
her for attention. But Isabel tearfully continued, "She is no
different. Am I supposed to let her keep ruining my life?"

No, forgiving someone doesn't mean that you must be a doormat to
their continual sin. I encouraged Isabel to confront her mother
lovingly but firmly, and tell her that she would no longer
tolerate destructive manipulation. It's okay to forgive another's
past sins and, at the same time, take a stand against future
sins. Forgiving is not a co-dependent activity.

Forgiveness does not demand revenge or repayment for offenses
suffered. "You mean I'm just supposed to let them off the hook?"
you may argue. Yes, you let them off your hook, realizing that
they are not off God's hook. You may feel like exacting justice,
but you are not an impartial judge. God is the just Judge who
will make everything right (Romans 12:19). Your job is to extend
the mercy of forgiveness and leave judgment up to God.

Forgiveness is agreeing to live with the consequences of another
person's sin. Suppose that someone in your church says, "I have
gossiped about you. Will you forgiven me?" You can't retract
gossip any easier than you can put toothpaste back into the tube.
You're going to live with the gossip this person spread about you
no matter how you respond to the gossiper.

We are all living with the consequences of another person's sin:
Adam's. The only real choice we have in the matter is to live in
the bondage of bitterness or in the freedom of forgiveness.

Heavenly Father, I give up my right to seek revenge or harbor
resentment. I want to enjoy the freedom which comes from
forgiving others.
