First Fruits

All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are
sacred to the Lord and must go into His treasury.
- (Joshua 6:19)


One of the earliest examples of the practice of giving God the
first fruits of the increase was when Joshua and the people
entered the Promised Land for the first time. When they crossed
the Jordan River, their first battle was Jericho. God set a
precedent with this battle by instructing them not to take any
spoils from it. Unlike future battles, the fruits from this
victory were to go into the treasury as a remembrance of their
first victory in the Promised Land. In addition, the city of
Jericho was to be a lasting monument to God's faithfulness. God
instructed Joshua never to rebuild this city. If they or anyone
in the future attempted to rebuild the city, the life of the
firstborn would be required. Years later, Ahab attempted to
rebuild this city and his firstborn died as a result. God never
forgets to enforce His Word.

Is your work a lasting monument to the faithfulness of God in
your life? Is it bringing glory to the Father? Are you giving the
first fruits from your increase to God? God has encouraged us
through this story to give the first fruits of our work to Him so
that He will be glorified through our work. This is a tangible
way for us to acknowledge that God is the source of all blessing.
