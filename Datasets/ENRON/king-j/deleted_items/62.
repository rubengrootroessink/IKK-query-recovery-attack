Ability Versus Availability

His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor His delight
in the legs of a man; the Lord delights in those who fear Him,
who put their hope in His unfailing love.
- (Psalms 147:10-11)


Do you ever feel so skilled in what you do that you require
little help from others? Perhaps you may feel that you are more
skilled than any other in your field. Does God need your skills
and abilities in order to accomplish His purposes on this earth?
The answer is NO.

One thing God does not need is our skills and abilities. However,
He does give us the privilege to exercise our gifts and abilities
for His service. That service may be as a computer technician, a
secretary, an ironworker, or even a lawyer. God calls each of us
to our vocations to work unto Him. To believe that He needs our
skills to accomplish His mission on earth would be to lower our
understanding of an all-encompassing and all-powerful God. The
psalmist tells us that His pleasure is not in our strength and
ability, but His pleasure is in the attitude of the heart. It is
what we find in the heart that helps determine whether ability is
translated into availability. You see, God is looking to and fro
throughout the earth for a man or woman who is fully committed to
Him. A man or woman who is committed to fearing the Lord and
placing his hope in His unfailing love is the person God seeks to
support. "For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to
strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him" (2
Chron. 16:9a). When our agenda becomes His agenda, we can expect
God to fully support all that we do.

If we want to see our skills and abilities multiplied a
hundredfold, then we must make them completely available to His
service. Where are the opportunities in which God is calling you
to be available to Him? Next time someone asks you to be involved
in some activity, before you say yea or nay, make sure you check
in with the Master of our decisions to ensure that your gifts and
talents are being used as He desires.
