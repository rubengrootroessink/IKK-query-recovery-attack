THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

Having put on the breastplate of righteousness . . . (Ephesians
6:14).

The second piece of armor God has provided for us is the
breastplate of righteousness. When you put on Christ at
salvation, you are justified before our holy God. It's not your
righteousness but Christ's (1 Corinthians 1:30; Philippians 3:8,
9). So when Satan aims an arrow at you by saying, "You're not
good enough to be a Christian," you can respond with Paul, "Who
will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who
justifies" (Romans 8:33). Your righteousness in Christ is your
protection against Satan's accusations.

Even though we rejoice in our position of righteousness in
Christ, we are well aware of our deeds of unrighteousness when we
think, say, or do something apart from God. Standing firm in our
righteousness requires us to live in continuous agreement with
God according to 1 John 1:9: "If we confess our sins, He is
faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness." Confession is different from saying
"I'm sorry" or asking forgiveness. To confess (homologeo) means
to acknowledge or to agree. You confess your sin when you say
what God says about it: "I entertained a lustful thought and
that's a sin"; "I treated my spouse unkindly this morning and
that was wrong"; "Pride motivated me to seek that board position
and pride doesn't belong in my life."

Satan will make confession as difficult for you as he can. He
will try to convince you that it's too late for confession, that
God has already erased your name out of the book of life. That's
another one of his lies. You're in Christ; you're already
forgiven. You are the righteousness of God in Christ (2
Corinthians 5:21), and He will never leave you. Your confession
of sin clears the way for the fruitful expression of
righteousness in your daily life. We should be like Paul, who
said, "I also do my best to maintain always a blameless
conscience both before God and before men" (Acts 24:16).

Lord, I put on the breastplate of righteousness today and seek to
maintain a blameless conscience before You and the people around
me.
