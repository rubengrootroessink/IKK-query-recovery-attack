THE BONDAGE BREAKER

If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free
indeed (John 8:36).

The contrast between bondage and freedom in a believer's life is
beautifully illustrated in the following letter from a successful
professional man.

    Dear Neil:

    My emotional troubles were probably rooted in my childhood
    experiences with horror movies, Ouija boards, etc. I clearly
    remember fearing a visit from devilish forces after I saw the
    movie titled The Blood of Dracula.

    My father had a pretty hot temper and was given to emotional
    outbursts. My survival response was to sulk and blame myself
    for upsetting him. Bottling my emotions inside became a way
    of life. As I grew into adulthood, I continued to blame
    myself for any and all personal shortcomings and misfortunes.

    Then I accepted Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. I grew
    spiritually over the next several years, but I never enjoyed
    complete peace. There was always a lingering doubt about my
    relationship with God whom I saw as distant and stern. I had
    difficulty praying, reading the Bible and paying attention to
    the pastor's sermons. I seriously questioned the purpose of
    life. I experienced horrible nightmares which woke me up
    screaming.

    It was during my time of prayer with you that I finally found
    freedom in Christ. Now when I read God's Word, I understand
    it like never before. I have developed a more positive
    attitude, and my entire relationship with my Lord has
    completely changed. Since our meeting, I haven't had one
    nightmare.

I'm not saying that every spiritual problem is the result of
direct demonic activity. But you may be in bondage because you
have overlooked or denied the reality of demonic powers at work
in the world. Your inheritance in Christ is the basis for your
complete freedom promised in Scripture.

Help me not to be a spiritual ostrich today, but to be alert to
my enemy's tactics and to Your truth.
