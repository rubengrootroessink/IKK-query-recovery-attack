IDENTIFYING A CHRISTIAN LEADER

There will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly
introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who
bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves (2 Peter
2:1).

What comes to mind when you hear the terms false prophets and
false teachers? Many people tend to thing of Eastern mystics and
gurus, the spokespersons for nonbiblical religions or dynamic
cult leaders--people who are recognizably outside the boundaries
of the Christian church. But the apostle Peter devoted an entire
chapter in one of his letters (2 Peter 2) to false prophets and
teachers who operate within the church. False teachers may
operate in our churches disguised as workers of righteousness.

Notice that the lure of false teachers is not primarily their
doctrine: "And many will follow their sensuality, and because of
them the way of the truth will be maligned" (verse 2). What does
Peter mean by "follow their sensuality"? He is talking about
Christians who evaluate a ministry based on the outward
appearance and charm of its leaders. We say, "He's such a nice
guy"; "She's a very charismatic person"; "He's a real dynamic
speaker"; "She's so sweet and sounds so sincere." But is physical
attractiveness or a syrupy personality a biblical criterion for
validating a ministry or a teacher? Of course not! The issue is
always truth and righteousness. A Christian leader should be
identified by his commitment to the truth, his righteous life and
his servant's heart.

Dear God, keep me from playing to the grandstand; I want only to
live for You. Keep me accountable as a person of truth,
righteousness, and love, ever fearful of discrediting Your name.
