Seeing a Greater Purpose in Adversity

But Paul shouted,"Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"
- (Acts 16:28)


Paul and Silas had just been thrown into prison. An earthquake
erupted and the jail cell was opened. It's Paul and Silas'
opportunity. "Deliverance! Praise God!" might be the appropriate
response. But this is not what Paul and Silas did. In fact,
rather than leave, they sat quietly in their cell area. The
guard, in fear of his life, knew that it would be automatic death
if prisoners escaped. Paul and Silas did not leave because they
saw a higher purpose for which they were in prison. They were not
looking at their circumstance; they were much more concerned
about the unsaved guard. The story goes on to explain how Paul
and Silas went home with the guard and his family. Not only did
the guard get saved, but his entire household as well.

What a lesson this is for us. How often we are so busy looking
for deliverance from our circumstance that we miss God
completely. God is looking to do miracles in our circumstances if
we will only look for them. Sometimes as businesspeople we become
so obsessed with our goals we miss the process that God involves
us in, which may be where the miracle lies. What if that bill
collector who has been hounding you is unsaved and he is there
for you to speak to? What if a problem account has arisen due to
something God is doing beyond what you might see at this time?
Our adverse situations can often be the door of spiritual
opportunity for those who need it.

I saw this personally when God allowed me to go through a number
of adversities. It took some time, but I saw some great miracles
as a result of those adversities. When God said that "all things
work together for good for those who are called according to His
purposes" (see Rom. 8:28), He meant all things. It is up to us to
find the "work together for good" part by being faithful to the
process. In the next adversity you face, tune your spiritual
antennae and ask God for discernment to see the real purpose for
the adversity.
