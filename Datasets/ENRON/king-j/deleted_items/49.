cannot be considered independent. We will benefit from any
increase in share price of the advertised company. We will
sell our shares at any time, without notice, be that
before, during or immediately after the release of this

negative impact on the securities of the company
liquidated, including decreased market value and/or
dilution of the company's securities. Furthermore, our
associates and/or employees and/or principals may have
stock positions in advertised companies purchased in the
open market or in private transactions. These positions may
be liquidated, without prior notification, even after we
have made positive comments regarding the advertised

and/or projections mentioned are solely opinions and should
not be taken as suggested holding periods. In fact, we will
sell our positions in any companies advertised before they
reach such target prices. The receipt of this information
constitutes your acceptance of these terms and conditions.
Reading this advertisement shall not create under any
circumstances an offer to buy or sell stock in any company
advertised. Nor shall it create any principal-agent
relationship between the reader and us. The stocks of
advertised companies may trade in fast moving, highly
volatile markets, and any reader should observe the trading
behavior of any advertised company prior to investing.

1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Any statements that express or involve discussions
with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans,
projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future

looking statements are based on expectations, estimates and
projections at the time the statements are made that
involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could
cause actual results or events to differ materially from
those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements may
be identified through the use of words such as expects,
will, anticipates, estimates, believes, or by statements
indicating certain actions may, could or might occur. We
