An Encounter With God

So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no
strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.
- (Daniel 10:8)


Daniel received a vision that troubled him greatly. He wanted
understanding of this vision. He set himself out to understand
the vision by fasting for three weeks. Three days after his three
weeks of fasting, a messenger of God appeared to Daniel. The
messenger explained that Heaven had heard his prayer from the
first day, but the angel was temporarily prevented from coming by
the prince of Persia, a demon angel, who sought to thwart God's
messenger from coming to Daniel.

There are times in our lives when we must set ourselves to
seeking God with all our hearts. It is in these times that we
hear from Heaven in ways we may never have experienced before.
Daniel's perseverance in prayer was rewarded with a personal
encounter with Heaven. However, in order to receive from God,
Daniel had to be left alone, his strength removed, and be placed
in a helpless condition. When we have no ability in our own
strength to move Heaven or the events around us, we are in
position to hear from Heaven. It is the acknowledgment of our
humanity and our frailness that places us in a position to have a
personal encounter with the living God.

Do you need a personal encounter with God today? Do you need God
to intervene on your behalf? Seek Him with all your heart.
Demonstrate to Him you are serious. Get alone and acknowledge
your helpless condition before Him. He will reward you with His
presence.
