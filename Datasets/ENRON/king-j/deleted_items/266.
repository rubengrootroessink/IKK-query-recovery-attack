THE PEACE OF GOD

Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world
gives, do I give to you (John 14:27).

Peace on earth--that's what everybody wants. But nobody can
guarantee external peace because nobody can control other people
or circumstances. Nations sign and break peace treaties with
frightening regularity. Couples lament that there would be peace
in their home "if only he/she would shape up." No one can
guarantee peace at home or on the job site. However, we should
always strive to be peacemakers. Jesus said, "Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God" (Matthew 5:9).
Paul instructed, "If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at
peace with all men" (Romans 12:18).

But let's face it: Peace with others isn't always possible,
because peace doesn't just depend on us. Peace on earth is what
we want; peace with God is what we have; the peace of God is what
we need.

Peace with God is something you already have (Romans 5:1). It's
not something you strive for; it's something you received when
you were born again. The Prince of Peace reconciled you to God by
shedding His own blood.

The peace of God is something you need to appropriate daily in
your inner world in the midst of the storms which rage in the
external world (John 14:27). There are a lot of things that can
disrupt your external world because you can't control all your
circumstances and relationships. But you can control the inner
world of your thoughts by allowing the peace of Christ to rule in
your heart on a daily basis (Colossians 3:15). There may be chaos
all around you, but God is bigger than any storm. I keep a little
plaque on my desk which reminds me: "Nothing will happen to me
today that God and I cannot resolve."

The peace of Christ will rule in your heart when you "let the
word of Christ richly dwell within you" (Colossians 3:16). And
when you turn to Him in prayer, "the peace of God, which
surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your
minds in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:7).

Prince of Peace, rule in my heart today. Give me Your peace and
make me a peacemaker in all my relationships.
