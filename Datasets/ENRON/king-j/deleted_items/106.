Sweating Outcomes

In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to
eat-for He grants sleep to those He loves.
- (Psalms 127:2)


Coming into the Promised Land in business will change the way you
and I view our work. No longer will we see getting up early and
staying up late as God's way. Living in the Promised Land in
business means we know that God is the source of our provision
and that our work is an act of worship to Him. Provision is a
by-product, not an end in itself. Work is no longer something
that must be sweated and toiled upon to make ends meet. "Could
this really be true?" you might be saying. God has made it clear
that obedience is the assurance of provision. Whenever we go
beyond the normal workday due to fear of non-provision, we are
operating in unbelief. We are saying that it is up to us to make
things happen. Sure, there are times when we work longer hours
due to a deadline, but we must be sure the motive is not out of
fear of loss or fear of non-provision. If we are obedient to what
God has called us to, He will provide our every need. This can be
a hard lesson for goal-oriented businesspeople.

I recall coming into this understanding. I had been a workaholic.
Long hours were common. Then God shook up my world and I was
challenged by a friend to examine my motives for working long
hours. I realized the source of those long hours was fear. Once I
came into this understanding, I refused to work long hours even
though the natural man would tell me I'd never make things happen
if I worked a normal work week. Again, this reasoning is based on
a lack of faith. If we are obedient to what God has called each
of us to, we will not lack. At times it may be less than what we
might like; at other times it may be more than we deserve. These
are God's ways.

The Bible tells us to come out of Babylon. Babylon is a system of
work and philosophy that is contrary to God's ways. Are you
operating in any aspect of work from a Babylonian value system?
Ask the Lord to reveal this to you. Begin to walk in the freedom
He has given us in our work life.
