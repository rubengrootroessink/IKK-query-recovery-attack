Four Attributes of a Life God Blesses

So this is what the Sovereign Lord says: "See, I lay a stone in
Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure
foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed."
- (Isaiah 28:16)


Whenever God calls us into a consecrated life, it is made up of
four distinct stages. Christ often compared this process to
building a house. First, we must prepare to build by laying a
foundation. That foundation is none other than Jesus Christ
Himself. Any foundation other than Christ will not stand.

Second, as we enter a walk of faith with God, He allows each of
us to experience trials, testings, miracles, and challenges in
life that are designed to provide "faith experiences" that
demonstrate tangible evidences of His work in our life: Moses'
burning-bush experience, Peter's walk on the water, Joshua's
parting of the Jordan River. These experiences built the faith of
these people. The depth and width of our calling is directly
proportional to the faith experiences He allows in each of our
lives. If God plans an international ministry with you, chances
are you will experience a higher degree of faith experiences
compared to another. The reason is, you will need to look on
these to ensure your calling and provide testimony to His work in
your life.

The third stage deals with motives. "All a man's ways seem
innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord" (Prov.
16:2). What is the motive behind my actions? Is it only financial
accumulation? Is it to gain control? Is it to create
independence? The primary motive must be God's leading you to
take such an action-it must be obedience. These other factors
must be by-products of the decision.

Finally, we are prepared to take action. Here we must ask, "Do we
have the skill, quality, and ability to enter into this
activity?" So often we have not trained ourselves adequately to
be successful in our endeavor. You would never want someone
working on your teeth who had not been trained and certified as a
dentist.

Before you begin your next project, ask yourself these four
questions. What is the foundation this project is based on? What
experiences has God demonstrated in my life that indicate His
involvement? What is my motive for entering this activity? Do I
have the skill, quality, and ability to accomplish the task?
Answering these questions will tell you whether God will bless
your activity.
