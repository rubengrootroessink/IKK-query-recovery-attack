HOW WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES

The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and
fellow heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16, 17).

Lydia is a middle-aged woman who was dealt a bad hand in life
right from the beginning. Memories of ritual and sexual abuse
that she suffered as a young child have haunted her continually
throughout her Christian life. When she came to see me, her
damaged self-image seemed beyond repair. As she told me her
story, Lydia displayed little emotion, but her words reflected
total despair.

When she concluded, I asked, "Who are you, Lydia? How do you
perceive yourself?"

"I'm evil," she answered stoically. "I'm just no good for
anybody. People tell me I'm evil and all I do is bring trouble."

"You're not evil," I argued. "How can a child of God be evil? Is
that how you perceive yourself?" Lydia nodded.

It is never pleasant to see the evil one express his ugly
personality through a victim like Lydia. But realizing that she
is primarily the product of the work of Christ on the cross
instead of the victim of her past, she was able to throw off the
chains of spiritual bondage and begin living according to her
true identity as a child of God.

Nothing is more foundational to your freedom from Satan's bondage
than understanding and affirming what God has done for you in
Christ and who you are as a result. We all live in accordance
with our perceived identity. In fact, we cannot consistently
behave in a way that is inconsistent with how we perceive
ourselves. Your attitudes, actions, responses and reactions to
life's circumstances are often determined by your conscious and
subconscious self-perception. If you see yourself as the helpless
victim of Satan and his schemes, you will live like his victim
and be in bondage to his lies. But if you see yourself as the
dearly loved and accepted child of God that you really are, you
will more likely live like a child of God.

Thank You, Jesus, that You have made me more than a conqueror.
Because of Your love and power, I can live as a victor instead of
a victim today.
