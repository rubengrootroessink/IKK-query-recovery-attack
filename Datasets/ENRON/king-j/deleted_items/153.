A New Breed of Businesspeople

Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to
Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of
the people....
- (Haggai 2:2)


Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah 60 years after the great
temple built by Solomon had been destroyed. The temple lay in
ruins, and the Lord spoke to the prophet Haggai, "Is it a time
for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while
this house remains a ruin?" (Hag. 1:4) God was calling for a
remnant of His people to come out of their comfort zones and
restore the glory of God's house.

God is doing this same thing today among Christian businesspeople
throughout the world. He is raising up a remnant of
businesspeople who are being handpicked to use their resources,
skills, and experience to affect nations that have not heard the
message of Jesus Christ. The only way they can hear is by
commerce being brought into their nation through Christian
businesspeople, because these are closed regions to normal
missionary efforts.

"But now be strong, O Zerubbabel," declares the Lord. "Be strong,
O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you
people of the land," declares the Lord, "and work. For I am with
you," declares the Lord Almighty. "This is what I covenanted with
you when you came out of Egypt. And My Spirit remains among you.
Do not fear" (Haggai 2:4-5).

The remnant of businesspeople God is calling today understand
that they have to come out of Egypt from their past business
life. Egypt signifies the way of the world. It represents sweat
and toil. It is the flesh. This new way is exemplified by a
pioneer spirit. God knows we need to have courage in order to
move in this realm. Also, God assures us that His Spirit is with
anyone who seeks to live in the realm of supernatural faith.

Are you one of these remnants He has handpicked in these days?
Has He called you out of Egypt in order to do extraordinary
things in your life for His Kingdom? Ask God to show you how He
wants to use you in the marketplace this year. Then act and "be
strong, all you people of the land."
