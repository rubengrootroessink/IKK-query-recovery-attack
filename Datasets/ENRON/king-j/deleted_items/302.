SAFETY, SECURITY AND BELONGING

My God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in
glory in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19).

Not only was Adam given a significant, authoritative role at
creation, he also enjoyed a sense of safety and security. All his
needs were provided for (Genesis 1:29). Adam was completely cared
for in the garden. He had plenty to eat and there was plenty for
the animals. He could eat of the tree of life and live forever in
God's presence. He lacked nothing.

When Adam sinned, he lost that sense of safety and security.
Before, he was naked and unashamed. After, he wanted to hide from
God and cover up. The first emotion expressed by fallen humanity
was fear.

Safety and security is another facet of our inheritance in
Christ. We have the riches of His kingdom at our disposal and His
promise to supply all our needs.

Adam and Eve also experienced a sense of belonging in that
perfect garden. Adam apparently enjoyed intimate, one-on-one
communion with God before Eve was created. Then God said it was
not good for man to be alone (Genesis 2:18). So He gave Eve to
Adam--and Adam to Eve--to enrich his experience of belonging.

Before the Fall, Adam and Eve had a sense of belonging. But after
the Fall they felt rejected, experiencing a need to belong. It is
one of our greatest needs today. Notice that what were attributes
before the Fall became needs after the Fall.

I believe that a true sense of belonging today comes not only
from knowing that we belong to God, but also from belonging to
each other. When God created Eve He established human community.
It's not good for us to be alone. Aloneness can lead to
loneliness. God's preventative for loneliness is
intimacy--meaningful, open, sharing relationships with one
another. In Christ we have the capacity for the fulfilling sense
of belonging which comes from intimate fellowship with God and
with other believers.

Lord, thank You that all my needs for safety, security and
belonging are fully met in You.
