DEALING WITH THE DARK WORLD

The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall
away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons (1 Timothy 4:1).

A few years ago I was speaking in a Southern California church on
the subject of the New Age Movement. My text was 1 Timothy 4:1.
After my message, I was surrounded at the front of the sanctuary
by people wanting to hear more about freedom from spiritual
conflicts caused by demonic influences.

Sitting about halfway back in the sanctuary was a 22-year-old
woman who had been weeping uncontrollably since the service
ended. As I approached the young woman, I could hear her sobbing,
"He understands! He understands!"

later Nancy described to me her horrible childhood, which
included an abusive father and a grandmother who identified
herself as a black witch. "When I was three years old, I received
my guardians--spirit guides," she continued. "They were my
companions, telling me how to live and what to say. I never
questioned if having spirit guides was anything but normal until
my mother took me to Sunday school."

"Would you like to get rid of your spirit guides?" I asked.

There was a long pause. "Will they really leave, or will I go
home and be thrashed by them again?"

"You will be free," I assured her. An hour later Nancy was free.

Nancy's experience is not an obscure, erratic blip in the
contemporary Christian community. In face, in more than 20 years
of ministry as a pastor, counselor, seminary professor and
conference speaker, I have met and ministered to more Christians
in bondage to the dark side of the spiritual world than you may
believe. Christians are woefully unprepared to deal with the dark
world of Satan's kingdom or to minister to those who are in
bondage to it.

Yes, as Timothy warned, "deceitful spirits and doctrines of
demons" are real. But as you daily embrace Christ and His truth,
you will be able to recognize Satan's lies and choose the truth.

Thank You, Jesus, for being the way, the truth, and the life. I
know You are my weapon for overcoming the evil one.
