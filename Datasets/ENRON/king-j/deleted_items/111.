Dear Friends,

We wanted to briefly let you know about some new newsletters from
Crosswalk.com that you may not want to miss:

 * INSIGHTS from Bill Bright
Beginning in mid-February, Dr. Bill Bright will be sharing his heart in
this daily email.  You will be encouraged and inspired by his
reflections on a lifetime of ministry.  Dr. Bright, founder and chairman
of Campus Crusade for Christ, says, "In my remaining time on this earth,
I want to communicate certain precious truths I have learned to as many
people as possible."  Don't miss this opportunity to sit at his feet.

 * The Single Truth
Lori Smith's articles offer a fresh perspective on singleness.  If you
feel like you don't fit in at church, if you're tired of meat markets
and set-ups, or wonder what God is doing with your life, this newsletter
is for you.  Lori says, "I think many singles feel like they've missed
the boat somewhere, and aren't receiving God's best for their lives.
That's just not true!"
