MILITARY RESALE GROUP ADDS BAYER, A MAJOR BRAND, TO ITS
PRODUCT LINE

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 22, 2001--Military Resale
Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) announced today that the Bayer
Corporation, a leader in the health and beauty aid
industry, has been added to its product supplier network.

Bayer is a very well recognized brand name in its market
categories, nationally and internationally. It is estimated
that sales of Bayer's products can add about $300,000
annually to revenues of Military Resale Group.

President Ethan D. Hokit commented: ``Military Resale Group
is pleased and complimented to have become able to
represent such a prestigious manufacturer as Bayer in our
distribution activities. We have previously forecast that
we expect MRG's sales to increase from $4.5 million in 2000
to reach $5.5 million over the next year. Bayer's new
presence is expected to make a major contribution to this
$1 million increase in annual sales that we foresee.''

Military Resale Group, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 when
it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military
Resale Market. At that time, MRG's annual sales were
$750,000 and they have since soared five-fold in three
years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now
a publicly owned company as a result of its recent
acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).

The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market,
with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under
the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a
Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this
area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell
groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at
exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The
resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major
fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The
competitive structure of the Military Resale Market
consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate
the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post-
acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by
acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by
internal growth.

received a total of 30,000 free trading shares of Military

purchased in the open market or in private transactions.
These positions may be liquidated, without prior
notification, even after we have made positive comments

that any price targets and/or projections mentioned are
solely opinions and should not be taken as suggested
holding periods. In fact, we will sell our positions in any
companies advertised before they reach such target prices.
The receipt of this information constitutes your acceptance
of these terms and conditions. Reading this advertisement
shall not create under any circumstances an offer to buy or
sell stock in any company advertised. Nor shall it create
any principal-agent relationship between the reader and us.
The stocks of advertised companies may trade in fast
moving, highly volatile markets, and any reader should
observe the trading behavior of any advertised company

stocks may experience difficulty in selling shares without
seeing a decline in market price and may have difficulty in
finding ready buyers of their stock. Information within

uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to
differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward
looking statements may be identified through the use of
words such as expects, will, anticipates, estimates,
believes, or by statements indicating certain actions may,
could or might occur. We encourage our readers to invest
