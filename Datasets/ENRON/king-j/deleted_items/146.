Your Work

I have brought You glory on earth by completing the work You gave
Me to do.
- (John 17:4)


The Lord has revealed to us that the number one thing we are to
do is love the Lord our God with all our heart and to love our
neighbor as ourselves. His desire is for us to know Him and the
power of His resurrection. These mandates deal with our
relationship with Him. The fruit of this relationship must then
result in our glorifying Him by completing the work He has given
each of us to do. It will become a by-product of this
relationship, not an end in itself.

What is the work God has called you to do? Jesus never did
anything the Father had not instructed Him to do. He lived in
such communion with the Father that He knew when to turn left and
when to turn to the right. Is it possible to have such a
relationship with our heavenly Father? I think that if it
weren't, He would not have given us such an example.

"Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and
unsearchable things you do not know" (Jer. 33:3). What has He
called you to do? Perhaps you are called to be the best CPA in
your city or the best advertising executive or the best office
worker or assembly-line person in your company. Whatever work He
has called you to do, He will use you as His instrument to
accomplish something that He has uniquely prepared you to do.

When our life is complete, what a glorious day it will be if we
can each say, "I have completed the work You gave me to do." This
will have brought great glory to Him.
