DON'T BELIEVE IT

Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be
defiled by them (Leviticus 19:31).

Where do mediums and spiritists get their "amazing" information
and insights? Many of them are demonic channelers, but much of
what is called "spiritism" and "psychic phenomena" is no more
than clever illusion. hese so-called spiritists give what is
referred to as "cold readings." You go to them for advice or
direction, and they ask you a few simple, leading questions.
Based on the information you give, they make general observations
which are probably true of most people in your situation. But
you're so impressed with the accuracy of their "revelations" that
you start tipping them off to all kinds of details which they can
fabricate into their "reading." This is not demonic; it's just
mental and verbal sleight-of-hand.

But the mediums and spiritists that God warned against in
Leviticus and Deuteronomy were not con artists, but people who
possessed and passed on knowledge which didn't come through
natural channels of perception. These people have opened
themselves up to the spirit world and have become channels of
knowledge from Satan. The charlatan with his phony cold readings
is only interested in bilking you of your money. But the false
knowledge and direction which comes from Satan through a medium
is intended to bilk you of your spiritual vitality and freedom.

There's big money in psychic/con artist operations, and a lot of
magicians are raking it in. Many people crave to know something
extra about their lives and their future, and they will pay
handsomely if they think you can give them the inside information
they desire.

When a psychic claims to have contacted the dead, don't believe
it. When a psychologist claims to have regressed a client back to
a former existence through hypnosis, don't believe it. When a New
Age medium purports to channel a person from the past into the
present, realize that it is nothing more than a familiar spirit
or the fraudulent work of a con artist.

Lord Jesus, You are the way, the truth and the life. I renounce
any power or revelation from any other source than You.
