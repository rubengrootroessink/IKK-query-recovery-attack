The Skillful Worker

Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings;
he will not serve before obscure men.
- (Proverbs 22:29)


The Lord has called each of us to be excellent in what we do.
Those whom God used in the Kingdom as marketplace ministers were
skilled and exemplified excellence in their field. Not only were
these men skilled, they were filled with God's Spirit.

Then the Lord said to Moses, "See, I have chosen Bezalel son of
Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him
with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all
kinds of crafts-to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver
and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage
in all kinds of craftsmanship" (Exodus 31:1-5).

Consider Huram, the master craftsman of bronze in whom Solomon
entrusted much of the temple designs. He was a true master
craftsman (see 1 Kings 7:14).

Consider Joseph, whose skill as an administrator was known
throughout Egypt and the world. Consider Daniel, who served his
king with great skill and integrity. The list could go on-David,
Nehemiah, Acquilla and Priscilla.

I recall the first issue of an international publication we
began. It was common to hear the comment, "It doesn't even look
like a Christian magazine." They were saying the quality and
excellence exceeded what they equated to Christian work. What a
shame. Has inferior quality become synonymous with Christian
work?

May we strive for excellence in all that we do for the Master of
the universe.

Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for
the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an
inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you
are serving (Colossians 3:23-24).

How can you experience God in your work? Why do most of us
tend to segment our spiritual life from our work life? Can
I really know God's will for my life? How can I make
decisions that will be blessed by God? Why do most Christians
in the workplace live a defeated life? Join Os and Angie
Hillman for the Called to the Workplace one day workshop and
find these answers along with many more October 26,27 in
