TERRA SYSTEMS (Pink Sheets: TSYI)
Latest price: 30 cents


Take a close look at TERRA SYSTEMS (Pink Sheets: TSYI) -
latest price: 30 cents - which has just released the
following news.

The group behind TSYI is the same people who put together
ETGP. When they got involved in ETGP, the stock was trading
at a similar price (20 - 25 cents). It lifted to 50 - 60
cents in a short period of time. ETGP did a 10 for 1
reverse (not needed in TSYI) so that it traded $5.00 -
$6.00 in July of 1995 on the Bulletin Board. The stock went
to $66.00 in September of 1995 and split two for one. The
whole transaction took less than a year.


TERRA SYSTEMS, INC. ANNOUNCES POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF ITS
TECHNOLOGY BY SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING GROUP

PAYSON, Utah--Oct. 25, 2001--Terra Systems, Inc. (PINK
SHEETS - TSYI) announced today that a Santa Fe, NM-based
scientific consulting firm, the La Mancha Company, has
completed an initial study (commissioned by TSYI) about the
Company's patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology.

The title of the report is ``Dry Bulk Materials Handling
Technology With Emphasis On Coal.'' The report's
conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technology's
technical and economic feasibility. In part because TSYI is
still a development-stage company, La Mancha's report cites
certain caveats including that ``...these general
conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in
rigorous pilot-test environments such as those proposed by
TSYI....''

The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says: ``In
conclusion, the process and its potential application to
utilization in coal-fired power generation, the recovery of
usable coal fines from long-accumulating waste sites, and
its environmentally ''friendly`` attributes, constitute an
intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in
reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and
environmental concern. The proposed Phase I Program (of
Terra Systems) should be supported as a first step.''

Commenting on this study, Clayton Timothy, Chairman of
TSYI, said: ``We are very pleased with the positive
conclusions about our technology that this report has
reached. The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific
consulting firm; and, in this case, two of the authors of
the report hold Ph.D.s in relevant physical sciences and
are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving
successful commercialization, including those mentioned in
this report. But, we also feel this study provides
substantial professional support for the faith we have in
the scientific and economic efficacy of the Company's
unique process for dry bulk materials handling.''

Terra Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Utah in 1996 and is
presently a development-stage company. It is primarily
engaged in the development and commercialization of its
patented Pneumatic Accelerator. This device is a gas linear
particle accelerator, which conveys and processes bulk
materials at high velocity in a particle-isolated state,
using air as the medium of movement. This technology
operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low
pressures and does not use water, the generally more costly
traditional alternative for processing bulk materials.
Virtually, all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in
basic industries can be more economically separated and
classified by our dry-process technology. This capability
facilitates a number of associated procedures, including:
drying, micro pulverizing, mixing, forming, conveying, and
loading. In addition, bulk materials can be beneficiated in
important ways including moisture reduction, ash reduction,
Btu enhancement, and electro-customization. Our system can
perform multiple tasks, needs less maintenance, requires no
chemical additives, and can improve the surrounding
environmental quality. Opportunities are seen for many
applications in an array of large industries including
power generation, agriculture, mining, environment,
construction, ceramics, and materials transportation.
We estimate that our technology could generate economic
returns to industrial users in the form of revenues and/or
cost savings in the area of $2 billion within a few years,
if adopted for implementation in several large projects.
Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic
returns through fees, royalties, and profit sharing from
licensing of its technology. TSYI has approximately 18
million shares currently outstanding.
