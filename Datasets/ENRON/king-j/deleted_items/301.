THE OLDEST LIE OF SATAN

They sacrificed to demons who were not God, to gods whom they
have not known, new gods who came lately, whom your fathers did
not dread. You neglected the Rock who begot you, and forgot the
God who gave you birth (Deuteronomy 32:17, 18).

The New Age Movement cloaks the occult in the description of New
Age enlightenment: "You don't need God; you are God. You don't
need to repent of your sins and depend on God to save you. Sin
isn't a problem; you just need to turn off your mind and tune in
to the great cosmic oneness through harmonic convergence." The
New Age pitch is the oldest lie of Satan: "You will be like God"
(Genesis 3:5).

This thirst for knowledge and power has lured a fallen humanity
to seek guidance from mediums and spiritists, and from such
occultic practices as fortune-telling, tarot cards, palm-reading,
Ouija boards, astrology, magic charming and automatic writing.
People all around us are ignoring the God who loves them and
wants to guide their lives and are instead seeking light and
peace in the kingdom of darkness. Peace can only be found in the
Prince of Peace, not in the prince of darkness.

Don't be carried away by the prospect of knowledge and power
which is luring so many people in our culture today away from
God. People such as the devotees of Simon in Acts 8:9, 10, will
continue to be astonished by those who practice New Age sorcery.
Others, such as the customers of the demon-possessed slave girl
in Acts 16:16-18, will contribute to the profit of those who
exercise a spirit of divination. As in these examples from the
early church, those who seek knowledge and power from the dark
side will greatly interfere with the work of God, deceiving many
by the counterfeit forces they employ. Other people will thirst
after power to such an extent that they will sacrifice to the
"goat demons" (Leviticus 17:7) and even sacrifice their own
children to demons (Psalm 106:36-38).

Let the words of Deuteronomy 32:17, 18, sober us to the reality
that even believers are vulnerable to being lured away from the
knowledge and power of God by our enemy.

Lord, I refuse to participate with the powers of darkness. You
are my life and the light of my world.
