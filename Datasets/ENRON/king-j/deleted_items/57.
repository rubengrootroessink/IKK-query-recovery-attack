Our Labor in the Lord

Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you.
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you
know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
- (1 Corinthians 15:58)


There is a paradigm shift going on among a remnant of
businesspeople today. That paradigm shift is a focus on using our
business and work life as a platform for ministry versus a
platform solely for material success. There is a remnant of
businesspeople throughout the world today who understand their
birthright in the marketplace is to reflect Christ fully in and
through their work. It is reflected by a commitment to use their
resources and skills to provide a product of excellence with the
overall motive to affect people for Jesus Christ. The difference
is that these individuals have an overriding ministry objective
to their work.

When the apostle Paul tells us to fully work unto the Lord, he
does not mean we must be working as missionaries in "full-time
Christian effort." He understands that all of life is holy and
sacred to God. If our motive is to serve God where we are, then
our labor "in the Lord is not in vain."

As you begin your work today, ask God if you are working with the
primary motive of reflecting His life and character through your
work on this day. Let nothing move you from this motive being
central to your activity. The Lord will reflect His power and
leading in and through your life when this becomes your primary
motive.
