RECKLESS ABANDON

I do not want you to become sharers in demons (1 Corinthians
10:20).

While Christians have been questioning the reality of demonic
influence in the church, the world has charged into the spiritual
realm with reckless abandon. The Western world is experiencing a
massive paradigm shift in its worldview, as best seen in the rise
of the New Age Movement, the acceptance of parapsychology as a
science, the growing popularity of the supernatural, and the
increasing visibility of Satanism in our culture. New Age
mysticism, which gathered its greatest strength with the influx
of Eastern religions in the 1960s, has been popularized by a host
of celebrities in the 1980s. It's commonplace to hear channelers
(mediums) on radio and TV talk shows boasting about their spirit
guides (demons).

But the New Age Movement is not just a celebrity issue. New Age
philosophy is making significant inroads into business, education
and even religion across our nation. Recently I challenged two my
students to attend, for the sake of research, a New Age
conference being held two blocks from our school. When they
arrived at the door and discovered the cost to be $65 each, they
started to walk away. But two strangers approached them saying,
"We were told to give you these tickets." My wide-eyed students
took the tickets and walked in.

They reported to me that one of the speakers led conference
participants in a meditation exercise. He challenged everyone to
imagine a spirit guide coming alongside. The speaker concluded
the exercise by saying, "Now invite your spirit guide to come
in." I could hardly believe it. The devil is giving altar calls
just two blocks from Biola University!

Does the spread of New Age and the occult worry you or frighten
you? It need not. In Christ you have every resource to defuse and
dispel any threat of darkness in your life or family. Stand on
the truth of His Word and walk in the light of your identity in
Christ.

Keep me alert today, Lord, to inroads the devil is attempting in
my world that I may tear down his strongholds with the weapons of
the Spirit.
