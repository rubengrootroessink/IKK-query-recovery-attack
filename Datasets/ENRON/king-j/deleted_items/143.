OUR DYNAMIC POWER SOURCE

. . . the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who
believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength
of His might . . . (Ephesians 1:19).

In Ephesians 1:19-21, Paul gives us a peek at the dynamic source
of our authority in Christ. He explains that the authority at our
disposal flows from the reservoir of power which raised Jesus
Christ from the dead and seated Him at the Father's right hand.
That power source is so dynamic that Paul used four different
Greek words in verse 19 to describe it: power (dunameos), working
(energeian), strength (kratous), and might (ischuos). Behind the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ lies the mightiest work of
power recorded in the Word of God. And the same power which
raised Christ from the dead and defeated Satan is the power
available to us to overcome the works of Satan in our daily
lives.

Paul opens our eyes to the expansive scope of Christ's authority
which is "far above all rule and authority and power and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but
also in the one to come" (Ephesians 1:21). Think about the most
powerful and influential political or military leaders in the
world. Imagine the most feared terrorists, crime kingpins and
drug barons. Think about Satan and all the power of darkness
marshaled under his command. Jesus' authority is not only above
all these human and spiritual authorities past, present and
future, but He is far above them. We share the same position
because we are seated with Christ in the heavenlies, which enable
us to live in freedom and victory over demonic intrusion and
influence.

Don't be deceived. You are not under Satan's power or subject to
his authority. You are in Christ above all demonic rule,
authority and power.

Reigning with You, Lord--what a liberating thought! I praise You
today for the power You share with me.
