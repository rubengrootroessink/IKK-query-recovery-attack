     How are you doing today? Michael Kane asked me to contact you in regards to a  few positions that I know of in the market place.  I have a few questions  for you.  Would you be open to relocation?  What would you say your  strongest region of trading is?   If you can help me by answering  these questions, I should be able to find a fit in the openings I know  of.
 
Thanks,
