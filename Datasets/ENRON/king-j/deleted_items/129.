CHILDREN NEED MODELS

A pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been
fully trained, will be like his teacher (Luke 6:40).

Your children need to see how you handle failure even more than
how you handle success. If you make a mistake, you need to own up
to it and ask forgiveness if the situation calls for it. If you
don't model how to deal with your own fleshly responses, how are
they going to learn how to own up to their mistakes and resolve
them biblically?

One Sunday morning my daughter wasn't ready when I wanted to
leave for church. I fumed about it until I exploded with anger.
After the service I was about to say grace before a meal when I
felt the convicting hand of God weighing heavily upon me. I
stopped and asked my family to forgive me for my outburst of
anger. I didn't confess my daughter's tardiness because it wasn't
my responsibility. Nor did I ask their forgiveness in hopes that
my daughter would own up to her tardiness. I asked their
forgiveness because my outburst of anger was a deed of the flesh.
I had to ask forgiveness to be right with God myself.

You never lose esteem in your child's eyes when you do what God
requires you to do. You gain esteem because you are an honest
person, and in the process you are modeling what they need to do
when they blow it. Children need models, not critics. Modeling is
what establishes our credibility to "bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4).

Lord, help me model a life of obedience and honesty before my
children and others who look to me as an example. And when I
fail, give me grace to admit my mistakes and resolve my
conflicts.
