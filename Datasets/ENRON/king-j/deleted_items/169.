THE PROCESS OF FORGIVENESS

Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who
curse you, pray for those who mistreat you (Luke 6:27, 28).

Here are 12 simple steps you can use to walk through the process
of forgiving someone who hurt you in the past.

  1 Ask the Lord to reveal the names of the persons who offended
    you and the specific wrongs you suffered.

  2 Face the hurt and the hate. If you are going to forgive from
    your heart, you must let God search the depths of your heart.

  3 Acknowledge the significance of the cross. It is the cross of
    Christ that makes forgiveness legally and morally right.

  4 Decide that you will not retaliate by using the information
    about the offender's sin against them (Luke 6:27-34).
  5 Decide to forgive. Forgiveness is a conscious choice to let
    the other person off the hook and free yourself from the
    past.

  6 Take your list of names to God and pray the following: "I
    forgive ___(name)___ for ___(specifically identify every
    remembered pain)__."

  7 Destroy the list. You are now free. Do not tell the offenders
    what you have done. Your forgiveness is between you and God
    unless the offenders have asked you for forgiveness.

  8 Do not expect that your decision to forgive will result in
    major changes in the other persons. Instead, pray for them
    (Matthew 5:44).

  9 Try to understand the people you have forgiven. They are
    victims also.

  10Freedom is a result of forgiveness in you. In time you will
    be able to think about the people who offended you without
    feeling hurt or anger.

  11Thank God for the lessons you have learned and the maturity
    you have gained.

  12When appropriate, accept your part of the blame for the
    offenses you suffered. Confess your failure to God and to
    others (1 John 1:9) and realize that if someone has something
    against you, you must go to that person (Matthew 5:23-26).

Lord, teach me how to love unconditionally and forgive quickly
those who hate me, curse me or mistreat me.
