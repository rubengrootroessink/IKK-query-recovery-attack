Knowledge That is Productive

For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they
will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
- (2 Peter 1:8)


Productivity is a term all businesspeople can relate to. It is
the by-product of what we desire from our work. Without
productivity, we do not make sales, we do not deliver goods, we
do not achieve our goals. There are things in our business lives
that can creep in making us unproductive. The same is true in our
walk with God.

The apostle Peter tells us that we can become knowledgeable of
Jesus but fail to be effective and productive in our relationship
with Him. We are a society that has great knowledge, but our
comparable scale of productivity from that knowledge is extremely
weighted to the knowledge side. The apostle Peter tells us there
is a solution to this dilemma.

For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith
goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge,
self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to
perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness;
and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these
qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being
ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ (2 Peter 1:5-8).

Is your Christian experience filled with knowledge, but little
power? Is there a staleness in your walk with God? Is there an
unrest in your soul? It may be due to a need to develop character
that only the Holy Spirit can develop out of an obedient heart.
Ask the Lord today to add these qualities to your faith so that
you can be productive as a soldier of Jesus Christ.
