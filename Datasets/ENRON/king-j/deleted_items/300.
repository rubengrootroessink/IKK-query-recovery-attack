Loose Your Donkey

..."Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a
donkey ttied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring
them to Me. If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the
Lord needs them...."
- (Matthew 21:2-3)


A donkey was an animal of commerce in Jesus' day. It was used to
carry great burdens of goods from place to place and he was known
as the "beast of the burden." This donkey no doubt was owned by a
village businessperson. But Jesus told His disciples to fetch the
donkey for "He had need of it." This donkey played an important
part in Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It was a day that
was the culmination of three years of ministry. Jesus chose to
use a vehicle of commerce to bring Him into His most important
public display.

We are entering a time in our own history in which God is saying
to businesspeople, "Loose your donkey for My purposes. I have
need of it." God is preparing His Church to be a vessel for
ushering in a great harvest of souls. He is preparing His remnant
of businesspeople, who are like a tribe within the Church, to be
a major force in this great harvest.

"He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest
branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood
of grapes. His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter
than milk" (Gen. 49:11-12). Is your donkey tied to the living
Vine, the choicest branch of Jesus Himself? When we are tied to
the living Vine, designed for His use, we will be useful in God's
Kingdom. Jesus wants to free us from the bondage of business
slavery; He wants us to walk in freedom so that others may see
God's grace flowing through us and our place in the business
world. Is your donkey available for His use?

Today, ask Jesus to allow the Vine to flow through you in every
area of your life.
