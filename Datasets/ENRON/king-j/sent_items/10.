Hey buddy,

I'm closing on my new house that week so that may be tough.  There is a chance that i could get away on Saturday morning so let me know your schedule.  Hope the family is well.

JK

Jeff

I am tentatively planning a trip to Houston for the weekend of Nov 16th.
Seeing just a few accounts while I'm there and I am hoping to get a round of
golf in for that Saturday.  I am hoping you can take the time to allow me to
kick your ass on the links.  What do you say?  I will let you know when my
plans are finalized.

Kihyon
