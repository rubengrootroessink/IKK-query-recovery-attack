Being an Overcomer

I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace.
In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have
overcome the world.
- (John 16:33)


"Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise
find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those
who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to
be true?" This was the comment from a business associate
recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not
a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to
maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother
sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, "Why do the
wicked prosper?" (see Jer. 12:1)

It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the
Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised
Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the
Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is
not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to
honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition
from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us
must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit
and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.

Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer
than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake
among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and
ineffective.

Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from
walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory
for every battle you will encounter. Call on His name.
