Hi all,

I have LOTS updates for the SMNW web page but I have not worked on it
yet...I will do that soon. I have changes to make dating back from
October...so please be patient! I keep all the emails you send me and go
back through them when I'm doing updates.

I currently have contact with about 150 emails (a few are coming back
undeliverable, which I also need to update) but contacts with more than
that. You can see the last update at http://www.amyslater.com/smnw.html
Remember, I have LOTS of changes and will email you again after I have made
them. Go ahead and email me if there is anything new.

See below for news about one of our bright classmates...Kurt Fried will be
appearing on Jeopardy in early December!!! Congratulations Kurt!

As usual, my latest news is put on my webpage at http://www.amyslater.com If
anyone else has a webpage they'd like linked to on the SMNW page, please let
me know!!!

Tom Swanson and I STILL have not met to have any kind of kickoff meeting!
This is bad. TOM...we need to set a meeting ASAP!
