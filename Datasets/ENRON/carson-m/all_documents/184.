This is interesting -- hadn't seen this chart in the press -- shows votes by 
region -- you can see the west favorites us -- but the others....? ?Big 12 
should have showcased OU and #14 more --- I think they were happy OU did what 
they did, but the "days gone by when they all were jealous of OU' probably 
still lingered in the Big 12 former Big 8 offices.......... 


If this doesn't open up to "regional vote" --look for a link titled something 
like that....
