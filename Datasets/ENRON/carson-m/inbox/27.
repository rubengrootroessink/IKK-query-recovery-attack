Mike,

I'm glad to hear things are going well!  Everything at PwC is going pretty
good.  I'm still traveling quite a bit, today I'm in Indianapolis.  Laura
is keeping pretty busy at KPMG and working on re-decorating the house.
She's been talking a lot about having a baby so I'm not sure how long it'll
be before we have a little Duvall running around.  Hey, I just got a
message from Vogel on Pig Dinner, are you  planning on going this year?
Let me know because I'm going to try to make it finally, even though it's
on the worst day of the year for a tax accountant (April 13th).

Take Care,

Devin

   Mike,

   I was wondering how your job was going.  I've obviously heard all the
   media
   hype surrounding your company.  Please send me a email with an update.

   Thanks,

   Devin
