Mike,

The change in the curves only shows a .60 increase today.  The curves were down anywhere from .60 to 1.65 previous which was supposed to be up .25.  Cin was up @ .15 today.  That would mean that ENT should be up at least the amount it was down the previous day plus any increase marked today.  Can you look into this for me.  This is causing a $2MM hit in the books down here.  Thanks.

-Joe
