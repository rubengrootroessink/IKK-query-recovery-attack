Hey Mike,
Just curious if you all have given any thought to posting a MEC Market.  You have
NSP and AECI and we would sure be interested in supporting a MEC market.
How the things going for you, I am sure right now it must be a bit tense 
In lieu of everything that is taking place with Enron.  
I wish you well and have a Happy Thanksgiving.
