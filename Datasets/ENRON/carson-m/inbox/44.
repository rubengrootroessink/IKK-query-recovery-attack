You might want to check www.kstatefootball.com  to get some  comments about the Oklahoma game.  Also, Audrey Mross of Dallas has  received some information on www.huskerfootball.com  that is very  interesting.  In case we are looking forward to November 10, she passed  that news along.
 
DON'T FORGET WATCH PARTY THIS SATURDAY AT SRO -  NORTHWEST SHOPPING MALL.
 
DON'T FORGET FOURTH ANNUAL "SUNFLOWERS AND  SAGE" BBQ ON OCTOBER 14
 
We'll be at the Colorado game this  Saturday.  I'm sure you'll spot us among the purple people!
 
See you later,
 
Joyce Nesmith
