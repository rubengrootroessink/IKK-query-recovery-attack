BAD AMERICAN
Date: Fri, 29 Jun 2001 Written by Ted Nugent, the rock singer
and hunter/naturalist, upon hearing that California
Senators B. Boxer and D. Feinstein denounced him for being a
"gun owner" and a "Rock Star".
This was his response after telling the senators about his past
contributions to children's charities and scholarship foundations
which have totaled more than $13.7 million in the last 5 years!!
"I'm a Bad American-this pretty much sums it up for me. I like
big trucks, big boats, big houses, and naturally, pretty women.
I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not
some midlevel governmental functionary with a bad comb-over
who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies.
I don't care about appearing compassionate. I think playing
with toy guns doesn't make you a killer. I believe ignoring
your kids and giving them Prozac might.
I think I'm doing better than the homeless.
I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.
I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are
different, weird or make me mad. This is my life to live, and
not necessarily up to others expectations.
I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it.
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. But if you want to that's fine;
I just don't feel like everyone else should have to.
I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake, a
pack of cigarettes, or hotel room you should do it in English.
As of matter of fact, if you are an American citizen you should
speak English. My uncles and forefathers shouldn't have had
to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born
in to come disrespect ours, and make us bend to your will.
Get over it.
I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry butt if
you're running from them after they tell you to stop. If
you can't understand the word 'freeze' or 'stop' in English,
see the previous line.
I don't use the excuse "it's for the children" as a shield for
unpopular opinions or actions.
I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a
machine with no political affiliation do a recount when needed.
I know what the definition of lying is, and it isn't based on
the word "is"-ever.
I don't think just because you were not born in this country,
you qualify for any special loan programs, gov't sponsored
bank loans, etc., so you can open a hotel, 7-Eleven, trinket shop,
or any thing else, while the indigenous peoples can't get past
a high school education because they can't afford it.
I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet.
I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny.
I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.
I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne,
Ice-T or Marilyn Manson sang, but that doesn't mean I want to
listen to that crap from someone else's car when I'm stopped at a 
red light. But I respect your right to.
I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment
than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box.
I don't want to eat or drink anything with the words light, lite
or fat-free on the package.
Our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their
lives in vain and defend our Constitution so that decades later
you can tell me it's a living document ever changing and is open
to interpretation. The guys who wrote it were light years
ahead of anyone today, and they meant what they said - now
leave the document alone, or there's going to be trouble.
I don't hate the rich. I help the poor.
I know wrestling is fake.
I've never owned, or was a slave, and a large percentage of
our forefathers weren't wealthy enough to own one either.
Please stop blaming me because some prior white people were
idiots - and remember, tons of white, Indian, Chinese, and
other races have been enslaved too - it was wrong for every
one of them.
I believe a self-righteous liberal Democrat with a cause is
more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.
I want to know exactly which church is it where the
"Reverend" Jessie Jackson preaches; and, what exactly is
his job function.
I own a gun, you can own a gun, and any red blooded American
should be allowed to own a gun, but if you use it in a crime,
then you will serve the time.
I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made
and continue to make more. If it makes you mad, then invent
the next operating system that's better and put your name on
the building. Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to
help you.
I don't believe in hate crime legislation. Even suggesting
it makes me mad. You're telling me that someone who is a
minority, gay, disabled, another nationality, or otherwise
different from the mainstream of this country has more value
as a human being that I do as a white male. If someone
kills anyone, I'd say that it's a hate crime. We don't need
more laws! Let's enforce the ones we already have.
I think turkey bacon, turkey beef, turkey fake anything sucks.
I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child-it
takes a parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank
his butt and say "NO!" when it's necessary to do so.
I'll admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Ole Yeller.
I didn't realize Dr. Seuss was a genius until I had a kid.
I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made
to keep silent because I have these beliefs and opinions.
I thought this country allowed me that right.
I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting
somebody's feelings.
I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the
 mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise.
Yes, I guess by some people's definition, I may be a bad American. But that's tough."
