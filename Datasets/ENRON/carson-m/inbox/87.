ell Davis  , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed fr=
om arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by =
surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fr=
acture in his leg and could be lost for the season.   "At this point in tim=
e, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said.   Davis admitted that =
his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the sco=
ut team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davi=
s was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer=
  , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports=
, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will =
join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monda=
y night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 ya=
rds. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to moti=
vate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/24/01   =
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herma=
n Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said h=
e wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passe=
d the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kev=
in Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the=
 XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight=
 weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR =
TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his=
 back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return dat=
e is unclear.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Eman=
uel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking=
 for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to =
Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother=
 picking him up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Wa=
rd is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday'=
s game against Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Carsons Wildcats U=
pdated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tu=
esday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.  =
  Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily=
 News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers=
 from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.  =
  Brett Favre  , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped T=
uesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this w=
eek, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Min=
nis  , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this wee=
k were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star=
 notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There=
 is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Col=
ts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to =
the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's p=
lace Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not wort=
hy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over th=
e next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/0=
1   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligam=
ents in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you p=
lay in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24=
/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three k=
ickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a=
 big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI -=
 Woltys Wonders Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is exp=
ected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.=
     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monda=
y game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery an=
d might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Drunk Monkeys Updated=
 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning J=
urevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter =
in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. T=
here is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani =
Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongsi=
de Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sideline=
s.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is =
suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game aga=
inst Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some=
 things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available," sai=
d head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more =
playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game again=
st the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playi=
ng. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited pr=
actice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that=
 it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head c=
oach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's =
game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     R=
aghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering f=
rom a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as=
 probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach=
 Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon=
 as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that=
 bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn=
't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hu=
rt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that=
 when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it wo=
uld be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe i=
f Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilf=
er  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice =
on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Ha=
sselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Ha=
sselbeck  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be the S=
eahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to=
 the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in fo=
r Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very fav=
orable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him =
this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01   =
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Caro=
lina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concuss=
ion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. =
He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy=
 player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Drunk Monke=
ys Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury.=
 He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use =
him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/23/01 =
  Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead =
of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend=
 you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hard=
ly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  =
  Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might mi=
ss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right =
foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Commissioner=
 Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas C=
ity due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league =
this week.    Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01   Dav=
is is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback gam=
e from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether =
they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos =
hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you us=
e Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's st=
arting running back and is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player N=
ews Teams   [IMAGE]   Carsons Wildcats Player News    Germane Crowell  , Re=
serve WR Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured rese=
rve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his =
season.    Rob Moore  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  According to Cardinals=
 coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season.=
 Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have set=
backs in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the=
 Arizona Republic . "That's why we both handled it like we did in training =
camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't=
 tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, =
we won't have him." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the ti=
me to let him go.    Freddie Jones  , Active TE Updated 10/22/01  Jones spr=
ained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.    Michae=
l Pittman  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Pittman had a great outing on Sund=
ay against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown.=
 Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a=
 valuable player to have on your roster.    LaDainian Tomlinson  , Active R=
B Updated 10/21/01  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this sea=
son by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on th=
e day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.    Ahma=
n Green  , Reserve RB Updated 10/19/01  Green will get the bulk of his numb=
ers in the second half if Green Bay can get ahead of Minnesota early. He wi=
ll definitely be good for at least one TD.    Shannon Sharpe  , Active TE U=
pdated 10/19/01  Expect Sharpe to have another solid week, as far as tight =
ends are concerned. He is the team's leader in receptions and should get a =
reasonable amount of balls thrown his way. Don't be surprised if he scores =
a touchdown as well. Sharpe is overdue for a score. He had five TD catches =
in 2000 but hasn't scored one this season.    Kurt Warner  , Active QB Upda=
ted 10/18/01  Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis=
, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against =
the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.    Torry Ho=
lt  , Active WR Updated 10/18/01  Holt has the potential to post big number=
s against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wi=
deout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.    Mark Brun=
ell  , Reserve QB Updated 10/17/01  Brunell is no longer being bothered by =
headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for ov=
er 200 yards and a score.    Vikings  , Reserve DT Updated 09/26/01  The Vi=
kings signed former Buffalo safety Henry Jones this week. He'll replace Rob=
ert Griffith, who broke his leg during Sunday's game against Chicago. The m=
ove won't make Minnesota's secondary much better than it was, however, and =
doesn't improve the unit overall from a Fantasy perspective.    Steve Chris=
tie  , Reserve K Updated 09/11/01  According to published reports, Christie=
 has been released by the Buffalo Bills. Christie, who was placed on injure=
d reserve due to a groin injury last week, will have an MRI on Tuesday. Dro=
p Christie now if you haven't already done so, and consider picking up Jake=
 Arians, who has taken over the placekicking duties in Buffalo.    Travis P=
rentice  , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01  Prentice was traded to the Vikings,=
 where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a Fant=
asy draft choice right now.    Rams  , Active DT Updated 08/30/01  Head Coa=
ch Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Arch=
uleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (ham=
string) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final p=
reseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener agains=
t Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selec=
tion on Draft Day.    Matt Stover  , Active K Updated 12/08/00  Stover need=
s just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to br=
eak the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to g=
et plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in y=
our active playoff lineup each week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner=
