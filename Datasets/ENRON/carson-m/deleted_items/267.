Harriet's Holiday Safety Tips:
In all the excitement of the season, it's easy to forget some common
sense safety measures that are especially important to remember with
trees, lights, and decorations. For a safe holiday, please take a
minute to think about some tips I've found come in handy.

Trees:
?     Select only a freshly cut tree. The needles should not be
      falling off from dryness.
?     Keep the tree outside or in a garage until you're ready to
      decorate it.
?     A diagonal cut in the tree trunk will allow the tree to absorb
      water. This will allow the tree to soak up water from the stand.
?     A 6' tree will use 1 gallon of water every two days, so be sure
      to check the water level daily.
?     Trees should be at least three feet away from heat sources such
      as fireplaces, candles, and radiators, also, never block an exit
      with the tree.
?     Artificial trees should bear the UL label. Never use electric
      lights on metal trees like the old silver trees. To avoid
      electric shock on metal trees, use colored spotlights securely
      mounted above or below the tree, never fastened directly on it.
      Plastic trees should be made of fire resistant material.

 Holiday Lights:
?     Use only U.L. approved tree lights. Check for frayed or bare
      wiring, lights with cracked or broken sockets or loose
      connections. If they show signs of wear and tear, throw them away.
?     Use only UL-listed lights, and no more than 3 strands linked together.
?     Decorations can cause overloaded circuits. Watch for signs of
      lights dimming.
?     Turn off all lights on trees and other decorations when you go to
      bed or leave the house.
?     Keep outdoor electrical connectors above ground and out of puddles and snow.

Tree Ornaments and Trimmings:
?     Avoid placing small or breakable ornaments on lower branches
      where children or pets can reach them and knock them off.
?     Also be careful about putting edible decorations low where
      pets and kids can reach them.

All of us at HarrietCarter.com wish you a safe, happy, and festive
Thanksgiving week and want to leave you with one last idea to make
your guests feel warm and welcome.

Harriet's Cozy Cider:

Pour a container of fresh cider into a large saucepan and heat
gently. You can add a little nutmeg or a few cloves, as well an
orange or lemon peel for a real flavor punch. When guests arrive,
ladle them a mug of hot cider with a cinnamon stick for a stirrer.
It's a great way to say "welcome!"

Relax, sit back, and start your Christmas shopping with
