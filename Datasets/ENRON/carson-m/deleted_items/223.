 back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the sec=
ond half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys=
 Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week=
, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked r=

t Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the =
No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however=

 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use hi=
m during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated=

y teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is =
having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy number=
s makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during yo=
ur playoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Harr=
ison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL =
season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in th=
e playoff race.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 =
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into yo=
