Dear Graduate Brothers,
            Things have been a little hectic around here lately.  In the last two weeks we have had Dad's Weekend, Homecoming, and FIJI Run.  We are all just now getting back into the normal routine.  There have been many positive things happening around here though:
 
Dad's Weekend we a huge success, except for K-State losing to Texas A&M.  All the Dad's a great time hanging out with there son's and learning what type of brotherhood we have developed here.
 
FIJI Run was also very successful.  This year it was the same week as homecoming so we chose to run the ball from Lawrence to Manhattan on Monday instead of Friday.  Between the two chapters we raised over $32,000, with $18,500 coming from Chi Deuteron alone.
 
Homecoming was a good time as always.  Our partners weren't too much help this year, but the Phi Gams represented well, and made it as crazy as ever.
 
5-8 of us will be traveling to William Woods in Fulton, MO this weekend for their chartering.  Three members will be on the initiation team there.  If anyone is interested in attending the festivities, email Terry Meyers at tmeyers@ussafety.com .  
 
Fraternally,
 
Kurt Niebuhr
Recording Secretary
