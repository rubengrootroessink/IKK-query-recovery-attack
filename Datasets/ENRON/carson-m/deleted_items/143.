Alright, dammit...
 
I forkin told everyone that it was first come,  first served.
The ONLY reason that you should copy everyone via  email
is out of  courtesy so they know the player is off the free agent
list until I make the actual trade because,  A.) I can't do the
deal until Tuesday morning anyway, and B.) it makes  other
team members aware of the trade.
 
Protocol, people.
