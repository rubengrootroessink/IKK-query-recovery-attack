  [IMAGE] October 20, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 91 [IMAGE]   =
  Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC J=
ournal Members:      [IMAGE] Special Announcement     When I look back on a=
ll these worries I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathb=
ed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which never happen=
ed. Sir Winston Churchill from Their Finest Hour  We are working on a very =
special edition custom tailored for bargain hunters. The last three weeks h=
ave led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besid=
es straight down.   There are many technology stocks trading at less than 1=
% of their previous highs. Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its m=
inimum $1 bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will =
review the rule early next year.   Unlike most market environments, individ=
ual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks a=
t these levels. Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not=
 allowed to hold stocks. Many funds cannot hold stocks below $5, and others=
 have a $1 threshold. Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at thes=
e levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund, oftentimes agains=
t their personal wishes and their own common sense. Fund managers will be a=
ble to purchase these stocks again once they appreciate above $1 and $5.   =
We are working on a list of stocks with compelling values that are very ove=
rsold. In order to make the list, the stock must be trading below the cash =
value the company has per share, and have little or no debt. We will try to=
 publish this exciting edition next weekend. We might call it the "Riskless=
 Rebound" edition. Stayed tuned.     [IMAGE] Energy Power Systems (OTC BB: =
EYPSF) Updated Profile [IMAGE]  Followers of Energy Power know it has been =
trading up and down the charts over the last 2 weeks. We are suggesting the=
 company change its symbol to OTIS as the stock goes up and down like an Ot=
is Elevator.   For investors looking for more information on Energy Power, =
the editors of the OTC Journal have updated our original profile to reflect=
 changing corporate events subsequent to the original release on February 1=
2th.   Click Here  to review the updated profile. If you never read our ori=
ginal release this would be an excellent opportunity to familiarize yoursel=
f with this company.     [IMAGE] Envoy Communications (NASDAQ: ECGI) Update=
 [IMAGE]  Our inbox is filled with questions on Envoy as the stocks fades i=
nto the oblivion of the $1 range. The stock is behaving as if there is some=
thing wrong with the company.   We spoke with management briefly this week =
about this issue. At the corporate level nothing has changed. Fiscal 2001, =
which ended at the end of September, still looks like roughly $10 million C=
DN in EBITDA profits. As of right now, business for fiscal 2002 looks about=
 the same as 2001. The stock is trading at about 3 times 2002 EBITDA. The i=
ndustry average is currently 11 times 2002 EBITDA.   What's the explanation=
 for this pathetic performance? Simple- management is doing nothing at this=
 time to market their company to investors. Their only audience is the memb=
ers of the OTC Journal.   A plan for a nationwide institutional road show w=
as in place prior to Attack on America, but that is now on hold. We can onl=
y hope management will wake up and recognize their responsibility to shareh=
olders and get proactive in telling their story.    Tax selling could hurt =
this stock, so it could go lower. One can only hope that despite management=
's failure to get out and tell their story, someone will come along and rec=
ognize the inherent value in this company.   Bottom line- Not worth selling=
 at this price, but it could go lower.     [IMAGE] Attention Football Fans =

endly wager on a football game, www.gridpicks.com  is for you.   Go to the =
