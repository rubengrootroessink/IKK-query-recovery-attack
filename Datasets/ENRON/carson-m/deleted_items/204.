   Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keyshawn John=
son , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second h=
alf of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a ri=
ght knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing wi=
th a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an =
MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are s=
aying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably cou=
ld not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmit=
t Smith! , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself OK de=
spite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory =
over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be=
 all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the =
degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk o=
ff the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at th=
e New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Mon=
day, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunte Cu=
lpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28/01 According to published =
reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Ba=
y. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - P=
owers Rangers Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards agains=
t New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted b=
ack to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike An=
derson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 4=
0 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-y! ar!=
 d run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yar=
ds also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.=
  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught fi=
ve passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scori=
ng threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Tr=
oy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes f=
or 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 ya=
rds. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive te=
ams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated =
10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the pa=
st, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie=
 and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a =
Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01=
 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two =
passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and J=
ones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems=
 to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside th=
e red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Centers=
 was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bil=
ls ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemers=
ma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price  =
, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 ya=
rds and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to=
 have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hassel=
beck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as=
 a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he contin=
ued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfi=
eld on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - DeWaynes Demons Updated=
 10/! 28! /01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consid=
ering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked r=
espectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post=
 good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his ove=
rall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/28/01 Gadsd=
en caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is n=
ot playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James Mc=
Knight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes =
for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receive=
r continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG =
- Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carrie=
s by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should=
 not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens =
Killers Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and ! a ! =
TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter wh=
at the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/=
01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the e=
nd zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins conti=
nue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks =
, QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs=
 and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playin=
g well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feel=
eys Fanatics Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was =
held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 =
yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should po=
st better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buck=
halter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back =
is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Ga=
rner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for=
 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him=
 firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remain=
s sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passe=
d for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game a=
t Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, an=
d we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McN=
abb  , QB PHI - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 y=
ards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepte=
d either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raide=
rs' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a s=
lump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quart=
erback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Cars=
ons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sun=
day at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, an=
d we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the re=
mainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Rangers Updated 10/28/=
01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. Whil=
e Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspect=
ive, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in=
 the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team. =
 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 2=
33 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, f=
urther exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates o=
therwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   C=
owboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinal=
s to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in t=
he game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspectiv=
e based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believ=
ing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  C!=
 li! nt Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed =
9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushin=
g for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona=
. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a=
 weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based=
 on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Smith l=
eft Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right k=
nee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be ev=
aluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Johnso=
n left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He =
was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replac=
ed by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.  More Updates  View Transactions  [=
