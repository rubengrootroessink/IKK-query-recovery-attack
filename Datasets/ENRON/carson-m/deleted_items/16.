---------------------------------------------
 
Some excitement last Saturday - The men's team beat 9th ranked  Oklahoma State!  WOW! Watch out Jayhawks!
 
Larry Reid scored 13 of his game-high 18
points in the second half as  Kansas State upset ninth-ranked Oklahoma
State, 70-61, in a Big 12 Conference  men's basketball game Saturday
at Bramlage  Coliseum.
        The victory was the  Wildcats' second straight over a team
that opened the week among the leaders  in the Big 12. Kansas State,
which beat Texas on Wednesday, improved to 9-10  overall and 3-5 in
the league.
----------------------------------------------
 
A little disappointment for the ladies team - an upset by Iowa State
 
Lindsey Wilson scored 25 points, Tracy
Gahan added 21 and Angie Welle  had 20 points as 16th-ranked Iowa
State upset No. 9 Kansas State, 86-72, in a  Big 12 Conference women's
basketball game played Saturday before a sellout  crowd of 13,340.
        The victory  lifted the Cyclones to 17-5 overall and 5-5 in
the Big 12. Kansas State had a  three-game winning streak snapped and
fell to 20-3 and 8-2 in the league. The  Wildcats also had an 11-game
home winning streak stopped.

See you tonight.
 
GO CATS!
