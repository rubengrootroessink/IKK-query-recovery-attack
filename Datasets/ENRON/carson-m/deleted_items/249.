 Journal Members:     [IMAGE] Riskless Rebound Portfolio [IMAGE]  Our Novem=
ber 2nd  edition, titled the Riskless Rebound portfolio, continues to climb=
 the charts. As of today's market close, the portfolio as a whole has now a=
ppreciated fully 36.75% over a brief two weeks. The Deutshce Bank Alex Brow=
n IPO Endwave Corporation (NASDAQ: ENWV) is leading the way, up 52% from $.=
84 to $1.28. The company came public on October 17, 2000 at $14 per share, =
and still has $1.78 per share in cash.   Readers will recall we computed th=
e portfolio would rise 88% if each of the five stocks simply appreciated to=
 the level of cash they had in the bank. Therefore, we believe there is con=
siderably more upside in this group of five stocks.   However, the NASDAQ m=
arket has rebounded dramatically off the September 21st lows, and is probab=
ly a little ahead of itself. Therefore, we would caution members who are lo=
oking for good entry levels to wait for a correction sometime between now a=
nd the end of the year before entering or adding to positions. If such a pu=
llback occurs, we will try to help you choose a good entry level.   To view=
 past editions of the OTC Journal in chronological order, put this web addr=

y Power (OTC BB: EYPSF) - September Quarterly Financial Results Strong   [I=
MAGE]  Short Sellers had to be a little demoralized by corporate performanc=
e when Energy Power released it's September (1st Quarter) Financial results=
 on Thursday.   The stock staged a remarkable turn around on Wednesday when=
 the bear assault forced the stock down from nearly $6 to a low of about $4=
. The stock turned around rapidly, and rebounded back above $5 when the com=
pany announced its year end audited results.   The stock continues trading =
over 1 million shares per day, which is historically unprecedented. The vol=
ume needs to quiet in order to identify a true support level for the stock.=
 In the interim, based on historical trading patterns, that the next massiv=
e volume surge will take the stock above the $6 level. Members who chose to=
 take profits when the stock traded above our target price of $5.60 should =
look to re-enter.   Another bear assault on the stock might be just such an=
 opportunity. If the stock drops dramatically again as the result of anothe=
r smear campaign we will get the word out as quickly as possible.   In the =
interim, shareholders should be heartened by September quarterly financial =
results, which are as follows:   Consolidated revenues were $5.5 million, u=
p from $4.5 million last year (up 22%). Consolidated gross profits were $1 =
million, up from $.70 million last year (up 43%). Consolidated EBITDA profi=
ts were $.6 million, up from $.1 million last year (up 500%). Consolidated =
profits were $.40 million, up from a loss of $.1 last year. Earnings Per Sh=
are were $.05, up from a loss of $.07 last year. all figures in Canadian Do=
llars  Improved financial results were attributed to revenue flow from the =
newly formed Oil and Gas Division, combined with increasing business at the=
 Engineering and Offshore Division. The company's decision to take massive =
voluntary write downs of assets last year also positions the company for in=
creasing profits going forward. Click Here  to read the entire news release=
 on their quarterly results.   The September quarterly financial performanc=
e is outstanding and should serve to reassure long term shareholders that m=
anagement is performing. We expect the September quarter to be the first in=
 a series of ongoing reports of growth in revenues and profits.     [IMAGE]=
 XMLG Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG) Turn Around in its Infancy [IMAGE]=
  [IMAGE]  The recent dramatic rise in the price of XML Global, one of our =
featured companies for 2001, has finally quieted, setting the stage for ano=
ther surge to the upside. XML Global is a leading software company developi=
ng tools for the revolutionary new XML programming language which is widely=
 viewed as the "Holy Grail" of ecommerce.   Despite the most challenging cl=
imate imaginable for a B to B middleware company, evidence is building that=
 XML Global's fortunes are turning back up. After making a 300% move in fiv=
e trading days, the stock has pulled back a little and quieted down, provid=
ing an excellent entry level for investors looking for powerful turn around=
 situations in the speculative end of the market.   Recent corporate develo=
pments support the notion that now is the time to accumulate this stock. Si=
nce the beginning of November the company has announced three major new con=
tracts- One with the city of Vancouver, one with the Canadian Federal Gover=
nment, and one with HomeSource Capital.    The OTC Journal believes the Hom=
eSource Capital contract to be the most important. XML is viewed by many as=
 the future of interserver communication between corporate computer systems=
. Corporate expansion has slowed to a crawl during this recession, but as s=
oon as IT spending picks up XML Global is positioned to grab a significant =
market share.   While most large corporations are embroiled in a bottoming =
business cycle, home finance companies are booming in a strong refinance ma=
rket fueled by low interest rates. The HomeSource Capital contract suggests=
 many other companies will use XML Global software as the business climate =
improves. Click Here  to read the entire text of the HomeSource contract.  =
 While there is some risk of a slight pullback in this stock as a result of=
 year end tax selling, we believe now is the time for bargain basement shop=
pers. The company is gaining the momentum we thought they would have before=
 the recession, and as business turns up there is no telling where this com=
pany could go. If you want to own a $.35 stock that has a good chance of go=
ing back to $1, here's your opportunity.   Charts Provided Courtesy Of Trad=
