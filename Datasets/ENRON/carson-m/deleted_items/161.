atest NFL Player News  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 10/18/01 =
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But t=
he Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilg=
er , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in t=
he Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against th=
e underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at =
tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against N=
ew England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Powers Rangers Updated 10/=
18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New=
 England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this wee=
k.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected t=
o start in pl! ac! e of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutiv=
e week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineu=
p.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suua=
lly performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law=
 in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyt=
on Manning , QB IND - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform w=
ell the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots=
 three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Ra=
ndy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participat=
e in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to p=
ractice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off decidin=
g on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  =
Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed pra=
ctice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should =
play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him th=
is week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - Feeleys Fanatics Updated ! 10! /18/01 Glenn=
 might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have=
 trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn=
't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18=
/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts=
 this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in h=
is second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Dem=
ons Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far.=
 He could have a ! go! od week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Ra=
ms. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan ar=
ound Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/18/=
01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held do=
wn by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his do=
wnfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Chargers Updated 10/18/01 Martin w=
ill be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try=
 to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB W=
AS - Kens Killers Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the s=
eason on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player =
due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous ma=
tchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony =
Banks , QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre agai=
nst Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards a=
nd one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outsi=
de of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats ! Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he coul=
d have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the =
Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.=
   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde m=
ight not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunis=
tic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of t=
he year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will li=
kely get most of the work at tight ! en! d now that Stephen Alexander is ou=
t. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod =
Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent =
game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth consid=
ering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt ,=
 WR STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post =
big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time =
Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   =
Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Powers Rangers Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been ve=
ry consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching=
. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets sec=
ondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has =
become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's wort=
h staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on =
your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/18/01 C=
anida! te! will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back t=
his weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' off=
ense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   K=
urt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/18/01 Considering the hug=
e numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every =
week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so b=
e sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Dans Dawgs U=
pdated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised =
if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. =
Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter wil=
l likely be the more pr! od! uctive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB=
 PHI - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy play=
ers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat =
the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure =
to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Woltys Wonders Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite t=
argets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary=
 is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts=
 Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a spra=
ined medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources sa=
y Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questio=
nable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis=
 , TE PHI - Commissioner Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at pr=
oducing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's =
one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on=
 a weekly basis.   More Updates   Transactions NFL Reports  [IMAGE]'); [IMA=
