MARTIN SHOOTS  WESTERN CAROLINA TO VICTORY
         MANHATTAN, Kan. - Freshman Kevin Martin finished with 29
points, including  six three-pointers, to lift Western Carolina to a
66-64 victory over Kansas  State in a men's college basketball game
Wednesday at Bramlage  Coliseum.
        The win lifted the  Catamounts to 6-3 overall and was their
third straight victory. Western  Carolina won at Florida State on Dec.
8 to start the winning streak. Martin  also had 29 points in the
Catamounts' last outing, a home win over  Guilford.
        The Wildcats fell to 5-4  overall.
        Gilson DeJesus led Kansas  State with 18 points, including a
5-for-7 effort from three-point range.  Travis Reynolds chipped in
with 13 points and 14 rebounds, his third  double-double of the
season. Larry Reid had eight points and six assists for  the Wildcats.
        A 15-point run in a  five-minute stretch early in the second
half helped the Catamounts erase a  45-35 deficit. Casey Rogers had a
pair of three-pointers and Martin scored  five points in the run that
put Western ahead 50-45 with 10:14  left.
        The Wildcats came back to  tie the game four times through the
remainder of the second half but never  regained the lead. Reynolds
scored to tie the game at 60-60 with 2:42 to  play. But Rogers hit one
of two free throws and Freeman converted a basket  after a Wildcat
miss to push the lead back to three  points.
        Pervis Pasco hit one of  two free throws for K-State with 1:15
left, and made only one of two again  after rebounding a Catamount
miss with 35 seconds left, bringing the Wildcats  within 63-62. Kori
Hatcher then hit a pair of foul shots for Western with 21  seconds to
play before Terence Woodyard stole the ball for the visitors  on
K-State's next possession.
         Woodyard hit one of two foul shots with eight seconds left to
put Western  ahead 66-62. Pasco made the final basket for K-State with
0.2 seconds  left.
        K-State hit just 31 percent  from the floor in the second half
on 9-for-29 shooting. The Wildcats, who hit  42 percent from the field
in the game, were also cold from the line, hitting  only 8 of 19 free
throws.
        The  Catamounts hit 54 percent of their shots in the second
half and finished with  a 15-for-18 mark at the foul line in the game.
Kelvin Wylie had seven  rebounds to lead Western on the  boards.
        Kansas State travels to  15th-ranked Iowa on Saturday before
returning home to play Fairleigh  Dickinson on Dec. 29 at 7 p.m.
