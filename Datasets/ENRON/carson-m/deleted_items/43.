Dear Investor,

The long bear market turned bullish on September 21, 2001.
And few profited as handsomely from this turnaround as
subscribers to Steve Harmon's Broadband Investor did. For
example:

September 17, 2001: Steve Harmon tells his subscribers:
"clearly more has to be done in the area of travel security."
He issues buy signs on eight travel security stocks.

How Does He Do It?

A former computer specialist and high-tech venture capitalist,
Steve Harmon knows the ins & outs of the technology business --
and he sees things that most financial advisors and investors
miss. Broadband Investor deciphers the confusion, chaos and
disruption in the complex but lucrative sectors for today's
investors.

Harmon focuses on companies with the strongest fundamentals,
like market leadership, sales and earnings growth, sector
potential, and management strength. And he steers clear of
momentum darlings that run on hot air but deflate quickly
when speculators run away.

See for yourself why Investors Chronicle calls Steve Harmon
"One of the top 10 online commentators." Why Smart Money lauds
him as "One of three rising stars in technology investing."

And start getting your share of the post-September 2001 rebound
