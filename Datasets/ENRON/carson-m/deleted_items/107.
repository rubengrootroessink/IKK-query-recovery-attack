OTC Investor
Dtomi, Inc. (OTC.BB: DTMI)
January 09, 2002
***********************************************************************

The Bear Market appears to have ended and the market has tested important support levels. Recently the NASDAQ has rallied to over 2000, and the DOW has rallied to over 10,000. The accumulation/distribution indicators have turned extremely positive, meaning institutions and mutual funds have started buying stocks. We believe it is time for investors to get back into the market. Our next recommendation, Dtomi, Inc. (OTC.BB:DTMI), could be one of our top picks of the year. For this reason we here are giving DTMI our highest rating of Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth.

About the Company

DTMI is a technology company that turns data into market intelligence. DTMI combines very sophisticated proprietary software that intelligently researches every aspect of business to business databases for company information, products and manufacturing capacity. DTMI utilizes these proprietary databases to create algorithms that compile and sell high-demand corporate intelligence and marketing information. DTMI's combination of technology and expertise quickly identifies new markets and prospects for client's marketing departments. According to DTMI's management, the company has become one of the leading aggregator and distributors of data from disparate corporate sources. This data is melded into a collective, powerful, interlocking matrix of valuable and concise information. Using DTMI's Market Intelligence Tools, a client-company can compile a comprehensive market report (including total market valuation), pinpoint each unique segment within that market, determine the va!
luation and number of companies that make up that segment, then identify actual buyers of its products. Simply put, the value of DTMI to a client-company is this: the comprehensive analysis that DTMI compiles for its clients is usually done in one day or less and costs on average $5000 to $7000. Using a company's own marketing and research department to compile the same information, and generate similiar quality leads, would take weeks or months and cost tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Revised Earnings

In today's economic climate of layoffs and cost-cutting, companies are looking for ways to save money. DTMI offers a service they cannot afford to pass up. DTMI management is seeing such a rapid acceleration in the number of companies coming to it for services, it has recently revised earnings projections upward. Also, DTMI is signing up clients with longer-term engagements than management had originally projected. This is just one of the reasons we are strongly recommending this stock.

Market Place

Sales of Business Information are expected to reach $58 Billion by 2003 according to Verronis & Suhler. DTMI's market intelligence segment is expected to reach $4 billion in the next several years. As we stated earlier, DTMI's technology can yield detailed market intelligence in a matter of minutes, compared to weeks or more to cultivate the similar data through traditional means, and at an incredible savings. We believe DTMI's technology is far above its competitors, and that it can capture a huge share of its market.

Conclusion

We believe market penetration of 1.5-2% is very achievable for DTMI. That could potentially mean an estimated $80 million-plus in revenues per year. Should the company achieve even half those revenues, our target price will be raised significantly. At $40 million in revenues, and with a 30% net margin, earnings would be $12 million. After-tax income would be $0.54 per share. At a 20 P/E ratio the stock would be worth $10.80 per share; but remember, that's half of what we think it could achieve. Also, according to management, based on early feedback from customers, new business will not be a problem. You can see why we are excited about this stock. Additionally, this company just started trading at $1.70 and, based on the company's quick move out of the blocks, Wall Street is paying attention. At these current price levels the stock is difficult for us to ignore. It looks like DTMI is in a strong upward trend, climbing to higher levels.
