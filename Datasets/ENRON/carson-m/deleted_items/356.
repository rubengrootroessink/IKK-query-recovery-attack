urging action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington=

nergy in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but Republicans are threatening to=
 force a vote through a filibuster.  In turn, Democrats are saying they'll =
filibuster any energy bill containing a provision to open Alaska's Arctic N=
ational Wildlife Refuge to drilling.  The legislation battle continues next=
 week.   Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the =
FERC's major decisions regarding how it assesses market power.  The Commiss=

ton Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage from the Alaska Res=
ources Conference taking place next Thursday and Friday.  We'll also bring =
