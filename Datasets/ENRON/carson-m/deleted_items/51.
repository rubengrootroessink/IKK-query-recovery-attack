The maker of M & M candy wants the world to  decide on a new color - either purple, pink or aqua!  And what color do we,  the Alumni Club of Kansas State University, fans of the color purple, want them  to pick?  PURPLE, of course.  
 
To register to vote (voting starts in March) go  to http://www.m-ms.com/us/index,jsp?s=3 .   This is the web site of M & M reached through the web site of  Masterfoods.  Or you can call them at a toll-free telephone number,  877-MMGLOBE between March 6 and May 31.  Put this on your calendar.   Winning color will be announced on June 19.  
 
Don't forget!
 
Go Cats!
