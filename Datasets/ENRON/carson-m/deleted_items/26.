ONLY THREE DAYS UNTIL THE BIG  DAY!
 
WHAT BIG DAY?, YOU ASK
 
Of course, it is the 3rd annual  KANSAS  KLASH
 
WHERE
 
SRO at Northwest Mall
290 and 610 Loop West
 
WHEN
 
Monday night, February 4
8:00 p.m.
 
ADMISSION
 
Please bring a couple cans of food or boxes of nonperishable  food items for the Northwest Assistance Ministries Food Pantry.  Houston  citizens need our help.
 
This is our annual meeting with the University of Kansas  Alumni Club.  Door prizes will be given away.  Come support our  team!  They were victorious last night in Manhattan against a ranked Texas  team. The 'Hawks better watch out!  The Wildcats are on a  roll!
-----------------------------------
All club activities are approved by the Kansas  State University Alumni Association.

Some club news - As I have said before, Ken and I are  "retiring" (after the Kansas Klash) from our leadership role in the  Houston club.  We have enjoyed it all but feel it is time for some new  ideas and new outlook.  And time for us to do other things!  Aaron  Brammer '95, Angie Benson '01, and Amber Clark '97 will be sharing the  leadership responsibilities.  Please be willing to give these young people  a hand when they ask or when they need it.  We are so pleased to have  Aaron, Angie and Amber take over the core committee and the club  activities.  I guess we could call them the Triple A's - they are coming to  the rescue.  Thanks again for your support all these years. Hope you can  come to the Kansas Klash and meet the Triple A's!  
 
Go 'Cats
