, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards a=
gainst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent w=
eeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents co=
ntinue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - DeWaynes Demons Upd=
ated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes f=
or 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fan=
! ta! sy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Charg=
ers Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards.=
 Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start pla=
yer for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated rec=
eivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11/25/01=
 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a =
fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter =
on most teams right now.!   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 =
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend=
 on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber ,=
 RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD =
against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well re=
cently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more con=
sistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/2=
5/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against =
Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including=
 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers R=
angers Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and=
 two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the=
 matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonders Upda=
ted 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a=
 touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a =
reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Range=
rs Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passe=
s for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most rel=
iable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly ba=
sis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 11/25/01 Jackson ha=
d a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and=
 a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is=
 worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updat=
ed 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yard=
s against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks=
 and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg =
or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried=
 the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in sho=
rt-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for a=
ny Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may n=
ot be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith ,=
 RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense=
 and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has beco=
me a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE -=
 Powers Rangers Updat! ed! 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New O=
rleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty=
 reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe=
 on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers =
Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions=
 against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to lo=
ok like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego a=
fter re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, =
and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Chargers Updated 11=
/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes f=
or 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy =
owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most=
 of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year =
with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs a=
nd one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration a=
s long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA=
 - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards =
at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden =
is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final =
weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler thr=
ew for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performanc=
e may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too incon=
sistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Drunk Mon=
keys Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 r=
ushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to r=
ebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Powe=
rs Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caug! ht! four passes for 32 yards again=
st Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy tea=
ms as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Upda=
ted 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The ro=
okie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like=
 a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis=
 played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a g=
ood backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been =
known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Commissioner Updated=
 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. H=
e posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes=
 for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CA=
R - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 Muhamm! ad! missed Sunday's game against=
 Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game again=
st New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Free =
Agent Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his retu=
rn from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to =
be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL -=
 Commissioner Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwi=
ng for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolin=
a with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy =
numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Alexande=
r caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was no=
t open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if =
he stays healthy.  More Updates  Transactions, View&n! bs! p; [IMAGE]     [=
