t [IMAGE]  As we mentioned in last weekends' edition, we are planning to pu=
blish a list of technology stocks trading well below both their cash and bo=
ok values. These stocks are the fallen angels of the tech wreck.   We view =
some of these ideas as nearly riskless as the stocks are oversold to the po=
int where they are trading below the cash they have per share with little o=
r no debt. While they are all losing money, one can assume these stocks hav=
e the potential to rebound to at least their cash values with the NASDAQ su=
rging nicely.   We have delayed the release of this exciting edition as sev=
eral of the companies had yet to release September quarterly financial stat=
ements. We want to present these ideas based on the most current balance sh=
eets. Some of them have begun moving up in sympathy with the NASDAQ's stell=
ar performance this week, but we believe there is plenty of upside room.   =
Our mid week edition will provide some perspective on the state of the busi=
nesses of these companies, and our riskless rebound ideas will be published=
 next weekend.      [IMAGE] Energy Power (OTC BB: EYPSF) - More Related New=

 back a little, closing nearer to $4.   However, there may be more upside i=
n this surge. The company only has about 8 million shares issued and outsta=

l   CECO Environmental - Industry Leader Calls For Higher Government Standa=
rds For Air Ventilation Systems To Tackle Threat Of Bioterrorism  NEW YORK-=
-(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2001--The supplier of filtration systems to the =
U.S. military's chemical weapons destruction program, CECO Environmental (N=
ASDAQ: CECE - news), is calling on governments to implement higher standard=
s for air ventilation systems in public buildings, including airports, subw=
ays, shopping centers and schools.    The FBI has warned of the potential f=
or the release of toxic chemicals, such as cyanide, into air handling syste=
ms of public buildings. Such systems have one or more fresh air intakes and=
 a blower or similar device that moves the air through the ventilation syst=
em.    ``Currently many of these facilities have no effective filters at al=
l in their ventilation systems,'' says Phil DeZwirek, CECO's Chairman and C=
EO. ``Ventilation systems generally are woefully outdated and there is noth=
ing forcing contractors to upgrade them.'' The Building and Office Manageme=
nt Association (BOMA) has told its members that the release of a toxic chem=
ical into an air handling system is a credible threat. ``Any release would =
be spread throughout the entire system within five minutes or less'' accord=
ing to BOMA, which has advised its members to do all they can to make exter=
nal fresh air intakes less accessible.    While CECO recognizes that this i=
s an important first step, it believes the air ventilation systems themselv=
es must be protected. ``We can do this today. CECO has had technology for y=
ears, including filtering systems that capture airborne biological agents,'=
' says DeZwirek.    CECO has been involved with the chemical weapons destru=
ction program since its inception 15 years ago. Its filtering systems were =
engineered into incinerators where several thousand tons of Sarin and VX ne=
rve gas and blister agents have so far been destroyed, along with more than=
 half a million rockets, bombs, mortars and mines.    ``Our technology has =
successfully filtered all particles from the incineration process,'' says D=
eZwirek. CECO has more than three decades of experience dealing with indust=
rial air pollution. In addition, it has developed and deployed systems that=
 protect workers by successfully capturing deadly dust and poisonous gasses=
 that can be produced during the manufacturing process. Its clients include=
 numerous Fortune 100 companies including DuPont, Exxon and U.S. Steel. ``W=
e have always been in the business of saving lives,'' says DeZwirek. ``We h=
ave built a $100-million dollar business in protecting workers and the publ=
ic at large from the scourge of industrial pollutants. Now we are applying =
our vast knowledge and experience to an even more nefarious problem.'' CECO=
 has established an internal task force to outline and provide recommendati=
ons for immediately and affordably implementing technological solutions tha=
t will help keep Americans safe in the commercial workplace.    ``The milit=
ary has safely destroyed tons of deadly nerve gas with the help of CECO tec=
hnology,'' DeZwirek says. ``Similar filters and air ventilation and purific=
ation systems can and must be deployed to protect the American public.'' AB=
