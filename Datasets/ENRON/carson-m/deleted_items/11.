 =09 =09    Dear Michael,  Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay will not testify at=
 either Congressional hearing this week.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Coo=
k says because of Lay's decision not to appear, the Senate Commerce Committ=
ee is expected to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to Lay as early as T=
uesday morning.  Two House subcommittees could soon issue their own subpoen=
as as well.  A subpoena would compel Lay to appear, but it does not guarant=
ee he will testify - he could invoke his constitutional right not to speak.=
   Other hearings involving Enron will proceed as planned, with three heari=
ngs scheduled for Tuesday morning.  One of the hearings involves Enron boar=
d member William Powers, who will testify in front of the House Energy and =
Commerce Committee's Oversight Subcommittee. Powers led the internal invest=
igation at Enron, resulting in a report released this weekend that was high=
ly critical of the company's management team.  We'll have highlights from P=
owers' testimony on Tuesday from Washington.   Unsecured creditors can help=
 ensure a better rate of return on what they're owed by Enron through claim=
s trading.  That's according to Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny Parkins=
.  He'll join us during the noon ET newscast from the Houston bureau to dis=
cuss the process of claims trading and how creditors can assure they will r=
eceive some sort of payment.   Also from Houston on Tuesday, Williams Gas P=
ipeline CEO Doug Whisenant talks about pipeline safety following September =
11. He'll also discuss the future of Williams Gas Pipelines.   We'll have m=
ore from the one-on-one interview between West Coast Bureau Correspondent K=
ym McNicholas and California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta =
Lynch.  Kym says Lynch will discuss the ongoing negotiations with generator=
