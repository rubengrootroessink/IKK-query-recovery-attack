is thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham prob=
ably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in=
 a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trev=
or Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the pr=
actice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dw=
ight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - =
Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and =

ll help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair  , QB TEN - Feel=
eys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from=
 back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the sec=
ond half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys=
 Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week=
, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked r=
ib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throw=

still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys =
Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an=

turned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/0=
1 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a=

B SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will pr=
obably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO =
- Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elit=
e Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the=

 banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depe=
nd on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent=
 Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the N=
o. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however,=
 and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Wei=
nke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup duri=
ng the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average n=
umbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner =
, QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fanta=
sy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the r=
est of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon ha=
s been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many t=
itle teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Won=
ders Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again =
been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your play=
off run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Minnis ha=
sn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the r=
emaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook  , WR WAS - Damons Do=
ormats Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fa=
ntasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Ga=
rdner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very in=
consistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardne=
r isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01=
 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use hi=
m during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated=
 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he i=
s too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB =
- Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this =
season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green =
, QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fant=
asy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill=
