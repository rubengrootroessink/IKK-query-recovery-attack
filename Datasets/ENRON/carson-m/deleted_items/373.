  NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Olandis Gary =
, RB DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/26/01 The Broncos placed Gary on injur=
ed reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This offi=
cially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop hi=
m from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11=
/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the second half =
of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did not thro=
w a touchdo! wn! pass for the first time this season, however, and has been=
 very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues to s=
truggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week 12. =
 Charlie Batch , QB DET - Damons Doormats Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear wh=
o will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Bat=
ch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. =
Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go,=
 but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears sec=
ondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.  Quincy Carter , Q=
B DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Carte=
r will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's ga=
me against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for Dall=
as, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don't r=
ecommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Feeleys =
Fanatics Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesot=
a with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroi=
t. Keep an eye on h! is! progress during practice this week before you make=
 a final decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/2=
6/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstring =
problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game against S=
an Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him fo=
r Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/26/01 Graham suff=
ered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is day=
 to day.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11/26/01 Brookins =
may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore will elevate =
Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo as =
a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/26/01 Barlow dis=
located his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not been det=
ermined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE -! D! amons Doormats Updated 11/26/01 =
Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day=
 to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is l=
isted as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was take=
n for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's =
Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/2=
6/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched=
 at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mi=
tchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the B=
engals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell=
 , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for =
80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play i=
n recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as op=
ponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - DeWaynes =
Demons Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught fiv=
e passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack rem=
ains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL -=
 Chargers Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 =
yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-sta=
rt player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrat=
ed receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11=
/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also l=
ost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy st=
arter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 11/25=
/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't de=
pend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barb=
er , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a=
 TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards.! H! e has played =
well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a m=
ore consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Updat=
ed 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day a=
gainst Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, in=
cluding 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - P=
owers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 ya=
rds and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting w=
hen the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonde=
rs Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yard=
s and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is =
only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Power=
s Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching si=
x passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against Sa! n ! Diego. He's one of t=
he most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on =
a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 11/25/01=
 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 7=
8 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver=
, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Mo=
nkeys Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes =
for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in r=
ecent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB =
OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheat=
ley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more o=
ften in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of sta=
rting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully health=
y, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antow=
ain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of to=
tal offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smi=
th has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brad=
y , QB NE - Powers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers again=
st New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become =
a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew=
 Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - C=
hargers Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no inter=
ceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continu=
ed to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , =
WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San=
 Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay J=
enkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Chargers Up=
dated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six =
pa! ss! es for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, =
and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointm=
ent for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing =
of the year with a mediocre performance.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright =
