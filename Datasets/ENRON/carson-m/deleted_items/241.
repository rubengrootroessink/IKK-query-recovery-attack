McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from=
 practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable f=

saac Byrd will likely start in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Char=
gers Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four=
 games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve r=

QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against=
 Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   S=
pergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's=
 game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wy=
nn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inex=
perienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB N=
E - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago=
 Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entren=
ched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expenda=
ble to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing ga=

n Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not=
 been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed ve=
teran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will b=
e a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Up=
dated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expecte=

xpected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 1=
2/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury t=
his week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Br=
ian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as p=
robable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davi=
s , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. =
2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amoun=
t of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many do=
uble tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nu=
ts Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able t=
o play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair=
 , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practic=
e on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fa=
ntasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smi=
th , WR JAC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practi=
ce time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk=
