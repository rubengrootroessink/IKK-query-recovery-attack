ws  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Watters has placed=
 on injured reserve. He will not play again this season. Shaun Alexander wi=
ll be the starter for Seattle's final three games.   Brian Griese , QB DEN =
- Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/19/01 Griese should be able to return from a conc=
ussion after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB.   Joe=
 Jurevicius , WR NYG - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/19/01 Jurevicius (hamstring=
) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep=
 ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary.   Travis Henry , RB BUF=
 - Kens Killers Updated 12/19/01 Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprai=
ned right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place.   Tim Dwight  , WR SD=
 - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to pl=
ay this week. He has not produced very much this year when healthy.  Tyrone=
 Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/19/01 Wheatley, who was not us=
ed last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will prob=
ably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams.   Derrick Mas=
on , WR TEN - Kens Killers Updated 12/19/01 Mason missed Tuesday's practice=
 with a hip flexor injury. His current status is day to day.  Steve McNair =
, QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/19/01 McNair (back stiffness) missed=
 practice on Tuesday. His current status is day to day.   Chris Sanders , W=
R TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Sanders has returned to practice from a=
 back injury. He is not expected to play this week.   Tony Richardson , RB =
KC - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Richardson is day to day with a shoulder i=
njury. He is expected to play on Sunday.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg o=
r Nuts Updated 12/19/01 Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained h=
amstring. He is expected to play on Saturday.  Bill Gramatica , K ARI - Car=
sons Wildcats Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reser=
ve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three=
 games of the season.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01=
 Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder.  H=
e might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gain=
ed 73 yards Sunday.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/19/=
01 The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week=
. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday ag=
ainst Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin=
 injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back =
and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playi=
ng in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health sta=
tus makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start =
for Bettis.  Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Titans Head =
Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over th=
e final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennessean . =
"We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Skip, if=
 at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to =
get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's prod=
uction over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.  Steve McNair =
, QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/18/01 McNair will miss Tuesday's pra=
ctice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's=
 game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to rep=
air a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday=
. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for=
 Week 15.  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Zereoue re-i=
njured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His s=
tatus for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a ma=
rginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.  Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Free Agen=
t Updated 12/18/01 The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured rese=
rve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese w=
ill probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson se=
rving as his backup.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Damons Doormats Updated 12/1=
8/01 According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remain=
der of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly star=
ter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel W=
hite, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of =
the way if Jackson is out.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Updated =
12/18/01 Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for=
 this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. D=
on't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based=
 on the Ravens' strong rush defense.  Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent =
Updated 12/18/01 Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due =
to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand.=
 Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be w=
orth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.  Akili Smi=
th  , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Bengals placed Smith on inju=
red reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. =
He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring t=
o the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the seas=
on if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the r=
est of the year anyway.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01=
 The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnat=
i after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 car=
ries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three afte=
r he recovered from a hand inj! ur! y. None of the three is a worthy starte=
r in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.   Doug Flutie , QB S=
D - Powers Rangers Updated 12/18/01 Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Mon=
day that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of roo=
kie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playin=
g time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player=
 during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he cou=
ld sit in favor of Brees at any time.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonde=
rs Updated 12/18/01 Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibl=
y Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for=
 Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his stat=
us before you consider using him this week.  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free A=
gent Updated 12/18/01 Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup t=
his week against Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine=
 his true status for the game.   Santana Moss , WR NYJ - Feeleys Fanatics U=
pdated 12/18/01 Moss, still suffering from a strained quadriceps is listed =
as questionable for Sunday's game. The injury has sidelined him the past fe=
w weeks.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 12/18/01 Davis suf=
fered a knee injury during Sunday's loss to Philadelphia. "He's sore today,=
 but he has indicated he'll be fine," Coach Marty Schottenheimer told the W=
ashington Post. Despite the injury, Davis is expected to start against Chic=
ago in Week 15.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Accordi=
ng to the Washington Post, Banks will remain the Redskins' starting quarter=
back. Banks has been very inconsistent recently, but Coach Marty Schottemhe=
imer is expected to stick with him rather than go with backup Kent Graham. =
  Frank Murphy , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Murphy suffered a seve=
rely sprained ankle during Sunday's loss to Chicago. The injury will likely=
 keep him out of this weekend's game against New Orleans.   More Updates  T=
eams, Player News  [IMAGE]Carsons Wildcats Player News  Bill Gramatica , Re=
serve K Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Ro=
okie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games=
 of the season.   Ahman Green , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Green had an awf=
ul outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing yards and 24 recei=
ving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a poor performance.   L=
aDainian Tomlinson , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Tomlinson had only 69 all-p=
urpose yards on Saturday against Oakland. He seems to be wearing down somew=
hat, which makes him more and more of a risk for Fantasy owners.   Kurt War=
ner , Active QB Updated 12/14/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to =
success this week. Expect fine numbers from him against the NFC West rival =
Saints on Monday Night Football.   Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 =
The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularl=
y featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football.   David Patten =
, Active WR Updated 12/14/01 Patten hasn't been a very good Fantasy receive=
r recently. His numbers may suffer now that Terry Glenn has returned.   Fre=
ddie Jones , Reserve TE Updated 12/14/01 Jones has been a Fantasy disappoin=
tment again this year. He won't do much against Oakland on Saturday.  Rod G=
ardner , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 Gardner has been a servicable Fantasy p=
layer this year, but don't count on him to find the end zone against the to=
ugh Philadelphia secondary this week.   Mark Brunell , Reserve QB Updated 1=
2/13/01 Brunell did not practice Wednesday but will play Sunday, according =
to the Florida Times-Union. He is expected to practice on Thursday. Brunell=
 is recovering from a lingering quadriceps injury and an injured finger.  S=
hannon Sharpe , Reserve TE Updated 12/13/01 Sharpe is recovering from a leg=
 injury but is expected to play Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and is liste=
d as probable on the injury report.   Steve Christie , Active K Updated 12/=
12/01 Christie will continue to work on field goals. Both he and Wade Riche=
y, who is working on kickoffs, are not reliable Fantasy kickers.  Michael P=
ittman , Reserve RB Updated 12/02/01 Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 a=
ll-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as=
 a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.  Tr=
avis Prentice , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01 Prentice was traded to the Viki=
ngs, where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a =
Fantasy draft choice right now.   Rams , Active DT Updated 08/30/01 Head Co=
ach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Arc=
huleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (ha=
mstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final =
preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener again=
st Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round sele=
ction on Draft Day.   Steelers , Reserve DT Updated 08/25/01 Defensive back=
 Chad Scott sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee on Sa=
turday. He is expected to have an MRI this weekend, and the team is uncerta=
in of just how long he'll be out.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.CO=
