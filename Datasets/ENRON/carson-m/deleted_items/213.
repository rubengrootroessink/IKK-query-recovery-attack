 Journal Members:      [IMAGE] Year End Update on Astralis LTD (OTC BB: AST=
R)   [IMAGE]  We started covering Astralis at the end of September, prior t=
o the completion of a merger which made Astralis a public company. At the t=
ime we were very excited about the public having the opportunity to get in =
on the ground floor of a potential medical breakthrough at a valuation comm=
ensurate with levels generally reserved for sophisticated investors in the =
biotech industry.   While the stock has been lackluster for the last two mo=
nths, the company announced an Agreement on December 12th which serves to r=
einforce our original hypothesis.   By way of reminder, Astralis "has compl=
eted clinical studies in Venezuela using first generation Psoraxine to trea=
t 3,000 psoriasis patients, the majority of whom responded positively with =
few side effects. Of the 3,000 treated patients, 638 achieved complete remi=
ssion, whilst nearly half of all patients experienced a reduction in diseas=
e of between 70% and 90%, as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity In=
dex (PASI), a validated outcomes measure. Overall, 96% of the patients had =
a positive response to Psoraxine, although these results have not yet been =
independently verified." from December 12 press release.   On December 12th=
, Astralis revealed it had entered into several agreements with SkyePharma =
PLC (NASDAQ: SKYE), a British pharmaceutical company which specializes in d=
rug delivery technologies.   The press release revealed that Astralis will =
pay a $5 million license fee for drug deliveries technologies. Conversely, =
SkyePharma will invest $20 million directly into Astralis in the form of a =
convertible preferred security in return for 15.3% of the company.   SkyePh=
arma's investment of $20 million in return for 15.3% of the company implies=
 they see upside in Astralis' technology at a $130 million valuation, a lev=
el from which they certainly hope and intend to make a substantial return o=
n their investment.   Based on the current price of the stock, and our esti=
mate of 38 million shares issued and outstanding, the market is currently p=
lacing a value on the company of just over $100 million.   Simply put, this=
 means Astralis can be purchased up to about $3.40 per share before you are=
 paying more than SkyePharma was willing to pay. They are investing $20 mil=
lion.   SkyePharma's revenues were up 40% through the first six months of 2=
001, an explosive growth rate and the sign of a well managed company.   Loo=
k for this stock to start behaving better in 2002. Once the funding is comp=
leted, Astralis will be positioned to apply for an upgraded listing to eith=
er the NASDAQ or the American Stock Exchange.   The risk associated with an=
 investment in Astralis is mitigated greatly by the capital they now have t=
o fund the New Drug Application and a partnership with a successful interna=
tional biotech company.   Here is the complete text of the news release for=

eements For Promising New Psoriasis Treatment  LONDON, and FLORHAM PARK, N.=
J., Dec. 12 /PRNewswire -- SkyePharma PLC (Nasdaq: SKYE; LSE: SKP) and Astr=
alis LTD (OTC Bulletin Board: ASTR - news) announce several agreements conc=
erning the formulation and development of Astralis' novel injectable vaccin=
e therapy, Psoraxine(TM), for the treatment of all forms of psoriasis, a ch=
ronic skin disorder that affects approximately 3% of the world population. =
  Under the terms of a technology access agreement, SkyePharma will receive=
 from Astralis a US$5 million license fee, which will be recognised as reve=
nue over the lifetime of the contract, for access to DepoFoam and other rel=
evant drug delivery technologies. In addition, through a service agreement,=
 SkyePharma will provide all development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and c=
linical development services for second generation Psoraxine, up to the com=
pletion of Phase II clinical studies. On completion of Phase II studies, As=
tralis will offer SkyePharma the option to acquire the worldwide licensing =
and distribution rights to Psoraxine. If SkyePharma does not take the optio=
n, Astralis will seek a marketing partner to fund Phase III clinical studie=
s and to provide a sales and marketing infrastructure. It is anticipated th=
at an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to start Phase I-B clinica=
l studies will be filed with the US Food and Drug Administration in the fir=
st half of 2002.   In a separate transaction, SkyePharma will make a total =
equity investment in Astralis of up to US$20 million in convertible preferr=
ed shares, on payment for which SkyePharma will own 15.3% of Astralis. Skye=
Pharma will make an initial investment of US$10 million on signature of the=
 agreement. The remaining US$10 million investment will be paid at times an=
d in quantities, amongst other conditions, dependent on the date of filing =
the US IND, up to January 31, 2003.   There is no approved cure for psorias=
is. Most approved treatment protocols provide temporary or incomplete relie=
f and may, with certain systemic treatments, cause serious side effects. Ps=
oraxine, developed by Astralis' Chairman Dr. Jose Antonio O'Daly MD, PhD, i=
s a protein that stimulates cells from the patient's immune system to rever=
se the inflammatory process responsible for psoriasis symptoms.   Astralis =
has completed clinical studies in Venezuela using first generation Psoraxin=
e to treat 3,000 psoriasis patients, the majority of whom responded positiv=
ely with few side effects. Of the 3,000 treated patients, 638 achieved comp=
lete remission, whilst nearly half of all patients experienced a reduction =
in disease of between 70% and 90%, as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Se=
verity Index (PASI), a validated outcomes measure. Overall, 96% of the pati=
ents had a positive response to Psoraxine, although these results have not =
yet been independently verified.   Professor James Leyden, a Board member o=
f the American Academy of Dermatology and past chairman of the Dermatology =
Foundation, said, ``I have had the opportunity to review the data generated=
 in Venezuela, and was very encouraged by the results. I believe Psoraxine =
could be an exciting new treatment alternative for many of the world's psor=
iasis sufferers. We look forward to becoming an integral part of the ongoin=
g clinical program.''   Michael Ashton, SkyePharma's chief executive office=
r commented, ``Our ability to provide Astralis with manufacturing, pre-clin=
ical, clinical and regulatory services, as well as access to a broad drug d=
elivery technology platform, makes SkyePharma ideally suited to their needs=
. We, in turn, are very excited by the opportunity to share in Astralis' pr=
omising discovery. It is rare to find a potential drug that has already sho=
wn such encouraging, early-stage clinical results in around 3,000 patients.=
''   Astralis' Chief Executive Officer, Mike Ajnsztajn, said, ``We are exci=
ted to enter into this agreement with SkyePharma, because they have a prove=
n track record in achieving FDA approval for novel products as evidenced by=
 the dermatological product, Solaraze, indicated for actinic keratosis. Thi=
s relationship will enable us to validate the results from our prior clinic=
al studies and to move aggressively toward gathering the necessary data for=
 US regulatory and marketing approval. SkyePharma's equity investment confi=
rms our collective commitment to introduce this promising product.''   This=
 press release may contain forward-looking statements regarding SkyePharma =
PLC or Astralis LTD. Actual results may differ materially from those descri=
bed in the press release as a result of a number of factors, including but =
not limited to the following: There can be no assurance that Psoraxine will=
 be successfully developed or manufactured, or that final results of human =
clinical trials will result in the regulatory approvals required to market =
products, or that final regulatory approval will be received in a timely ma=
nner, if at all, or that patient and physician acceptance of this product w=
ill be achieved. SkyePharma PLC and Astralis LTD undertake no obligation to=
 revise or update any such forward-looking statement to reflect events or c=
ircumstances after the date of this release.   Notes   Astralis LTD, an eme=
rging biotechnology company based in New Jersey, focuses on the research an=
d development of novel treatments for immune system disorders and skin dise=
ases. Psoraxine, the company's first product, is an innovative drug under d=
evelopment for psoriasis, and is based on the company's discovery of a new =
gene sequence of proteins. To date, clinical data suggest remission of this=
 skin condition in patient trials in Venezuela.   SkyePharma PLC, an establ=
ished drug delivery company, based in the UK, provides innovative services =
to major pharmaceutical partners from the point of drug discovery through t=
he approval process. Its five technologies, oral, injectable, inhalation, t=
opical, and nanoparticulate solubilisation encompass the vast majority of d=
elivery systems in use by the pharmaceutical industry. For more information=

Psoriasis is a chronic, genetically based remitting and relapsing scaly and=
 inflammatory skin disorder that affects approximately 3% of the world's po=
pulation. Psoriasis symptoms result from the overproduction of skin by bloo=
d cells associated with the immune system. These blood cells become confuse=
d and act as though the skin was damaged, manufacturing skin cells at a muc=
h faster rate than is required by undamaged skin. The overproduction of ski=
n can cause everything from itchy rash like patches to painful pustules and=
 massive inflammation. Most current treatments are sub-optimal and some sys=
temic treatments can cause serious side effects.    Additional information =
