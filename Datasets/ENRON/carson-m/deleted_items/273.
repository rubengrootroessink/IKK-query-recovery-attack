, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA -=
 DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss anoth=
er two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many conten=
ding Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up s=
ome fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Powers =
Rangers Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Dr=
ew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this! =
w! eek," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right =
now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jon=
athan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start =
in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is =
still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to=
 practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for anothe=
r two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key per=
former for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flut=
ie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego =
Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew B=
rees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about c=
ontroversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our =
quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week." Sti=
ll, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mar=
k Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest=
 of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely aff=
ect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the be=
st run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or =
Nuts Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer =
being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinne=
y , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/2! 0/! 01 Kinney (calf) may play this we=
ek after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early t=
his week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (ca=
lf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week =
11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 The Tennesse=
an says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facil=
ity on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any pract=
ice time this w! ee! k.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11=
/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start a=
gainst Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/20/01 Mi=
nnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have=
 to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/0=
1 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game aga=
inst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome =
Pathon , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for t=
he season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also h=
urting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the start=
ing lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/20/01 Dave =
Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no Q! B ! controversy surrounding =
Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said.=
 ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared=
 away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Dem=
ons Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) w=
ill be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. =
"We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan tol=
d the Denver Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's i=
n a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help ou=
r team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay ,=
 RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch=
 Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try=
 to get him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevi=
n Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a ri=
b injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Phi=
ladelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player=
 at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring=
 any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, =
who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any =
after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Ja=
cquez Green , WR TB - Kens Killers Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expe=
cted to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsi=
stent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrel=
l Owens , WR SF - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained lef=
t knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against=
 Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is ex=
pected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin =
, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury d=
uring Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but =
is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has n=
o real value as a Fantasy player! , ! but he is a key blocker for Duce Stal=
ey.    Giants , DT NYG - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 According to the=
 New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee be=
gan giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsu=
re that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday ni=
ght, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you shou=
ld consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. =
  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 ! Th! e Baltimore Sun =
says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's start=
ing QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy t=
eams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still =
dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game agains=
t Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at thi=
s point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 Defensive e=
nd Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee s=
urg! er! y. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore =
defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.  =
  Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley,=
 who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get=
 the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep D=
enver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas=
' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Charger=
s Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denve=
r. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told t=
he Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to=
 Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.   =
  Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruise=
d ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practic=
e time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. T=
he Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn=
 into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after mis=
sing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play=
 on Sunday against San Diego.   More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE] [IMAG=
