, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - J=
ugg or Nuts Updated 11/24/01 Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami=
 Dolphins on Dec. 2. He has missed the past two games while recovering from=
 his second arthroscopic surgery this year.   Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Power=
s Rangers Updated 11/24/01 Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He =
broke a bone in his left leg during Thursday's game.   Darnay Scott , WR CI=
N - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable =
for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss =
the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Alle=
n , RB CHI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Al=
len will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Viki=
ngs lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Wee=
k 11.   Anthony Thomas! , RB CHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/23/01Accordi=
ng to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's gam=
e against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely =
be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL -=
 Chargers Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He ga=
ined only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for m=
ost of the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/0=
1 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list=
 Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught=
 just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.=
    James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushe=
d for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stin=
ger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained righ=
t ankle, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Damons=
 Doormats Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdow=
ns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series=
 in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch s=
aid he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His st=
atus for next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at =
Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunda=
y's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution,=
 but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks =
in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.  =
  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven cat=
ches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also wen=
t over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best r=
eceiver in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DE=
N - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. H=
e has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  ! Olandis Gary=
  , RB DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left =
leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest o=
f the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis mig=
ht be able to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Update=
d 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump=
 against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he m=
ay catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01=
! The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis=
' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start hi=
m every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent =
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats a=
nd may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated =
11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense=
 has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner=
 Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent w=
eeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basi=
s. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, =
but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell=
 Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very we=
ll at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on t=
o open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key rece=
iver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanat! ic! s Update=
d 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brow=
n downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brow=
n into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Door=
mats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the =
Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York =
is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative =
on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 P=
atten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has bee=
n inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. =
Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should conside=
r using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers=
 Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners th=
is season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him=
 the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints se=
condary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or N! ut! s Updated 11/21/01 Smith =
has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go u=
p against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get =
him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or=
 Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and =
we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove h=
imself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the rem=
ainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/0=
1 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few =
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues=
.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use=
 Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He =
could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak agains=
t the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 =
Gonzalez will rack up good! F! antasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. Wh=
ile he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active e=
very week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis ru=
shed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zon=
e once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may =
have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth =
around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Par=
ker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' sec=
ondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might=
 make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free =
Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in =
recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks o=
n Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you a=
re in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting i=
n your lineup.  More Updates  Schedule, Breakdown  [IMAGE] Woltys Wonders P=
