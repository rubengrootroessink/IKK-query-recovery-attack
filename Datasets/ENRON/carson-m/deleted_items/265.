hargers Updated 11/19/01 Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his su=
rgically-repaired toe, and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is st=
ill expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on th=
e artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankl=
e) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. He won=
'! t ! make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him=
 in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Commissioner Updated 11/19/01 Lewis su=
ffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injur=
y isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this we=
ekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics=
 Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb=
, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this wee=
k. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.   Packers , DT =
GB - Damons Doormats Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractu=
red left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out ind=
efinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will like=
ly take over the starting duties in Butler's absence.   Steve McNair , QB T=
EN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an inju=
ry to his right thumb, but the Tennesse! an!  says he will probably miss so=
me practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's n=
ext game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/19/01 Hakim=
 left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were n=
egative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free =
Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His curren=
t status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/19=
/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's=
 game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven =
passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the=
 game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.=
   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a s=
trained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did n=
ot return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR=
 ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit =
on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured =
his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy C=
arter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01  Carter feels as though his ha=
mstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the=
 Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his s=
tarting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this seaso=
n to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jack=
son , RB CLE - Damons Doormats Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland =
Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. J=
ackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gameti=
me had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence=
 of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , =
QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this =
weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the tea=
m's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than w=
aiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first q=
uarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philade=
lphia is uncertain at this time.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated=
 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Den=
ver, told the Washington Post that there's a "definite possibility" he woul=
d be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graha=
m would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive F=
antasy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Update=

ee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas! f! ac=

hsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained h=
is left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Wee=
k 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monke=
ys Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against=
 the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried t! he! ball 10 times for 28 yards. It i=
s apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams=
, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbroo=
k , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes =
for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie =
Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year sl=
owly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/18/01 Plummer thre=
w for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar=
 performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this sea=
son.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/18/01 The awfu=
l Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't =
start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  =
David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD pass=
es for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at =
TE, con! si! der Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  =
Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 y=
ards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The=
 Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal lin=
e as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.=
  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 pa=
sses for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and f=
umbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers dur=
ing the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keysh=
awn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 pa=
sses for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone a=
gain. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thi=
