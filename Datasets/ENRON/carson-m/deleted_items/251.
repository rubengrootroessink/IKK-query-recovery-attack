 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Dans=
 Dawgs Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's ga=
me against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga=
me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis =
, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi=
s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into =
effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabi! li! tate=
 with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work t=
oward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK -=
 Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game wit=
h the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Z=
ack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is exp=
ected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a ri=
sky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fana=
tics Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's gam=
e against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball durin=
g individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely t=
o play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week a=
s a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/16/01 Smith will r=
eturn to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games wit=
h a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's =
practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His =
return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use e=
ither back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI =
- Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL inju=
ry report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game aga=
inst Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a l=
arger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secon=
dary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , Q=
B CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke =
will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. H=
owever, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , =
QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good =
Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this =
season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy pe=
rspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris =
Carter, WR MIN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be =
down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benchin=
g. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good=
 game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday nigh=
t.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed a=
s probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury=
. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench=
 him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams=
 , RB NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fant=
asy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'=
ll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season lon=
g, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Kens Killers Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, thr=
owing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this seaso=
n, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, espe=
cially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO=
 - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San =
Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll f=
ace a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Wee=
k 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB=
 WAS - Kens K! il! lers Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play afte=
r beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his las=
t four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give=
 him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to hi=
gh scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks=
 has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games.=
 He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be bea=
ten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy l=
eagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Wes=
tbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown=
 passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend =
that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth cons=
idering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/16/01 Gardner=
 has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes f=
or 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, =
however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons=
 Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so =
starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. =
He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid usi=
ng him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Carsons Wildcats =
Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he=
's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New En=
gland secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy=
 team! b! ased on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR=
 STL - Powers Rangers Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy=
 totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the leagu=
e. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's =
still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Fau=
lk , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game agains=
t Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league.=
 He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 aga=
inst New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Co=
nwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is som=
ewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, h=
owever, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choi=
ce but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 =
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but =
don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting ei=
ther back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend ag=
ainst St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so st=
arting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he'=
s still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success a=
gainst San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Mu=
hammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a som=
ewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. =
He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francis=
co, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doorma=
ts Updated 11/16/01 Favre has be! en! one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks =
in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very=
 vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks =
, TE GB - Commissioner Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage =
numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fanta=
sy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the ty=
pe of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR=
 GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the =
NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's=
 a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to s=
trong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  Schedule, Breakdown  [I=
