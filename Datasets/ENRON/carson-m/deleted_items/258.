Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/13/01 According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to re=
turn from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed t=
o reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun Alexander performing so =
well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which =
one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're =
betting it will be Alexander.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated=
 11/13/01 Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a spra=
ined right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't =
go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole=
, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is al=
ready expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.  Edd=
ie Kennison , WR DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/13/01 Kennison returned to=
 the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is "unretiring," according to=
 the Denver Post . While this is a radical turnaround from his message of r=
etirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a =
result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be pl=
aced on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either =
way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the rema=
inder of the season. Drop him.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/13/01 According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for=
 Sunday's game against Indianapolis. His high ankle sprain still hasn't hea=
led sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majori=
ty of the playing time in his absence.   Santana Moss , WR NYJ - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/13/01 Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against =
Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as=
 probable for Sunday's game.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Upda=
ted 11/13/01 Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a s=
houlder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver.   Fred T=
aylor , RB JAC - Feeleys Fanatics  Updated 11/13/01 Taylor is expected to p=
lay Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month becau=
se of a groin injury.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 =
Jones re-injured his shoulder in Sunday's game. He had an MRI done on the s=
houlder Monday. His status for this week's game is uncertain.   Mark Brunel=
l , QB JAC - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/13/01 Brunell is expected to play =
this week, despite suffering from a sore leg. However, he is not expected t=
o ! pr! actice. Nevertheless, look for Brunell to be a productive No. 1 QB =
this week.   Chad Johnson , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Johnson mi=
ght play on a limited basis in Sunday's game against Tennessee. He will be =
re-evalauted on Tuesday, according to The Cincinnati Post. Johnson has been=
 sidelined for a month because of a fractured collarbone.  Terry Glenn , WR=
 NE - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Glenn should be able to play Sunday if he=
 practices with the team this week, according to The Boston Herald . He has=
 not practiced in over three weeks because of a hamstring injury. The Patri=
ots first two workouts are on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Brian Natkin , TE T=
EN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Natkin started Monday's game. He was used =
to replace the injured Shad Meier and Erron Kinney. Natkin played the entir=
e game but had only one catch for 18 yards.    Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/13/01 Wycheck left Monday's game briefly because of an a=
nkle injury but returned. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Wycheck ha=
d two catc! h! es for 18 yards Monday.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fana=
tics Updated 11/13/01 Garcia made it through another game using a brace to =
protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve=
 Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace =
soon.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Kelly suffered =
both knee and ankle injuries during Sunday's win over Dallas. He will have =
an MRI this week to determine the extent of the injury, and his status for =
this weekend's game against Green Bay is unclear at this time.   Elvis Grba=
c , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Grbac started in Monday's game des=
pite suffering from chest/rib injuries. He threw for 192 yards and a touchd=
own, but was also intercepted once. Nevertheless, Grbac appears to have ove=
rcome his injuries and should be a solid No. 1 QB this week.   Kurt Warner =
, QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/13/01 Warner admitted to STLtoday.co=
m that the thumb injury he sustained in the season opener against Philadelp=
hia is effecting his ability to throw the ball deep. The team has begun ext=
ensive treatment on the thumb, and coach Mike Martz doesn't feel as though =
his Pro Bowl QB will miss any playing time. "I don't anticipate this being =
a real problem unless he gets it banged and re-injured," Martz said. "He ha=
s played pretty well with it since Philadelphia. We should be fine."   Terr=
y Allen , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/13/01 Allen played in Monday's gam=
e against Tennessee but suffered a fractured left hand in his first and onl=
y carry of the game, during the second quarter. His status for Sunday's gam=
e is uncertain. !   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Dyso=
n played in Monday's game despite suffering from a toe injury. It appears h=
e has recovered from the injury. He had six catches for 68 yards and a touc=
hdown. Dyson should be a productive No. 2 or No. 3 wideout if he remains he=
althy.   Panthers , DT CAR - Powers Rangers Updated 11/13/01 Defensive end =
Sean Gilbert will likely miss a month of action after suffering a Grade II =
sprain in his left knee on Sunday. In other news, linebackers Dan Morgan (a=
nkle), Dean Wells (calf) and Cory Minor (knee) will likely! r! eturn to act=
ion this weekend against San Francisco.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/13/01 Weinke (shoulder), who missed Sunday's 48-14 loss to St.=
 Louis, has been cleared to practice. His status for this weekend's game ag=
ainst San Francisco is still unclear, however, but coach George Seifert exp=
ects him to play.   Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Commissioner Updated 11/13/01=
 According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's final status for Sunday's g=
ame against Green Bay won't be determined until at least Wednesday. Chandle=
r missed his last start due to a rib injury, but Reeves believes that Chand=
ler will be available for the game.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts=
 Updated 11/12/01 Davis has a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee and wi=
ll be out 10 to 12 days, Mike Shanahan said. He will undergo surgery, and i=
s not expected to play in the next two games. Mike Anderson will start in h=
is place.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/12/01! Schroede=
r may have re-aggravated his ankle injury during a TD celebration on Sunday=
. His current status is day to day.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/12/01 Bledsoe is expected to be cleared to return to practice this w=
eek, and he could be ready to play Sunday night against St. Louis.  Patriot=
s coach Bill Belichick said Monday he expects the team's doctors to give Bl=
edsoe the OK this week. But that doesn't mean he will replace Tom Brady, wh=
o is 5-2 as a starter since Bledsoe's chest injury, as the starting quarter=
back.    Kurt Warner  , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/12/01 Warner s=
ays his thumb is affecting the way he throws the ball. X-rays revealed a sp=
rained ligament, and he will be limited in practice this week.  Rob Johnson=
 , QB BUF - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/12/01 According to published reports,=
 Johnson will miss at least four weeks with a broken clavicle. Alex Van Pel=
t will start while he is out.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated=
 11/12/01 Moss felt soreness in his ankle on Sunda! y,! but he is fine and =
there is no apparent reason to expect him to miss any playing time.  Tyrone=
