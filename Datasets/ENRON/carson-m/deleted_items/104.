>WILDCATS NAME BIELEMA AS LINEBACKERS COACH
>
>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Bret Bielema, formerly the linebackers
>coach at Iowa, has been hired as the linebackers coach and
>co-defensive coordinator at Kansas State, head football coach Bill
>Snyder announced Thursday.
>        Bielema, who turns 32 on Jan. 13, was on the Hawkeyes'
>coaching staff for eight years, including the last six as the
>linebackers coach. A former Hawkeye co-captain, he lettered at four
>years for Iowa and started for two seasons as a defensive lineman.
>        "There are a lot of close ties and with the Iowa connection,
>I've been familiar with the program," said Bielema. "To come to
>Kansas State and be a co-coordinator is a great opportunity. I spent
>time there with Coach Snyder and saw everything they have in place.
>I'm excited to get in there and hit the ground running."
>        Bielema and Sean Snyder, K-State's Associate A.D. for
>football operations, were teammates at Iowa in 1988.
>        "Bret brings a wealth of talent and enthusiasm to our
>program," said Snyder. "He has proven to be a very successful
>recruiter, a players' coach and a tireless worker.
>        "It was not easy for Bret to leave the University of Iowa,
>where he has spent his entire career as a player and coach. I am
>grateful to (head coach) Kirk Ferentz, a dear friend, and the
>University of Iowa, also a dear friend, for allowing us the
>opportunity to approach Bret."
>        Bielema became a member of the Iowa staff as a volunteer
>student assistant in 1993. He worked with the Hawkeye defense and
>special teams as a graduate assistant for two seasons before moving
>into a full-time coaching position.
>        As a player, Bielema joined the Iowa football program as a
>walk-on and quickly became a factor. He was a member of Iowa's Big
>Ten championship team in 1990 and took part in the 1991 Rose Bowl.
>Bielema was a starter as a junior in 1991 when the Hawkeyes were
>10-1-1, ranked fifth in the final CNN/USA Today poll and played in
>the 1991 Holiday Bowl.
>        He was elected one of two co-captains in 1992 and finished
>his Hawkeye career with 83 tackles.
>        Bielema signed a free-agent contract with the Seattle
>Seahawks as a defensive lineman in April 1993, before completing his
>football career with the Milwaukee Mustangs of the Arena Football
>League in 1994.
>        Bielema earned his bachelor's degree in marketing from Iowa in
1992.
