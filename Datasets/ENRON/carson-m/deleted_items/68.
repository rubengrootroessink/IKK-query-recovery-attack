 Emerging Growth Stock Alert Blagman Media International: A Marketing Giant=
 in the Making=09
      Key Points about BMII:   BMII projects a total run rate of between $8=
0-100 million in 2002.  BMII currently manages an advertising and promotion=
al campaign for MET-Rx, the nation's leader in sports supplements.   Centur=
y Media, BMII's pending acquisition target, is one of the nation's largest =
direct marketing firms, with a dozen Fortune 1000 companies as clients.    =
BMII has the exclusive rights to market and advertise the national video re=
lease of a four video collector's set of the best of "The Red Skelton Show.=
"   Company Name   Blagman Media International (OTCBB: BMII) Current Price =
$0.0012 (12 hundredths of one cent) 52-Week High $0.56 52-Week Low $0.0011 =
  Company Background  Today we have a look at a classic merge and conquer s=
cenario in the $200 billion dollar Direct Response sector.  The conqueror-t=
o-be is called BMII (Blagman Media International, Inc.) The new company wil=
l combine the talents and clients of some of the biggest names in the infom=
ercial world under the Blagman name.  With its announced plans to acquire m=
ajor companies such as Century Media Inc. and Wellworld Group Ltd., BMII ha=
s quickly established a gateway for major immediate revenue stream coupled =
with rapid internal growth.  A-List clients have included the likes of Proc=
tor & Gamble, Kodak, Dainler-Chrysler, Black and Decker, Home Shopping Netw=
ork, and TriStar.  Total combined billings for BMII upon the completion of =
its acquisitions are expected to run from $80 to $100 million dollars in 20=
02.  This will give BMII the financial leverage and the know-how to change =
the face of the Direct Response industry.  Industry Stats  According to the=
 Direct Marketing Association (DMA), U.S. direct marketing expenditures , c=
urrently at $191.6 billion, are expected to continue to grow annually at 7.=
1% from 2002 until 2005.  Moreover, U.S. sales revenue due to direct market=
ing is estimated to reach more than $1.8 trillion for 2001. Through 2005, s=
uch sales are estimated to grow by 9.6% annually to reach $2.7 trillion.   =
Again- Direct Response will cause $2.7 trillion (estimated) in sales by 200=
5.  This figure goes to show the effectiveness of direct marketing as well =
as the likelihood that demand for Direct Response will continue to grow ove=
r the years.    BMII's Growth Strategy  Recognizing the opportunity for str=
ategic consolidation in the Direct Response industry, the management of Cen=
tury Media and Blagman decided to utilize BMII to facilitate the acquisitio=
n strategy.  Through its public position, BMII assumed the lead role in the=
 financing and negotiated the acquisition for a combination of stock and ca=
sh.  The company's senior management and board will consist of a combinatio=
n of senior managers from both companies.  Currently, no other direct indep=
endent competitor to BMII is in the field of Direct Response having the bre=
adth and depth of its combined enterprises.  At present, 99% of the pure pl=
ay infomercial business is privately held.  And for good reason.  The margi=
ns offered by Direct Response sales are three and four times greater than t=
raditional bricks-and-mortar retail. Profit potential that makes BMII a sto=
ck with tremendous upside.    BMII CEO Robert Blagman understands the Infom=
ercial sector.  Says Blagman,  "The primary purpose of these reverse merger=
s was to make BMII public and create a new BMII, a vehicle with which to bu=
ild a media-buying infrastructure.  BMII will streamline operations, combin=
e miscellaneous expenses, and create synergies within this larger structure=
 to increase economies of scale and lower costs-per-eyeball for their clien=
ts."  In Conclusion  Given its accomplishments and current plans, BMII appe=
ars to have great upside potential in the exciting infomercial market.  Bla=
gman Media International has demonstrated is ability to capture substantial=
 clients, as evidenced by its impressive client base.  The acquisitions of =
Century Media and Wellworld will provide BMII with an even larger client ba=
se with plenty of experience under its wing.     With an expected $80-100 m=
illion in billings for 2002 and the prospect of additional mergers, acquisi=
tions, and new ventures, BMII gives investors plenty to look at given its p=
rice of just fractions of a penny per share.=09
