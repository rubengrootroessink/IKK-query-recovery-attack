rnal Members:      [IMAGE] For OTC Journal Members There Will Be Two SuperB=
owls   This Sunday the St. Louis Rams will square off against the New Engla=
nd Patriots in the most watched television event of the year. The Superbowl=
 is the single most hyped sporting event, and hopefully this year it will b=
e a good game. Hundreds of millions of viewers world wide will have their t=
elevisions tuned in to this event.   The St. Louis Rams are favored by two =
touchdowns, and most odds makers give the Patriots no chance. The SuperBowl=
 has a well deserved reputation for being a blowout, with the outcome decid=
ed by the end of the first half. It's like the Presidential election. The m=
edia decides the outcome with only about 10% of the score being counted. Ho=
pefully this year's SuperBowl will prove as close and entertaining as the l=
ast Presidential Election. Maybe the Supreme Court will have to decide the =
winner.   SuperBowl fans know the commercials can be the most exciting part=
 of the telecast. Advertisers go all out in a creative competition as they =
have the opportunity to get their message to largest imaginable audience.  =
 Fans of the OTC Journal will have the opportunity to watch one SuperBowl t=
his weekend, and play in one next week. As we continue to remind you, our n=
ext profile will come out toward the end of next week, and we believe this =
stock will be the SuperBowl of small cap stocks for our members.   The stoc=
k will begin trading sometime between Wednesday and Friday, and check our h=
ome page frequently for an update. As soon as the stock opens for trading w=
e will hit the send button on the mail server. It will take about six hours=
 for the newsletter to deploy, and as always there can be technology delays=
 on the Internet.   However, the banner on our home page will update you au=
tomatically, and you will be able to simply click on it to read the profile=
 when the stock opens for trading. Hopefully we will be able to provide a m=
ore precise time frame in an edition early next week.     [IMAGE] Small And=
 MicroCap Stocks Avoid Wall Street Carnage This Week [IMAGE]  The latest GD=
P and Unemployment figures came out stronger than expected this week, leadi=
ng investors to believe the end of the recession is right on schedule.   Ho=
wever, this good news was overshadowed by scandal related selling early in =
the week. The Dow and Nasdaq were clobbered early in the week, slipping bel=
ow 9700 and 1900 respectively.   The thinking on Wall Street was dominated =
by the belief that the Enron accounting scandal was just the tip of the ice=
berg, and other company's financial statements would come under increased s=
crutiny.    Behemoth multi national Tyco (NYSE: TYC) was annihilated early =
in the week on fears they have been cooking the books. It was disclosed one=
 of their directors received a $20 million payment for arranging an acquisi=
tion. Many feel this was a blatant conflict of interest.   Telecommunicatio=
ns giant Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) filed bankruptcy this week. Chairman Ga=
ry Winnick has taken $600 million off the table personally in the last five=
 years. Quite a reward for failure.   Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) announ=
ced a $1.7 billion non cash charge to earnings in order to correct previous=
 accounting issues. The stock fell nearly 8% on the news.   ImClone Systems=
 (NASDAQ: IMCL) is being investigated by the SEC and the Justice Department=
. The company is accused of misleading investors on the highly touted colon=
 cancer drug Erbitux. CEO Samuel Waksal told investors on a conference call=
 that he was "stunned'' at the FDA's decision to refuse the cancer drug app=
lication for Erbitux. However a copy of the FDA's rejection letter was obta=
ined by The Cancer Letter. It suggests Waksal and his brother Harlan knew, =
or should have known, that the FDA had serious concerns about the way the c=
ompany conducted a key clinical trial. Harlan Waksal filed a Form 144 with =
the SEC on Dec. 6 to sell $52 million worth of ImClone stock.   Wall Street=
 is afraid earnings and accounting scandals will dominate financial news fo=
r some time to come. Arthur Andersen generated $50 million in accounting fe=
es from Enron last year, and companies like Enron have a lot of muscle with=
 their auditors. In order to win the business, the consulting arm comes up =
with the tax avoidance scheme and earnings enhancement method, and the audi=
ting division implements the strategy.    Like a weight lifter taking stero=
ids, large cap companies are addicted to beefing up their financial perform=
ance at any cost. And just like the weightlifter taking steroids, this perf=
ormance enhancement is not only toxic long term, it is also illegal.   In t=
he small and micro cap arena there is significant risk associated with fail=
ed corporate performance. However, these smaller companies do not have the =
fiscal muscle to make their auditors bend the rules to enhance financial pe=
rformance. You won't see many small company scandals associated with accoun=
ting irregularities. Their auditors take a much more conservative approach,=
 as the auditor is more concerned with covering his own butt than collectin=
g the reduced fees.   During this past week, while Wall Street was annihila=
ting several of its large cap favorites, Cross Media (AMEX: XMM) and Energy=
 Power (OTC BB: EYPSF) both traded up. Small stocks still remain a preferre=
d and level playing field for individual investors.    Charts Provided Cour=
