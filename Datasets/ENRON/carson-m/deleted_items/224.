 Journal Members:      [IMAGE] "Twas the night before Christmas...."    [IM=
AGE]  In December of 1822 a poem was written by a literature professor at C=
olumbia College (now University) to amuse his children.   The poem was orig=
inally entitled "A Visit From St. Nicholas". One year later it was publishe=
d anonymously in the Troy Sentinel, submitted without the author's knowledg=
e by a house guest who obtained a copy.   A New York publisher later issued=
 the poem, and was advised nearly universally by critics of the time that i=
t was a waste of paper and ink.   However, as usual the critics were wrong.=
 This unheralded verse managed to hang on, and after the author's death it =
was illustrated with drawings from Thomas Nast and became very famous.   Th=
e author was Clement Clarke Moore, and the poem began with the phrase "Twas=
 the night before Christmas...."   So much for the critics. Have a wonderfu=
l Christmas. Remember, the gifts that are around you are more precious than=
 the gifts you unwrap.     [IMAGE] Envoy Communications (NASDAQ: ECGI) Anno=
unces Year End Results- Santa in Nowhere to be Found [IMAGE]    Over the Lo=
ng Term Market Price Action Always Tells You What's Happening Even When the=
 Company Doesn't, and the Market is Rarely Wrong.  The Editors of the OTC J=
ournal  [IMAGE]  Envoy Communications held a conference call this past week=
 to discuss its fiscal year end results (end of September). Santa was nowhe=
re to be found. Based on what we learned from the call the stock has droppe=
d from the mid $4 range to just under $1 in the past year because it deserv=
ed to.   The company revealed an abdominal 4th quarter where they lost $2.2=
 million EBITDA. Although they ended the year with just over $80 million in=
 revenues (up 38%) and about $7 million in EBITDA profits (down 30%), the t=
rend towards losses is very disturbing.   We have been in a tough market en=
vironment for many companies, and Envoy has not been left out. Of the $2.2 =
million the company lost in the 4th quarter, $.5 million is attributed to s=
hutting down the Communiqu? division, and $1 million was attributed to Sage=
 Consulting, their technology division which will probably continue to lose=
 money.   The only bright spot was the performance of Watt Group, their Int=
ernational design and consulting firm. Watt is profitable and now represent=
s 50% of the company's ongoing revenue stream.   As seen in the chart, the =
recent rebound in the stock has dramatically reversed course as a result of=
 this disclosure. In our last edition on Envoy we felt the stock was destin=
ed for higher levels. In the short term, this past week's financial disclos=
ure sabotaged our prediction. Sadly, we were wrong. It's not the first time=
 and it won't be the last.   However, these financial results are a snapsho=
t of the past. We are concerned with the future. In the conference call the=
 company indicated they expected to make $8.6 million in EBITDA profits nex=
t year.   December quarterly numbers are expected to be lackluster, and the=
y are expecting improvements in the March and June quarters.   The editors =
of the OTC Journal are very disappointed that management never gave any ong=
oing public disclosure concerning their 4th quarter performance. Many compa=
nies are falling on hard times, but most of them are choosing to inform the=
 public as disappointments occur.   It is evident from the performance of t=
he stock that someone knew the company was doing so poorly. Unfortunately, =
it wasn't us.   We still believe the stock will rebound to the $2 level, al=
though it may take some time. Recent new contract wins have resulted in sur=
ges in the stock price, suggesting the market wants to believe again.   In =
the next week the stock may suffer from the final week of potential tax sel=
ling. If you see the stock down near $1 it should be bought for a January r=
ebound.   Still to come: Year end wrap ups on XMLG (big stuff happening the=
