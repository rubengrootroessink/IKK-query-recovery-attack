cs Updated 10/29/01 Garcia suffered a knee injury in Sunday's loss at Chica=
go. He is expected to play against Detroit.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/29/01 Cleeland (ankle) should be able to play in the Sai=
nts' next game. His current status is day to day.  Warrick Dunn!  , RB TB -=
 DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/29/01 According to published reports, Dunn (ham=
string) may return to practice later this week. But don't be surprised if h=
is workload may be lessened a bit after Mike Alstott's performance against =
Minnesota.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/29/01 Davis w=
as inactive for Sunday's game, although he claimed he felt healthy enough t=
o play. According to the Denver Post, there is no clear indication of when =
the Broncos will use Davis again. "He never practiced last week with the fi=
rst team," Mike Shanahan said.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
29/01 Leaf was the No. 2 QB vs. Arizona and did not play on Sunday. As of n=
ow, it is not clear who will start for the Cowboys at New York. Clint Stoer=
ner may have played well enough to get the call again next week.  Jim Mille=
r , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Miller (hip) will be further evalu=
ated on Monday. According to some published reports, he should be available=
 for Chicago's next game.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/29/=
01 Johnson injured his right foot in Sunday's game at San Diego. The injury=
 is not serious, says the Buffalo News. He also hurt his elbow and shoulder=
.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/29/01 Pittman suf=
fered a concussion in Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to=
 day.  James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/29/01 Stewart wa=
s inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at =
RB for the Lions.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28=
/01 Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the M=
innesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test M=
onday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in pra=
ctice last week. "I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there," John=
son said. "Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll kn=
ow more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I =
was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/0=
1 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after t=
he Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a l=
ittle bit right now, but I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew=
 what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.=
"   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he=
 expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Sm=
ith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith =
was walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated=
 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose =
in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game act=
ion.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 10/28/01 Kennison ru=
shed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. T=
he veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief =
period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10=
/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots=
. He did score on an eight-y! ar! d run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary c=
arry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some =
confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats =
Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver.=
 He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New=
 England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 10=
/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also ca=
rried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threa=
t against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Con=
way , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120=
 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he=
 is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally pe=
rforming up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - =
Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play a=
gainst the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches =
was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on sh=
ort TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end=
 when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Comm=
issioner Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on f=
our catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield =
to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Cent=
ers ecery week.  Peerless Price  , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Pri=
ce caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is =
still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy=
 teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/0=
1 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs an=
d no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key p=
asses and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander ,=
 RB SEA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/! 28! /01 The Dolphins held Alexander =
to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, A=
lexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The=
 Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's be=
tter defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Ju=
gg or Nuts Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Se=
attle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more=
 than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28=
/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also=
 lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally=
 productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held=
 to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up cons=
istently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right no=
w.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nin=
e passes for 109 yards and ! a ! TD against Washington. He remains a must-s=
tart Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB =
WAS - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the =
Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for goo=
d yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are ab=
le to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 B=
anks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Ri=
ght, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy rese=
rve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/28/01 Staley playe=
d Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three =
carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Rai=
ders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, =
it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, =
which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That mak=
es both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 10=
/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philad=
elphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured =
back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyr=
