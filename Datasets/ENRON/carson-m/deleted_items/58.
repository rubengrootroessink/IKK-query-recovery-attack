In case you guys didn't receive anything from the house, Pig is on April 13
this year. They must have gotten around to scheduling it late though, because
the actual dinner is at the Holiday Inn rather than the Ramada. However,
there's a block of rooms reserved at both hotels. If you tell the Ramada you
need a room reserved by the house you can get it for $68 per night, which is
almost $20 less than their normal rip-off rate... or you're more than welcome
to crash in my room and sleep next to Kalberg. (I'd go with your own room)
