Ken and I are stepping down from this challenging job.   We have served the Houston Club for over 7 years and have enjoyed the  association we have had with the alums here and with the Alumni  Association.  We have made some great friends.  It is time, we feel,  for us to move in other directions and time for new leadership and new creative  ideas for the KSU club.  We will continue to support the University as we  always have and will definitely support the new leadership of the Club.  Of  course, we will help the new leaders in any way we can.
