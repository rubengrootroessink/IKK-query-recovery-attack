Kansas State's Koehn  Named Big 12 Rookie Of The Week
Wildcats Get Fifth Rookie of the Week  Honor This Season

 
       MANHATTAN, Kan. - Kansas State freshman Laurie Koehn continues to make a  statement for Big 12 Conference Rookie of the Year honors by being named the Big  12 Conference Rookie of the Week today for the third time this  season.
       The  5-foot-8 guard from Hesston, Kan., averaged 17 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0  assists, 3.5 three-pointers and 37 minutes per game in victories over Kansas and  No. 12/13-ranked Texas Tech. The freshman shot 73.3 (11 of 15) percent from the  field, 77.8 (7 of 9) percent from three-point range and 71.4 (5 of 7) percent  from the foul line.
In a win over cross-state rival Kansas,  Koehn had 21 points, five rebounds, two assists and five three-pointers. The  20-plus point performance was the seventh of her career. She shot 60 percent  from the field, 71.4 percent from beyond three-point range and 66.7 percent from  the charity stripe.
 Against Texas Tech, Koehn had 13  points, a rebound, a steal and two three-pointers. She was perfect for the game  as she hit 5-for-5 from the field, 2-for-2 from three-point range and 1-for-1  from the free-throw line. With her two treys, Koehn moved into a tie for sixth  on the Big 12 single-season chart for three-pointers in a season (80). She is  tied with Megan Taylor of Iowa State  (2001).
       Koehn, who  has scored 20 or more points in seven games this season, is Kansas State's  leading scorer (18.1) and fourth in assists (53) and fourth in steals (28). She  is the team's top three-point shooter (44.9 percent) and is shooting 47.7  percent from the field and 84.6 percent from the free-throw line, while  averaging 3.8 three-pointers per game.
 Kansas State has  claimed five of the eight Big 12 Rookie of the Week honors this season with  freshman Kendra Wecker earning the honor twice. K-State has had 12 Big 12  Rookies of the Week honors since the inception of the league. Sophomore Nicole  Ohlde was honored three times last year en route to her Big 12 Freshman of the  Year honor. Koehn, who sat out last year with an injury, was named preseason Big  12 Freshman of the Year in 2000-2001.
    Kansas State, now 19-2 overall and 7-1 in the Big 12, looks to continue its  winning ways when it travels to Austin, Texas, to take on the Texas Longhorns on  Wednesday at 7 p.m.
