   [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  Our last Trading Alert on September 5th was Cross Media=
 Marketing at $1.30. The stock traded up to $1.65 for a 27% return five day=
s after our release, making many of our members very happy with a nice shor=
t term gain. In fact, we are convinced the stock would have continued highe=
r had the September 11th disaster not derailed the entire market.   Just li=
ke the stray cat you have fed, the OTC Journal is back for more as we had s=
uch a great meal the first time around.   Cross Media closed at $6.70 today=
, but it is really back at the $1.30 level from September 5th. The company =
completed its merger with Lifeminders on October 25th and did a 1 for 5 rev=
erse stock split. Therefore, split adjusted the stock has returned to the $=
1.30 level we had so much success with the first time around.   Breaking ne=
ws on the company just after the market closed today puts Cross Media back =
on our radar screen. The OTC Journal is bringing this breaking news to you =
first.   With the Lifeminders merger finally completed, Cross Media is now =
positioned to enlighten us about future performance. The company revealed t=
oday that it anticipates 50% organic growth in 2002, leading to revenues in=
 excess of $150 million, and EBITDA earnings of $23 million. Net earnings a=
re expected to be $15 million, or $1.15 per share post reverse split.   For=
 investors who still believe in looking at PE Ratios, the stock is therefor=
e trading at 5.8 times projected 2002 net earnings with a 50% growth rate. =
Here is an excerpt from today's news release:     Preliminary projections c=
all for the Company achieving record revenues and earnings for the year end=
ing December 31, 2002.  Revenues are projected to be in excess of $150 mill=
ion, representing a 50% increase over expected revenues for 2001.  The reve=
nue projection is based on organic growth from all operations and do not gi=
ve effect to any potential acquisitions.   Net income is expected to grow i=
n excess of 50% resulting in a minimum of $15 million of net earnings and $=
1.15 earnings per share based on a fully diluted base of approximately 13 m=
illion common shares outstanding. EBITDA (defined as earnings before intere=
st, taxes, goodwill, amortization, interest charges and non-cash operating =
expense) is projected to be in excess of $23 million compared to calendar 2=
001's projection of $16 million to $18 million.        [IMAGE] Recent Devel=
opments [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  We have interviewed management extensively about =
the state of their business, and have learned the company has benefited dra=
matically from the Attack on America.   Since the attack, consumers are sta=
ying home more. Ratings on TV shows are up, and rental activity at Blockbus=
ter is exploding. People are more prone to consume their entertainment and =
media at home. This is a mega trend that analysts expect to continue.   The=
 company describes itself as "a technology- driven cross media marketing co=
mpany integrating its sophisticated direct marketing skills with cutting-ed=
ge technologies, including interactive voice response and web-based systems=
, resulting in a multi-dimensional marketing platform for the international=
 exploitation of products and services."   Cross Media had the most success=
ful week in its history just after September 11th. Magazine subscription sa=
les, which represent 75% of the company's revenues, went through the roof. =
Consumers were demonstrating a desire to stay at home and be informed.   Wi=
th market conditions improving, investors are seeking undervalued situation=
s with real growth. Cross Media, head quartered just a few miles from the W=
all Street Financial district, is bound to end up on the radar screens of i=
nstitutional investors now that the stock has been recapitalized into the $=
6.75 range where fund managers will look at it.     [IMAGE] Trading Alert D=
etails [IMAGE]  Here are our thoughts on this Trading Alert on Cross Media =
Marketing (AMEX: XMM).   The early September move in the stock from the hig=
h $6's to nearly $9 came in conjunction with the OTC Journal's last Trading=
 Alert on the stock. According to the company, earnings for 2002 will come =
in at about $1.22 per share. At $6.75 this makes the stock ridiculously und=
ervalued. The first analyst report on the company was issued August 30th, p=
rojecting $27 (split adjusted) in 18 to 24 months. The stock is sitting dir=
ectly on its support line with volume increasing. Clearly, it is under accu=
mulation and today's news could be the required catalyst to move this stock=
 to the upside.  Buy up to $7.25 which gives you room to make money if the =
stock trades in our favor. If you can get in under $7 it would be ideal. Ve=
ry low risk entry level. Set your Stop Loss at $6.00 to give you some room =
for a short term pullback or what ever your risk tolerance is. If the stock=
 can get through $8.50 in the next few weeks should go higher it could find=
 its way to nearly $10 with a little luck and favorable market conditions. =
A move to $8.50 would be the same percentage return we provided from our la=
st Trading Alert on this stock. Because of their growth and profitability y=
ou can comfortably put this one in your long term speculative portfolio.   =
 The OTC Journal intends to publish follow-up editions on this company. Thi=
s stock has the potential to be a huge winner.   This newsletter is our opi=
nion only, and not a solicitation to buy this stock. Make up your own mind.=
 If you are looking for a short term trade limit your loss if the stock goe=
s against you. As always, we remind you before making any investment decisi=
ons please review the section on our home page on Trading Alerts.  Read our=
 section on Successful Microcap Investing , paying particular attention to =
the Trading Strategies Section. The track record on our previous alerts can=
