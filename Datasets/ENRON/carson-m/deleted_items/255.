As you all know by now, the Louisiana Tech game  tomorrow will not be televised.  However, the Missouri game, on the 24th at  11 a.m., will be televised.  There will be an unhosted watch party on that  date at the SRO in Northwest Mall on Hempstead Highway.  Plan to go and  cheer on the team with other Houston K-Staters.
 
Here's wishing you a great Thanksgiving  Holiday!  We'll be in Kansas for turkey dinner!
