, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - De=
Waynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable for Su=
nday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the ga=
me, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Allen , RB=
 CHI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen wi=
ll likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings la=
ck of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. =
  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/23/01 According to =
publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game agai=
nst Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be rep=
laced in the starting lineup by James Allen.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Char=
gers Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained =
only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most o=
f the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 The=
 Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thur=
sday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just=
 eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.    J=
ames Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for=
 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger i=
n his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ank=
le, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch, QB DET - Damons Doorm=
ats Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an=
 interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in th=
e first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he=
 couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status f=
or next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver=
, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's ga=
me at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but a=
ll his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the=
 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.    Rod =
Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches f=
or 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over=
 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receive=
r in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Ju=
gg or Nuts Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has =
missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  Olandis Gary , RB DE=
N - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on th=
e second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the sea=
son. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be abl=
e to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/0=
1 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against =
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch =
a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 The loss=
 of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output o=
ver the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every we=
ek in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rus=
h defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may eve=
n find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updat! ed! 11/21/0=
1 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has be=
en very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner Update=
d 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, S=
tewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He f=
aces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but onl=
y use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackso=
n , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at K=
ansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open =
up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver fo=
r Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/21/01 =
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield=
 in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your=
 active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Update=
d 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against t! he! Giants o=
n Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough=
 on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your =
roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Patten an=
d the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been incons=
istent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten c=
ould beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using =
him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated=
 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this seaso=
n, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the bal=
l. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.=
  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a p=
leasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a =
subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into you=
r active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Update=
d 11/21/01 Gadsden has been ve! ry! inconsistent this season, and we don't =
recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself be=
fore you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of=
 the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There i=
s a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long pass=
es on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis=
 Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a =
fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be =
worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run=
 all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez =
will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has b=
een somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  =
Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 =
yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone ! on! ce a=
gain. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no =
choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around t=
he league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker coul=
d get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary h=
as regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a =
good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent g=
ames, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday=
. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a =
deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your l=
ineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs =
will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which shoul=
d help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get =
him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week =
Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC! -! Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Green and the =
Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday again=
st Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secon=
