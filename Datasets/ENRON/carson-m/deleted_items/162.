Don't forget the watch party at the SRO,  Northwest Mall, at 11:30 a.m. this Saturday.  The Cats need our help!   We can't let those big Aggies overcome us!  
 
There will be no watch party next week for the  Kansas game.  The game will be shown only in Kansas by pay tv.  Go to Kansas and  you can see it!
 
GO CATS!
