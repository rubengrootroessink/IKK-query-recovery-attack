r Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Mike Anderson , RB DE=
N - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/11/01 Anderson carried four times for 23 yards=
 against San Diego. He won't play much now that Terrell Davis is healthy. A=
nderson was a disappointment when Davis was out as well, as he failed to ma=
tch his 2000 form.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/11/01 =
Davis rushed for 83 yards on 33 carries and caught five passes for 36 yards=
 against the Chargers. He is definitely healthy enough to start for most Fa=
ntasy! t! eams, but Davis doesn't run with the same burst that once made hi=
m an elite back.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Updated 11/11/01 Flu=
tie threw for 165 yards, one TD and was intercepted four times by Denver. R=
ight now, Flutie is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fant=
asy backup.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/11/01 Conway cau=
ght three passes for 111 yards and a TD at Denver. He continues to be a rel=
iable,a nd sometimes explosive Fantasy player.  Garrison Hearst , RB SF - W=
oltys Wonders Updated 11/11/01 Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, c=
ompiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himsel=
f as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan =
Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fanati=
cs Updated 11/11/01 Garcia, who is dealing with a sprained knee, had anothe=
r big game against New Orleans. The Niners quarterback threw for 252 yards =
and four touchdowns, further establishing himself as a top-notch Fantasy qu=
arterback. !   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/11/01 Horn had a=
 big game against San Francisco, catching six passes for 99 yards and two s=
cores. Horn now has six touchdowns in his last three games against the Nine=
rs, and is putting up some big numbers after a slow start to the season.   =
Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/11/01 Brooks had a huge game=
 on Sunday, throwing for 347 yards and two scores against San Francisco. He=
 may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numb=
ers makes it tough to bench him.  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Dans Dawgs =
Updated 11/11/01 Buckhalter rushed for 66 yards and a TD against the Viking=
s. But he will see his numbers and playing time dwindle now that Duce Stale=
y is healthy and capable of being a dependable RB again.  Duce Staley , RB =
PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/11/01 Staley rushed for 146 yards and a T=
D, and caught six passes for 85 yards against the Vikings. There should be =
little doubt about his health or current value after his stellar outing.  R=
andy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/11/01 Moss caught seven pass=
es for 95 yards and a TD at Philadelphia. He padded his numbers well after =
the outcome of the game was decided, and he still does not have a 100-yard =
receiving game this year.  Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Powers Rangers Update=
d 11/11/01 Bennett did not play at Philadelphia. Doug Chapman started in hi=
s place and finished with 19 rushing yards and 45 receiving yards.  Byron C=
hamberlain  , TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Chamberlain left Sunday'=
s game after injuring his leg. He finished with two catches for 23 yards.  =
David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/11/01 Boston had another =
huge game on Sunday, catching nine passes for 137 yards and a touchdown aga=
inst the N.Y. Giants. He's become one of the best Fantasy receivers in the =
league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI=
 - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/11/01 P! it! tman was unimpressive on Sunday=
, rushing for only 54 yards in Arizona's 17-10 loss to the N.Y. Giants. Pit=
tman is best used when the matchup is to his advantage, and not as a weekly=
 Fantasy starter.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Chargers Updated 11/11/01 Hilli=
ard had only 43 yards receiving against Arizona, but he did score a touchdo=
wn in New York's 17-10 win. The score was Hilliard's third in his last thre=
e games.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/11/01 Barber had a =
solid game against Arizona, compiling 118 yards rushing in the Giants' 17-1=
0 win. Barber hasn't been very reliable as a Fantasy player this season, bu=
t he is useful when the matchup is right.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/11/01 Wayne caught only two passes for 18 yards against the =
Dolphins. The rookie receiver is not performing well enough to start for mo=
st Fantasy teams right now.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Update=
d 11/11/01 Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions, 174 yards an=
d thr! ee! TDs. No defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays=
 in front of the home crowd.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated =
11/11/01 Chambers had the best game of his rookie year, catching three pass=
es for 113 yards and two TDs. He has certainly become a great asset to Fant=
asy teams that are thin at WR or need help because of injuries or bye weeks=
.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/11/01 The Colts' defens=
e held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 y=
ards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Sm=
ith might be fading as a Fantasy player.  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Drunk=
 Monkeys Updated 11/11/01 McCardell caught five passes for 61 yards and a T=
D against he Bengals. The veteran wideout has been unreliable for much of t=
he year, and he may follow his good performance with a quiet week.  Stacey =
Mack , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Mack rushed for 71 yards and tw=
o! T! Ds against the Bengals. He may have restored Jacksonville's faith in =
him after some questionable outings, but Mack is anything but reliable.  Co=
rey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/11/01 The Jaguars held Dill=
on to 58 rushing yards, but he did score on a seven-yard TD run. Even if op=
ponents limit Dillon's yardage numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle =
him completely. He remains worthy of No. 1 RB status on many Fantasy teams.=
  T.J. Houshmandzadeh , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Houshmandzadeh=
 was Cincinnati's leading receiver at Jacksonville, catching six passes for=
 62 yards. Don't add him to your roster until he proves he can be a consist=
ent contributor to the Bengals' passing game. Houshmandzadeh is a rookie, a=
nd he may fade away very quickly.  O.J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/11/01 Santiago caught a 12-yard TD pass against the Steelers, and fi=
nished with two catches for 14 yards. Don't pick him up unless you are desp=
erate for TE help, because Santiago has always been a Fantasy disappointmen=
t.  Kevin Johnson , WR CLE - Chargers Updated 11/11/01 Johnson caught a res=
pectable eight passes for 62 yards against Pittsburgh's tough defense. Oppo=
sing secondaries are having trouble containing the third-year wideout, and =
he remains a must-start player every week.  Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/11/01 Brown made five of six field goal attempts at Cleveland, =
including the game-winner from 32 yards. Despite his troubles in Week Eight=
, Brown has been a reliable kicker for most of his three-year career in Pit=
tsburgh.  Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Burress ca=
ught four passes for 44 yards at Cleveland. The second-year wideout has yet=
 to produce respectable Fantasy numbers on a consistent basis,  Peerless Pr=
