layer News  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Damons Doormats Updated 10/16/01 Has=
selbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Mi=
ami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. "Matt has had=
 a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he =
has to prove," Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer=
. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially =
against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free =
Agent Upda! te! d 10/16/01 Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's g=
ame against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 ag=
ainst Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "There's more to =
it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that," Seahawks He=
ad Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. "He's injured, and he won't practice th=
is week." Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don'=
t expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.  Tony Ric=
hardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermei=
l said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, ac=
cording to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury. =
 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/16/01 Wheatley had an M=
RI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his=
 right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.=
  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a walk=
ing boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the =
Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when =
the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - Jugg or Nut=
s Updated 10/16/01 The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for =
Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI M=
onday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no ti=
e to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday'=
s practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte t=
o get the start.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Johnso=
n has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a=
 neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and t=
here's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson. =
 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent s=
uccessful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson=
 has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of=
 the 2001 season.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/16=
/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets=
 despite a bruised right knee. "He really could possibly play this week," c=
oach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the possibility of him playi=
ng completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will =
be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decis=
ion on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation=
 t! hr! oughout the week.   Justin McCareins , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated =
10/16/01 McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his =
ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the an=
kle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the=
 rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards.   Eddie=
 Berlin , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver us=
ed mostly on special teams,  will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suff=
ered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sun! da! y.  D=
ennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach B=
utch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of pla=
ying time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too pr=
oductive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week.=
   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed a=
s probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bru=
ised left shoulder.  Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/0=

Rangers Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Mon=
day, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years i=
n the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the gr=
ound by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23=
 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the gam=
e, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minu=
tes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself f! it! enoug=
h to play. "I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every fe=
w hours to see if I was alive," he said, "but I'm feeling OK and I'll be re=
ady."      Redskins , DT WAS - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/16/01 Washington corne=
rback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against=
 Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently li=
sted as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16=
/01 Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to=
 Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as d=
ay-to-day.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/16/01 Accor=
ding to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Mo=
nday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split ca=
rries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy=
-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/16/01 Jureviciu=
s suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury =
is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the start=
ing lineup on Monday against Philadelphia.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg =
or Nuts Updated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman=
 that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman st=
ated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week=
, but we expect him to go.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10=
/16/01 Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 wi=
n over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should hav=
e amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game.  =
  Reggie Swinton , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suffered a =
hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game =
after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day.   Jackie Harris , T=
E DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Mo=
nday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and =
has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB D=
AL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Carter underwent successful surgery to rep=
air the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday!=
 . ! He is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure.    Ra=
ghib Ismail , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) returned t=
o action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches=
 for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise.    Tiki Barb=
er , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to=
 return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be avail=
able for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayn=
e, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming week=
s.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/16/01 Pittman s=
uffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with =
headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is st=
atus for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the =
week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB ro=
le once again.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/16/01 Moss=
 is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at=
 full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Mos=
s, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your=
 roster allows for a! s! olid replacement.   Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free A=
gent Updated 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this week=
end against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be=
 worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed=
 to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense.   Michael Bennett=
 , RB MIN - Powers Rangers Updated 10/16/01 According to the Minneapolis St=
ar-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against=
 Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walking wit!=
 h ! a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's=
