layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Bradford=
 started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minn=
esota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hi=
mself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Commissioner Updated 10/=
21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptio=
ns was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six g=
ames this year and has become a major s! co! ring threat even though he is =
not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Da=
mons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99=
 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for =
the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes i=
t tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 10/21/01=
 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. G=
reen has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a s=
tarting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21=
/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numb=
ers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been=
 so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett ca=
nnot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Powers=
 Rangers Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, postin=
g seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the b=
est receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Mi=
chael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a gr=
eat outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offens=
e and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity=
, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , =
WR SD - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on =
Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. =
He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certai=
nly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats U=
pdated 10/21/0!  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season=
 by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the d=
ay, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond =
Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday=
, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been=
 reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue t=
o start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updat=
ed 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) starte! d ! Sunday's game against San Diego, =
but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two in=
terceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. B=
ut the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does=
 not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Upda=
ted 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect t=
he veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly=
.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seve=
n passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Ter=
rell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anth=
ony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yar=
ds and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's t=
op RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year. =
 Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven =
passes for 100 yards and a TD at ! De! troit. Despite some quiet outings un=
til this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titan=
s lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted =
once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two conse=
cutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of incon=
sistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/21/01 McNair=
 threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He complet=
ed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly=
 indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie George =
, RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26=
 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has c=
ertainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a =
TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsisten=
cy, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE A=
TL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards a=
nd a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight e=
nd for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Chargers Update=
d 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It =
is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson=
 , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 r=
eceiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers agains=
t the low-qu! al! ity Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of pr=
oviding owners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa=
 Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his F=
antasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently =
score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/21/01 =
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, bu=
t he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense=
.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge g=
ame against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He=
's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good n=
umbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Ke=
yshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10=
 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field =
relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to p=
ost high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  J! er! ome Bettis , RB PIT - =
Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 ca=
rries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing p=
roves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate =
, RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game agains=
t the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His=
 role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on =
the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/21/01 ! Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches =
for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Mich=
ael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a r=
oster spot from a Fantasy perspective.   More Updates  View Transactions  [=
