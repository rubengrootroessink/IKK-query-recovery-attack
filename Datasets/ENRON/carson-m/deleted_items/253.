 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk M=
onkeys Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's gam=
e against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unc=
lear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rus=
hed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carr=
ied the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer wo=
rthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to! s! ee =
some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Upd=
ated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver=
. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is ge=
tting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - W=
oltys Wonders Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and wa=
s intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plumm=
er, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI -=
 Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittma=
n to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming we=
eks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at=
 Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always g=
ets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent =
Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught =
11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warr=
en on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good F=
antasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes De=
mons Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears=
, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn fo=
r consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be ex=
plosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demon=
s Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears,=
 but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down t=
he stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CH=
I - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tam=
pa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fanta=
sy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - Kens Killers Updated 11/18/01 Booker cau=
ght seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third sea=
son, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must st=
art every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for=
 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliab=
le Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Up! da! =
ted 11/18/01  Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, post=
ing 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in rece=
nt weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he hel=
d out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Feeleys Fanatics Up=
dated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacks=
onville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receive=
r for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Do=
ug Flutie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Upd! at! ed 11/18/01 Flutie's recent str=
uggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unl=
ess he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamb=
le.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held=
 to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a rel=
iable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB=
 OAK - Chargers Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Dieg=
o, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fan=
tasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Ric=
e , WR OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunda=
y, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Die=
go. Rice may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can ce=
rtainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony=
 Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Banks w! as! carted off the f=
ield in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He=
 was replaced by Kent Graham.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Update=
d 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but h=
e was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent =
play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-star=
t every week.  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradfor=
d caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout =
is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris C=
handler , QB ATL - Commissioner Updated 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green =
Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. He remains a g=
ood Fantasy backup when healthy.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/18/01 Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yar=
ds at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes =
a good backup! R! B right now.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/18/01 Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times b=
y the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and sh=
ould not start for most Fantasy teams.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissio=
ner Updated 11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the=
 Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who s=
hould give you some occasional TDs down the stretch.   Tim Couch , QB CLE -=
 Dans Dawgs Updated 11/18/01 Couch threw for only 144 yards and was interce=
pted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even a=
s a Fantasy backup right now.  Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/18/01 Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 1=
8 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and la=
teral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at=
 RB.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Damons Doormats Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (a=
nkle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carrie=
s in his place.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/18/01 Smi=
th rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears t=
o be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack=
 depth at RB.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 T=
he rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Cha=
mbers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.  More Upda=
