>WILDCAT WOMEN BEAT HUSKERS BEFORE RECORD-SETTING CROWD
>
>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Laurie Koehn scored 26 points to lift
>14th-ranked Kansas State to an 85-71 victory over Nebraska in a Big
>12 Conference women's basketball game Saturday played before a
>school-record crowd of 13,466 at Bramlage Coliseum.
>        The victory lifted the Wildcats to 16-1 overall and 4-0 in
>the Big 12, while the Cornhuskers fell to 11-6 and 1-3. K-State has
>won 13 straight games this season.
>        The crowd was announced as a sellout, the first for women's
>basketball in the history of Bramlage Coliseum. The previous high for
>attendance for a K-State women's game was 9,736, set on Feb. 22, 1997
>at a game against Kansas. It was also the largest crowd a Wildcat
>women's team had ever played before either home or away.
>        Kendra Wecker added 21 points and 12 rebounds for the
>Wildcats, while Nicole Ohlde finished 18 points and nine boards.
>        Katie Robinette scored 16 points on 7-for-18 shooting from
>the floor to lead four Nebraska players in double figures. K.C.
>Cowgill scored 15 points for the Huskers, all from three-point range,
>with Stephanie Jones adding 14 points and Keasha Cannon scoring 10.
>        Kansas State iced the victory by hitting 22 of 25 free throws
>in the game, including a 19-for-22 effort in the second half.
>        Kristin Rethman scored five points and Wecker added four in
>an early 9-0 run that put K-State ahead 14-5 with 13:46 left in the
>first half. Nebraska cut the lead to four once before halftime. The
>lead was six with 6:06 remaining in the half when back-to-back
>three-pointers by Koehn and Wecker pushed the Wildcats' edge to 33-21.
>        K-State led 45-32 at the break, as Koehn had 14 points and
>Wecker finished the first half with 13.
>        Nebraska used a 9-0 run early in the second half to cut the
>deficit to 49-45 with 14:19 to play. But the K-State lead was never
>less than four points the rest of the way. The 'Cats led 65-59 with
>7:16 left when Koehn buried a three-pointer and Ohlde hit two free
>throws to increase the lead to 11 with 6:21 remaining.
>        Kansas State led by at least 10 points the rest of the game.
>        Koehn's six three-pointers were the most ever by a Wildcat in
>a conference game. She hit 6 of 9 behind the arc and also went
>6-for-6 from the free-throw line. K-State got four blocked shots by
>Ohlde and five steals by Wecker in a solid floor game.
>        Nebraska held a 46-42 edge in rebounding, as all but one
>Husker who played had at least one rebound. Cannon finished with five
>assists for Nebraska.
>        Kansas State travels to Texas A&M on Jan. 16. The Wildcats'
>next home game is Jan. 23 against Kansas.
