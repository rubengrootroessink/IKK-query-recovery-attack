Why do all of you lazy f*cks fail to  follow
the directions below? What I am referring  to
is making a trade. The directions were as  follows:
 
1.) to make an add/drop (trade) transaction,  click on the "Owners" tab
on the league homepage (found up top next to Live  Chat), page down
to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast email to ALL team  members
announcing your  intentions. I will implement the trade(s) on the Tuesday  following
the Monday night game. The transaction deadline is Friday 5:00 PM for the  weekend
games. If I receive the email  timestamped before then, I will make the trade for
the upcoming weekend. IF there is a Thursday  night game, Thursday 5:00 PM
is the deadline for THE WEEKEND. At any time  after the deadline if a transaction
is submitted, it will apply to the following  weekend. Also, there will be NO limit on
the amount of transactions, feel free to  contribute as much as you wish.
 
The next jackass that submits for a  trade transaction and does NOT braodcast
it to everybody in the league will  be ignored. Gill and Farley, take note.
