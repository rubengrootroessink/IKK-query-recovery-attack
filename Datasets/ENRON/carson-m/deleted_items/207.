It seems that KSU is getting it together in basketball!  Way to go, team!

Don't forget the Bowl Watch Party on Saturday, December 29, at 4 p.m. when
KSU meets Syracuse University at the Insight.com bowl!  Plan to be there!

Let's not forget the reason for our celebration this 25th of December.  We
are all truly thankful for our faith in God, for our families and friends,
and for this wonderful country in which we live.  We pray that the year 2002
will not be so difficult for so many of our fellow Americans.  Follow the
star to a blessed Christmas holiday.

But don't forget December 29!

Go Cats!

>PASCO HAS 30 POINTS TO LEAD K-STATE TO VICTORY
>
>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Junior center Pervis Pasco had 30 points
>and 11 points to lead Kansas State to an 84-70 victory over North
>Texas in a men's college basketball game played Saturday at Bramlage
>Coliseum.
>        The win snapped a two-game losing streak by the Wildcats and
>lifted them to 5-3 overall. The Mean Green fell to 1-6 on the year
>after losing their sixth straight.
>        Pasco, who also had five blocked shots, hit 11 of 17 shots
>from the floor to lead the Wildcats. Nick Williams chipped in with 19
>points, while Larry Reid finished with 13 points, eight assists and
>seven rebounds.
>        Junior guard Chris Davis led North Texas with 28 points and
>nine rebounds, hitting 11 of 21 shots from the floor. He also had
>three three-pointers for the Mean Green, which got 10 points off the
>bench from Unjel Masters.
>        Kansas State went on an 11-1 run midway through the first
>half to take a 22-18 lead with 7:20 left. The lead grew through the
>rest of the half, and the Wildcats went to halftime with a 44-33
>halftime edge behind 15 points from Pasco.
>        K-State's advantage grew to 20 at 56-36 in the opening five
>minutes of the second half before the Mean Green started a slow
>comeback. North Texas cut the deficit under double figures to trail
>73-64 with 4:03 to play. But K-State hit 7 of its final 8 free throws
>in the final 3:50 to seal the win.
>        Pasco's previous season-high was 16 points, scored against
>Gardner-Webb. The double-double was his second of the season and his
>second straight, as he had 15 points and 10 boards at Northwestern
>last Saturday.
>        Williams also had a season-high for K-State, eclipsing the 15
>points he had scored at Northwestern.
>        K-State committed only eight turnovers in the game and
>finished with a 47 percent shooting mark from the field. North Texas
>was held to just 40 percent shooting from the floor.
