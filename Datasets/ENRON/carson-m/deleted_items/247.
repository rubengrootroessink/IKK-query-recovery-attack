 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or=
 Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Ch=
argers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Croc=
kett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to=
 play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky star=
t from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Upd=
ated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game agains=
t Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during indivi=
dual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play d=
espite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a resu=
lt.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to=
 the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a spra=
ined right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice=
 that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return b=
umps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either ba=
ck against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free A=
gent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury repor=
t on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Det=
roit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger le=
ague this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is =
worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - =
Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be =
the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, =
he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN -=
 DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy =
season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. =
He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspectiv=
e, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter ,=
 WR MIN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down so=
mewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The =
veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game a=
gainst rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Ra=
ndy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as proba=
ble for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's =
been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him ba=
sed on his potential to po! st! solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , R=
B NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy =
backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll f=
ace an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, s=
o Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Kens Killers Updated=
 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwin=
g for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, b=
ut his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especial=
ly against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - D=
amons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Fran=
cisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face =
a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10=
, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS=
 - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginn=
ing the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four g=
ames, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the=
 start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scori=
ng games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has pla=
yed well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's go=
t a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten thro=
ugh the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues. =
  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook h=
as been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes =
in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is =
vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.=
   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has bee=
n held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 ya=
rds. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however,=
 so starting him is a good move. !   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doorm=
ats Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starti=
ng him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll =
go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him=
 outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Carsons Wildcats Update=
d 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's onl=
y scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England =
secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team =
based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Po=
wers Rangers Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals t=
his season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll =
face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wor=
th starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB S=
TL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolin=
a, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a m=
ust-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New =
England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has=
 had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of =
a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, s=
tarting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to=
 do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Woltys Won! de! rs Updated 11/16/01 Huntl=
ey will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't=
 be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either =
back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against=
 St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so startin=
g him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11=
/16/01 Walls has be! en! held in check over the last three weeks, but he's =
still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success aga=
inst San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muha=
mmad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somew=
hat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He=
's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco=
, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats=
 Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in th=
e league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vuln=
erable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE =
GB - Commissioner Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbe=
rs, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy pl=
ayer. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of=
 tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB -=
 Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Schro! ed! er (ankle) is not listed on the N=
FL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's =
a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to st=
rong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent =
Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detr=
oit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has m=
uch Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge ga=
mble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will li=
kely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona.=
 He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a l=
ast resort in larger Fantasy leagues.   More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAG=
