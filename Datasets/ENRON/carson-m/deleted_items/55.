>>HOT SHOOTING CARRIES 11TH-RANKED WILDCATS TO VICTORY
>>
>>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Nicole Ohlde had team-highs of 24 points,
>>11 rebounds and eight assists to lift 11th-ranked Kansas State to a
>>76-63 victory over No. 12 Texas Tech in a Big 12 Conference women's
>>basketball game played Sunday before a sellout crowd of 13,340 at
>>Bramlage Coliseum.
>>        The victory improved the Wildcats to 19-2 overall and 7-1 in
>>the league. K-State has won all 10 home games it has played this
>>season. The Lady Raiders fell to 12-6 overall and 4-4 in the Big 12
>>and had a three-game winning streak snapped that included wins over a
>>pair of ranked teams.
>>        Kansas State, which hit 18 of 22 shots (82 percent) from the
>>floor in the second half, put four players in double figures. Kristin
>>Rethman had 15 points, including a 4-for-5 effort from three-point
>>range, while Laurie Koehn had 13 points and Megan Mahoney added 11.
>>        Jia Perkins finished with 24 points for Tech, scoring 18 in
>>the first half. She went 1-for-8 in the second half after hitting 8
>>of her 12 shots before halftime. Casey Jackson added 11 points and 10
>>rebounds for the Lady Raiders.
>>        The game was tied at 41-41 with 15:20 remaining when the
>>Wildcats grabbed the lead for good on a bucket by Ohlde, who had 17
>>points on 8-for-8 shooting from the floor in the second half.
>>        K-State led 55-51 with 8:45 to play when back-to-back layups
>>by Mahoney gave the 'Cats an eight-point lead. The Raiders were
>>within 65-59 with 4:25 left when the Wildcats made their decisive
>>run. Shalondra Booker hit a three-pointer, Mahoney added a layup and
>>Ohlde scored on a three-point play to put K-State ahead 74-59 with
>>1:34 to play.
>>        Texas Tech held a 35-32 edge on the boards, but second-half
>>shooting was the difference in the game. While the Wildcats were hot
>>from the field after halftime, Tech managed just 27 percent shooting
>>from the floor, hitting just 9 of 34 shots.
>>        Rethman finished with five assists for Kansas State, while
>>Candi White had six and Perkins added five assists and five steals.
>>        Kansas State travels to 13th-ranked Texas on Wednesday before
>>returning home on Saturday, Feb. 2 to play No. 14 Iowa State. The
>>game against the Cyclones is also a sellout.
