MAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated=
 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throw=
ing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and =
is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's mat=
chup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanat=
ics Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a fa=
mily illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Clevel=
and, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updat=
ed 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chi=
cago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy se=
ason.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) =
is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to s=
tart at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR C=
AR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this =
week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in =
his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Chargers Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn =
Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunda=
y against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing t=
ime will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/=
29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injur=
y. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Pac=
kers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last =
week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep in=
to the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01=
 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquir=
ing Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterba=
ck, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move w=
ould certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely b=
e made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monk=
eys Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's =
game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insu=
rance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.=
   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is=
 day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile A=
lstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Mic=
hael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's stat=
us is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Ma=
rTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his se=
cond consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would =
replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Ag=
ent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He =
is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated =
12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie Da=
vid Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he i=
s healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red =
zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has=
 been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injur=
y may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Up=
dated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expe=
cted to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will b=
e less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonders Up=
dated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still =
expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Horn =
suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to=
 start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea =
(shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue =
to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BA=
L - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to practice and =
is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week =
17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may mi=
ss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third=
 downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash , =
WR PHI - Powers Rangers Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practic=
e on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - =
Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a kne=
e injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL=
 - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will cont=
inue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas w=
ill continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free =
Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is ex=
pected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 1=
2/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this=
 week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a f=
ew snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full stre=
ngth" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to =
start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's prac=
tice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when pl=
ayers work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the=
 regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snap=
s than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in th=
e closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Upda=
ted 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice =
field Thursday for the first time in a month. "Still questionable," coach B=
ill Cowher said. "He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go=
 from there. We'll take it day to day."   Doug Brien , K TB - Free Agent Up=
dated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tam=
pa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica c=
an't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 =
victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out fo=
r Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have =
a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.   More Updates  Sche=
