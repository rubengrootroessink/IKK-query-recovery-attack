The Marketocracy Dream Team
What if you could tell what the world's best investors were doing
every day?  The ability to buy what the best investors are buying,
and sell what they are selling, would be a dream come true. For
over a year, Marketocracy has been operating a web site - the forum
for an incredibly effective and proven trading and performance
tracking tool - designed to accurately measure the investment
ability of thousands of people, in order to identify the world's
most successful investors.  Currently, we follow and maintain
over 50,000 track records - more than 10 times the number of equity
funds tracked by Morningstar.  Never before has the investment
performance of so many been so accurately measured.  Want to benefit
from their stock picking abilities?

See For Yourself - m100 Journal Free Trial
We want to give you access to the ultimate investment tool: our
m100 Journal. The m100 Journal provides timely knowledge every
week of what many of the world's best investors are doing right
now - not last quarter, or 6 months ago - including the top buys,
sells, holdings, tips, and commentary of the m100 Index.  If you
want to look over the shoulders and benefit from some of the best,
simply hit "reply" to this email, and we will send you 4 free
issues of the m100 Journal, delivered to you weekly via an emailed
PDF attachment.
