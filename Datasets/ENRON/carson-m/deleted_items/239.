s as planned, we will be introducing you to a virtually unknown company whi=
ch is making the transition to the big leagues through a major fundamental =
development. Members of the OTC Journal will be the first to learn of this,=
 giving you the competitive investing edge. Hopefully, we will start the Ne=
w Year out with a short term money maker.     [IMAGE] Free Wall Street Jour=

d Update on XML Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG) [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  XML Gl=
obal's year was a microcosm of the B to B sector on the NASDAQ, which was p=
ounded into oblivion. In the late 90's Wall Street's enormous appetite for =
technology IPOs created an excess supply of technology in this sector, most=
 of which becomes obsolete sooner than companies can get it to customers.  =
 The shrinking economy forced a significant contraction of IT budgets at la=
rge corporations, and the market for XML Global's products vaporized tempor=
arily. XML is a new universal computer language which allows large systems =
to communicate directly with each other. Analysts have long recognized this=
 new language will eventually dominate the B to B space. Most importantly- =
the implementation of this language saves companies money over the long run=
, making its adoption inevitable.   However, after having survived a challe=
nging environment, business seems to be turning the corner at XML Global. T=
his small company has garnered an unusual amount of high profile publicity =
on its products. The December 24th edition of Business Week carried a featu=
re on the company's stolen property tracking software, Xtract. Click Here  =
to read the article. If you have a copy of the magazine, the article can be=
 found on page 75.   The stock dropped all the way from $1 to just under $.=
20, but has since come off the canvas and tripled. Expect the company to co=
ntinue to announce more positive fundamental developments in the first quar=
ter of 2002 as the long awaited XML revolution finally begins to take hold.=

up provides outsourced coding services for hospitals. Their business evolve=
d out of the medicare related fraudulent practices of health care providers=
 in the late 1980's and early 1990's.   We have always liked this company a=
s they have been consistently profitable and nearly doubled in size every y=
ear for the past three years.   The company embarked on an aggressive expan=
sion plan in the first quarter, gearing up staff to handle a significant in=
crease in business from a large, Houston based hospital chain.   Towards th=
e end of the summer the expansion was derailed by serious flooding in the H=
ouston area, which led to the closing of several hospitals. Shortly thereaf=
ter the September 11th Attack on America also slowed new contract roll outs=
.   New business is back on track, and the company should report a relative=
ly strong fourth quarter. Business should accelerate next year, and the com=
pany should easily exceed the $10 million revenue mark in 2002. Overstaffin=
g for delayed contract roll outs hurt their performance in 2001, but the de=
lays are now in the past.   This company has a unique market niche. There i=
s no other company which specializes in outsourced coding for hospitals. In=
 our opinion, this company is a good candidate for a merger or acquisition =
of some kind in 2002, which could put the stock on the map.   Charts Provid=
