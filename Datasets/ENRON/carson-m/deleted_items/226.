SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kan=
sas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike R=
iley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his p=
lace and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers ar=
e already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of=
 a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith  , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/0=
1 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has=
 been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to F=
antasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01=
 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He pla=
yed well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a =
solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Ga=
rcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. =
He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padd=

d in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the=
 third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde G=

must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith=
 , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done=
 much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy=
 playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may =
step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muh=
sin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy team=
s much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Up=
dated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He =
lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good opt=
ion if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats =
Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during t=
he playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon=
 , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy =
QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never=

tarted off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideout=
s. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR=
 KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fanta=
sy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL se=
ason.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Westb=
rook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a go=
od No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner  , WR WAS - Carsons Wil=
dcats Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unle=
ss you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony R=
ichardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a co=
nsistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoff=
s.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't pl=
ayed as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench duri=

/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help=
 lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updat=
