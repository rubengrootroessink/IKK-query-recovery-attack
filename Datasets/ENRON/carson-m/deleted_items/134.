ews  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is prob=
able with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Phil=
adelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to =
get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starti=
ng job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR =
- Woltys Wonders Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said M=
onday that Huntley will enter Wee! k ! Seven as the team's starting tailbac=
k. "He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Sei=
fert. "Here's a golden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in y=
our league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Ca=
rolina starting RB job.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Kens Killers Updated 10/2=
2/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsbur=
gh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could k=
eep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progre=
ss during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.  Keysh=
awn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sideline=
d for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right =
hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice ! th! is week and could m=
iss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress=
 this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.   Warrick Dunn , RB T=
B - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstri=
ng during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situ=
ation we're going to be in," Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the St. Peters=
burg Times. "Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So =
I don't know who it'll be carrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker,=
 is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running =
backs in Week Seven.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 10/22/0=
1 Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Mi=
nnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he shou=
ld have time to recover. "It'll be OK," Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Se=
ntinel. "Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help."  J=
ames Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunda=
y's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankl=
e. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his a=
bsence.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Despite a gr=
eat performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the Chicago Tribune re=
ports that the Bears will continue to use an alternating syste! m ! with hi=
m and James Allen. "We will continue to use them both," said offensive coor=
dinator John Shoop. "Anthony did a great job today, though." As long as thi=
s duo continues to split carries, it's hard to recommend either as a weekly=
 starter in a Fantasy league. We believe Thomas is the better long-term pic=
k, though.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Hoover left=
 Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not believed to =
be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some carries now that =
starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season.   Fred Baxter , TE CHI=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday ag=
ainst Cincinnati, and had a one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the =
solid performance, he's still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy le=
ague.  Robert Wilson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Wilson suffered =
a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard reception. He is a=
lso recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be evaluated on a daily bas=
is.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Cleeland suffe=
red a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered to be serious.=
 He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception. Cleeland will =
be evaluated on a daily basis.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Update=
d! 1! 0/22/01 Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcu=
s Robinson in Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson own=
er, consider adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions =
for 91 yards on Sunday.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01=
 According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with R=
ackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.  Fre=
ddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/22/01 Jones sprained his a=
nkle against Denver. His current! s! tatus is day to day.  Darnay Scott , W=
R CIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Scott suffered bruised ribs agains=
t the Bears. He is not expected to miss next week's game against Detroit.  =
J.R. Redmond , RB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return =
from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't se=
e enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Pow=
ers Rangers Updated 10/22/01 Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His =
status for next week;s game is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if=
 Grbac can't play.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/22/01 Alle=
n is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the Baltimore Sun,=
 the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating Allen's status as a =
starter is anything but firm.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated =
10/22/01 Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be ev=
aluated on a daily basis. !  Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated =
10/22/01 Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday =
and also burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full st=
rength, but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from thei=
r bye on November 4.    Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 1=
0/22/01 Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in th=
e Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again un=
til November 4.   Isaac Bruce , WR ST! L ! - Powers Rangers Updated 10/22/0=
1 Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't necess=
arily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball successfully =
so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for Bruce to do bette=
r next week against the Saints.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Carsons Wildca=
ts Updated 10/22/01 Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that C=
rowell tore the patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of t=
he season. Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end =
zone in the second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination =
of Larry Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.  Marcus=
 Robinson  , WR CHI - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Robinson suffered a =
torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left =
knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of =
the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left i=
n the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will be the primary receive=
r in his absence.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Ri=
chardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-lin=
e packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will =
probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly e=
merged as a featured back.  Ricky Williams , RB NO - Kens Killers Updated 1=
0/22/01 Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards=
 on 21 carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards=
 in the second half. "We couldn't do anything in the second half," Williams=
 said. "We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes an=
d made plays." Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against t=
he Rams this Sunday.    Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/=
01 Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 a=
nd 39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him =
to be an adequate starter for the rest of th! e ! season.   Tim Biakabutuka=
 , RB CAR - Commissioner Updated 10/22/01 Biakabutuka broke his foot in the=
 fourth quarter of Sunday's game after rushing for 121 yards and a touchdow=
n. He is to have surgery Monday and is out for the season.    Corey Bradfor=
d , WR GB - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the =
injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four pass=
es for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player=
