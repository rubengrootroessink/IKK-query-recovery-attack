, Player Updates  [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , W=
R SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but ma=
y bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers shoul=
d be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jug=
g or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an=
 adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but y=
ou still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to s=
truggle against! a! decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still g=
ive you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , =
WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 1=
1. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stew=
art , QB PIT - Commissioner Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing ga=
me has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to m=
erit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday=
, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a start=
er in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 =
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use th=
eir passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and=
 Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - =
Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/21/01Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty =
of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunda=
y. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner =
, RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up g=
ood stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from a=
n injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't hav=
e another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildc=
ats Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Su=
nday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable mat=
chup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, =
and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown =
, WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable rece=
iver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady=
 has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown agains=
t a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updat=
ed 11/21/01Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this s=
eason. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we r=
ecommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden ,=
 WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent =
this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills=
. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your acti=
ve lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills dow=
nfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in =
very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The=
 Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the de=
fense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have=
 been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs =
Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against th=
e Seahawks. While he has ! be! en somewhat of a disappointment, you need to=
 keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated=
 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held =
out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Wee=
k 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of r=
unning back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as=
 the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout=
 options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richards=
on , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-=
line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score agai=
nst the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative =
ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might =
be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Up=
dated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off bala=
nce on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this w=
eek. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles=
 against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated=
 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but sho=
uld rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against=
 this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mista=
ke-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander  , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/=
21/01 According to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the start=
ing lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior t=
o suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble.   Kyl=
e Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful =
Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week ag=
ainst the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slum=
p.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats ! Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has =
been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holdi=
ng onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sun=
day, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardel=
l , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane=
 Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the pos=
sibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start=
. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you s=
houldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Wo=
ltys Wonders Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his sec=
ond straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in =
your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talent=
ed enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Jo=
seph , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could b=
reak off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. H=
owever, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other option=
s at running ba! ck!   Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21=
/01 Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance=
 Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight =
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, y=
ou should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence =
Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start i=
n place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wil=
kins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a s=
o-so Niners secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other o=
ptions at wide receiver.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 1=
1/21/01 Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of oppone=
nt. However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plumm=
er downfield for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Dans Daw=
gs Updated 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, an=
d you should definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James=
-like stats, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clar=
k , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes=
 thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key =
member of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowb=
oys will likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to sta=
rt one it should definitely be Clark.  More Updates   NFL Reports, Transact=
