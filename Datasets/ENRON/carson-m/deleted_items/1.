OTC Investor News has heard reports that Synergetics Tecnologies may be acquiring a bulletin board listing very soon.

Synergetic Technologies, Inc. announced in a press release on Monday February 4th that the company will begin beta testing of its airline security and anti-terrorism system. OTC Investor News has also heard a rumor that the company may be heading into a bulletin board entity in a very short timeframe. Share volume for the past six weeks is reflective of increased business activity and momentum as the stock has gained in price over the past two weeks and the potential for share appreciation seems quite positive.

OTC Investor News believes that immediate near term share appreciation will take place - Here's why:

* OTC Investment News has learned that strong support is coming in from European investors.

* SYGE has recently announced contract negotiations for substantial anti-terrorist system sales - we believe that many more contracts are on their way.

* SYGE recently announced the acquisition of Custom Broadband - completing the technical infrastructure required to deploy the anti-terror system in aircraft.

* OTC Investment News  Believes that a bulletin board listing is imminent. Typically, listing on the BB will enhance the share value.

* SYGE is near the low end of the price spectrum and is seeing record trading volume at this time. OTC Investment News  believes that there will not be a more opportune time to accumulate a position in this company.
