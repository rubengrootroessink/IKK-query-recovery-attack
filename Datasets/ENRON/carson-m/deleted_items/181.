layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According =
to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Wat=
ters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which coul=
d be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"=
 Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into th=
e lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has co=
me in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll =
play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash =
both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back=
 from Alexander down the stret! ch!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injur=
y. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on =
any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for S=
unday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He=
 replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined wit=
h a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck f! ro!=
 m a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR N=
YJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as quest=
ionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday =
to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Ra=
ms.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday'=
s practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Se=
attle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lama=
r Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Mo=
nday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle=
, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys =
Wonders Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Mi=
nnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapo=
lis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the C=
olts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-c=
ut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/=
01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to=
 a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND=
 - Commissioner Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's gam=
e at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fa=
ntasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/2=
3/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his come=
back game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided =
whether they will act! iv! ate him. He will work in practice this week and =
the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't reco=
mmend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's=
 Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn =
, RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg =
Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Du=
nn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to pl=
ay on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics U=
pdated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but h=
e didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, =
and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 3=
4 yar! ds! on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to dep=
end on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him=
 if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Kens=
 Killers Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game bu=
t is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf in=
jury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , =
WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is recovering from a thumb inju=
ry but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is exp=
ected to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Up=
dated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expec=
ted to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics=
 Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a pl=
ay in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  =
 Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean repor=
ts that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is exp=
ected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an =
injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Dr=
ew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI =
on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Ta=
ylor , RB JAC - Feeleys ! Fa! natics Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled=
 out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game=
 remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase h=
is exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Flo=
rida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Pr=
ogress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make som=
e kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has bee=
n inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcu=
tt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game beca=
use of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to actio=
n next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did no=
t play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is opt=
imistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inacti=
ve for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB =
BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of S=
unday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. J=
ason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grba=
c , QB BAL - Powers R! an! gers Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expect=
s Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarter=
back wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest =
area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the carti=
lage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wa=
it and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.=
     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffe=
red a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. Howev=
er, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orle=
ans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 According=
 to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of =
Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshal=
l to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 perce=
nt before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's =
not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement=
 last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspe=
ctive again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/0=
1 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is clo=
se to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It =
was a blessing for me because I w! as! able to get treatment every day," St=
okes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say =
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, ho=
wever, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be=
 more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Chargers Updated 10/23/01 Hilliar=
d continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting l=
ineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night=
 against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is=
 almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/=
01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to =
a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB =
STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, =
Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just taki=
ng the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not expec=
t Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent befo=
re I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate would =
once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    More Updates  =
