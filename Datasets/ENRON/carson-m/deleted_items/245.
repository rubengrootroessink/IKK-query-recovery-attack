Dear Body Shop Members,
"Healthy Habits for the Holidays" October 22nd - December 14th

Week Four - Healthy Habit Tip
Stress Management:   Family members who traditionally oversee a household's holiday plans are particularly at risk for holiday depression since they frequently feel responsible for a family's good time!  Here's a few coping suggestions to help keep everything in perspective:
Relax!
Keep it simple.
Be realistic.
Ask for help.
Holiday food, gifts and decorations don't have to be elaborate.
Enjoy each other's company.
Remember the reason for the season!
If you're not the host, offer to help, bring food, baby-sit or clean up!
Weight Management:  Pumpkin is a remarkable healthy ingredient!  
High in fiber.
Provides 3.5 times the RDA of vitamin A
Pureed pumpkin (like applesauce and prune puree) can replace fats in baked goods without giving them a rubbery texture. 

Members who workout a minimum of (3) times each week between October 22nd and December 14th will be entered in the weekly drawing for massages, apparel, and more.  (Weekly participation based on members Enron ID badge check-ins at the Body Shop Front Desk).
Due to next week's shorter work week - members who workout a minimum of (1) time that week will be entered in the weekly drawing.
Congrats to:  Daniel Ayers-Winner of Week Three Massage & Karen Herrmann - Winner of Week Three Enron Travel Bag
